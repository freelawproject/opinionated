The seeds of the present controversy were sown in January 1975 when plaintiffs William Phillips and Merle Led-better and the predecessor of plaintiff Howard Jones became the three union trustees of the funds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, their management counterparts were Martin Bessell, Charles Baker, and defendant Eugene Bowen. By mid-1976, however, Bessell and Baker had been replaced by defendants Monroe Phagan and Leo Beck. Both Pha-gan and Beck were members of the Steel and Ornamental Erectors Association of South Florida (\u201cSOEA\u201d), which served as the collective bargaining representative of management. The president of SOEA, and the person who appointed Phagan and Beck, was Eugene Bowen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">Upon assuming their tenure as union trustees of the annuity fund, plaintiffs Phillips and Ledbetter and the predecessor of plaintiff Jones (hereinafter \u201cthe union trustees\u201d) began investigating large losses that the fund had sustained in recent years. They eventually concluded that the losses were at least in part the result of improprieties by the \u201cformer trustees\u201d of the fund, <em>i. </em>e., the three union trustees whom they had succeeded and management trustees Bessell, Baker, and Bowen; that these persons were individually liable for the fund\u2019s losses; and that suit should be brought against them and other culpable parties to recover the losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">At a meeting of the board of trustees of the fund on or about October 28, 1976, the union trustees formally moved that such a suit be filed. The management trustees, however, apparently including Bowen, voted to block the suit or at least to table the motion. At the next meeting of the board on November 22, 1976, consensus obtained that the vote of the previous meeting deadlocked the motion, and the trustees proceeded to select an arbitrator and to submit the issue to arbitration pursuant to the Agreement and Declaration of Trust governing the fund. The cost of the arbitration exceeded $35,000 and plaintiffs contend that defendants were advised that the cost of arbitrating whether to file the suit or not would probably exceed the cost of the suit itself. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants Phagan and Beck made no independent investigation regarding the merits of the suit before deciding to block it and even refused to look at evidence offered to them by labor-appointed co-counsel for the fund, Marvin Kurzban. Phagan and Beck, however, maintain that they asked Kurzban to present the evidence to them in an open meeting (i. e., in Bowen\u2019s presence) but that he insisted on their coming to his office to see it, which they refused to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">After extensive proceedings, the arbitrator, Jason Berkman, concluded that the board should indeed file suit against the former trustees and another individual with whom those trustees had dealt, and in his decision delivered on August 27, 1977, he directed the board to bring such an action. At a board meeting convened on September 2,1977, the union trustees moved that a suit be filed against the persons designated by the arbitrator for \u201cfraud, conspiracy, negligence, nonfeasance, malfeasance, misfeasance, breach of fiduciary duty and/or malpractice.\u201d The management trustees, however, refused to approve such a suit, in part, they assert, because they did not think charges of fraud or conspiracy were authorized by the arbitrator\u2019s decision. Thereupon co-counsel Kurzban, over the objection of co-counsel representing the management trustees, wrote to the arbitrator requesting clarification of his decision. The arbitrator responded that his opinion did \u201cnot limit the type of action to be filed by the present Board of Trustees\u201d and that the proper scope of the suit should be left to the trial court. The management trustees still refused to permit a suit against the former trustees that alleged any willful misconduct, even though, according to plaintiffs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>they were advised that inclusion of such a charge would not materially affect the cost of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">As a result, the union trustees and Local No. 272 itself commenced the present action against the management trustees, requesting (1) enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s decision to file suit against the former trustees, (2) removal of Bowen, Phagan, and Beck as trustees of the three fringe benefit funds because of various breaches of fiduciary duties, (3) assessment of compensatory and punitive damages against the three management trustees for the breaches of fiduciary duties that precipitated the costly arbitration proceedings, and (4) recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for the present litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">The district court found, first, that the \u201carbitrator\u2019s decision was not restricted in the type or form of suit to be brought (including allegations amounting to \u2018willful misconduct\u2019)\u201d but rather left the proper scope of the suit to be determined by the judge who tried the case. On the basis of this finding, the court ordered the trustees to file suit against the former trustees within 30 days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court also removed Bowen as a trustee of the three fringe benefit funds \u201cuntil all proceedings relating to said suit are completed,\u201d but the court made clear that it did so only \u201cto avoid the appearance of impropriety and the foresee-ably and unforeseeably deleterious harm which may flow therefrom\u201d and not because of any misconduct on Bowen\u2019s part. The court declined to remove Phagan and Beck, however, because it did not find that they had \u201cbreached their fiduciary duties in deadlocking the board and in refusing to include \u2018willful misconduct\u2019 in the proposed suit.\u201d The court also denied damages for tile cost of the arbitration on the ground that the management trustees had not \u201cacted in bad faith in deadlocking the board.\u201d Finally, the court summarily denied plaintiffs\u2019 claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">Plaintiffs have appealed both the court\u2019s finding that defendants are not liable for the cost of arbitration and its refusal to award attorneys\u2019 fees. Defendant Bowen has filed a cross appeal challenging the jurisdiction of the district court, his removal as a trustee of the fringe benefit funds, and the enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-10\">Although we do not necessarily disagree with any of the actions of the district court recounted above, we must nevertheless remand the case to it because of our inability to discern from the court\u2019s opinion the factual or legal basis upon which it predicated some of those actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-11\">\n<em>I. Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-12\">The district court found jurisdiction under section 302(e) of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(e), and sections 404 and 406(b)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104, 1106(b)(2). Cross-appellant Bowen, however, challenges both assertions of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-13\">Insofar as Bowen objects to jurisdiction under section 302(e) to remove trustees of a jointly administered trust fund or to assess damages against them for breaches of fiduciary duties, his objection is well taken. Section 302(e) confers jurisdiction on district courts \u201cto restrain violations of this section.\u201d Even if breaches of fiduciary duties per se constitute violations of section 302,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we held in <em>Snider v. All State Admin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number><em>istrators, Inc., </em>481 F.2d 387, 390 (5th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 957, 94 S.Ct. 1484, 39 L.Ed.2d 571 (1974), that jurisdiction under section 302(e) \u201cis limited to restraining future violations of the statute and does not include granting relief by way of . removal of defalcating trustees or administrators.\u201d In <em>Mobile Mechanical Contractors Association v. Carlough, </em>566 F.2d 1213, 1218-19 (5th Cir. 1977), moreover, we reiterated that section 302(e) jurisdiction is limited to remedies for future violations, and we specifically held that it does not comprehend claims for damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">Without doubt, however, the district court had jurisdiction under ERISA to consider pleas for both removal and damages based on claims of fiduciary misconduct. There is no dispute that the annuity fund is an \u201cemployee benefit plan\u201d under ERISA section 3(1), (3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1), (3); and therefore, by virtue of sections 4 and 401, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1003, 1101, is subject to ERI-SA\u2019s fiduciary responsibility provisions, sections 401-414, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1114. Among the provisions prescribing conduct for ERISA fiduciaries are the two cited by the court below. Remedies for fiduciary misconduct are set forth in section 409(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-6\">Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter [ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 2-514, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1144] shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary, and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of such fiduciary. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1339-14\">Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages from, and removal of, trustees who have allegedly breached their fiduciary duties arises under section 409(a). Section 502(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a), then provides that \u201c[a] civil action may be brought \u2014 . . . (2) by the Secretary [of Labor], or by a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section [409, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7] 1109.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And section 502(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e), ordains that federal district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of such actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-16\">The same sections of ERISA also conferred jurisdiction on the lower court to enforce the arbitrator\u2019s decree. Among the duties that ERISA imposes on fiduciaries is the imperative of section 404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D), to act \u201cin accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter.\u201d The Agreement and Declaration of Trust governing the annuity fund, which provides for the appointment of an arbitrator in the event of a deadlock among the trustees, requires the trustees to be bound by the decision of the arbitrator.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>trustees refused to comply with the arbitrator\u2019s decree alleged a breach of section 404(a)(1)(D), and since, under section 409, <em>supra, </em>a fiduciary who violates such a mandate \u201cshall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate,\u201d the court had jurisdiction under section 502(a), (e) to order the trustees to comply with the arbitrator\u2019s decree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\"><em>II. Trustees\u2019 Liability for Damages </em>Plaintiffs appeal the district court\u2019s finding that the management trustees are not liable for damages on the ground that the court applied an incorrect legal standard in appraising the trustees\u2019 behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">The fiduciary provisions of ERISA that govern at least most of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are \u2014 in addition to section 404(a)(1)(D), <em>supra </em>\u2014section 404(a)(1)(A), (B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(A), (B):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-7\">(a)(1) Subject to sections [403(c), (d), 4042, and 4044, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7] 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-8\">(A) for the exclusive purpose of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-9\">(i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-10\">(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-11\">(B) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1340-16\">and section 406(b)(2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106(b)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajs-dedup-0\">(b) A fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-17\">(2) in his individual or in any other capacity act in any transaction involving the plan on behalf of a party (or represent a party) whose interests are adverse to the interests of the plan or the interests of its participants or beneficiaries .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1340-18\">Sections 404(a)(1)(A) and 406(b)(2), among others, thus impose duties of loyalty on fiduciaries, while section 404(a)(1)(B) imposes a duty of care.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-19\">The court assessed no damages for the cost of the arbitration proceeding because it found insufficient evidence that the management trustees had \u201cacted in bad faith in deadlocking the board.\u201d Plaintiffs contend, correctly, that \u201cbad faith\u201d is not the appropriate standard under ERISA. The court, however, asserted jurisdiction under sections 404 and 406(b)(2), the relevant fiduciary standards under ERISA, and, in deciding the issue of the trustees\u2019 removal, it found that Phagan and Beck had not \u201cbreached their fiduciary duties\u201d and that Bowen had not engaged in \u201cany miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>duct.\u201d If these latter findings were made in light of the ERISA standards, they would support the court\u2019s decision not to award damages even though that decision itself was reached via a bad faith standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">We cannot clearly discern, however, whether in finding no breaches of fiduciary duty or misconduct the court applied the standards of section 404 and 406(b)(2), upon which it based jurisdiction, or the standard of bad faith, which it invoked in deciding the damage issue. The court gave no explication of its use of the terms \u201cbad faith,\u201d \u201cfiduciary duty,\u201d and \u201cmisconduct,\u201d and it gave no explanation for any of the conclusions it reached in which it used these terms. Because of our uncertainty regarding the grounds for its decision,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we must remand the case for the district court to redetermine the issue of the trustees\u2019 liability for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">Also unclear from the court\u2019s opinion is whether it found as a fact that Bowen actively participated in the decision whether to sue the former trustees, who included Bowen himself, and indeed voted to block the suit. Although the record strongly suggests that he did so, the court specifically found only that the management trustees deadlocked the board. Since only two votes are required to deadlock the board, this finding does not necessarily imply that Bowen voted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">If Bowen in fact did vote not to sue himself or did actively participate in the decisionmaking process, we would hold as a matter of law that he violated both sections 404(a)(1) and 406(b)(2). Section 404(a)(1) and subsection (A) require a fiduciary to act \u201csolely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries\u201d of a plan and \u201cfor the exclusive purpose\u201d of providing them benefits at a reasonable cost. We do not believe that one who, in his capacity as a trustee, attempts to prevent a trust from suing him for substantial damages can reasonably be said to do so \u201csolely in the interest\u201d of or \u201cfor the exclusive purpose\u201d of benefitting others. Section 406(b)(2), moreover, forbids a fiduciary to \u201cact in any transaction involving the plan on behalf of a party . whose interests are adverse to the interest of the plan.\u201d Since we regard \u201c[acting] on behalf of a party\u201d to encompass acting on behalf of oneself<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and since we consider a desire not to be sued by a plan to be an interest \u201cadverse\u201d to that of the plan, we would hold that active participation in a decision whether to bring suit against oneself that is directed toward thwarting such a suit constitutes a violation of the statute. On remand, therefore, the court should address itself to the factual issue of the extent of Bowen\u2019s participation in the board\u2019s decisionmaking process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>\n<em>III. Removal of Trustees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">The court declined to remove Phagan and Beck because it found that they had not breached their fiduciary duties, but it did remove Bowen \u201cto avoid the appearance of impropriety.\u201d Since the judgment below, Phagan and Beck have resigned as trustees, and thus plaintiffs have not appealed the court\u2019s decision not to remove them. Bowen, however, appeals his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">Plaintiffs argue that Bowen\u2019s appeal is moot. Since his removal, the collective bargaining agreement between Local 272 and SOEA, the employer association of which Bowen was president, has expired, and the union has signed a new agreement with a different employer association \u2014 the Coastal Ironworkers Subcontractors Association (\u201cCISA\u201d) \u2014 of which Bowen is not a member. Under the terms of the agreement, CISA appoints the management trustees of the union fringe benefit funds, and under the bylaws of CISA an employer must be a member of CISA to be eligible for appointment. Plaintiffs argue that, since Bowen is ineligible to be a trustee, he cannot be reinstated as one, and therefore his appeal of his removal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">We agree that, under present circumstances, Bowen could not be reinstated as a trustee, but we do not consider his appeal to be moot. Under the terms of the district court\u2019s order, Bowen is barred from serving as a trustee of the union funds until the suit against him and the other former trustees has been completely resolved. Given the current congestion of court dockets and the typical tenacity of litigators, we would not want to predict that that controversy will soon be resolved.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Bowen, moreover, can apparently join CISA at any time and thus become eligible for appointment as a trustee when a vacancy on the board arises. We must conclude, therefore, that the issue of whether Bowen should continue to be subject to the legal disability imposed on him by the court is not one \u201cthat cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before\u201d us, <em>North Carolina v. Rice, </em>404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S.Ct. 402, 404, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971), or in which \u201cthe parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome,\u201d <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 496, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 1951, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969). <em>Cf. Si-bron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 51-58, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1896-1900, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968) (challenge to criminal conviction not moot even though sentence has expired because conviction itself may entail collateral legal consequences); <em>Connell v. Shoemaker, </em>555 F.2d 483 (5th Cir. 1977) (propriety of Army\u2019s blacklisting, without a hearing, of plaintiff\u2019s rental property on grounds of racial discrimination not moot even though Army has removed the sanction because imputation of bigotry may hurt plaintiff\u2019s business and reputation in the community). We therefore reach the merits of Bowen\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-10\">Bowen protests his removal as trustee of all three fringe benefit funds. If he was properly removed as trustee of the annuity fund, however, the court had discretion under section 409(a), <em>supra, </em>to remove him from the others as well. Section 409(a) authorizes such \u201cequitable or remedial relief that the court may deem appropriate, including removal of [a] fiduciary.\u201d This clause provides \u201ccourts with broad remedies for redressing the interests of participants and beneficiaries when they have been adversely affected by breaches of fiduciary duty.\u201d <em>Eaves v. Penn, </em>587 F.2d 453, 462 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>see Marshall v. Snyder, </em>572 F.2d 894, 901 (2d Cir. 1978). Since all three plans cover the same group of employees, the court could reasonably consider it \u201cappropriate\u201d to the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the three plans that a person who had not served them faithfully in one fiduciary capacity not represent them in any such capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-11\">While the broad remedial powers conferred by section 409(a) thus authorized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>particular remedy chosen by the court, that section, read literally, predicates the exercise of those remedial powers on a finding that the individual against whom the remedy is levied has violated a fiduciary duty. In the present case, however, the court removed Bowen simply \u201cto avoid the appearance of impropriety\u201d and not because of \u201cany misconduct.\u201d We are thus presented with the question whether a court has power beyond the literal mandate of section 409(a) to take action against a fiduciary to further what appears to be the best interests of those whom the fiduciary serves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">We have concluded that it would be imprudent for us to address this question at the present time. The issue is one of first impression, not only in this circuit but apparently in all others as well. The question itself, moreover, is a difficult one. On the one hand, Congress, in drafting very extensive and detailed standards of conduct for ERISA fiduciaries, in providing the courts with broad remedial powers to redress violations of those standards, and in preempting applicable state trust law,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> may have intended that the statute be the exclusive vehicle for regulating fiduciary conduct<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, in particular, that a statutory violation be a prerequisite for invoking the statutory remedies provided for such violations. On the other hand, Congress, in drafting a remedial statute, may have intended it to be liberally construed to carry out its purposes <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and, in creating a uniform federal fiduciary duty law, may have intended to incorporate therein traditional common law trust principles.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While the issue presented is thus both novel and substantial, the parties did not address it at all in their briefs, and we are loath to decide so important a question without benefit of the fruits of the adversary process unless it is necessary for us to do so. Here we are remanding the issue of damages to the district court and, in deciding that issue, the court will decide whether Bowen breached any of his statutory fiduciary duties. If it finds that he did, his removal can clearly stand. If it finds that he did not, it can then decide whether his removal was nevertheless permissible under ERISA,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and we will review that decision if called upon to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-11\">\n<em>IV. Enforcement of the Arbitrator\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-12\">In addition to challenging the lower court\u2019s jurisdiction to enforce the arbitrator\u2019s order to bring suit against the former trustees, which we have upheld, Bowen raises three other discernable objections to the enforcement of the order. We find them all without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-13\">First, Bowen argues that the court erred in construing ambiguities in the arbitrator\u2019s decision. The court found as facts both that the arbitrator\u2019s decision did not limit the type of charges to be brought against the former trustees and that Bowen was one of the former trustees and was therefore to be sued along with the others. Bowen cites <em>San Antonio Newspaper Guild Local No. 25 v. San Antonio Light Division, </em>481 F.2d 821, 825 (5th Cir. 1973), for the proposition that a court should not itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>resolve ambiguities in an arbitrator\u2019s award but rather should, in the \u201cnormal course,\u201d remand to the arbitrator for clarification. In the present case, however, the arbitrator not only wrote a letter to the trustees upon request clarifying his decision, but he himself testified at the trial, and the court simply interpreted the purported ambiguities in the decision to comport with what the arbitrator said he meant. We thus conclude, as did the panel in <em>San Antonio Light, </em>which also accepted a district court\u2019s adoption of an arbitrator\u2019s subsequent clarification, that to remand \u201cin this case . would be a pointless gesture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">Accompanying Bowen\u2019s argument that the court should have remanded to the arbitrator for clarification is the wholly inconsistent contention that the arbitrator lacked the authority to clarify his decision. Bowen cites <em>Citizens Bldg. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., </em>120 F.2d 982, 984 (5th Cir. 1941), for its statement that once \u201can arbitral board renders a final award, its powers- and duties under the submission are terminated,\u201d and \"it is powerless to modify or revoke [its final decision] or to make a new award upon the same issues.\u201d In the present case, however, the arbitrator did not alter his decision at all; he merely explained what he did and did not mean by it. And if such an explanation is necessary, the arbitrator is ordinarily <em>required </em>to provide it. <em>San Antonio Light, supra; United Steelworkers of America v. W. C. Bradley Co., </em>551 F.2d 72, 73 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">Finally, relying on <em>Refinery Employees Union v. Continental Oil Co., </em>268 F.2d 447, 451 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 896, 80 S.Ct. 199, 4 L.Ed.2d 152 (1959), which acknowledged that an arbitrator can only decide issues submitted to him, Bowen argues that the arbitrator\u2019s clarification went beyond the scope of the issues he was asked to resolve. <em>Refinery Employees </em>also holds, however, that determining just what issues were submitted to an arbitrator is a task for the court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 452. And here the court found that among the issues submitted to arbitrator Berkman was \u201c[w]hether under the facts and circumstances in the above-styled matter, the present Board of Trustees should file suit against all or any of the former Board of Trustees in their individual capacities.\u201d Since this finding was one of fact, we can disturb it only if it is clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Given the evidence in the record, including the fact that the court\u2019s phrasing of the issue was identical to that used by the arbitrator in prefacing his decision on the issue, we cannot say that the court\u2019s finding was erroneous at all. And given the arbitrator\u2019s decision on the issue, which was that \u201c[t]he present Board of Trustees are directed to file suit against all the former members of the Board of Trustees in their individual capacities,\u201d we cannot say that the arbitrator strayed from the matter before him when he warranted that by \u201csuit\u201d he did not mean to exclude any particular charges and that by \u201call the former members\u201d he did mean to include Bowen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-8\">\n<em>V. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-9\">Plaintiffs appeal the court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under section 502(g) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g), which provides that: \u201cIn any action under this sub-chapter by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-10\">While section 502(g) on its face gives the district court discretion with regard to attorneys\u2019 fees, plaintiffs argue that section 502(g) should be construed analogously to section 204(b) of Title II of the Civil Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a-3(b),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which is similarly worded and which the Supreme Court has interpreted to require the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs as a matter of course \u201cunless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968). Plaintiffs also point to <em>Northcross v. Board of Education, </em>412 U.S. 427, 93 S.Ct. 2201, 37 L.Ed.2d 48 (1973), which construed section 718 of the Emergency School Aid Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1617,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> identically to section 204(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\"><em>Northcross, </em>however, convinces us that plaintiffs\u2019 analogy is unsound. The Court in <em>Northcross </em>based its decision on two grounds. First, it recognized that \u201c[t]he similarity of language in \u00a7 718 and \u00a7 204(b) is ... a strong indication that the two statutes should be interpreted <em>pari passu.\u201d Id. </em>at 428, 93 S.Ct. at 2202. But second, and principally,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Court relied on the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-6\">\u201cthe two provisions share a common <em>rai-son d\u2019etre. </em>The plaintiffs in school cases are 'private attorneys general\u2019 vindicating national policy in the same sense as are plaintiffs in Title II actions. The enactment of both provisions was for the same purpose \u2014 \u2018to encourage individuals injured by racial discrimination to seek judicial relief . . . <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Combs, </em>471 F.2d 84, 86 (C.A. 5 1972), quoting <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., supra, </em>390 U.S., at 402, 88 S.Ct., at 966.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1345-10\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, there are two manifest distinctions between section 718 and 204(b), on the one hand, and section 502(g) of ERISA on the other. First, both of the former two provisions were designed to promote the eradication of (nonreverse) racial discrimination, \u201ca policy that Congress considered of the highest priority.\u201d <em>Piggie Park, </em>390 U.S. at 402, 88 S.Ct. at 966. The policies underlying ERISA are certainly important ones, but they simply do not rise to the level of assuring that all citizens are accorded their civil rights. Not only are the policies that section 502(g) is designed to enforce less compelling than those furthered by sections 718 and 204(b), but the need for attorneys\u2019 fees as an enforcement incentive is less under ERISA than the two civil rights statutes. Plaintiffs suing under the latter statutes are \u201cprivate attorneys general\u201d in the sense that they seek injunctive relief to vindicate important public rights. If such \u201cplaintiffs were routinely forced to bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees, few aggrieved parties would be in a position to advance the public interest by invoking the injunc-tive powers of the federal courts.\u201d <em>Piggie Park, </em>390 U.S. at 402, 88 S.Ct. at 966. Plaintiffs under Title I of ERISA may be seeking injunctive relief for the benefit of all the participants and beneficiaries of a particular plan, but they may also be seeking damages on behalf of their plan or simply the recovery of benefits from the plan that are due them alone.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Fiduciaries, moreover, may have a statutory obligation to bring ERISA suits.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, incentives in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees are, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>the whole, less necessary to insure that the statute is enforced.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">While we fail to find in ERISA the compelling circumstances that have led the Supreme Court to construe discretionary attorneys\u2019 fees provisions as virtually mandatory, we nevertheless must remand the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees in the present case. We have two reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">The first is simply that we are remanding on the merits, and different decisions on the merits may warrant a revised decision on attorneys\u2019 fees. The second is that the district court gave no reasons at all to justify its denial of attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs. While section 502(g) gives that court discretion with regard to awarding such fees, we are charged with reviewing its decision for abuse of discretion, and it is very difficult for us to do so without benefit of the lower court\u2019s reasons for deciding as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">We think that it would be helpful for district courts to have some guidelines to assist them in exercising their discretion, and we are certain that it would <em>be </em>helpful for us if the courts justified their decisions in terms of such guidelines. In deciding whether to award attorneys\u2019 fees to a party under section 502(g), therefore, a court should consider such factors as the following: (1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (2) the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorneys\u2019 fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting attorneys\u2019 fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERI-SA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions. <em>See Eaves v. Penn, </em>587 F.2d 453, 465 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>Baeten v. Van Ess, </em>474 F.Supp. 1324 (E.D.Wis. 1979). No one of these factors is necessarily decisive, and some may not be apropos in a given case, but together they are the nuclei of concerns that a court should address in applying section 502(g)..</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-10\">In particular types of cases, or in any individual case, however, other considerations may be relevant as well. Where plaintiffs are fiduciaries, <em>for example, as in </em>the present case, a court should consider whether those parties would have violated their fiduciary duties by not bringing suit.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>If they would have, and if they themselves, as is the case here, are bearing the costs of the suit, that would cut in favor of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. That the fiduciaries rather than the plan are financing the suit, however, may indicate that their duties did not require them to bring the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">Since the court below must reexamine its decisions regarding the management trustees\u2019 liability for damages, the propriety of Bowen\u2019s removal, and the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees, the case is</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">. The third union trustee who assumed office in January 1975 was Bill Hadden. Howard Jones replaced Hadden as a trustee in December 1977 and was subsequently substituted for him as a plaintiff in the present litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">. The court also found that Bowen was a \u201cformer trustee\u201d in the context of the arbitrator\u2019s decision and thus should be a defendant in the suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">. Section 302 generally prohibits employers from making payments or loans to labor organizations or their officers, but section 302(c)(3) provides an exception for payments to trust funds established for the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d of employees and administered by equal numbers of employer and employee representatives if the funds are organized and operated within a variety of other statutory restrictions. Although we have not specifically addressed the issue and do not do so here, the weight of authority seems to be that only structural deficiencies in a plan that defeat the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d provision of section 302(c)(5), and not simple breaches of fiduciary duty, violate that provision. <em>See, e. g., Lugo v.
