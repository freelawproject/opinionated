We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">Entrekin contends first that the district court erred by permitting his former wife, over his objection, to give testimony that he claims was based on confidential marital communications. The marital privilege recognized at common law represents two distinct and independent privileges. The first bars one spouse from testifying adversely to the other. The second bars one spouse from testifying as to the confidential marital communications of the other. <em>See United States v. </em>Mendoza\u201e 574 F.2d 1373, 1379 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 988, 99 S.Ct. 584, 58 L.Ed.2d 661 (1978); <em>United States v. Cameron, </em>556 F.2d 752, 755 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Harper, </em>450 F.2d 1032, 1045 (5th Cir. 1971). Entrekin recognizes the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Trammel v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 906, 63 L.Ed.2d 186 (1980), and makes no claim based on the first privilege. Rather, he confines his argument to the claim that his former wife testified as to the confidential marital communications that remain privileged after <em>Trammel. See id. </em>at-, 100 S.Ct. at 912-13, 63 L.Ed.2d ,at 194-195. There is no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\">This court previously has held \u201cthat conversations between husband and wife about crimes in which they are jointly participating when the conversations occur are not marital communications for the purpose of the marital privilege, and thus do not fall within the privilege\u2019s protection of confidential marital communications.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>574 F.2d at 1381. The record discloses both that all challenged conversations between Entrekin and his former wife were made in furtherance of the conspiracy to commit mail fraud and that, from the first conversation, Entrekin\u2019s former wife was an active participant with Entrekin in that conspiracy. The conversations testified to by Entrekin\u2019s former wife fall squarely within the exception to privileged marital communications created by <em>Mendoza</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and properly were admitted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-18\">Entrekin next contends that the district court erred by refusing to permit him to use his former wife\u2019s prior conviction for shoplifting for the purpose of impeachment. A party may attack the credibility of a witness by introducing evidence that the witness previously has been convicted of a crime provided the crime \u201cwas punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year\u201d or \u201cinvolved dishonesty or false statement.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 609(a). The district court properly excluded evidence of the witness\u2019 prior conviction for shoplifting because the crime neither was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year nor involved dishonesty or false statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>within the meaning of Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(2). <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 14:67 (West 1974); <em>United States v. Ashley, </em>569 F.2d 975, 978-79 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 853, 99 S.Ct. 163, 58 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978). <em>See also United States v. Barnes, </em>622 F.2d 107, 110 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Entrekin lastly contends that the district court erred by refusing to give a requested instruction based on <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973), and by denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. The record in this case clearly demonstrates that both contentions are totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-14\">. Entrekin\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument that <em>Trammel </em>does not address that portion of the marital privilege that protects confidential marital communications from disclosure. Accordingly, <em>Trammel </em>does not affect the validity of our prior holding in <em>Mendoza </em>that excludes from the scope of protected, confidential marital communications \u201cconversations between husband and wife about crimes in which they are jointly participating when the conversations occur.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
