For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-17\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-18\">At the time of his death Larry Lang, the appellee\u2019s decedent, had been employed as a switchman by the appellants for four years. On the night of his fatal injuries, Lang was engaged in switching railroad cars down particular access tracks to be later attached to other cars and engines. The procedure was for a switchman to release the cars by pulling the pin that attached them to more forward cars or the engine and let gravity operate to move the cars down the track. The evidence shows that Lang and his crew released two cars on Track 3. Lang then continued with the engine which proceeded on Track 4 parallel to the released cars. Because of its greater speed, the engine passed the two cars on Track 3. Immediately after the engine stopped, Lang jumped from the engine and attempted to cross Track 3. He was struck and killed, however, by the two cars that he had earlier released. Although there were no witnesses to Lang\u2019s death, the evidence showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>that the switching yard was poorly lit, the cars which struck Lang were not equipped with lights, and the area in which Lang\u2019s body was found was slick from accumulated oil. Over objection, Lang\u2019s foreman testified that possible causes of the accident were slippage of oil and poor lighting, and he knew of no contributory negligence on the part of Lang, although he had not witnessed the accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">Lang\u2019s widow brought this action against the railway companies individually, as next friend of her minor child and as representative of her deceased husband. She was not named administrator of the estate until after the jury verdict. The appellants, however, failed to plead lack of capacity. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $913,000. The district court ordered a remittitur and the award was reduced to $600,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Capacity to Sue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">Pursuant to 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51, an action under FELA may be maintained only by the deceased\u2019s \u201cpersonal representative.\u201d The phrase \u201cpersonal representative\u201d has been construed to mean an executor or administrator of the deceased\u2019s estate, not simply an heir. <em>Briggs v. Walker, </em>171 U.S. 466, 19 S.Ct. 1, 43 L.Ed. 243 (1898). At the time the suit was filed, the appellee, wife of the deceased, had not been appointed administrator of the estate. Indeed, she did not attain that status until after the jury verdict had been rendered but before the verdict was reduced to judgment. The appellants, however, failed to plead lack of capacity and only raised this ground in their motion for new trial after the verdict and judgment. The district court permitted the appellee to amend her pleadings to demonstrate capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">The appellants argue that because the appellee lacked the proper capacity throughout the trial, the trial and the verdict are nullities. We disagree. <em>See Reading Company </em>v. <em>Koons, </em>271 U.S. 58, 46 S.Ct. 405, 70 L.Ed. 835 (1926). It is true, as the appellants contend, that only a personal representative may enforce the action. This limitation on enforcement, however, is not for the purpose of assuring that the proper party be before the court, but rather to assure all beneficiaries and heirs access to whatever funds might result from the litigation and to guarantee that the railroad will not be subject to multiple recoveries. Neither of those bases underlying \u00a7 51 are offended by permitting the appellee to amend her complaint after the trial has occurred. Moreover, it is apparent that the appellants have suffered no prejudice. The label affixed to the appellee is one of form not substance for the purpose of prosecuting the litigation. No new cause of action was involved nor were any different factual circumstances introduced. <em>See M.K.T. &amp; R. Co. v. Wulf, </em>226 U.S. 570, 577, 33 S.Ct. 135, 137, 57 L.Ed. 355 (1912). It would be a different situation if the appellee had never become the personal representative of the deceased because then the railroad could be subject to multiple recoveries. However, that case is not before us. Moreover, the appellants\u2019 failure to plead lack of capacity renders that objection waived. Rule 9(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, although not requiring a plaintiff to aver capacity, does require a defendant to plead absence of capacity. <em>See Plumbers Local Union No. 519 of Miami v. Service Plumbing Company, Inc., </em>401 F.Supp. 1008 (D.C. Fla.1975). Therefore, because the appellants failed to plead the appellee\u2019s lack of capacity, they have now waived that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">\n<em>Sufficiency of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-11\">The FELA allows recovery of damages for personal injuries to an employee of a railroad if the injuries resulted \u201cin whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence necessary to sustain a jury finding of negligence was the subject of the Supreme Court opinion in <em>Lavender v. Kurn, </em>327 U.S. 645, 66 S.Ct. 750, 90 L.Ed. 916 (1946). In <em>Lavender </em>the Court was also confronted with a situation in which there were no eyewitnesses to the accident. The evidence demonstrated, however, that it could be reasonably inferred that the decedent had been struck by a protruding fixture on one of the railroad cars. The company argued that the decedent had been murdered. As in the instant case, the petitioner in <em>Lavender </em>contended that the jury verdict was the result of pure speculation. The Supreme Court answered this argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aef\">It is no answer to say that the jury\u2019s verdict involved speculation and conjecture. Whenever facts are in dispute or the evidence is such that fair-minded men may draw different inferences, a measure of speculation and conjecture is required on the part of those whose duty it is to settle the dispute by choosing what seems to them to be the most reasonable inference. Only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusion reached does a reversible error appear. But where, as here, there is an evidentiary basis for the jury\u2019s verdict, the jury is free to discard or disbelieve whatever facts are inconsistent with its conclusion. And the appellate court\u2019s function is exhausted when the evidentia-ry basis becomes apparent, it being immaterial that the court might draw a contrary inference or feel that another conclusion is more reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1358-7\">327 U.S. at 653, 66 S.Ct. at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-8\">In the instant case the evidentiary basis for the jury\u2019s conclusion is manifest: the negligence of the appellants is demonstrated by the absence of lighting both in the switching yard and on the cars in question and by the accumulation of oil in the immediate vicinity of Lang\u2019s body. It was reasonable for the jury to infer causation, that Lang was struck either because he could not see the approaching cars or he did see the approaching cars but slipped on the oil or perhaps a combination of the two. The appellants were free to demonstrate factors from which the jury could infer contributory negligence, for example, that Lang was susceptible to fainting or a similar physical infirmity, that Lang was ill at the time he was working, or that Lang had been drinking. The appellants offered no such evidence and the appellants\u2019 foreman testified that he knew of no contributing factors. Because there is not a complete absence of probative facts, we reject the appellants\u2019 contention that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-9\">\n<em>Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-10\">Finally, the appellants contend the trial judge erred in refusing to give a requested charge dealing with the effect of income taxation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-11\">If your verdict is in favor of the plaintiff, you will not increase or decrease the amount of your verdict by reason of federal income taxes, since the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>awarded the plaintiff, if any, is not taxable income to the plaintiff within the meaning of the tax laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">Apparently, relying upon the settled law in this circuit, see, e. <em>g., Greco v. Seaboard Coastline R.R., </em>464 F.2d 496, 497 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 990, 93 S.Ct. 1502, 36 L.Ed.2d 190 (1973), the district court refused the proffered charge. However, on February 19, 1980, subsequent to the trial and while the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court in <em>Norfolk and Western Railway Co. v. </em>Liepelt,-U.S.-, 100 S.Ct. 755, 62 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980), effectively changed the law in this area. In <em>Liepelt, </em>also a wrongful death action brought under FELA, the Court held that the trial court erred in refusing a requested jury instruction that \u201cyour award will not be subject to any income taxes, and you should not consider such taxes in fixing the amount of your award.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court reasoned that the average jury of laymen may not be cognizant that damages received as wrongful death awards are not taxable income to the recipient; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> therefore, the jury may assume mistakenly that a plaintiff\u2019s recovery will be subject to federal taxation and thus substantially inflate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-8\">Appellee urges that (1) the appellants failed to object properly under Rule 51, Fed.R.Civ.Proc., to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested charge, and (2) it would be improper for us to apply <em>Liepelt </em>retroactively. Rule 51 requires that for an objection to a jury instruction to be preserved for appeal, the objection and grounds must be stated distinctly after the charge and before the jury retires.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The purpose of the rule is to enable the trial court to correct any error it may have made before the jury begins its deliberations and thus avoid the necessity of a new trial. The rule is not without exceptions, however, and the failure to object may be disregarded if the party\u2019s position has previously been made clear to the court and it is plain that a further objection would have been unavailing. 9 <em>Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2553, at 640.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the time of the trial, the prevailing Fifth Circuit rule did not require submission of the requested charge. <em>Greco v. Seaboard Coastline R.R., </em>464 F.2d 496, 497 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 990, 93 S.Ct. 1502, 36 L.Ed.2d 190 (1973). Therefore, the trial court having refused the proffered instruction, further objection by the appellants would have been fruitless.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the Ninth Circuit stated in a similar situation: \u201cAn exception could not have permitted the district court to \u2018correct\u2019 the instructions. The instructions correctly stated the controlling law of the Circuit at the time they were given.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Heilman, </em>563 F.2d 1304, 1307 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-15\">Nor do we agree with appellee that <em>Liepelt </em>should not have retroactive effect. Our duty is to apply the law in effect at the time we render our decision, unless to do so would result in \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Richmond School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>711-15, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016-2018, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974); <em>Thorpe v. Housing Authority, </em>393 U.S. 268, 89 S.Ct. 518, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969); <em>United States v. Schooner Peggy, </em>1 Cranch 103, 2 L.Ed. 49 (1801). We do not find that retroactive application of <em>Liepelt </em>to this case will result in \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">We have considered the appellants\u2019 other citations of error but find them merit-less.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We therefore affirm on the issue of liability. In the light of <em>Liepelt, </em>however, we find that the trial court erred in refusing to give the proffered charge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">.

In <em>Liepelt </em>the Supreme Court also held that the trial court erred in excluding evidence offered to show the effect of income taxes on the decedent\u2019s estimated future earnings.

Motichek Towing Serv., Inc., </em>427 F.2d 897, 901 (5th Cir. 1970). We do not find that the failure to give the proffered instruction in the instant case was \u201cplain error.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1359-18\">. Appellants\u2019 argument that they made a proper objection after the charge to the jury is not supported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1360-7\">. <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 </em>U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971), cited by appel-lee, is a case in which retroactive application would have caused manifest injustice, in that case the plaintiff was injured in 1965 while working on an offshore drilling rig and brought suit for damages in 1968. While his case was pending in the trial court, the Supreme Court, in <em>Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>395 U.S. 352, 89 S.Ct. 1835, 23 L.Ed.2d 360 (1969), held that the Louisiana one-year statute of limitations, rather than the admiralty doctrine of laches, applied to actions such as the plaintiffs. In <em>Huson, </em>however, the Supreme Court declined to apply <em>Rodrigue </em>retroactively because application of the Louisiana statute of limitations would have deprived the plaintiff of any remedy whatsoever. In the instant case, on the other hand, no comparable hardship will result. Appellee is still entitled to a just and adequate recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1360-8\">. The appellants additionally argued that the district court erred in refusing to grant a retrial for excessiveness of damages or abused its discretion in failing to order a greater remittitur. Finally, the appellants contended that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the decedent\u2019s foreman to testify as to his conclusion on the cause of Lang\u2019s death. We hold that the court did not err in refusing to grant a retrial and that the amount of the remittitur was set within the limits of sound discretion. We also hold that the testimony of Lang\u2019s foreman was properly admitted. The conclusion of the lay witness was properly admitted as conducive to a clear understanding of the issue of causation of Lang\u2019s death. <em>See </em>Rules 701 and 704 of the Fed.R.Evid. Moreover, the jury was properly charged that they were the ultimate finder of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1360-18\">. We note that in <em>Cazad v. Chesapeake and Ohio Ry., </em>622 F.2d 72 (4th Cir. 1980), a case tried prior to <em>Liepelt </em>but pending on appeal when <em>Liepelt </em>was decided, the Fourth Circuit reversed for failure to give a proffered instruction which was substantially identical to the instructions required in <em>Liepelt.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
