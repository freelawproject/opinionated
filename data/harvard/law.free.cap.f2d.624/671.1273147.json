(Port Allen), on the Mississippi River. On January 5, 1975, Donald Bossard, an employee of Port Allen, met his death when he inhaled toxic fumes during the gas freeing of the Barge Exxon 217. Bossard\u2019s widow, individually and as administratrix of Bossard\u2019s estate, and his children sued Exxon Corporation (Exxon), as the owner of the barge, under section 905(b) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b) (Supp. 1977), for negligence. The district court concluded that Exxon could not be held liable under any theory of negligence on the facts presented and dismissed the suit. On appeal, we affirmed. <em>Bossard v. Exxon Corp., </em>559 F.2d 1040 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 934, 98 S.Ct. 1510, 55 L.Ed.2d 532 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">These plaintiffs then brought this action against Port Allen, alleging that Bossard\u2019s death was caused by the negligence of Port Allen and that it was liable as the owner <em>pro hac vice </em>of the Barge Exxon 217. The defendant denied that it was the owner <em>pro hac vice </em>of the barge and moved for summary judgment. The district court found for Port Allen on the point and gave it judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">No one disputes that Bossard\u2019s death was compensable under the LHWCA. The claim here is not for compensation, however, but for damages against the vessel as a third party. Plaintiffs contend that Port Allen, in addition to occupying the status of Bossard\u2019s employer, was the owner <em>pro hac vice </em>of Barge Exxon 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Under section 905(b) of the LHWCA, an employee may sue a vessel for its negligence. The term \u201cvessel\u201d is defined in the Act to include \u201csaid vessel\u2019s owner, <em>owner pro hac vice, </em>agent, operator, charter or bare boat charterer, master, officer or crew member.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(21) (1976) (emphasis added.) In <em>Smith v. M/V CAPTAIN FRED, </em>546 F.2d 119, 122 (5th Cir. 1977), we observed that Congress was \u201cwell aware of the fact that shipowners, owners <em>pro hac vice, </em>and charterers frequently have their own employees perform tasks covered by the LHWCA, but [made] no special provision for . that situation.\u201d Citing legislative history indicating a Congressional intent that the same principles be applied to determine vessel liability \u2014 whether the vessel owner employs its own longshoremen, shipbuilders, or repairmen or hires an independent contractor who employs them \u2014 we held that \u201can employee may sue his employer qua vessel if he was injured as a result of the vessel\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 123. <em>CAPTAIN FRED, </em>therefore, squarely supports the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability in this case \u2014 that a longshoreman or ship repair employee can bring a maritime, negligence-based damages action for personal injury against an employer whose relationship with the vessel on which the injury occurred was that of ownership <em>pro hac vice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">The district court properly granted summary judgment because plaintiffs failed, as a matter of law, to establish that Port Allen was the <em>pro hac vice </em>owner of the Barge Exxon 217 when Bossard\u2019s accident occurred. For such ownership to be found, it is generally necessary for the defendant\u2019s relationship to be that of shipowner-bareboat charterer. Such a relationship is materially different from that of shipowner-ship repairer or shipowner-stevedore. <em>Rao v. Hillman Barge and Construction Co., </em>467 F.2d 1276, 1277 (3rd Cir. 1972). \u201c[T]he charterer takes over the ship, lock, stock and barrel, and mans her with his own people. He becomes the owner <em>pro hac vice, </em>just as does the lessee of a house and lot, to whom the demise charterer is analogous.\u201d G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the Law of Admiralty, \u00a7 4-1 at 194 (2nd ed. 1975); <em>see Eskine v. United Barge Co., </em>484 F.2d 1194, 1196 (5th Cir. 1973). Though the ship repairer is a bailee, and to that extent is like a charterer, he plainly does not have the degree of control over the vessel that the charterer, the owner <em>pro hac vice, </em>has.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The depositions and affidavits in the record before us indicate that Port Allen was hired merely to \u201cgas-free\u201d or \u201cde-gas\u201d the barge; thus it did not have the control necessary to be deemed an owner <em>pro hac vice. </em>An Exxon tug moved the barge to Port Allen\u2019s repair facilities and docked it, and the barge remained in that docked position until the gas-freeing process had been completed. Following Bossard\u2019s accident, the barge was released to Capital Marine (a subsidiary of the parent corporation which also owned Port Allen) to be moved to a shipyard for further repairs. The barge was not and could not have been used by Port Allen to ship cargo. Exxon could have demanded that Port Allen release the barge at any time. In sum, Port Allen did not have the complete control over the barge required for ownership <em>pro hac vice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The entry of summary judgment was appropriate, and, accordingly, we</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
