He asserts claims against the tavern and its owners under the Dram Shop Act set forth in General Obligations Law \u00a7 11-101, as well as by operation of section 65 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, and for negligence. However, plaintiff has no remedy under the facts as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">New York courts have not imposed a common-law duty to protect a person whose injuries are results of his or her own voluntary intoxication, and have refused to recognize a common-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>law cause of action against providers of alcoholic beverages for injuries to such persons <em>(Sheehy v Big Flats Community Day, </em>73 NY2d 629, 636 [1989]; <em>Livelli v Teakettle Steak House, </em>212 AD2d 513 [1995]). The cause of action under the Dram Shop Act, a statutory vehicle for relief distinct from the common law, is limited to a third party injured or killed by an intoxicated person and does not authorize recovery for injuries sustained by the person whose own voluntary intoxication resulted from the sale <em>(Sheehy </em>at 635; <em>cf. Rutledge v Rockwells of Bedford, </em>200 AD2d 36, 41 [1994]). Moreover we have long recognized that section 65 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law does not create an independent statutory cause of action <em>(Moyer v Lo Jim Caf\u00e9, </em>19 AD2d 523 [1963], <em>affd </em>14 NY2d 792 [1964]).
