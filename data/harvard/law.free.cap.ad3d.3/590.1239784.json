The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>evidence included defendant\u2019s detailed signed confession, as well as the testimony of his accomplice and eyewitnesses to the chain of events culminating in this shooting. The proof established that following a heated argument with the victim in the days prior to the shooting, defendant purchased a gun. On the day of the shooting, defendant was riding as a passenger in a vehicle driven by his codefendant searching for Crawley; they waited for a time outside Crawley\u2019s house and then drove away; when they spotted the victim\u2019s parked motorcycle, they waited and, when the victim drove away on the motorcycle, defendant directed his codefendant to follow the motorcycle. When it stopped, defendant and the victim exchanged words and then defendant admittedly shot the victim four times, asserting in his confession that the victim\u2019s threatening gestures toward him had scared him.</p>\n<p id=\"ADm\">Upon his conviction, Supreme Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 25 years to life, to be served consecutively to sentences imposed upon prior convictions. Defendant appeals. Finding no merit to defendant\u2019s contentions that the court\u2019s denial of his <em>Batson </em>motion was error, the verdict was unsupported, his mistrial motion was improperly denied, he received ineffective assistance of counsel and the sentence should be reduced, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">With regard to defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge directed at the exclusion of one African American juror on the basis of race, no error is discernible in Supreme Court\u2019s determination rejecting this challenge. After an appropriate inquiry and careful analysis, the court ascertained that while a pattern of discrimination was arguably established at that juncture, the People\u2019s explanation\u2014that the juror\u2019s answers reflected potential bias against correction officers and sympathy toward inmates stemming from her experiences with and ill will toward her ex-husband, a correction officer\u2014was race-neutral and not shown to be pretextual <em>(see People v Smocum, </em>99 NY2d 418, 421-422 [2003]; <em>People v Williams, </em>306 AD2d 691, 691-692 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Turning to the jury\u2019s verdict, a review of the trial testimony and evidence in the light most favorable to the People demonstrates legally sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion <em>(see People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]; <em>People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620, 621 [1983]). Defendant\u2019s own confession, combined with the testimony of several other witnesses including the codefendant, supported the conclusion that defendant, armed with a gun, bullets and latex gloves, pursued the victim and repeatedly shot him at close range intending to cause his death, motivated by their recent argument. Further, viewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the evidence in a neutral light and deferring to the jurors\u2019 ability to assess the witnesses\u2019 credibility, we find that the verdict was supported by the weight of credible evidence and, in fact, a different finding would have been unreasonable (see <em>People v Bleakley, supra). </em>Despite some inconsistencies, the testimony of the codefendant, who accepted a guilty plea to a reduced charge in exchange for his testimony, was more than adequately corroborated by defendant\u2019s own statement to police and the testimony of other witnesses who observed either the shooting or defendant in the hours or days prior thereto <em>(see </em>CPL 60.22 [1]; <em>People v Elhadi, </em>304 AD2d 982, 983 [2003], <em>lv denied </em>100 NY2d 580 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">We perceive no abuse of discretion in Supreme Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s mistrial motion, which followed the unsolicited direct testimony of one of the detectives repeating two oral remarks made by defendant after his arrest which were not in the CPL 710.30 notice or part of defendant\u2019s written statement <em>(see People v Miller, </em>239 AD2d 787, 787-788 [1997], <em>affd </em>91 NY2d 372 [1998]). No undue prejudice resulted, no bad faith was evident and the court immediately gave an extended curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Defendant\u2019s claims that he was denied meaningful representation are unpersuasive, as the record reflects that trial counsel, faced with overwhelming proof of defendant\u2019s guilt, vigorously represented defendant during, inter alia, pretrial motions, jury selection and in cross-examining witnesses at trial, making numerous trial and postverdict motions on defendant\u2019s behalf <em>(see People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708, 711-714 [1998]; <em>People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 146-147 [1981]). Counsel\u2019s ultimately unsuccessful tactical decision\u2014with defendant\u2019s input and assurances to Supreme Court that he assented and had adequate time to make this decision\u2014to withdraw the jury charge on self-defense and focus on undermining the credibility of the People\u2019s witnesses, provides no basis for this claim <em>(see People v Smith, </em>302 AD2d 677, 680 [2003], <em>lv denied </em>100 NY2d 543 [2003]; see <em>also People v Satterfield, </em>66 NY2d 796, 798-800 [1985]).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Finally, considering defendant\u2019s significant criminal record and the violent premeditated nature of this crime, which reflect that defendant poses a very serious danger to society, we perceive no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances to justify reducing the sentence in the interest of justice <em>(see People v Mileto, </em>290 AD2d 877, 880 [2002], <em>lv denied </em>97 NY2d 758 [2002]). Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Cardona, P.J., Mercure, Peters and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
