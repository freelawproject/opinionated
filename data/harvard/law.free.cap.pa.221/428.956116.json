Pea coal is hereby defined to be that coal which passes with the dirt through a screen of three-quarters of an inch mesh.\u201d The miners agreed to mine the said coal in a careful, skillful and prudent manner, and by the best possible way, and to take out all available coal. The weights returned by the transporting companies to be taken as evidence of the amount mined and removed, and the lessors are given free access to all shipping and sales books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\">By sundry convejmnces the property and all the rights of Swoyer and Mitchell passed to and became vested in defendant company, which is now and has for several years been operator and lessee of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-9\">The amended statement of plaintiff, filed September 25, 1901, concisely sets out the facts relied upon for the judgment. They are: 1. The defendant has mined and shipped 163,430 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>tons and sixteen cwt. of merchantable coal denominated \u2018 by defendant as \u201c buckwheat coal \u201d; 26,601 and five cwt. merchantable coal denominated by defendant as <em>\u201c </em>rice coal \u201d; 5,509 tons and nineteen cwt. merchantable coal denominated by defendant as \u201c barley coal,\u201d as shown by a table furnished by defendant to plaintiffs and annexed- to and made part of their statement. 2. For the purpose of making power, defendant has consumed under its boilers 80,217.7 tons merchantable coal, and that defendant has paid for' coal mined of the sizes larger than buckwheat, rice and-barley, only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-4\">The supplemental affidavit of defense (the original affidavit of defense purports to have been made by Mr. Warriner, manager for defendant, but is signed and sworn to by Mr. Woodward only) admits defendant mined, shipped and sold buckwheat, rice and barley coal, of the quantity set out in plaintiffs\u2019 statement of August 27, 1906, but denies that the tonnage of this coal was of the amount set out in the amended statement, and denies that such was pea coal as known to the trade at the time when the lease was made, or at the present time, or was pea coal as defined by the lease, and denies it has consumed under its boilers any coal which the defendant is liable to pay for. On October 30, 1907, exceptions were filed to this affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-5\">By the terms of the contract the lessors demised all- the coal, with the right to open mines and remove the coal, the lessee to have and to hold until all the merchantable coal available by skillful and proper working should be exhausted. It was agreed by the parties that certain rentals should be paid on all merchantable coal, that pea coal shall be paid- for at half price. The contract makes it unnecessary to search elsewhere for what the parties considered such coal. They provided in apt and explicit words what they meant it should be, as follows : \u201c Pea coal is hereby defined to be that coal. which passes, with the dirt, through a screen of three-quarters of an inch mesh.\u201d What pea coal is, in this agreement, was not left to guess, construction of language, or evidence, either at the time of the execution of the agreement or now. The court should not against protest now make a new contract for the parties. Pea, by the terms of the agreement, is. defined to be \u201c that coal (all the coal) which passes with -the ditt \u2019\u2019-through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>a certain, mesh. Defendant does not deny, indeed it admits, the coal sued for was such coal, that it was mined, removed, sold or used by it and paid for, but seeks to avoid judgment by a statement that the coal mined was not pea. With equal force it could say that any other definition contained in the lease is not what it specifically states it is, and thus, by parol evidence, raise a question to be construed and decided. This, in our opinion, cannot be done in an affidavit of defense, and, therefore, the rule for judgment, notwithstanding the affidavit of defense, is made absolute.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aypa\">May 18, 1908:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-5\"><em>F.
