Hawley were dismissed by the court, Ashman, B. J., filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">The main inquiry concerns the validity of the testamentary trust created by the husband and that created by his appointee. By the will of the testatrix she devised and bequeathed her estate to her husband in these terms : \u201c To my husband John Morton McClellan for the term of his life, with power to dispose of the same during his life, and with power of his last will and testament at his death to appoint and vest any or all that remains undisposed of of my estate, to and in such persons as he sees fit ... . provided that nothing shall be given during his life or bequeathed by his last will to any member or members of his family.\u201d In case of a breach of this pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>viso she directed that her estate should go to her brother, Dr. B. N. Hawley, for life, with a similar power of disposition during life or by will. The only limitation which is here suggested or can be implied is found, if found at all, in the use of the word \u201c vest.\u201d An estate vests in a person who is given a present and immediate interest, as distinguished from an interest whose existence depends upon a contingency. As defined by Chancellor Kent, to vest is to give a legal or equitable seisin : 4 Kent\u2019s Com. (13th ed.), 202. An estate in remainder is vested in the remainder-man, although its enjoyment is deferred until the falling in of the life estate. So an estate is vested in a trustee to serve the interests of the cestuis que trust. Whatever may have been the original meaning of the word as denoting the investiture of the fee, the word is now applied to estates in personalty usual as estates in land. In this instance, the husband of the testatrix could have willed the estate in parcels by appointing it to A. for life with remainder to B. in fee, and no one'could doubt that he would thereby have vested an estate in each of those parties; and with the same effect he co.uld have vested an estate in a trustee to serve their interests.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">Assuming, as we think it did, that the power of appointment in John M. McClellan covered equitable as well as legal estates, was his appointment to J. Bundle Smith in trust, within the limits of the authority conferred by the will of the testatrix, the original donor ? It omitted the proviso in that will, prohibiting any gift to a member of the husband\u2019s family. But that proviso was by operation of law written into any will or power of appointment which the husband or his appointee might execute, and would carry with it the penalty imposed by the will of the testatrix. Without doubt the trust created by the husband tended to a perpetuity. His will gave the donee of the power a life estate with power to appoint to another for life, and with authority in the last donee to will the principal as she should choose, and therefore with power to create a life estate in one who was not in being at the death of the testatrix. The law, however, will remedy, if it can, the defective execution of a power, and will not strike down a trust which is in part good and in part invalid, so long as the part which is valid can be upheld: Hor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>witz v. Norris, 49 Pa. 213.- Here the trust for the daughter of \u00abJ. Bundle Smith for life is valid, and we cannot assume that her exercise of the power will be other than valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-4\">The testatrix owned a small undivided interest in a large tract of land. After her death John M. McClellan joined with the remaining owners in an agreement to sell, under which the land was sold, but he died before the payment of the purchase money. He evidently executed the contract in his own name and not as executor or trustee, because after his death, some doubt having arisen as to his power, the court authorized the executor of his will to execute the deed. If the husband by his joinder intended more than simply to facilitate the sale in which others, and not he, were largely interested, and if his purpose was rather to assert his individual ownership, can he be said by this act to have disposed of <em>\u201c </em>the share \u201d within the meaning of testatrix\u2019s will ? Especially can this be said when the purchase money never came into his hands, and when the testatrix had used the words <em>\u201c </em>disposed of,\u201d in connection with the words \u201c given or spent,\u201d meaning thereby some act by which the husband should unmistakably distinguish between his wife\u2019s estate and his own. So with the personal effects, consisting of books, paintings, etc. The husband continued after his wife\u2019s death to reside in the house which she had occupied, and he apparently allowed these articles to remain undistributed where she had left them. They passed as part of his wife\u2019s estate under the clause in his will by which he gave \u201c all my personal property and effects coming to me from my deceased wife,\u201d to a trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">The discussion by counsel covered a wide range, into which it Avould be more interesting than useful to enter.
