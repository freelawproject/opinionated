It has an authorized capital stock of $100,000, divided into 1,000 shares of the par value of $100 each. It has a paid up capital of $70,000, consisting of 700 shares of stock, of which the plaintiff, Zachary T. Brindley, owns 350 shares and defendant Edwin Walker owns 349 shares, and defendant Clarence L. Walker owns one share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-8\">That said corporation has always been, and still is, managed by a board of three directors, which directors are said stockholders, and have been elected annually at the stockholders\u2019 meeting held in the month of August of each year, and were again re-elected at such meeting held in August, 1907. And the said board of directors thereupon immediately organized by the election of said Edwin Walker as president, and said Zachary T. Brindley as secretary and treasurer, and the said Clarence L. Walker ivas appointed superintendent for the ensuing year. That said Edwin Walker had held the said office of president and the said Zachary T. Brindley had held the said office of secretary and treasurer ever since the organization of said corporation. That about one month after said last annual election the said president of the board of directors requested the secretary to call a meeting of said board in a letter as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-9\">\u201c Erie, Pa., Sept. 28, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-10\">\u201c Z.

Walker :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\">\u201c Resolved, that the president of the Erie Specialty Company is hereby authorized and directed to employ counsel and defend the Erie Specialty Company in the suit brought by Z.

Brindley is hereby removed and dismissed from the office of secretary and treasurer of the Erie Specialty Company, to take effect immediately.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-10\">\u201c Resolved, that Henry L. Morse is hereby elected secretary of the Erie Specialty Company, to take effect immediately.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-11\">\u201c Resolved, that Clarence L. Walker is hereby elected treasurer of the Erie Specialty Company, and that his salary as treasurer and superintendent shall be two hundred ($200) dollars per month from and after September 30, 1907.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-12\">\u25a0 And that said director, Zachary T. Brindley, protested and voted against the adoption of each of said resolutions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-13\">That at such directors\u2019 meeting in August, 1907, the salary of Edwin Walker as president was fixed at $300 a month, and that of Zachary T. Brindley as secretary and treasurer was fixed at $250 a month, and that of Clarence L. Walker as superintendent at $175 a month for the ensuing year. That at a subsequent meeting of said board the action of said board in increasing the salary of said Clarence L. Walker to $200 a month was rescinded. That said plaintiff, by virtue of his said appointment at the August meeting of said board, continued to act as secretary and treasurer of said corporation until said meeting on September 30, 1907, but bad not taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the secretary\u2019s oath as required by law, nor filed a new bond as required by the by-laws of said corporation, but did tender such a bond on October 28, 1907, before bringing this suit. That on said September 30, 1907, after the adoption of said resolutions, the said president of the board gave Mr. Brindley written notice of his removal and directed him to surrender the property which he held as such secretary and treasurer, and to transact no further business as such ; and since which time he has not been permitted to act as such officer. No charges were preferred against Mr. Brindley and no reason given for his removal. He is still a director of said company, and brings this writ of mandamus to be restored to the said office of secretary and treasurer. There is nothing in the bylaws of said corporation fixing the length of the term of any of the officers of said company nor the manner of their removal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-4\">The court entered judgment for defendants on the demurrer to answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-6\"><em>Frank Gunnison, </em>with him <em>John S.

They do, however, provide for annual elections. The directors and officers have uniformly, since the organization of the company, been elected annually for the term of one year. The election of the plaintiff in 1907 was for the \u201c present year.\u201d It is so alleged in the petition for the mandamus and admitted in the answer. The custom of electing for the term of one year, followed in this instance, would seem to have the force of a by-law, and the election for that term to have the effect of a contract: Dunston v.

He seeks by this proceeding to be reinstated, on the ground that in removing him the directors exceeded their power. The general rule with respect to officers in private corporations such as this is, that all below the grade of directors, and such other officers as are elected by the corporation at large, hold their offices durante bene pl\u00e1cito, and are removable by the directors without cause being assigned. The reason for the rule is as obvious as the distinction made. The supreme authority in every corporation resides in its membership. The expressed will of the majority at a regular shareholders\u2019 meeting governs in all matters within the limits of the charter. Therefore, when action has been taken by the corporation at such a meeting, on any subject pertaining to the affairs of the association, it is beyond the power of any of the agents of the corporation to undo or change what has been done. The directors are the immediate representatives of the corporation charged with the management of its affairs, and are necessarily invested with large discretionary powers; but they can act only where the corporation has not. Ordinarily, the selection of the secretary and treasurer is committed to the board of directors, as was the case here; but when the corporation has itself elected these officers the directors must accept them, and the officers so elected hold on the terms and conditions prescribed by the corporation, and none other. They derive their title to their respective offices from the same source as the directors do theirs, and they can be removed only by the power that appointed them. It is otherwise when the corporation has committed the election to the board of directors. In such case the board stands for the corporation ; the officers selected are its appointees, and its power to remove is necessarily implied. \u201c The directors and managing agents of a corporation have undoubted authority to revoke the powers of' the inferior agents whom they have appointed. It would be practically impossible to carry on the business of a corporation without this power; it is, therefore, always implied. The power is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u2022discretionary one, and the rightfulness of its exercise cannot be investigated by the courts. But the directors of a corporation have no implied authority to revoke the power of those agents who are appointed by a vote of the stockholders, or Avhose office is fixed and regulated by the charter : \u201d Morawetz on Private Corporations, sec. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThe ministerial officers who are not elected by the corporation at large, for stated terms, but who are appointed by the board of directors, and who, therefore, sustain toward the corporation the relation of an employee toward an employer, serving for a compensation, Avhich in general the directors do not receive, have no franchise in their office, and hence are removable at the mere pleasure of the directors, without the assignment of any cause, without the giving of any notice, and Avithout any trial or investigation into the grounds of the removal: \u201d Thompson on the Law of Corporations, sec. 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The secretary and treasurer in corporations such as this are purely ministerial officers. The effort here made to show that under our act of assembly they are something more, is unavailing. The act of 1891, under which this corporation is said to have been chartered, provides that corporations chartered under it \u201c shall be managed and conducted by a president, a board of directors or trustees, a secretary or clerk, a treasurer, and such other officers, agents and factors as the corporation authorizes for that purpose.\u201d The effect and purpose of this provision is to require of every corporation that it shall have the officers named, viz.: a president, directors, secretary and treasurer, as a necessary part of the equipment of its organization. The act does not attempt to define the powers and duties of any of the officers named, but leaves these to be implied from the established custom and the nature and character of the places filled. The construction that would make the act invest the secretary and treasurer with discretionary poAver \u2014 \u25a0 something which a ministerial officer has not \u2014 Avould extend that discretionary power to all the agents and factors which .the act allows the corporation to employ. Manifestly nothing of this kind was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">From what we have said it folloAvs that in removing the appellant from the office of secretary and treasurer the board of directors was exercising a power which rightfully belonged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>it. Whether it was wisely or considerately exercised is not for us to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
