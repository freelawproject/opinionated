Wright, </em>189 Md. 294, 55 A 2d. 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">The other allegations have no bearing on the propriety of the petitioner\u2019s detention. This Court cannot in a habeas corpus proceeding determine the sufficiency of the evidence, and therefore petitioner\u2019s allegations, even if substantiated, would not justify release on habeas corpus. <em>State, ex rel. Sawyer v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>190 Md. 757, 60 A. 2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
