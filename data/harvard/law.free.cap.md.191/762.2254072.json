He further alleges that he was arrested without a warrant and that his house was searched without a search warrant. He also alleges that false testimony was introduced against him in his trial and that the evidence was not sufficient to convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">The papers filed here, however, show that he was convicted and sentenced to ten years for robbery with a deadly weapon. Even if he was illegally arrested and held, he cannot for that reason escape punishment when lawfully indicted, tried, and convicted. <em>Davis v. Brady, </em>188 Md. 113, 51 A. 2d 827; <em>Bowie v. Warden, </em>190 Md. 728, 60 A. 2d 185; <em>State ex rel. Wilson v. Warden, </em>190 Md. 758, 60 A. 2d 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">He does not allege that the articles obtained from his house without a search warrant were offered in evidence against him. Even if they were so offered, that question cannot be retried on habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The question of guilt or innocence and credibility and weight of the evidence cannot be retried on habeas corpus. <em>Rountree v. Wright, </em>189 Md. 292, 55 A. 2d 847, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
