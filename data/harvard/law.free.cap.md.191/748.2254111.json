He alleges that he was convicted for a crime that \u201clayed among five drunks\u201d, and that no one knew anything about the crime until after they became sober the next day. He alleges that the truth was not told by the witnesses at the trial, as the other four men who were present at the time of the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>were against him, because the woman who was killed was their friend and they did not want him to be living with her. He also alleges that while arrangement was made for him to have a lawyer, and the lawyer did all he could, he was a colored man who did not protect his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The writ of habeas corpus cannot be used as an appeal or for the purpose of reviewing the evidence given in a criminal case. <em>Rountree v.
