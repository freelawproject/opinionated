The appeal is filed by Elmer Meadows, who claims he is blind and is now confined in the Maryland Penitentiary on conviction of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">He claims that before his trial there was no preliminary hearing, that his arrest was without a warrant and his conviction was based on false testimony. He also claims that his witness was not brought into court to testify. No facts alleged show a denial of a preliminary hearing or of an opportunity to prepare his defense. He admits that he was tried on an indictment. <em>State ex rel. Kirby v. Warden Maryland House of Correction, </em>190 Md. 765, 59 A. 2d 791. A preliminary hearing is not necessary before a valid indictment can be obtained. <em>State ex rel. Sanner v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>191 Md. 743, 59 A. 2d 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">Even if he was illegally arrested and held, this did not absolve him from punishment when lawfully indicted, tried and convicted. <em>Davis v. Brady, </em>188 Md. 113, 51 A. 2d <em>827; Edmondson v. Brady, </em>188 Md. 96, 52 A. 2d 96; <em>Bowie </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number><em>v. Warden of Maryland Penitentiary, </em>190 Md. 728, 60 A. 2d 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Of course, the question of guilt or innocence and the sufficiency of the evidence cannot be retried on habeas corpus. <em>Olewiler v. Brady, </em>185 Md. 341 344, 44 A. 2d <em>807; Bernard v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>187 Md. 273, 49 A. 2d 737; <em>Copeland v. Wright, </em>188 Md. 666, 53 A. 2d 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">He does not allege that he asked that witnesses be summoned, whether they were summoned, or what they would testify if present. <em>Rountree v. Wright, </em>189 Md. 292, 55 A. 2d 847; <em>Walker v. Warden of Maryland Penitentiary, </em>190 Md. 729, 60 A. 2d 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
