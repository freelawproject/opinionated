The habeas judge did not have before him the record of the proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeals or the trial transcript.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1122-14\">. The order denying the petition states that the court has \u201cexamined the <em>proceedings </em>before the Court of Criminal Appeals,\u201d that the <em>opinion </em>of that court correctly sets forth the law on the matters involved, and that it \u201cfinds from this <em>record </em>that none of Petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights have been violated.\u201d After the entry of this order petitioner filed a request with the District Court stating that the decision had been rendered based on the <em>opinion </em>of the Court of Criminal Appeals and asking leave to file as exhibits to be available to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals the \u201cRecord on Appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeals\u201d which, the motion stated, had not been before the habeas judge. The habeas judge granted that motion but included in his order a statement that he did not consider the said Record necessary to dispose of the case'. From this course of events we dedpce that the denial was based solely upon the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals and without examination of the Record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
