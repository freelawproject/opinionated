Although the appeal was once dismissed, we confirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>our order of October <em>12, </em>1973, reinstating the appeal, and consider it on its merits, but without oral argument. Rule 2, F.R.A.P. Plaintiff\u2019s application for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Plaintiff is an inmate of a state prison and is not represented. He sent his \u201ccomplaint,\u201d \u201caffidavit in forma pauperis,\u201d and other sheets of paper, variously entitled, to the district court. His pleading is to be held \u201cto less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers\u201d and the test is whether \u201cit appears \u2018beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u2019 Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 [78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80] (1957).\u201d Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 596, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), reh. denied 405 U.S. 948, 92 S.Ct. 963, 30 L.Ed.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The district court permitted filing in forma pauperis, but dismissed on the court\u2019s own motion without service of process on defendant.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court concluded that there were no facts pleaded by which defendant could be said to have acted under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Reading plaintiff\u2019s papers together, plaintiff alleged that defendant incompetently represented him as a \u201ccourt appointed attorney\u201d in a burglary trial before a state court; that plaintiff was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment; that \u201cdefendant is clothed with the authority of state law\u201d; that he deprived plaintiff of sixth amendment rights by giving plaintiff incompetent counsel; and that specifically defendant failed to move to suppress damaging evidence which was introduced at trial, failed to call all witnesses in plaintiff\u2019s behalf, and made statements in argument to the jury which involved plaintiff in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">It is now clear, as a result of plaintiff\u2019s later submissions, and a letter from defendant to this court concerning the appeal, that defendant was the Public Defender of Macon County, Illinois. In fairness to the district court it must be noted that plaintiff\u2019s original papers never expressly referred to defendant as public defender, although the caption of the complaint indicated his address as \u201cMacon County Courthouse Decatur Illinois.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">It is at least arguable that a public defender acts under color of state law in his relationship with and representation of an indigent accused person. Although we recognize that after appointment in a given case, the professional relationship of the public defender with his client is similar to that of a private attorney with his \u25a0 client, the public defender ordinarily enjoys continuing employment by a unit of government, is often furnished an office as well as compensation, and appears to his client, as well as others, as a person cloaked with the authority of the state. See, in the context of a criminal charge against a public defender acting under color of law, United States v. Senak, 477 F.2d 304 (7th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Assuming that defendant, as public defender, was acting under color of state law, plaintiff would still have to establish that defendant subjected him to the deprivation of a sixth amendment right. Looking at the complaint with required liberality, we can not say with assurance that plaintiff can adduce no facts to prove that defendant\u2019s alleged failures turned the state trial into a \u201csham or mockery\u201d or at least \u201cblotted out the essence of a substantial defense.\u201d United States ex rel. Little v. Twomey, 477 F.2d 767, 773 (7th Cir., 1973); Scott v. United States, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 339, 427 F.2d 609, 610 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Assuming, however, that defendant could be deemed to be acting under color of state law, and allowing for the possibility that plaintiff\u2019s proof might demonstrate such incompetency as to amount to deprivation of sixth amendment rights, we think that, as a matter of law, defendant is immune from liability for damages, and plaintiff\u2019s complaint must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The legislative history of 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 1983 does not indicate that Congress intended to \u201cabolish wholesale all common law immunities.\u201d Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 555, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1218, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1966). In part because of the same factors which lead us to think that state subsidized and appointed public defenders can act under color of state law, we conclude that public defenders, like state prosecutors, and state and city attorneys, enjoy a qualified immunity for acts performed in the discharge of their official duties. Brown v. Joseph, 463 F.2d 1046, 1048 (3rd Cir., 1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 950, 93 S.Ct. 3015, 37 L.Ed.2d 1003. See Arensman v. Brown, 430 F.2d 190, 193 (7th Cir., 1970). We note that the extension of immunity to public defenders will encourage their free exercise of discretion in the performance of professional obligations, as well as aid in the recruitment of able men and women for public defender positions. See Brown v. Joseph, <em>supra, </em>463 F.2d at 1048-1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">As contrasted with the indictment in United States v. Senak, <em>supra, </em>there are no factual allegations in the complaint at bar, even when construed broadly, which indicate that the acts complained of fall beyond the scope of defendant\u2019s immunity. In deciding whether to object to evidence, whether to call a particular witness, and how to address the jury, the public defender was performing acts within the scope of his employment. Although it may be established under the pleadings that defendant made gross errors of judgment, we note that there is no allegation that his conduct was intentionally harmful to plaintiff, or otherwise deliberately inconsistent with his obligations to plaintiff so as to be a voluntary excursion outside the scope of his duties. See Hilliard v. Williams, 465 F.2d 1212, 1218 (6th Cir., 1972), cert. denied 409 U.S. 1029, 93 S.Ct. 461, 34 L.Ed.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\"> Unlike the plaintiff in Dear v. Rathje, 485 F.2d 558 (7th Cir. 1973), John did not move for the issuance of summons to defendant, and his indigent complaint was dismissed before <em>Dear </em>was handed down. Accordingly, we need not vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
