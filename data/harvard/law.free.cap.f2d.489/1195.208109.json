Appellant argued that he is a professional writer who has published four books treating of the Kennedy assassination. The Department of Justice moved that the complaint be dismissed or, alternatively, for summary judgment, predicating its position upon Section 552(b)(7) of the Act which, as here pertinent, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">(b) This section shall not apply to matters that are</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">* -* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">(7) investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes ....</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">The district court without opinion granted the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are satisfied that the record before us clearly demonstrates the desired materials <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were part of the investigatory files compiled by the FBI for law enforcement purposes, and, as such, are exempt from the disclosure sought to be compelled. Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-21\">President ' Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:00 p. m. on Friday, November 22, 1963. That day, at 2:38 p. m., Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the thirty-sixth President of the United States and immediately by plane left Texas for Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-22\">Director Hoover testified before the Warren Commission that</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-23\">When President Johnson returned to Washington he communicated with me within the first 24 hours and asked - the Bureau to pick up the investigation of the assassination because as you are aware, there is no federal jurisdiction for such an investigation. It is not a Federal crime to kill or attack the President or Vice President or any of the continuity of officers who would succeed to the presidency.</p>\n<p id=\"AQB8\">Appellant has argued on brief that the FBI materials could not have been compiled for law enforcement purposes since, in 1963 the State of Texas but not United States \u201chad jurisdiction over the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He thus contended that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>\u201centitled to the sought material as a matter of law and not as a matter of grace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">Clearly, in the day and time of it all, the President contemplated collaboration with Texas authorities by agents of the Secret Service and of the Federal Bureau of Investigation looking to the early apprehension and ultimately the conviction of whoever murdered President Kennedy. It was speedily developed that the rifle from which the assassin\u2019s bullets had been fired had been shipped to one Lee Harvey Oswald. The latter was placed under arrest and charged with the perpetration of the crime. Two days later, as an investigation of massive proportions got under way, Oswald, then in the custody of Dallas Police, was fatally shot by one Jack Ruby.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">Director Hoover further testified before the Warren Commission <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abr2\">However, the President has a right to request the Bureau to make special investigations, and in this instance he asked that this investigation be made. I immediately assigned a special force headed by the special agent in charge at Dallas, Texas, to initiate the investigation, and to get all details and facts concerning it, which we obtained, and then prepared a report which we submitted to the Attorney General for transmission to the President. [Hearings before the Warren Commission, Vol. 5, p. 98.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">To glean some understanding of the magnitude of the investigatory organization which was speedily activated, we may turn to the Foreword of the Warren Commission Report, xii, from which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-10\">The scope and detail of the investigative effort by the Federal and State agencies are suggested in part by statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service. Immediately after the assassination more than 80 additional FBI personnel were transferred to the Dallas office on a temporary basis to assist in the investigation. Beginning November 22, 1963, the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted approximately 25,000 interviews and reinterviews of persons having information of possible relevance to the investigation and by September 11, 1964, submitted over 2,300 reports totaling approximately 25,400 pages to the Commission. During the same period the Secret Service conducted approximately 1,550 interviews and submitted 800 reports totaling some 4,600 pages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1280-11\">We deem it demonstrated beyond peradventure that the Department\u2019s files: (1) were investigatory in nature; and (2) were compiled for law enforcement purposes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When that much shall have been established, as is so clearly the situation on this record, and the district judge shall so determine, such files are exempt from compelled disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-13\">While the statute speaks for itself in the respect under consideration, we may note that the legislative history additionally explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-14\">It is also necessary for the very operation of our Government to allow it to keep confidential certain material, such as the investigatory files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>In slightly different context to be sure, Judge Hays analyzed the Congressional purpose thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">If an agency\u2019s investigatory files were obtainable without limitation after the investigation was concluded, future law enforcement efforts by the agency could be seriously hindered. <em>The agency\u2019s investigatory techniques and procedures would he revealed. </em>The names of people who volunteered the information that had prompted the investigation initially or who contributed information during the course of the investigation would be disclosed. The possibility of sugh disclosure would tend severely to limit the agencies\u2019 possibilities for investigation and enforcement of the law since these agencies rely, to a large extent, on voluntary cooperation and on information from informants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\"> There can be no question that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 had as its principal purpose that there was to be disclosure to the public of the manner in which the Government conducts its business. Congress additionally was concerned with the dilemma in which the public finds itself when forced to \u201clitigate with agencies on the basis of secret laws or incomplete information.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have repeatedly made evident our appreciation of the principle that generally disclosure, and not withholding, of information is called for, especially where there is an adversarial posture presented as in Bristol-Myers Co. v. FTC, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 25, 424 F.2d 935, 938, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 824, 91 S.Ct. 46, 27 L.Ed.2d 52 (1970).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But the remedy appropriately provided in \u00a7 552(a)(3) is not available in every situation, and as we have previously noted, \u00a7 552(b) is explicit that \u00a7 552 does not apply to matters that are specifically exempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-14\">We are not here speaking of trade secrets, or personnel and medical files, or patent information or internal revenue returns, or yet other material which, by statute <em>(see, e. g., </em>41 CFR \u00a7 105-60.604, 1972), had been specifically exempted from disclosure. We are not treating of geological information or matter required by Executive order to be kept secret. We are not discussing any problem except that of compelled disclosure of Federal Bureau of Investigation investigatory files <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> compiled for law en-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>foreement purposes. Certainly the answer does not depend upon what this appellant desires to accomplish if access be afforded. The Court has told us that the Act does not \u201cby its terms, permit inquiry into particularized needs of the individual seeking the information.\u201d EPA v. Mink, 410 \u00da.S. at 86, 93 S.Ct. at 835. Against the background we have hereinbefore set out, we may appropriately turn, particularly as 'a frame of reference, to the correspondence between the appellant and the Department prior to the institution of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">This appellant, in his letter of May 16, 1970 attached as an exhibit to his complaint, submitted to-the Department of Justice the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">With regard to the spectrographie analysis, if you are not aware of it, not then having been in your present position, 1\u2019 think you should know that if it does not agree in the most minute detail with the interpretation put upon it by the Warren Commission, their Report is a fiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">Appellant then transmitted the Department\u2019s form entitled \u201cRequest For Access To Official Record Under 5 U.S. C. 552(a) and 28 CFR Part 16,\u201d describing the material set forth in our footnote 3, <em>swpra. A </em>further exhibit attached to the appellant\u2019s complaint discloses that the Department under date of June 12, 1970, wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\"><em>Spectrographie Analyses: </em>You have asked for access to the spectrographie analyses conducted on certain bullet evidence involved in the assassination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">I regret that I am unable to grant your request in that the work notes and raw analytical data on which the results of the spectrographie tests are based are part of the investigative files of the FBI and are specifically exempted from public disclosure as investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes. 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (7). The results of the spectrographic tests are adequately shown in the report of the Warren Commission where (Volume 5, pages 67, 69, 73 and 74) it is specifically set forth that the metal fragments were analyzed spec-trographically and found to be similar in composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-11\">Our problem thus stems from what follows under the Freedom of Information Act after the Attorney General\u2019s exercise of the decisional process devolving upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-13\">The Department of Justice, headed by the Attorney General, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 503, includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 531. The Attorney General is directly charged under 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 534 with the duty to acquire, collect, classify and preserve identification, criminal identification, crime and other records, and to exchange such records with and for the official use of authorized officials, not only of the federal government, but of the States and cities. So it was that the Bureau collaborated with the Dallas police.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>Further appreciation of the daily activity of the Bureau may be seen in its annual report for 1972. The FBI had developed more than 345,000 items of criminal intelligence which had been disseminated to other Federal, state and local agencies engaged in law enforcement. More than 495,000 examinations of evidence had been conducted by the FBI laboratory to be submitted to law enforcement agencies. Organized crime investigations had ranged throughout the nation. Discretion respecting disclosure of the records in such matters devolved upon the Attorney General by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 534. Moreover, under subsection (b) thereof, the exchange of records so gathered may be \u201csubject to cancellation if dissemination is made outside the receiving departments or related agencies,\u201d Congress provided. It may to some appear <em>unthinkable </em>that the criminal investigatory files of the Bureau of Investigation, compiled for law enforcement purposes, are to be thrown open to some \u201cperson\u201d as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(2) who asserts entitlement in reliance upon \u00a7 552(a)(3). Yet our appellant claims his \u201cright\u201d as a matter of law since in November, 1963, it was not a federal crime to kill a President. We need only surmise the consequences to law enforcement if any \u201cperson,\u201d knowing full well that an investigation has been conducted, can ask some federal court to compel disclosure of the Bureau\u2019s files.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">Obviously, the statutory scheme of organization, as above referred to, calls for the exercise of discretion <em>by </em>the Attorney General respecting execution of the duties devolving upon him, and through him, upon the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We have no doubt whatever that Congress was fully alive to the problem where investigatory files of the FBI were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\"> Congress knows full well that in the first instance an Attorney General in myriad situations must exercise the discretion conferred upon him by law. He must evaluate the evidence necessary to an informed judgment. He must decide whether to prosecute or not. He must decide whom to prosecute. He must decide when to prosecute. Functions in this area belong to the Executive under the Constitution, Article II, Sections 1 and 3, and, as here, specifically to the Attorney General under 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 509. Consider problems such as we find were assessed in Pugach v. Klein, 193 F.Supp. 630, 634-635 (S.D. N.Y.1961), and Moses v. Kennedy, 219 F.Supp. 762, 765 (1963), aff\u2019d sub nom., Moses v. Katzenbach, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 352, 342 F.2d 931 (1965). As Judge Wright there said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-10\">.\u2022 . an investigation as to the adequacy or the execution of these laws is not a matter within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch of this Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1283-12\">And <em>see </em>Newman v. United States, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 263, 265, 382 F.2d 479, 481 (opinion by present Chief Justice Burger, 1967). The Attorney General\u2019s prosecutorial discretion is broad, indeed, and ordinarily at least, is not subject to judicial review. Inmates of Attica Correctional Facility v. Rockefeller, 477 F.2d 375, 380 (2 Cir. 1973); Powell v. Katzenbach, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 250, 359 F.2d 234 (D.C.Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 906, 86 S.Ct. 1341, 16 L.Ed.2d 349, (1966); Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462, 467-469, 71 S.Ct. 416, 95 L.Ed. 417 (1951); cf. Adams v. Richardson, 156 U.S.App.D.C. 267, 480 F.2d 1159 (en banc, June 12, 1973); but we suggested that immunity respecting the exercise of discretion may well be unavailable were the Department to be under investigation by a court or grand jury when fraud or corruption might be involved, Committee for Nuclear Responsibility, Inc. v. Seaborg, 149 U.S.App.D.C. 385, 391, 463 F.2d 788, 794 (1971). But this much is certain, (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 as part of Pub.L. 89-554, 80 Stat. 379), the At<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>torney General, like the heads of other Executive <em>departments,, </em>was authorized to refuse disclosure under Exemption 7 if he could determine as here that the issue involved investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">Congress surely realized that disclosure was not to be required in certain prescribed classifications. For example, section 552(b) provided that the section as a whole was not to apply to matters that are (3) \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute.\u201d <em>See, </em>as illustrative, the statutes identified in 41 CFR \u00a7 105-60.604 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">Again, section 552(b)(1) exempted from disclosure matters \u201cspecifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy.\u201d That very language gave rise to an issue which this court first considered, followed by the Supreme Court\u2019s definitive pronouncements as to the steps to be taken respecting disclosure of materials coming within section 552(b)(5). Ruling that we misapplied that section,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Court reversed, EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973), observing at 82, 93 S.Ct. at 833 after a review of the legislative history,</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">Rather than some vague standard, the test was to be simply whether the President has determined by executive, order that particular documents are to be kept secret. The language of the Act itself is sufficiently clear in this respect, but the legislative history disposes of any possible argument that Congress intended the Freedom of Information Act to subject executive security classifications to judicial review at the insistence of anyone who might seek to question them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">Lest there be any doubt as to the Supreme Court\u2019s teaching respecting Exemption (b)(1), its opinion, 410 U.S. at 84, 93 S.Ct. at 834, emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-12\">What has been said thus far makes wholly untenable any claim that the Act intended to subject the soundness of executive security classifications to judicial review at the insistence of \u2022 any objecting citizen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1284-13\">There was to be no room for challenge, no \u201cbalancing\u201d function, no <em>in camera </em>inspection. Rather, upon the basis of the \u201cshowing and in such circumstances, petitioners had met their burden of demonstrating that the documents were entitled to protection under Exemption 1, and the duty of the District Court under \u00a7 552(a)(3) was therefore at an end.\u201d EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. at 84, 93 S.Ct. at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-14\">In that very case, strikingly different treatment was prescribed even as to executive materials claimed to be immune from disclosure under Exemption 5. EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. at 85 et seq., 93 S.Ct. 827. The applicability of Exemption 7 no less will turn ultimately upon a determination by the district court<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that disclosure is not required \u2014 as in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-15\">Granted that the Attorney General may designate certain investigatory files as having been compiled for law enforcement purposes, his <em>ipse dixit </em>does not finalize the matter, for there remains the judicial function of determining whether that classification be proper. Where the district court can conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s designation and classification are correct, the Freedom of Information Act requires no more. Here the record overwhelmingly demonstrates how and under what circumstances the files were compiled and that indeed they were \u201cinvestigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d When the District Judge made that determination, he correctly perceived that his duty in achieving the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>of Congress under the Freedom of Information Act was at an end.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">Thus he ruled that there was no claim upon which relief could be granted, that there was no issue as to any material fact, and that the Department was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The action was thereupon dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1278-14\">. The appellant\u2019s complaint in paragraph 6 had alleged that after the assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had spectrographically analyzed and compared the following items:</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-26\">a) the bullet found on the stretcher of either President Kennedy or Governor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>John Connally of Texas (Identified as Exhibit 399 of the President\u2019s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, hereafter referred to as the Warren Commission) ;</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-10\">b) bullet fragment from front seat cushion of the President\u2019s limousine ;</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-11\">c) bullet fragment from beside front seat;</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">d) metal fragments from the President\u2019s head;</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-13\">1 e) metal fragment from the arm of Governor Connally;</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-14\">f) three metal fragments recovered from rear floor board carpet of limousine ;</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-15\">g) metal scrapings from inside surface of windshield of limousine ; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-16\">h) metal scrapings from curb in Dealey Plaza which was struck by bullet or fragment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1279-17\">.

Mink,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Justice White, writing for a majority of the Court, reviewed the legislative history of one section of the Freedom of Information Act, that which exempts from disclosure \u201cmatters that are (1) specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the basis of the legislative history and the explicit statutory language, the majority concluded that \u201cCongress chose to follow the Executive\u2019s determinations in these matters Rather than follow some vague standard, the test was to be simply whether the President has determined by Executive Order that particular documents are to be kept secret.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-11\">In this case, appellant Weisberg seeks the following information:</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-12\">Spectrographic analysis of bullet, fragments of bullet and other objects, including garments and part of vehicle and curbstone said to have been struck by bullet and/or fragments during assassination of President Kennedy and wounding of Governor Connally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>In response to Weisberg\u2019s request for this information, the Justice Department stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-4\">. that the work notes and raw analytical data on which the results of the spectrographic tests are based are part of the investigative files of the FBI and are specifically exempted from public disclosures as investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes. 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7). The results of the spectrographic tests are adequately shown in the report of the Warren Commission where (Volume 5, pages 67, 69, 73 and 74) it is specifically set forth that the metal fragments were analyzed spectrographi-eally and found to be similar in composition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">Thus, we deal in this case, not with Section . 552(b) (1), but with Section 552(b)(7). The latter provision exempts from disclosure \u201cmatters that are investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes except to the extent available by law to a party other than an agency.\u201d I have no doubt that, as Judge Danaher\u2019s majority opinion concludes, the information sought in this case is lodged in a file originally compiled for law enforcement purposes. I cannot, however, agree with the majority that this fact automatically brings the information within the ambit of Section 552(b)(7). There remains the question whether such information is to be considered as resting solely within an \u201cinvestigative file\u201d when the results of the spectrographic tests have been made public in the Warren Commission report and when there is no indication that the Government contemplates use of the information for law enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">The reasons that support my position are fully stated in Judge Frank Kaufman\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> majority opinion for the panel that originally heard this case, an opinion in which I concurred and which was withdrawn when the case was ordered to be reheard <em>en banc. </em>I set forth here the central part of Judge Kaufman\u2019s opinion: <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-11\">In Bristol-Myers Company v.

Nor is Weisberg the subject of any investigation. He simply asks for information which he alleges he is entitled to have made available to him under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3). The language of Section 552, supported abundantly by the legislative history of the Freedom of Information Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> places the burden on the Government to show, why non-revelation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>should be permitted, and requires that exemptions from disclosure be narrowly construed and that ambiguities be resolved in favor of disclosure. <em>See generally </em>Getman v.

The Court below granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, not its motion for summary judgment. Thus, it seemingly accorded no weight to the affidavit of Agent Williams.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But even if that affidavit is given full consideration, it is a document which is most general and conclusory and which in no way explains <em>how </em>the disclosure of the records sought is likely to reveal the identity of confidential informants, or to subject persons to blackmail, or to disclose the names of criminal suspects, or in any other way to hinder F.B.I. efficiency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The conclusion that the disclosure Weisberg seeks will cause any of those harms is neither compelled nor readily apparent, and therefore does not satisfy the Department\u2019s burden of proving under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7), as the Department must, some basis for fearing such harm.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Neither the F.B.I. nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>any other governmental agency can shoulder that burden by simply stating as a matter of fact that it has so done, or by simply labelling as investigatory a file which it neither intends to use, nor contemplates making use of, in the future for law enforcement purposes, at least not without establishing the nature of some harm which is likely to result from public disclosure of the file. Something more than mere edict or labelling is required if the Freedom of Information Act is to accomplish its \u201cprimary purpose, i. e., \u2018to increase the citizen\u2019s access to government records.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">The above was, of course, written in the context of the facts of this case. In most cases perhaps, the Government may satisfy its burden of proof simply by establishing that the information sought was compiled for investigatory purposes and rests in an investigatory file, none of the contents of which have ever been made public. But that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-9\">I continue to agree with Judge Kaufman that the purpose of the Act should not be defeated if there is available a judicial technique for advancing it and at the same time ensuring that no harm comes to the interests Congress intended to protect. <em>In camera </em>inspection, as required by the remand order of the withdrawn opinion, is such a technique. The fact that, in <em>Mink, </em>the Supreme Court determined that the language and legislative history of the Section (b)(1) exemption did not permit the use of <em>in camera </em>inspection does not mean that the technique is unsuitable in every case involving the Section (b) (7) exemption.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, its use seems most suitable in this case.
