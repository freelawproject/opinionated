In fixing the allotments to be made under Section 205, the President observed that, \u201c[T]hese amounts will provide for improving water quality and yet give proper recognition to competing national priorities for our tax dollars, the resources now available for this program and the projected condition of the Federal treasury under existing tax laws and the statutory limit on the national debt \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">The plaintiff brought this action for both declaratory and injunctive relief in connection with the administration of the Act. By way of declaratory relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>it asked judgment that \u201c(a) the defendant [Administrator] lacks the discretion to refuse to allot among the states the full sums authorized by Congress; or, alternatively, (b) the defendant abused whatever limited discretion he possesses by withholding a greater amount of funds than contemplated by the Congress under the Act.\u201d It, also, requested injunctive relief, \u201cdirecting the defendant to allot among the states the full sums of $5 billion and $6 billion authorized to be appropriated by section 207 of the Act for fiscal years 1973 and 1974.\u201d Without answering, the defendant Administrator moved to dismiss on the grounds \u201cthat the Court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of this suit and that the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d At the same time, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment \u201con the grounds that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that, * * * plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d After a hearing, the District Court denied the motion of the defendant to dismiss and granted in part the motion of the plaintiff for summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> From that decision, the defendant Administrator appeals. We remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-15\">The defendant Administrator at the outset raised a number of procedural barriers to the maintenance of this action. He put in issue the standing of the plaintiff to maintain this action, the jus-ticiability of the issues, the prematureness of the proceedings, and finally, the bar of sovereign immunity. These claims were carefully considered in the thoughtful opinion of the District Court and were found meritless. For the reasons assigned by the District Court and for the reasons hereafter developed, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">Turning to the substantive controversy: The plaintiff concedes the Congress intended to give the executive certain discretion in making allotments under Section 205; the defendant Administrator asserts the existence of such discretion; and the District Court found that there was such discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The exis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>tence of discretion, therefore, is not in issue on this appeal. The point of controversy is the extent of that discretion and the power of the Court to review. The plaintiff, in the District Court, contended that the discretion granted by Congress to the Administrator was not \u201cunbridled\u201d; that specifically it was not broad enough \u201cto give the Administrator the discretion to gut the Act.\u201d In developing this contention, it emphasized the purposes and goals of the Act and argued that the Administrator\u2019s discretion may not be exercised in a manner and to an extent that the purposes of the Act are frustrated and nullified and that Courts have both the power and the duty to prevent such nullification. The defendant, on the other hand, took the position that, while the Administrator had not by his limited allotments frustrated the legislative purposes reflected in the Act, he has absolute discretion in making such allotments, and that his exercise of discretion is immune from judicial review. In resolving these conflicting positions, the District Court found that, on its face, an \u201cimpoundment policy,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by which 55% of the allocated funds will be withheld, is a violation of the spirit, intent and letter of the Act and a flagrant abuse of executive discretion.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It found authority to declare judgment \u201cthat that policy is null and void\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Though it thus found the allotments as fixed by the Administrator invalid, it denied injunctive relief on the ground the Court was not equipped to \u201csupervise the Administrator in the administration of the Act\u201d, partially because of \u201cthe expert discretion designed for the appropriations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>stage.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And, finally, it limited the application of its judgment \u201cto those interests in Virginia represented by the plaintiff organization.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">As we have already stated, the right of the defendant to exercise discretion in making the allotment under Section 205 is not challenged by this appeal: that right is conceded. We are not concerned with the question whether an appropriation, either by its very nature<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or under the terms of the Antideficiency Act,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> even in the absence of any expressed grant of executive discretion in its use, involves some element of discretion in the executive. We are dealing here with a legislative provision which it has been held (and from this holding there is no appeal) does vest the executive with discretion. In short, the issues on this appeal are whether, accepting the holding that there was discretion in this case, its exercise is judicially reviewable, and, if reviewable, what standards or criteria are to be used in assessing the validity of its exercise. Those are the only issues posed by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">It is the defendant\u2019s position that, by conceding executive discretion in the fixing of the allotments under Section 205, the plaintiff has admitted a want of judicial power to review his exercise of that discretion. He rests this argument upon Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which provides that administrative action, the exercise of which is \u201ccommitted to agency discretion\u201d is not judicially reviewable. <em>Cf., </em>Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, 1970 Supp., \u00a7 28.16, p. 964. What the defendant urges is similar to the administrator\u2019s argument in Overseas Media Corporation v. McNamara (1967) 128 U.S.App.D.C. 48, 385 F.2d 308, 316, n. 14, <em>i. e., </em>that we should \u201cadopt the view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>that the [legislative] act of committing a matter to an agency\u2019s discretion forecloses court consideration of an alleged abuse of that discretion\u201d under any circumstances. To that argument, the Court in <em>Overseas </em>replied firmly, \u201cThe Legislative History of the Administrative Procedure Act belies this position.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And this conclusion in <em>Overseas </em>was confirmed in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe (1971) 401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed. 2d 136, where, speaking of this exception, the Court characterized it as \u201ca very narrow exception\u201d, whose application, according to \u201cThe legislative history of the Administrative Procedure Act\u201d is limited to \u201cthose rare instances where \u2018statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.\u2019 \u201d In resolving whether the matter falls within that \u201crare\u201d instance in which the executive action is non-reviewable, the problem is \u201cthat of determining when the agency action is \u2018committed to agency discretion\u2019 within the meaning of section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and when it merely \u2018involves\u2019 discretion which is nevertheless reviewable.\u201d Ferry v. Udall (9th Cir. 1964) 336 F.2d 706, 711, cert. denied 381 U.S. 904, 85 S.Ct. 1449, 14 L.Ed.2d 286. Unquestionably, whether an agency, in exercising its asserted discretionary power under a legislative authorization, is acting in a manner consistent with the legislative purpose and with proper regard for the constitutional principle of separation of powers between the executive and legislative is an issue that Section 10 did not intend to make non-reviewable; it patently is not an issue \u201ccommitted to agency discretion\u201d. <em>See, </em>Note, Protecting the Fisc: Executive Impoundment and Congressional Power, 82 Yale L.J. 1636, at p. 1647; DeVito v. Shultz (D.C.D.C.1969) 300 F.Supp. 381, 383; Hamel v. Nelson (D.C.Cal.1963) 226 F.Supp. 96, 98. The power to spend rests primarily with Congress under the Constitution;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the executive, on the other hand, has the constitutional duty to execute the law in accordance with the legislative purpose so expressed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> When the executive exercises its responsibility under appropriation legislation in such a manner as to frustrate the Congressional purpose, either by absolute refusal to spend or by a withholding of so substantial an amount of the appropriation as to make impossible the attainment of the legislative goals,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the executive trespasses beyond the range of its legal discretion and presents an issue of constitutional dimensions which is obviously open to judicial review. And it was this issue and this issue alone to which the District Court carefully restricted itself in this case. It specifically denied any power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>on its part to review or supervise the defendant\u2019s discretion so far as it was exercised in a manner that was not so arbitrary or drastic as to represent a nullification of legislative purpose.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We agree generally with this construction of its power by the District Court.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Our only difficulty with the decision of the District Court relates to its conclusion on the issue of arbitrary frustration of legislative policy by the executive action taken. The District Court found that an allotment under Section 205 in the amount of 45% of the authorization under Section 207, established such a drastic and arbitrary administrative reduction in the contract authorization as, on its face, without any other evidentiary support, to require a finding of executive nullification of the purposes of the Act. With this factual finding, we are unable to agree. The statement of the President must be read in conjunction with the explanation given by the Administrator both in his presentation to this Court and in his Congressional appearances, for his allotments as made. In his presentation to this Court, the Administrator has disclaimed any purpose of evading the responsibilities given him under the Act. In his appearance before the Senate <em>ad hoc </em>Subcommittee on Impoundment of Funds on February 6, 1973,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> where he defended the allotments made for the years in question here, he forcefully expressed his commitment to the goals intended by the Act<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and affirmed that the reductions in the contract authorizations, as represented by the allotments made by him under Section 205 for fiscal years 1973 and 1974, were arrived at on the basis of an administrative judgment that greater authorizations could not be spent \u201cin a wise or expeditious manner\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in achieving such goals during those years. This judgment was based, in turn, he testified, on a conclusion that \u201cthere was not sufficient technical capacity, technical capability, I think it was, or contractual capacity\u201d to carry out a greater or more extensive program.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In reaching that conclusion, he had taken note, according to his testimony, that there were already available other contract authorizations for the same purposes as that authorized under the Act, which, when added to the authorizations actually allotted by the Administrator, meant that \u201cthere was $7.25 billion released on the 27th of November [1973] to be spent over the next 18 months\u201d in meeting the goals of the program.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He argued that to attempt a more rapid rate of spending would inordinately inflate the cost of the program without appreciably accelerating the attainment of its goals. He pointed out in partial confirmation of this opinion that \u201cthe construction industry has inflated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the cost of the building of the project at the rate of 120 percent\u201d, while at the same time \u201cthe cost of living has gone up at the rate of 40 percent.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The Administrator, also, asserted in his brief, without contradiction by the plaintiff, that as of August 31, 1973, all of the States had utilized but 73 percent of their 1973 allotments and 8 percent of their 1974 allotments. There is no way for us at this juncture to venture an opinion whether the Administrator had been \u201cdragging his feet\u201d in approving projects or whether these figures indicate that the allotments made represented reasonable go\u00e1ls for the two fiscal years in controversy. The experience in the use of the allotments so far in fiscal 1973 and 1974 is, though, a matter that might well be considered in determining whether the Administrator, in exercising his discretion under Section 205, acted so arbitrarily as to frustrate the attainment of the legislative goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Moreover, it must not be overlooked that the Administrator claims the power to increase allotments during a fiscal year and has declared in this Court that, should it appear that the allotments made for fiscal years 1973 and 1974 are not sufficient to support the applications made and qualifying under the standards established, he will give consideration to making additional allotments out of the maximum authorizations provided by Section 207.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Act itself grants contract authorizations for the fiscal years 1973-1974-1975 in the overall amount of $18 billion. It provides for reallotment of unused allotments. The defendant asserts that, considered as a whole, the Act gives the defendant the power to add to allotments for any fiscal year, within, of course, the legislative m\u00e1ximums, as the need demonstrates. Because he claims there has been no denial of any qualified project in either fiscal year 1973 or fiscal year 1974, there is no demonstrable need for an increase in the allotments heretofore made. Moreover, he avers without contradiction by the plaintiff that no qualified project for the Commonwealth of Virginia has been denied contract authorization during fiscal 1973 or 1974. He goes further and asserts that if there are qualifying projects from Virginia in the fiscal years in question that exceed the allotments already made, the plaintiff has suffered no prejudice or injury unless he [the Administrator] refuses to make additional allotments to cover qualifying projects in Virginia in the two fiscal years in question. It is true, as the plaintiff argues, that Section 205 declares that allotments are to be made no \u201clater than the January 1st immediately preceding the beginning of the fiscal year for which authorized\u201d but the defendant presses the point that this provision simply establishes a date for initial allotments and was not intended and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>does not represent a restriction on the defendant\u2019s right, if the need develops, to add to or to increase the allotments as initially made.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Whether this construction is sound \u2014 and we are strongly persuaded that it is \u2014 it would seem unlikely that any party would have standing successfully to challenge any increase made by the Administrator in the initial allotment. In any event, this is an issue that should be given consideration in determining whether the action of the Administrator was arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">These observations do not establish that the District Court\u2019s conclusion was incorrect; they do indicate, though, that the issue in controversy here is not one to be resolved by any <em>per se </em>rule but is one that requires inquiry into the basis for the Administrator\u2019s action. After all, there is a presumption of legality that attaches ordinarily to an administrator\u2019s action and the burden of establishing impropriety rests on him who challenges. Even if the District Court had concluded, as some other courts have, that the Administrator was without discretion in making allotments under Section 205, he would still have been empowered under the terms of the Anti-deficiency Act \u201cto withhold funds for reasons of efficiency and economy\u201d; and, if the plaintiff wished to challenge an impounding of funds made under the authorization of the Antideficiency Act, it would have had the burden of showing \u201cthat the impoundment was in fact not warranted by efficiencies or other new developments\u201d, and <em>pari passu, </em>it would seem to follow that \u201ca plaintiff challenging an assertion that the executive has discretion to impound under a particular spending bill must show that the discretion granted was less than that claimed\u201d. Note, Impoundment of Funds, 86 Harv.L.Rev. 1505, 1529 (1973). Beyond the bare assumption that an expenditure of approximately half the authorized appropriation establishes a frustration of legislative purpose the plaintiff has done nothing to satisfy its burden. Such an assumption, in the face of other circumstances to which we have adverted, and recognizing that the District Court has found at least some discretion in the Administrator to fix the allotment, is insufficient to support the conclusion reached by the District Court that the allotments made were \u201ca violation of the spirit, intent and letter of the Act and a flagrant abuse of executive discretion\u201d, or involved a use of irrelevant factors in arriving at his action. That issue should not have been resolved on the pleadings but a record should have been made that would support the conclusion reached by the District Court.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We accordingly remand to the District Court for further proceedings in order to determine, on the basis of such evidence as may be submitted by the parties, whether as a fact the amount of allotments made by the Administrator under Section 205 were \u201ca violation of the spirit, intent and letter of the Act and a flagrant abuse of executive discretion\u201d, or involved irrelevant or improper standards in fixing such amount. In connection with that inquiry, it will be appropriate for the District Court to consider whether the factors used by the defendant in fixing the allotments were the ones that were \u201crelevant\u201d under a proper construction of the discretionary power found to exist in the executive.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-12\">.

The statutes involved in this action concern not direct appropriations but what has often been described as \u201cobligational authority\u201d. The Office of Management and Budget, in its listing of appropriated funds withheld from disbursement, omitted those represented by \u201cobligational authority\u201d. <em>See, New York Times, </em>Feb. 6, 1973, at 1, col. 1 (city ed.). In principle, however, the difference between the two is unimportant, so far as the issues in this jjroeeeding are concerned. As one commentator has aptly remarked, \u201cAppropriations are passed in various forms, and permit actual expenditures as well as the incurring of obligations. However, there is another species\u2019 of financial authority, the contract authorization [also termed obliga-tional authority), which empowers the governmental unit only to incur obligations. Under such contract authority power, the agency will have to later request an appropriation to liquidate the obligations it has incurred.\u201d Note, The Likely Law of Executive Impoundment, 59 Iowa L.Rev. 50, 54 (1973). There is thus no reason to treat the two forms of authorizations other than as appropriations and to adjudge the right of the executive to withhold the same in both instances. <em>See, </em>Note, Impoundment of Funds, 86 Harv.L.Rev. 1505, 1506, n. 2 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\">.

Thus the plaintiff in its brief, states the issues on appeal to be \u201cwhether, in passing the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, Congress intended to give the President boundless discretion to withhold funding under the Act, or whether, as plaintiffs contend and the district court held, the discretion granted the Executive is limited and was grossly exceeded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">While a number of courts have found a want of discretion in the Administrator in \u2022 fixing the authorized allotments, the commentators on the Act are not as definite in their opinions. <em>See, </em>for instance, Note, The Likely Law of Impoundment, 59 Iowa L.Rev. 50, 55, n. 42 (1973) and Note, Impoundment, 86 Harv.L.Rev. 1505, 1526, n. 116; but <em>of., </em>Note, Protecting the Fisc: Executive Im-poundment and Congressional Power, 82 Yale L.J. 1636, 1952. The issue of discretion, it is conceded by one of the commentators is plainly \u201carguable\u201d, something that cannot be said, it suggests, with reference to the appropriation made in support of the Federal Aid Highway Act, Section 101--44, 23 U.S.C., involved in State Highway Commission v. Volpe (8th Cir. 1973) 479 F.2d 1099, 50 Iowa L.Rev. at p. 55. In fact, Congress made it as plain as it could in the Highway Act that it intended to confer no right of impoundment on the executive. <em>(See </em>Page 1111, 479 F.2d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-19\">Ralph Nader, in his testimony before the Senate Ad Hoc Committee on Impoundments (hereafter referred to as Impoundment Hearings) ranged himself with those who found discretion in the executive in executing Section 205. He testified in this connection :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-20\">\u201cGranted, the legislative history of these 1972 amendments suggests that Congress may have intended to grant the President limited discretion in controlling the level of obligations. However, the decisive overriding of the veto indicated a clear congressional mandate to have sufficient funds immediately available for obligation to meet the timetable for water quality goals which the act established.\u201d (at 34)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqp-dedup-0\">For a thoughtful statement of reasons for discretionary spending authority in the executive, <em>see </em>Fisher, Presidential Spending Discretion and Congressional Controls, appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ing in the Winter, 1972, issue of Law and Contemporary Problems and quoted in Im-poundment Hearings, at 719:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201cThe reform advocate is therefore advised to regard executive spending discretion as an essential, ineradicable feature of the budget process. Expenditures deviate from appropriations for a number of reasons. Appropriations are made many months, and sometimes years, in advance of expenditures. Congress acts with imperfect knowledge in trying to legislate in fields that are highly technical and constantly undergoing change. New circumstances will develop to make obsolete and mistaken the decisions reached by Congress at the appropriation stage. It is not practicable for Congress to adjust to these new developments by passing large numbers of supplemental appropriation bills. Were Congress to control expenditures by confining administrators to narrow statutory details it would perhaps protect its power of the purse but it would not protect the purse itself. Discretion is needed for the sound management of public funds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">But, <em>cf., </em>the comment of the editor in 82 Yale L.

The editor in one recent Note would define it \u201cas the executive practice of withholding appropriated funds or obligational authority, beyond the bounds of any statutorily conferred discretion.\u201d Note, 59 Iowa L.Rev. 50, 56 (1973). Similarly, Professor Miller defines it as \u201cdeliberate attempts to scuttle projects authorized by Congress, but disliked by the Executive.\u201d Impoundment Hearings, at 752. This would limit the application of the term to those acts of the Executive which represent an illegal withholding of appropriated funds. Other authorities use the term to identify any executive withholding of appropriated funds and make no effort to engage in the \u201csemantic\u201d game. Thus, in the Note, Im-poundment of Funds, 86 Harv.L.Rev. 1505, n. 1, impoundment is defined as a \u201crefusal by the executive, for whatever reason, to spend funds made available by Congress.\u201d Another writer uses similar language, stating that, \u201cIn its broadest context, impoundment occurs whenever the President spends less than Congress appropriates for a given period.\u201d Fisher, Funds Impounded by the President: The Constitutional Issue, 38 Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 124 (1969). This would seem the more sensible definition. Under this definition, any withholding would be an impoundment and whether such impoundment was permissible would depend on the legislative intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b578-12\">. 361 F.Supp. at 700.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b578-13\">. 361 F.Supp. at 700.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b579-6\">. 361 F.Supp at 700.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\">. 361 F.Supp. at 701.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\">. It has been sometimes stated that an appropriation is <em>\u201cpermissive </em>rather than <em>mandatory\u201d, </em>by which the author states \u201cit is meant that the Executive Branch is <em>auth-rized </em>but not <em>required </em>to spend funds up to a given amount for designated purposes.\u201d (Italics in text.) Miller, Presidential Power to Impound Appropriated Funds: An Exercise in Constitutional Decision-Making, 42 N.C.L.Rev. 502, 511 (1965). In somewhat similar vein, Professor Corwin summed the matter up with the statement that the Constitution \u201cassumes any expenditure is primarily an executive function, and conversely that the participation of the legislative branch is essentially for the purpose simply of setting bounds to executive discretion \u2014 a theory confirmed by early practice under the Constitution.\u201d Corwin, The President: Office and Powers, 127-8 (4 ed. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\"><em>See, also, </em>McKay v.

This section authorizes the executive to withhold funds \u201cto provide for contingencies, or to effect savings whenever <em>savings </em>are made possible by or through changes in requirements, greater efficiency of operations, or <em>other developments </em>subsequent to the date on which such appropriation was made available\u201d (Italics added, 665(e)(2).) Two constructions of the terms \u201csavings\u201d and \u201cother develop<em>ments\u201d </em>have been advanced. Under a narrow view, these terms relate to \u201cdevelopments within the individual programs involved, and that impoundment is only permissible to the extent that it does not interfere with achieving the underlying purposes of the program involved.\u201d Note, Impoundment, 86 Harv.L.Rev. at p. 1517 (1973). \u201cAccording to a more expansive view, however, \u2018other developments\u2019 should refer to any subsequent development, whether or not uniquely program related, which would, in the administrator\u2019s mind, call for the making of savings through reduced program expenditure. A determination that a subsequent situation of inflation justified program reduction or termination in order to cut government spending would fit into this category.\u201d Note, The Likely Law of Exeetuive Impoundment, 59 Iowa L.Rev. 50, 67 (1973).

The claimed basis for the exercise of such power is stated by the Department of Justice in its reply to certain questions propounded by the Chairman in the Impoundment Hearings, pp. 837-8. it is not clear whether this issue is present here. It is possible to interpret the testimony of the Administrator as indicating that it was the unique, inflationary forces prevalent at the moment in that part of the construction industry involved in sewage plant development which were considered by him. Actually, however, the general objection to impoundment on the part of the Congress seems to be directed at the re-ordering of priorities as a result of impoundment. Thus, the Chairman of the Subcommittee at the Im-poundment Hearings, Senator Erwin, after quoting from Mr. Fisher to the effect that, \u201cImpoundment is not being used to avoid deficiencies, or to effect savings, or even to fight inflation, but rather to shift the scale of priorities from one Administrator to the next, prior to Congressional action,\u201d said, \u201cThat is our complaint.\u201d Impoundment Hearings, p. 277.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b582-10\">.
