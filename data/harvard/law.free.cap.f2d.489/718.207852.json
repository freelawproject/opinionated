We reverse and remand for trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">In 1965, John McPhee, Jr. was operating a sawmill for his employer, Erickson Hardwoods, Inc., of Onalaska, Wisconsin, when the log carriage unexpectedly moved and forced him into the saw blade, amputating both of his legs. Corinth Machinery Company, a Mississippi corporation domiciled in Corinth, Mississippi, had installed the sawmill pursuant to an agreement to replace portions of Erickson\u2019s existing sawmill. After receiving the results of an inspection of the existing mill by one of Corinth\u2019s sales representatives, Corinth\u2019s chief engineer determined that the appropriate carriage drive for Erickson\u2019s operation was a unit manufactured by the appel-lee, Oliver Tyrone Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation with its main office in Corinth, Mississippi. The required carriage drive was then purchased from Tyrone and was delivered to Corinth in Corinth, Mississippi, as a packaged unit with a control lever mounted directly on the side of the unit. The control lever, as manufactured and sold by Tyrone, did not contain a locking device to prevent unintentional movement of the carriage drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Upon receipt of the unit, Corinth\u2019s chief design engineer determined that a longer control lever for the carriage drive might be operated and controlled by the sawyer at a distance from the unit itself. The original control lever was removed and discarded, and Corinth manufactured a new control lever, which, like the original, did not incorporate a locking device. Corinth then mounted the carriage drive on its frame husk, and this complete assembly, along with other related items, was shipped to Erickson, which assembled the entire sawmill.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">McPhee and his wife, Wisconsin residents, brought a diversity action against Corinth and Tyrone in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin for damages sustained by them as a result of the aforementioned accident. They contended that the movement of the carriage which initiated the accident occurred without any action on McPhee\u2019s part and that this could have been prevented by incorporating a locking device into the control lever.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">The Wisconsin district court dismissed Tyrone for lack of jurisdiction over the person. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2). Pursuant to a special jury verdict, the MePhees were awarded judgments against Corinth in the total amount of $474,349.46, plus interest and costs. In response to a question submitted by the court, the jury found Corinth negligent in \u201cfailing to provide a locking device\u201d and in \u201cfailing to properly inspect and supervise the installation.\u201d The judgment was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">Corinth, unable to respond to the entire judgments, negotiated a settlement with the MePhees under which Corinth\u2019s liability carrier paid $100,000, the limits of its policy, and Corinth paid $100,000. As part of the agreement, Corinth also assigned and transferred to the MePhees such claim or claims as Corinth might have for indemnity or contribution against Tyrone.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">The MePhees, appellants here, then filed this diversity suit to recover $150,000 from Tyrone. Count I of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>complaint seeks indemnity on the theory that Corinth\u2019s negligence was \u201cpassive\u201d while Tyrone\u2019s was \u201cactive.\u201d This count recognizes the Mississippi doctrine that joint tort-feasors <em>in pari delicto </em>are not entitled to indemnity from each other. <em>See, e. g., </em>Smith Petroleum Serv., Inc. v. Monsanto Chem. Co., 5 Cir., 1970, 420 F.2d 1103, 1112; Home Ins. Co. v. Atlas Tank Mfg. Co., 230 So.2d 549 (Miss. 1970); Bush v. City of Laurel, 215 So. 2d 256 (Miss.1968). Count II of the complaint is based on the theories of breach of implied warranty and strict liability in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Affidavits in support of the summary judgment motion were filed in the district court by Tyrone's chief engineer and by Corinth\u2019s board chairman and chief design engineer; and affidavit in opposition to the motion was filed by appellants\u2019 counsel. The affidavits submitted in support of the motion included pictures and drawings of the unit involved in this suit; the affidavits in opposition contained exhibits and testimony excerpted from the evidence presented at the Wisconsin trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The district court granted Tyrone\u2019s motion for summary judgment. 353 F. Supp. 601. With respect to Count I, the court concluded as a matter of law that Corinth\u2019s negligence was active rather than passive, and that under Mississippi law there is no right of indemnity between two such equally culpable tort-fea-sors as Tyrone and the McPhees\u2019 assign- or, Corinth. The court also found that appellants could not recover under the theories of implied warranty or strict liability in tort. The court rejected their contention that there was an implied warranty to furnish a product suitable for the use intended because it was of the opinion that the omission of a locking device on the control lever was \u201cobvious and apparent to all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607. Consequently, under Mississippi law it saw no duty on the part of Tyrone, the manufacturer, to warn Corinth of this \u201cobvious defect.\u201d Id.; <em>see </em>Har-rist v. Spencer-Harris Tool Co., 244 Miss. 84, 140 So.2d 558, 562 (1962). Appellants\u2019 theory of strict liability in tort was rejected on the ground that a substantial change, the attachment of a new control lever, was made in the unit after its sale by Tyrone and before the unit reached the mill. <em>See </em>State Stove Mfg. Co. v. Hodges, 189 So.2d 113, 118 (Miss.1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 912, 87 S.Ct. 860, 17 L.Ed.2d 784 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Summary judgment should be granted only when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and when no genuine issue remains for trial, it being quite clear what the truth is. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Sartor v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., 321 U.S. 620, 64 S.Ct. 724, 728-729, 321 U.S. 620 (1944); Shahid v. Gulf Power Co., 5 Cir., 1961, 291 F.2d 422, 423-424. <em>See also </em>Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 65 S.Ct. 1416, 89 L.Ed. 2013 (1945); Eccles v. Peoples Bank, 333 U.S. 426, 68 S.Ct. 641, 92 L.Ed. 784 (1948). After careful examination of the record before us, we do not think these requirements were satisfied. As an appellate court, however, we are not called upon to decide factual issues, but only to determine whether there may be factual issues to be tried. Slagle v. United States, 5 Cir., 1956, 228 F.2d 673; National Screen Serv. Corp. v. Poster Exch., Inc., 5 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 647, 651. <em>See also </em>Palmer v. Chamberlin, 5 Cir., 1951, 191 F.2d 532, 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">In this case, there appear, at the least, to be genuine issues of fact with respect to: (1) whether Corinth\u2019s negligence was active or passive in relation to Tyrone\u2019s responsibility for the accident; (2) whether the omission of a locking device on the control lever constituted an obvious danger; (3) whether Corinth\u2019s attachment of a new control lever constituted a substantial change in the original unit. The district court\u2019s resolution of these issues on the basis of the materials before it was unwarranted. These materials, including evidence adduced at the Wisconsin trial and the jury\u2019s special verdict there, did not provide a sufficient basis on which to draw conclusions of fact and law in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The facts and cii\u2019cumstances of this lawsuit should be developed through the full inquiry of a trial before the district court below. Since the ultimate questions to be answered in this case are complex and are necessarily entwined with the interpretation of the facts, an explication of the facts before that court is necessary if it is to deal adequately with the applicable law. <em>See, e. g. </em>NLRB v. Smith Indus., Inc., 5 Cir., 1968, 403 F.2d 889, 893; Keating v. Jones Dev. of Missouri, Inc., 5 Cir., 1968, 398 F.2d 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
