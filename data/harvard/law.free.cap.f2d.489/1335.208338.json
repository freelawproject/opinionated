Schmidt, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Social Services of the State of Wisconsin, and his agents from restricting correspondence between Juan Morales and his wife\u2019s sister.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Morales\u2019s complaint, defendant-appellant Schmidt has general supervision over the rulemaking policies of the state prisons and is \u201cdirectly liable for the conduct and actions of his agents therein.\u201d At the time of the filing of the complaint, Morales was an inmate of the Wisconsin State Prison at Waupun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-18\">As an initial matter, we must dispose of a mootness question. Morales was convicted of having violated the Uniform Narcotics Drug Addiction Act and was sentenced to a term of not more than ten years. On March 27, 1972, before the district court entered its order in this case, Morales was released on parole. The petition of amicus curiae, Corrections Legal Services Program, suggests that the case is therefore moot. We agree with the appellant and appellee that we have before us a live controversy. The department which defendant Schmidt heads has responsibility for the entire correctional system of the State of Wisconsin, including the administration of parole and probation matters. Pursuant to the sentence imposed on Morales, Schmidt will have legal custody of the plaintiff, although a parolee, for six more years and has authority to impose restrictions upon him. In his response to the amicus curiae petition, Secretary Schmidt stated that he has refrained from preventing Morales from communicating with his sister-in-law solely because of the duty to comply with the district court\u2019s injunction. We further note that there is always the possibility that Morales during his period of parole will violate the terms of his conditional release and thus be returned to prison. In light of these circumstances, we find that the change in plaintiff\u2019s status does not alter the central issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-20\">The parties are in agreement about the facts. On November 28 or 29, 1970, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>Morales wrote a letter to his wife\u2019s sister, Kathleen Steffes, who was on the prison\u2019s list of approved correspondents. In the letter Morales mentioned that he was the father of a child by Steffes and stated that he hoped to continue his relationship with mother and son in the future. At the time the letter was written, the plaintiff\u2019s wife was apparently unaware of the relationship between her sister and Morales, including the fact that her husband had fathered Steffes\u2019s illegitimate child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">Prison administrators intercepted and read the letter and then routed it to Morales\u2019s prison social worker, who refused to mail it to Steffes. On December 22, 1970, he discussed with Morales the letter as well as Morales\u2019s continued correspondence with his sister-in-law. After consulting with prison officials, the social worker told Morales that Steffes was being placed on the list of denied correspondents-visitors and that she would be notified of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">Both Morales and Steffes were advised that the decision would be re-evaluated if they could provide additional information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">The prison administrators based their actions on their opinion that it would be inappropriate to permit Morales to correspond with a woman with whom he had had an illicit sexual relationship, particularly since they had reason to believe that he intended to continue the relationship upon his release from prison although he also intended to live with his wife and their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">Neither Morales nor Steffes made further efforts to justify to prison authorities their correspondence. In January 1971, Morales filed the present Section 1983 action, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, in the federal district court, alleging that, the prison officials\u2019 actions in refusing to allow the letter of November 28, 1970, to be sent to Kathleen Steffes and in refusing to permit him to correspond with her violated his rights under the First, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Condemning the administrators\u2019 actions as \u201carbitrary, capricious and unreasonable,\u201d he sought a permanent injunction against the defendant and his agents to bar them from depriving him of the use of the mails \u201cto communicate with [plaintiff\u2019s] relatives and family.\u201d Morales also alleged irreparable injury and moved for a temporary restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-10\">The district court entered an order directing the Secretary of Health and Social Services to show cause why the requested order should not be granted. The Secretary then moved for summary judgment upon affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-11\">On April 6, 1972, the court dismissed the motion for summary judgment and entered the preliminary injunction challenged here. In reaching its decision, the court reasoned as follows: (1) freedom to use the mails is a First Amendment freedom; (2) someone not convicted of a crime would be free to correspond with his wife\u2019s sister whether or not he had been sexually intimate with her; (3) the interest of a non-convict in corresponding by mail is a \u201cfundamental\u201d interest; (4) \u201cwhen the government undertakes to deny this freedom .to a member of the class of persons who have been convicted of crime, while granting it to members of a class of persons who have not been convicted of crime, the burden is upon the [State] to show a compelling governmental interest in this differential in treatment,\u201d 340 F.Supp. at 554-555; and (5) the Government\u2019s interests in the maintenance of internal prison discipline and in the rehabilitation of Morales are not so compelling as to permit their vindication by interference with a right secured to plaintiff by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-13\">The Constitution provides no clear answer to federal courts seeking to determine the civil rights of state prisoners. The variety of views expressed by the courts when resolving challenges by prisoners to the constitutionality of prison rules reflects the ambiguous mandate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>of the Bill of Rights and the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments when construed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">The Thirteenth Amendment, if read literally, suggests that the States may treat their prisoners as slaves: \u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, <em>except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, </em>shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, by emphasizing the applicability to state prisoners of the Fourteenth Amendment, which now incorporates most of the Bill of Rights including the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition -of \u201ccruel and unusual punishments,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> courts in recent years have moderated the harsh implications of the Thirteenth Amendment. But the tension remains between the view that a prisoner enjoys many constitutional rights, which rights can be limited only to the extent necessary for the maintenance of a person\u2019s status as prisoner (or parolee), and the view that a prisoner has only a few rudimentary rights and must accept whatever regulations and restrictions prison administrators and State law deem essential to a correctional system. Even the most \u201cliberal\u201d opinions acknowledge that although a convicted person is not a slave neither is he a \u201cfreeman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-13\">Thus, we agree with the district court that state prisoners\u2019 suits present exceedingly perplexing problems for the federal courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We must not shirk our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>duty to protect an individual\u2019s rights, yet we must respect the rights and interests of the States. In a symposium on prison reform and \u201cprisoners\u2019 rights,\u201d the Dean of the University of Virginia Law School articulated well the major questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">\u201cWhat is the proper function of the coui\u2019ts, the legislatures and executive? What are the limits of the wisdom and power of each? What must be left to administrators for determination? What are the opportunities of each of these institutions for information gathering, for enforcement, and for promulgation? . How much liberty is compatible with the order necessary in any kind of institutional confinement \u2014 a closed society- \u2014 where the principal concern of each inmate is to get out?</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">What are the programs which in fact change the character of human beings? . . . [W]hat kinds of things does the Constitution require [in a prison setting?]\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-14\">The Fourteenth Amendment states in part: \u201cnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d Morales does not maintain that his conviction and sentence were accomplished without due process. But this does not establish what liberties remained to him once he was found guilty according to law. The relatively few cases in which prisoners have contested prison officials\u2019 refusal to permit correspondence or visiting rights with specific persons are of limited aid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Factually closest is Fussa v. Taylor, 168 F.Supp. 302 (M.D.Pa.1958), where the court upheld the warden\u2019s decision. However, there the forbidden female correspondent was deeply involved in narcotics, was herself an inmate, and was but the most recent in a series of paramours the petitioner had had. In Corby v. Conboy, 457 F.2d 251 (2d Cir. 1972), decided after the Second Circuit\u2019s seminal opinion in Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972), a Second Circuit pan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>el held that the contention that prison administrators had violated the prisoner\u2019s civil rights by refusing to mail several letters to the petitioner\u2019s family because they contained prison news or constituted \u201cbegging\u201d adequately stated a claim under Section 1983. Another Second Circuit decision, Wilkinson v. Skinner; 462 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 1972), affirmed the dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s civil rights complaint because the issues raised therein had been mooted by amended regulations relating to censorship of prison correspondence. The new regulations, which allowed prison authorities to refuse to mail outgoing letters or to accept incoming mail \u201cwhere it is apparent that there exists a clear and present danger to the jail or penitentiary,\u201d provided a sufficiently precise delineation of the boundaries of the protection against censorship. Accordingly, the court concluded that \u201c[ajbsent a showing that appellant\u2019s correspondence with his mother . . . would pose a clear and present threat to prison discipline or security, presumably such correspondence will not be further interfered with by the appellees,\u201d 462 F.2d at 672-673.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">Unlike <em>Wilkinson, </em>our case does not involve a regulation that embodies a familiar legal standard. Pursuant to statutory authority, Wisconsin prison officials had promulgated correspondence rules, and defendant Schmidt on appeal states that his agents, in terminating correspondence between Morales and his sister-in-law, acted under them. (See Appendix to this opinion.) However, the regulations provided no standard comparable to the one approved in <em>Wilkinson. </em>Furthermore, the enabling legislation specifies no guidelines for the drafting of rules governing correspondence. The formulation of parole regulations apparently is also left to the discretion of correctional administrators. The district court therefore did not discuss particular written regulations but tackled directly the problem of determining the appropriate standard for testing whether the Constitution forbids a State to regulate the life of a convicted person in a certain manner. Its choice of standard was intertwined with its analysis of the constitutionality of a State\u2019s limiting communications by a person convicted of a crime under circumstances where the State could not so limit a non-convict\u2019s communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-8\">It is to this portion of the district court\u2019s, opinion, its adoption of the \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d standard, that appellant Schmidt takes greatest exception. Schmidt fears that if we. uphold the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>plicability of the test, few prison regulations will be able to withstand constitutional attack. Prisoners allegedly will contest every disciplinary measure, and prison administrators will be unable to command the adherence to rules which allows the correctional system to function smoothly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">The compelling state interest standard is one of several \u201ctests\u201d courts use to determine whether governmental curbs on a citizen\u2019s civil liberties are justifiable. See, <em>e. g., </em>Bates v. City of Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 524, 80 S.Ct. 412, 417, 4 L.Ed.2d 480 (1960). \u201cWhere there is a significant encroachment upon personal liberty, the State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest which is compelling.\u201d As the opinion of the district court below illustrates, how stringent a justification a State must offer depends in part, under current doctrine, on the nature of the right invaded. Courts commonly reserve the compelling state interest standard for impingements on sensitive areas of liberty, that is, interests of a citizen which courts deem \u201cfundamental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">Like many other judicial standards, \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d is not a precise concept. Some judges, for example, seem to equate it with the \u201cless drastic means\u201d test. Others, like Mr. Justice White, rephrase it as a curtailment \u201creasonably necessary for the effectuation of a legitimate and substantial state interest, and not arbitrary or capricious in application. . . .\u201d Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 502, 504, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 1692, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965) (White, J., concurring in the judgment finding Connecticut\u2019s statutory ban of contraceptives unconstitutional). <em>Cf. </em>Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 700-708, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">The district court in the case before us decided that correspondence by mail is a \u201cfundamental\u201d interest. <em>Cf. </em>Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 85 S.Ct. 1493, 14 L.Ed.2d 398 (1965), especially the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan, 381 U.S. at 308, 85 S.Ct. 1493. Hence, the district court concluded that the compelling state interest standard was the appropriate test for judging the constitutionality of governmental restrictions on correspondence by mail. The district court noted that the equal protection clause is clearly applicable to intra-prison classes. The court, however, then rejected the \u201cunar-ticulated but potent\u201d view that the equal protection clause has no applicability where the classes involved consist of prisoners and non-prisoners. The court adopted the thesis that those convicted of crime should continue \u201cto share with the general population the full latent protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d 340 F.Supp. at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-14\">In so holding, the district court did not condemn the establishment of the two classes as \u201cinherently suspect.\u201d Instead, it ruled that when a State seeks to restrain a fundamental interest of the members of one class, it bears the burden of showing a compelling interest in the differential in treatment. The State may not merely show that the differentiation was not arbitrary or unreasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>We disagree that the equal protection clause mandates the elimination of the distinction between the two classes here. The Supreme Court has indicated that the constitutional limitations on governmental actions differ depending on the role in which the government is acting in a particular case. This is so despite the fact that each situation might involve the same constitutional interest of the affected individuals. See, <em>e. g., </em>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969); Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). <em>Cf. </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed. 2d 484 (1972): \u201cRevocation [of parole] deprives an individual, not of the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only of the conditional liberty properly dependent- on observance of special parole restrictions. The State has found the parolee guilty of a crime against the people. That finding justifies imposing extensive restrictions on the individual\u2019s liberty. . . .\u201d 408 U.S. at 480, 483, 92 S.Ct. at 2600, 2601. The <em>Morrissey </em>Court did not pass on the constitutionality of the restrictions placed on parolees; however, in describing, the \u201ctraditional\u201d conditions of parole, including the prohibition of association or correspondence with certain categories of undesirable persons, the Court implicitly acknowledged the propriety of these conditions or, at least, the authority of the States to limit a parolee\u2019s activities substantially beyond the ordinary restrictions imposed by law on an individual citizen. As we suggested before, the Constitution gives the States considerable leeway in deciding how to treat persons convicted of violating State law. We hold that the Constitution does not require a State to show a compelling interest when it seeks to restrict a prisoner\u2019s or parolee's associations or written communications with persons who are not judges, lawyers, or governmental officials. (See footnote 6, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-12\">Defendant Schmidt apparently opposes any judicial inquiry into the reasonableness of specific restrictions concerning a particular felon. He deplores the erosion of the \u201chands-off\u201d doctrine, which provided that a court should not examine the legitimacy of prison rules or the reasonableness of their application in a particular situation, areas entrusted to the discretion of prison officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-13\">Secretary Schmidt also urges us to find that the kind of restriction imposed on Morales is \u201cinherent in the concept of punishment for a crime.\u201d Although some courts have referred to conditions \u201cinherent\u201d in a system of punishment, we think that such an inquiry is unwise. It would plunge us into a philosophical debate far removed from our proper judicial function of interpreting and applying the Constitution. Further, a decision based on our understanding of \u201cpunishment\u201d would merely reflect our personal predilection for certain social and moral policies, <em>e. g., </em>retribution or utilitarianism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-14\">In our opinion, courts have been wisely hesitant about involving themselves too deeply in the day-to-day operations of a state penal system. Prison administrators necessarily must have freedom to exercise discretion in the execution of their duties. However, to allow prison administrators to determine the constitutional rights of a convicted person would be to abdicate our responsibilities. <em>Cf. </em>Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 486, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969); Sobell v. Reed, 327 F.Supp. 1294, 1302 (S.D.N.Y.1971). After all, the maintenance of a correctional system is state action. \u201cFederal courts sit not to supervise prisons but to enforce the constitutional rights of all \u2018persons\u2019 which in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>elude prisoners.\u201d Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 1081, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972). Recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court, as well as of several courts of appeals, clearly establish that cursory disposition of un-frivolous claims by prisoners no longer suffices. In evaluating a prisoner\u2019s suit, the Wisconsin Supreme Court recently stated: \u201cThe courts cannot upon a hands-off doctrine exercise \u2018abstention\u2019 when the constitutionality of the administration\u2019s act is at issue.\u201d State ex rel. Thomas v. State, 55 Wis.2d 343, 357, 198 N.W.2d 675, 683 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">The appropriate standard by which to judge the constitutionality of the kind of restriction the defendant wishes to impose in this ease is the usual one for analyzing State action, namely, whether the action contemplated bears a rational relationship to or is reasonably necessary for the advancement of a justifiable purpose of the State. Pursuant to this standard, a district court should scrutinize closely the justifications offered by the State for the limitation. Its review must \u201cbe more than an obeisance to a warden\u2019s asserted expertise.\u201d Spaeth, The Courts\u2019 Responsibility for Prison Reform, 16 Vill.L. Rev. 1029, 1031, 1037 (1971). In State ex rel. Thomas v. State, <em>supra, </em>the Wisconsin Supreme Court interpreted the statute under which defendant Schmidt claims his agents acted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court indicated that it would condemn the statute as unconstitutional if it prohibited totally communication by inmates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-6\">\u201cThis statute may be read to require reasonable regulations which effectuate legitimate administrative objectives without infringing the first amendment rights of prisoners. The statute certainly does not grant all the powers of an absolute censor to the department of health and social services.\u201d 55 Wis.2d at 357, 198 N.W.2d at 682-683.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-9\"><em>Cf. </em>Hyland v. Procunier, 311 F.Supp. 749, 750 (N.D.Cal.1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-10\">\u201c [I] t is not only the apparent abridgement of first amendment rights which concerns the Court. California as well as federal law has imposed the due process rule of reasonableness upon the State\u2019s discretion in granting or withholding \u2018privileges\u2019 from prisoners, parolees, and probationers. . . . The defendants herein have made no showing that the condition imposed on plaintiff\u2019s parole is in any way related to the valid ends of California\u2019s rehabilitation system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-12\">Our adoption of the rational relationship standard is consistent with the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in State ex rel. Thomas v. State, <em>supra. </em>The appellant there, an inmate of the Wisconsin State Prison at Waupun, sought, <em>inter alia, </em>an injunction restraining interference by prison officials with his attempt to communicate with the Veterans Administration. The court reversed the dismissal of the prisoner\u2019s suit, citing two theories: the right to petition for redress of grievances and the First Amendment\u2019s free-speeeh guarantee. We note that the court\u2019s free speech discussion was an alternative ground for its decision. Further, the court\u2019s primary aim was to emphasize the State\u2019s obligation to justify its actions under any of the accepted standards of review, 55 Wis.2d at 353, 356-357, 198 N.W.2d at 682-683. We do not read the opinion as committing the Wisconsin Supreme court to any one particular standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-13\">The district court\u2019s granting of a preliminary injunction was based upon the \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d standard which we hold not to be applicable in the situation before the court. The record is insufficient for a determination of the question of whether the State\u2019s proposed restriction is justified under the rational relationship standard, the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>which we hold is applicable here. We accordingly reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Upon remand, it will be appropriate to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the prohibition of Morales\u2019s communicating and associating with his sister-in-law is rationally related to the advancement of some legitimate purpose of the State such as the rehabilitation of Morales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">APPENDIX TO THE COURT\u2019S OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">Wis.Stat. \u00a7 53.09 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-7\"><em>\u201cLabor and Communications. </em>Inmates shall be employed as provided in chapter 56. Communication shall not be allowed between inmates, and any person outside the prison except as prescribed by the prison regulations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3yL\">Pursuant to this authority, the Division of Corrections promulgated regulations governing the delivery and dispatch of prisoner correspondence. The administrative regulations covering mail privileges, revised as of February, 1971, provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-8\">\u201c(a) <em>Approved Lists. </em>Each inmate shall be permitted to correspond with approved persons named on the correspondence list. . . . The list of approved correspondents may be changed or revised with approval of the appropriate officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-10\">(b) <em>Limitations. </em>The number of outgoing letters permitted each week shall be specified by the warden or superintendent. The outgoing correspondence privilege may be withdrawn or restricted as a disciplinary or security measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-11\">(c) <em>Mail Inspection. </em>All incoming and outgoing mail for inmates shall be subject to institution inspection. At the discretion of the warden, superintendent, or designated official, the delivery or dispatch of any inmate correspondence, with the exceptions noted [letters to certain state officials and to judges], may be withheld for reasons of propriety, security or the welfare of the institution or inmate.

Fitzpatrick, 451 F.2d 545 (1st Cir. 1971). The prohibited communication was between an inmate (now parolee) and the mother of his child, not between an inmate and his attorney, or the courts, or appropriate state officials regarding the legality of his conviction or the conditions of his incarceration. Courts now regard the latter kind of communications as <em>sni generis. </em>Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972).

The present case is also distinguishable from those suits questioning the practice of opening and reading or censoring (in the sense of deleting certain sentences) mail by prison .authorities or their limiting the number of letters permitted to a prisoner. The federal courts have reached varying conclusions about' the legality of such actions. See, e. <em>g., </em>Sostre v. McGinnis, <em>supra, </em>442 F.2d at 199-201 (dicta); Lee v.

I cannot accept Judge Doyle\u2019s broad conclusion that the fact of conviction is not itself a sufficient basis for some differential in the treatment of the fundamental interests of those who have, as opposed to those who have not, been convicted of crime. In my opinion his reliance on the Equal Protection Clause as requiring the state to justify any such differential by a \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d is misplaced. Nevertheless, I am persuaded that his disposition of the specific issue raised by the response to the plaintiff\u2019s application for a temporary injunction was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-7\">Before discussing each of the three aspects of defendant\u2019s justification, a preliminary comment on the state of the record, and some of its deficiencies, is appropriate. It does not contain the precise regulations which were in effect when Steffes was placed on the \u201cdeny list\u201d; indeed, it does not even contain the regulations as revised in January, 1971. The relevant regulations \u201cas revised\u201d in February, 1971, are before us. Since Defendant\u2019s brief implies that they are controlling, I make that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-8\">The record contains only fragments of information about plaintiff\u2019s rather complex family relationships. In addition to his wife and mother (with whom he corresponds in Spanish), his family includes at least one brother, three half brothers and three half sisters. Apparently he married Sandra in 1966, not long after moving to Milwaukee. Shortly thereafter he initiated proceedings to adopt her illegitimate daughters. On at least one occasion during his incarceration in 1968 her prolonged failure to correspond or to visit him caused him to enlist the assistance of the Correctional Department to inquire about the welfare of his children. I do not find that the record discloses the age of plaintiff\u2019s illegitimate son, Joseph, or whether his affair with Steffes preceded or followed his marriage to Sandra. Portions of his letter to Steffes evidence a genuine concern about the welfare of Joseph.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1427-9\">Addresses in the file indicate that his wife and sister-in-law were neighbors as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>well as sisters. Whether the family situation is such that a complete termination of any association between plaintiff and Steffes would be a desirable or feasible condition to parole is not indicated. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the relationship between Morales and Steffes had any connection with his possession of heroin, for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">When issue was joined in the district court, the record contained little information about plaintiff\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is reasonable to infer that Steffes was placed on plaintiff\u2019s \u201cdeny list\u201d for reasons related to rehabilitation, but that conclusion is not expressly articulated in the record; nor is there any evidence that correction officials considered less drastic alternatives, such as censorship of plaintiff\u2019s correspondence with Steffes, before banning all communication between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">The record would clearly be adequate to support defendant\u2019s position if \u00a7 53.-09 of the Wisconsin statutes could be enforced literally. For that statute may be read to authorize a total prohibition against any communication by an inmate. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has held, however, that the statute must be read more narrowly because such a total prohibition would be unconstitutional. It has construed \u00a7 53.09 \u201cto require reasonable regulations which effectuate legitimate administrative objectives without infringing the First Amendment rights of prisoners.\u201d State ex rel. Thomas v. State, 55 Wis.2d 343, 357, 198 N.W.2d 675, 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-11\">The State Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that a prisoner\u2019s claimed right to communicate raises First Amendment issues is plainly correct. Whether we view the issue from the standpoint of the prisoner\u2019s right to communicate with others, or from the standpoint of society\u2019s right to know what is happening within a penal institution, it is perfectly clear that traditional First Amendment interests are at stake.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is equally clear that plaintiff\u2019s incarceration has not completely extinguished his First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">The case does not merely involve a prisoner\u2019s right to receive incoming mail which, unlike outgoing mail, may contain contraband. Nor does it involve mere inspection or censorship of outgoing mail. It involves a total prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>of any communication with a specific individual. It thus presents an example of a \u201cprior restraint\u201d on the plaintiff\u2019s freedom of expression \u2014 the kind of abridgment that normally receives the closest judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">Placing the \u201cprior restraint\u201d label on defendant\u2019s action does not, however, decide the case; for some kinds of prior restraint have always been tolerated. See Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 716, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357. I assume that conviction of a crime and imprisonment in a penal institution provide exceptional circumstances which. may justify prior restraint in appropriate cases. However, if the vital purposes of the First Amendment are kept in mind, it is equally clear that the state bears the burden of justifying such restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">Under the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 53.09, that burden may not be discharged by simple reliance on the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">The relevant regulations do not authorize the action which plaintiff challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-15\">The prison regulation of \u201cMail Privileges\u201d contains three relevant subpara-graphs. It is subparagraph (b) which expressly authorizes the withdrawal of outgoing correspondence privileges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The only specified grounds for withdrawal or restriction are \u201cas a disciplinary or security measure.\u201d There is nothing in the record to suggest that either of those grounds has any relevance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-16\">Subparagraph (c) authorizes inspection of all incoming and outgoing mail and, in addition, the nondelivery of particular communications for a variety of reasons, including \u201cpropriety, security or the welfare of the institution or inmate.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the point is debatable, I assume that subparagraph (c) would provide adequate authority for the nondelivery of the letter of November 29, 1970, which precipitated this controversy; however, that subpara-graph does not purport to authorize the complete prohibition of communication between an inmate and others. Thus, neither subparagraph (b) nor (c) supports the action at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-17\">Subparagraph (a) of the regulation is ambiguous but may be read to authorize the warden to add or subtract names from a list of permissible correspondents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>for any reason whatsoever.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <em>Thomas </em>case indicates that such mail privileges have been forbidden for reasons unrelated to discipline, security of the institution or rehabilitation of the inmate; in that case the warden had refused to permit an ex-serviceman to write a letter to the Veterans Administration complaining of inadequate medical care. See 55 Wis.2d at p. 346, 198 N.W.2d 675. Since, however, the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s opinion forecloses an interpretation of subparagraph (a) as granting the kind of arbitrary authority that would enable the defendant to withdraw mailing privileges on a selective, completely <em>ad hoc </em>basis, I am persuaded that subparagraph (a) affords no more support for defendant than the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-10\">I therefore conclude that the decision to place Steffes\u2019 name on plaintiff\u2019s deny list is not supported by the kind of reasonable regulation effectuating legitimate administrative objectives which is required by the State Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-12\">In my opinion, any action which abridges First Amendment rights bears a heavier burden of justification if it implements an <em>ad hoc </em>determination rather than a preformulated standard. Guidelines which evidence awareness of the conflicting considerations that should influence particular decisions are presumptively valid.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But I am per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>suaded that the strong presumption of regularity which normally supports state action, particularly when an exercise of discretionary authority is under attack, is not available to justify the <em>ad hoc </em>determination made on behalf of the defendant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">The issue is nevertheless not easily resolved because there is a reasonable likelihood that the judgment of the experienced social worker who interviewed both plaintiff and Steffes is sound. Certainly I would not presume to characterize it as irrational, even under the test well stated in Judge Pell\u2019s opinion. On the other hand, the record does not unambiguously establish a correlation between plaintiff\u2019s rehabilitation and the total prevention of communication between plaintiff and the mother of his child. In view of the risks of error inherent in an <em>ad hoc </em>determination,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> unsupported either by preformulated guidelines or by a more complete exposition of the reasons why less drastic alternatives could not be equally effective in achieving a legitimate rehabilitative goal,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a fair respect for the rights protected by the First Amendment requires rejection of defendant\u2019s justification on the record developed in the court below. I would therefore affirm Judge Doyle\u2019s order of April 6, 1972.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1426-12\">.

The petition of amicus curiae suggesting that the appeal be dismissed as moot advises us that plaintiff was paroled on March 27, 1972, but it does not appear that this development was called to Judge Doyle\u2019s attention before he made his ruling on April 6, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1428-8\">. Before a democratic society can effectuate drastic institutional changes, the community at large must be informed about the need for change. That there is inadequate public awareness of the nature of our penal system, and that the system as a whole needs to be changed dramatically, are propositions which correctional officials are not likely to challenge. (See, <em>e. g., </em>Reducing Crime and Assuring Justice, A Statement by the Research and Policy Committee, June 1972, Committee for Economic Development, at p. 40: \u201cThe entire correctional system is failing and in need of drastic reconstruction.\u201d) If the reasons for our faith in the principles embodied in the First Amendment are valid, it is not unreasonable to infer that there is a causal connection between those two propositions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1428-14\">.

Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030. See Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 321-322, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263. Although Mr. Justice Relinquist found no impermissible impairment of petitioner Cruz\u2019s religious freedom, his analysis, like that of the majority, recognized that Cruz\u2019s conviction and incarceration had not resulted in a total deprivation of the aspects of liberty protected by the First Amendment. See 405 U.S. at 324, 92 S.Ct. 1079. See, also, the cases cited by Judge Mansfield in Carothers v. Follette, 314 F.Supp. 1014, 1023-1024 (S.D.N.Y.1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">.

The full text of subparagraph (c) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-12\"><em>\u201cMail Inspection. </em>All incoming and outgoing mail for inmates shall be subject to institution inspection. If an inmate refuses to consent to inspection, he may be denied the privilege of correspondence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-13\">All letters received for him may be returned to the sender with a proper notation or held for delivery to the inmate upon release or discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-14\">\u201cLetters to or from the Governor, Secretary of the Department of Health and Social Services, Administrator of the Division of Corrections and the members of the Health and Social Services Board are exempted from such inspection. Communications sent to these correspondents shall have the inmate\u2019s name and number plainly written in the upper left hand corner of the envelope. Those letters received from the Secretary of the Department and Administrator of the Division will be initialed in the upper left hand corner of the envelope. In addition, inmates may send mail sealed and without inspection to the Justices of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin or to any Judge of a Court of original or competent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-19\">\u201cAt the discretion of the warden, superintendent or designated official, the delivery or dispatch of any inmate correspondence, with the exceptions noted, may be withheld for reasons of propriety, security or the welfare of the institution or inmate. Such correspondence shall be disposed of as the warden or superintendent shall direct, having in mind the best interests of the inmate and the institution.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">. Subparagraph (a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-5\"><em>\u201cApproved Lists. </em>Each inmate shall be permitted to correspond with approved persons named on the correspondence list prepared at the institution as soon as possible after the time of admission. The list of approved correspondents may be changed or revised with approval of the appropriate officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">. Historically, the value of carefully considered standards has been largely ignored in the corrections area because virtually all aspects of corrections were assumed to be committed to the complete discretion of executive appointees. Apparently for the first time in history, on August 23, 1972, the Association of State Correctional Ad-ininitrators adopted recommended uniform standards to guide institutional administrators and personnel. The recommended policy guidelines with respect to mail merit quotation in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-7\">\u201cCorrespondence with members of an inmate\u2019s family, close friends, associates, and organizations is beneficial to the morale of all confined persons and may form the basis for good adjustment in the institution and in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-8\">\u201cInmates should be permitted to send sealed letters to a specified class of persons and organizations. Mail to these persons from the inmates should not be opened. Mail from these persons to inmates may be opened for inspection for contraband only. The following persons should be included:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-13\">1. Judges of federal, state and local courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-15\">2. Officials of the confining authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-16\">3. Members of the paroling authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2bX\">\u201cApproved mail lists for general correspondence may be maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-17\">\u201cThe criteria for approval of persons for general correspondence should be limited to the purposes of confinement and security of the institution. In general, all close relatives should be approved, anyone having legitimate business with the inmate may be approved, correspondence should not be limited solely on the basis of sex, existence of a criminal record should not, in and of itself, constitute a barrier to correspondence, and juveniles under the age of 18 years should have permission from parents before correspondence is allowed. Other correspondents may be permitted at the discretion of the institutional head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-18\">\u201cAn inmate may make changes on his approved list. The number of approved correspondents should be unlimited, and there should be no limitation on the number of letters an inmate may send to or receive from them. Upon request, an individual may be removed from the inmate\u2019s mailing list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-19\">\u201cAll general correspondence, both incoming and outgoing, may be inspected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL1i\">\u201cPUBLICATIONS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-20\">\u201cInstitutions should allow inmates access to publications to the greatest degree consistent with institutional goals, internal discipline and security. Publications should be received by inmates only from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>the publisher or distributor. In addition, institutions may subscribe to publications in sufficient quantity to give coverage in the institution and to provide for the diverse interests of the inmate population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-7\">No publication should be prohibited solely on the basis of its appeal to a particular ethnic, racial or religious audience. As a general rule, however, institutions may restrict receipt of publications that constitute a danger of a breach of prison discipline or security, or some other substantial interference with the orderly administration of the institutions.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1431-18\">. We must both respect the expertise of the correction officers who face these problems daily and also be on guard against the danger that the \u201crhetoric of rehabilitation\u201d will obscure rather than identify constructive solutions to prison problems. In his illuminating paper on \u201cThe Prosaic Sources of Prison Violence,\u201d Hans W. Mattick stated (at page 2) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-20\">\u201cMuch more fundamental is a contradictory complex of utilitarian and religious ideas of 18th and 19th Century origin, which have been slowly debased into a melange of 20th Century \u2018high school thought,\u2019 and now serve as the basis for our penal policy. It is, for the most part, a policy of isolation and punishment, accompanied by the rhetoric of rehabilitation, which results in the chronic under-financing, inadequate staffing, deflected sexuality, and general lack of resources and poverty of imagination that characterizes our prisons and jails.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1431-8\">.
