The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reached a contrary result in United States v. Behle, 316 F.2d 134 (1963). That case, however, involved the interplay of section 1301 and the Code provisions governing charitable and medical deductions, and therefore is distinguishable. Moreover, for purposes of the present case, we choose to follow the reasoning of our own decision in <em>Wilkinson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1486-23\">KUNZIG, Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1486-24\">This is a suit for the recovery of $15,-486.60 in federal income tax paid for the year 1966, plus interest on that amount. The dispute before us involves the relationship between the net-operating-loss carryback provision of Internal Revenue Code section 172 and the income-averaging provision of former section 1301. In our opinion, plaintiffs may not create a double tax benefit by combining the operations of these two relief provisions. Consequently, we hold for the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-25\">None of the facts is controverted. In 1966, plaintiff William Payne received $713,625 in payment for legal services rendered for the period January 1, 1948 to April 21, 1966, in connection with the claims of the Oklahoma Cheyenne Arapaho Tribes of Indians against the United States Government. In computing their joint tax return for 1966, Mr. Payne and his wife elected to take advantage of the original version of section 1301 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>now repealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This statute provided that the tax on the lump-sum payment should not exceed what the aggregate tax on that amount would have been if it were earned ratably over the 220-month period of employment. In effect, taxation at a rate more favorable to the taxpayer was made possible by \u201caveraging\u201d the income over the period it was earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-5\">The \u201cspread back\u201d of income yielded a monthly rate of compensation of $3,243.-75. Thus, by using former section 1301, plaintiffs saved approximately $220,000 in taxes on their 1966 income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-6\">The present controversy, however, derives from plaintiffs\u2019 effort to save more. In 1967 and 1968, plaintiffs reported net operating losses of over $31,000 and $22,000, respectively. On June 16, 1969, they filed a claim for refund of $15,486.80 for an alleged overpayment of 1966 taxes. This claim was based upon plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to amend their section 1301 computation of the 1966 tax liability by using Code section <em>172</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to \u201ccarry back\u201d net-operating-loss deductions from 1967 and 1968, and applying them against the section 1301 allocations of income for 1964 and 1965. Apart from the 1301 allocations, 1964 and 1965 were themselves net-loss years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-18\">The Internal Revenue Service rejected this claim on the ground that former section 1301 did not actually \u201cshift\u201d income from the year of receipt into prior tax years, but only affected the rate of tax applicable in the year of <em>receipt, </em>and that a net-operating-loss carryback could therefore not be deducted from section 1301 income allocated to such prior years. Plaintiffs here challenge that determination. While a number of judicial decisions on related issues exist, this appears to be a case of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-19\">No dispute exists here as to plaintiffs\u2019 qualification to utilize former section 1301 for the 1966 lump-sum payment or as to the existence of net operating losses in 1967 and 1968. The controversy before us, then, turns on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>question of whether the section 1301 computation of tax liability shifts to earlier years income against which net-operating-loss carrybacks can be deducted. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-4\">As has been demonstrated in the statement of facts above, the purpose of former section 1301 was to ease the abnormal tax burden created by a lump-sum receipt or accrual of long-term compensation by allocating such \u201cbunched\u201d income over the period in which it was earned. Wilkinson v. United States, 304 F.2d 469, 157 Ct.Cl. 847 (1962). In interpreting section 1301 and its companion provisions, the Internal Revenue Service has emphasized that \u201cthese sections have no effect on the income tax liability for prior years; they simply provide a special method of computing the amount of tax for the year of receipt or accrual.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.1301-1 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-5\">Consistent with this view, this court has ruled that the predecessor statute to section 1301, in allocating earnings to prior years for purpose of tax \u201caveraging,\u201d does not reduce in the year of accrual the amount of actual income against which charitable deductions may be taken. Wilkinson v. United States, <em>supra, </em>304 F.2d at 471, 157 Ct.Cl. at 853.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201cspread back\u201d of income is, thus, only a conceptual one for a specific purpose; it effects no redistribution of funds in an accounting sense. It represents a one-year, one-shot mathematical computation which may not be manipulated to maximize deduction benefits of subsequent years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-9\">A similar result was reached by the Tax Court in a case involving the interplay of the predecessor statutes to sections 1301 and 172. Albert G. Redpath, 19 T.C. 470 (1952). The court there held at 473:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1488-10\">Section [1301] merely limits the tax in the year of income or the year of receipt, it does not provide for the shifting of income or the recomputation of tax liability for other years. * * * Section [1301] is concerned with, and limits, the recomputation of tax while section [172] deals with the computation of net income, or more specifically, with net operating loss deductions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1488-12\"><em>See </em>Annot., 29 A.L.R.2d 592, 625 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-13\">We believe these authorities govern the present ease. Because former section 1301 did not actually shift income to prior tax years, net-operating-loss deductions could not be carried back to years which were already loss years. Plainly put, section 1301 and the carry-back provisions of section 172 simply were not meant to mix with one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-14\">In the face of this reasoning, plaintiffs at oral argument brought forth Treasury Regulation 1.1301-2(d) (2) (ii) (1959),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which they asserted allows them to effect the net-operating-loss car-ryback in question. We find this view untenable. As made clear by the explanatory illustration in subsection 2(d)(3), which issued contemporaneously with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>the section here in question, the obfuscated language of regulation 1.1301-2(d) (2) (ii) covered only net operating loss which preexisted the 1301 computation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> not a carryback of future net losses. <em>See </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.1301-2(d)(3) (1959). Thus, the regulation on which plaintiffs rely here has no relevance to the present facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-4\">Because both former section 1301 and section 172 are relief provisions, plaintiffs must clearly prove their qualification for these statutes\u2019 benefits. United States v. Olympic Radio &amp; Television, 349 U.S. 232, 235, 75 S.Ct. 733, 99 L.Ed. 1024 (1955); Breen v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 328 F.2d 58, 62 (8th Cir. 1964). In their reliance on Treasury Regulation 1.1301-2(d) (2)(ii), plaintiffs have failed to carry this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the regulation would fly in the face of the broader rule of Treasury Regulation 1.1301-1 that the 1301 allocation not be used as a tool to reopen the computation of prior tax years. Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the subject regulation is irreconeilable with the <em>Wilkinson </em>and <em>Redpath </em>decisions, which we follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final contention is that denial of the attempted net-operating-loss deduction here would put plaintiffs in a position inferior to that of taxpayers who received the same amount of income ratably over the period of employment. The argument is groundless. A man receiving $713,625 in one year <em>is </em>different from a man receiving the same amount over eighteen years. Plaintiffs have already reaped the full bounty of Congress\u2019 grace through their election of the 1301 income averaging option. To allow the compounding of this benefit by linking it to the net-operating-loss car-ryback deduction would be to accord a windfall not contemplated by Congress. We hardly consider plaintiffs penalized by the reduction of the 1966 tax liability by over $220,000 through income averaging. In summary, we find all of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-9\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted; plaintiffs\u2019 cross motion for summary judgment is denied; and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1487-7\">. \u201c\u00a7 1301. <em>Compensation from an employment</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1487-8\">\u201c(a) ...
