He was accompanied to the funeral by four armed deputy marshals. His half-brother, LaVance Greene, during the course of the funeral service in a crowded church, disarmed the deputy marshals, released his brother from custody, shot to death one of the deputy marshals, took their guns, commandeered at gunpoint a passing automobile, and attempted to escape with his half-brother Randolph. A passing police car gave chase and after a high speed pursuit, with the assistance of two motorcycle officers, several miles later, effected the arrest of the two appellants. Charges of felony murder, premeditated murder of Federal officer, four counts of armed robbery, rescue of a prisoner, as well as escape from custody were brought against the two brothers. Randolph Greene was convicted only of escape. LaVance Greene was convicted by jury verdict of the other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-19\">Numerous points are raised by appointed counsel, three of which were emphasized at oral argument. Counsel challenged the jury selection system then in force and effect in this district. He challenged the legality of the felony murder conviction in that the felony LaVance Greene is charged with committing at the time of the shooting of the deputy marshal was a Federal felony which, counsel says, cannot be joined with the local (Title 22, D.C.Code) felony murder statute. He challenges the burden placed on LaVance Greene regarding the insanity instructions. We affirm the judgments on Count 3 (felony murder), Counts 7, 9, 11, and 13 (armed robbery, as to LaVance Greene), and Count <em>6 </em>as to Randolph Greene. We vacate the remaining judgments of conviction as to LaVance Greene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-21\">CHALLENGE TO THE JURY SELECTION SYSTEM</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-22\">With respect to appellant\u2019s first challenge, namely, the jury selection system, the record reflects that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>judge, on two occasions, extended the time within which pretrial motions could be filed. No request was made by defense counsel to file a motion to dismiss the indictment because of the jury selection system until January 17, 1972, the day of trial. This challenge is untimely. Appellate counsel was uninformed as to when trial counsel for the defense first learned of any problem with respect to the jury selection in the instant case. Counsel filing this motion and swearing to the required affidavit was Miss Sarah E. Brown of the Public Defender Service. The records of the trial Court, of which this Court may take notice, indicate that a similar motion raising the same points was filed in United States v. Johnson, Criminal Case No. 1690-71. Counsel pressing these similar motions in the <em>Johnson </em>ease were Mr. Robert Weinberg and Mr. Matthew Zwerling, also of the Public Defender Service. The date on which these similar motions were filed and documented with comparable material was October 28, 1971. It is clear that the basis for the motion filed before the trial judge in the instant case was known to Miss Brown\u2019s office as early as the 28th of October, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Section 1867(a) of the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, Pub.L. 274 of the 90th Congress, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861 et seq., provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">(a) In criminal cases, before the voir dire examination begins, or within seven days after the defendant discovered or <em>could have discovered, </em>by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is earlier, the defendant may move to dismiss the indictment or stay the proceedings against him on the ground of substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title in selecting the grand or petit jury. (Emphasis supplied.) It is reasonable to conclude that the basis for filing these motions was well known to the lawyers who comprise that Service. Failure to file this motion reciting similar grounds as the motion filed in the Johnson<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> case until the day of trial stamps the filing as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">Counsel acknowledges that only six of a possible 20 peremptory challenges were made by defense counsel in the process of selecting a petit jury. He conceded he was uninformed as to the composition of the petit jury, that is to say, what their ages were, or what their economic status was. He persists, however, in saying that the jury selection system does not fairly select young people and poor people.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">The Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, Pub.L. 90-274, March 27, 1968, requires that litigants shall have the right to trial by jury, both grand and petit, selected at random from a fair cross-section of the community in the district wherein the court convenes. (Section 1861). Section 1862 prohibits <em>exclusion </em>from service of any citizen on the ground of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or economic status. Section 1863 provides that a plan be devised by the District Court and approved by the Judicial Council of the Circuit and the Chief Judge of the District Court. In conformity with the authorization contained in paragraph (b)(2), the plan for this District utilized the City Directory rather than the voter list. No challenge was made that jurors selected for the grand jury and the petit jury panel were not randomly selected from the City Directory in accordance with the Circuit approved plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">The motion, filed on the day of trial, contains certain conclusory statements without any adequate underlying factual data. Counsel contends that the poor and the young are excluded from the jury selection plan. The record discloses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>no evidence of exclusion on account of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or economic status (\u00a7 1862). What appellants contend, as we understand their argument, is that since certain rolls of the Manpower Commission and the Bail Agency applicant list reflect a substantial percentage of persons not listed in the City Directory that the selection process must be deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\"> As a matter of decision law, there are a number of objections to the thesis propounded by appellants. First, while it is clear that the intention of the Jury Selection Act is to obtain a jury that is fairly representative of a cross-section of the community (see Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U.S. 217, 66 S.Ct. 984, 90 L.Ed. 1181 (1946)), it is also clear that there is no constitutional requirement that the jury pool be a statistical mirror of the community. Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57, 82 S.Ct. 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 118 (1961). The fact, if it is a fact, that there are fewer young people on the jury than the exact proportions of young persons in the community does not of itself make a jury nonrepresentative. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">It bears emphasis that there is no claim in the case before us of a purposeful exclusion of young persons, but only a claim that the system of jury selection results in an under-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">The Jury Selection Act itself does not refer to young people as a class. Serious question arises as to whether young people are an identifiable class. No criteria are set forth in the Act on the basis of which the class is described. Young people are characterized by as many variables, varying philosophies, education, earning capacities, as old pro-pie, or middle aged people, or any other group concerning which known and admitted variables exist. With the exception of United States v. Butera,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 420 F. 2d 564 (1st Cir. 1970), all Federal courts, both at the trial level and at the circuit level, have held that the category of \u201cyoung persons\u201d is not a cognizable class that must be systematically mirrored in jury selection procedures. See United States v. Guzman, 337 F.Supp. 140 (S.D.N.Y.1972). The Court said at page 146:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-10\">The mere fact of similarity in age cannot, by itself, be sufficient to define a cognizable group. If it were, any jury selection system could be successfully attacked by a strategic drawing of age group lines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-12\">In accordance with the long line of cases cited above, this court cannot accept the proposition that members of arbitrarily drawn age brackets necessarily constitute valid categories for measuring the legality of a jury selection system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-13\">To the same effect, see United States v. Gargan, 314 F.Supp. 414 (W.D.Wis. 1970). The <em>Gargan </em>case was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit sub nom. United States v. Gast, 457 F.2d 141 (7th Cir. 1972). Judge Frank Kaufman\u2019s decision in United States v. Cohen, 275 F.Supp. 724 (D. Md. 1967), was affirmed by the Fourth Circuit sub nom. United States v. DiTommaso, 405 F.2d 385 (4th Cir. 1968). In affirming, the Fourth Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-14\">As to age as a measure of representation, we do not believe that members of arbitrarily drawn age brackets necessarily constitute valid categories for measuring the legality of jury selection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-15\">405 F.2d at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-16\">To the same effect, see United States v. Kuhn, 441 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir. 1971). It is interesting to note that Judge Coffin, who wrote the opinion of the First Circuit in <em>Butera, supra, </em>in a subsequent case, United States v. Camara, 451 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>F.2d 1122 (1971), rejected out of hand a contention that persons under 25 were underrepresented on grand juries in the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">In the absence of a claim of purposeful exclusion, we see serious problems in a legal claim based on statistical under-representation of a sub-class of the young, the middle-aged, the middle-income, manual laborers, college graduates, and so on, ad infinitum, as to all the matters that some lawyers may identify as having a bearing on the jury\u2019s action. We have thought it useful to discuss problems presented by appellant\u2019s thesis even though, in view of the lack of timely objection, we do not decide this matter on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">As to the alleged underrepresentation of persons in the lower economic group, no showing whatsoever has been attempted to show any intentional deletion of such persons. By referring to random sampling, efforts on the part of statisticians to establish that persons on the Manpower Commission rolls, on the Bail Agency lists, and among clients of the Neighborhood Legal Services, are underrepresented, counsel has simply demonstrated that for one reason or other these persons are more likely to move than other members of the general population, but no evidence is supplied indicating exclusionary practices. That is what the Act prohibits. Exclusion of day laborers in <em>Thiel, sy/pra, </em>was sufficient to invalidate the conviction. Here, the Court is confronted with no comparable situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">THE FELONY MURDER CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-8\">The third count of the indictment on which La Vance Greene was convicted is drawn under 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2401 (1967) and charges him with first degree murder committed while perpetrating the crime of rescuing a federal prisoner. In pertinent part, 22 D.C. Code \u00a7 2401 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-9\">Whoever, being of sound memory and discretion, kills another purposely, * * * in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate <em>any offense </em>punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, * * *. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-12\">The crime of rescuing a federal prisoner is defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 752(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-13\">The appellant argues that the term \u201cany offense\u201d in Section 22-2401 \u201cincludes only the local felonies created by D.C.Code and not the national felonies created by U.S.Code.\u201d Contending the rescuing a federal prisoner \u201cis exclusively a national crime\u201d, counsel for the appellant reaches the conclusion that there is no statute which creates the offense alleged in the third count. In support of this thesis doubt is expressed that Congress intended \u201cparochial penal legislation\u201d, such as the District of Columbia statute, to be applied in implementing statutes creating \u201cnational crimes\u201d. It is said \u201ca construction favoring such unnecessary implementation will produce discriminatory, harsh results\u201d in that the penalty for first degree felony murder will be more severe in the District of Columbia than elsewhere under the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-14\">The question presented is one of congressional intent: did Congress intend the plain words \u201cany offense\u201d to include a Title 18 offense committed in the District of Columbia? We think Congress did so intend. The Federal Criminal Code embodied in Title 18 and the District of Columbia Criminal Code of Title 22 were both enacted by Congress and were intended to exist together. Johnson v. United States, 225 U.S. 405, 32 S.Ct. 748, 56 L.Ed. 1142 (1912). We believe further that they were intended to mesh with each other, and they have been so construed in the past. Thus a violation of the District of Columbia Code has been held to be an offense against the United States; and an indictment is good which alleges a conspiracy under the federal statute to commit an offense against the United States by violating the District of \u2022 Columbia Code. United States v. Cella, 37 App.D.C. 423 (1911), cert. denied, 223 U.S. 728, 32 S.Ct. 526, 56 L.Ed. 633 (1912) (con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>spiracy to violate the District of Columbia bucket shop law); Fletcher v. United States, 42 App.D.C. 53 (1914) (conspiracy wrongfully to accuse a woman of unchastity and to commit perjury); Arnstein v. United States, 54 App.D.C. 199, 296 F. 946, cert. denied, 264 U.S. 595, 44 S.Ct. 454, 68 L.Ed. 867 (1924) (conspiracy to bring stolen stock into the District of Columbia); <em>see </em>Beard v. United States, 65 App.D.C. 231, 82 F.2d 837, cert. denied, 298 U.S. 655, 56 S.Ct. 675, 80 L.Ed. 1382 (1936) (conspiracy to violate D.C. gambling laws); <em>cf. </em>Lee v. United States, 72 App.D.C. 147, 112 F.2d 46 (1940); Monroe v. United States, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 234 F.2d 49 (1956) (conspiracy to commit bribery). In short, it has long been understood and held that the two codes are reciprocal in their operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">To adopt appellant\u2019s construction would lead to an anomalous result, one that Congress could not conceivably have intended. If one killed during the course of a robbery on the street in front of a bank, he could be prosecuted for felony murder under the D.C.Code, but if during the course of a robbery in a bank a killing occurred, that robber could not be prosecuted for felony murder under the D.C.Code. Such a construction must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">The appellant\u2019s argument that our construction will \u201cproduce discriminatory, harsh results\u201d is answered by Johnson v. United States, <em>supra. </em>As the Supreme Court said (225 U.S. at 418, 32 S. Ct. at 752): \u201cThere is certainly nothing anomalous in punishing the crime of murder differently in different jurisdictions. It is but the application of legislation to conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">Appellant also argues that he was denied equal protection of the laws because of the breadth of the District of Columbia felony murder statute; that is to say, he alleges that it is broader than the coverage of the federal felony murder statute. Whether prosecution is brought in this jurisdiction under the D.C.Code or whether it is brought under an applicable section of the United States Code is a matter confided solely to the discretion of the United States Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">Congress was not limited in the D.C.Code specification for first degree felony murder to the felonies set forth in the Federal Code, as pertinent to murder within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111. Certainly there would be no constitutional objection to a trial for first degree felony murder in, say, Virginia, if that commonwealth defined that offense to include homicides that were purposeful (though falling short of the premeditated) and were committed in the course of the felony of escape from lawful custody, including homicides, perhaps of bystanders, in the course of the felony of escaping from a Federal marshal. Congress, in legislating for the District of Columbia, had all the powers of the Virginia legislature to legislate concerning homicides occurring within the territorial limits of Virginia, and could go beyond the Federal maritime code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">Counsel also attacks the charge in Count 3 for the reason that the trial court did not instruct on all the elements. Particularly, he says that the trial court did not tell the jury that the government was required to prove, among other things, that LaVance Greene was of sound memory and discretion. It is well settled that no allegation of sanity is required in an indictment, nor does the language of Section 2401 of Title 22 of the D.C.Code require that the indictment include the allegation that the defendant was of sound memory and discretion. See Jones v. United States,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>111 U.S.App.D.C. 276, 296 F.2d 398, cert. denied, 370 U.S. 913, 82 S.Ct. 1260, 8 L.Ed.2d 406 (1962). See also Coleman v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 210, 295 F.2d 555, cert. denied, 369 U.S. 813, 82 S.Ct. 689, 7 L.Ed.2d 613, rehearing denied, 369 U.S. 842, 82 S.Ct. 870, 7 L.Ed.2d 847 (1962). In <em>Coleman, </em>the defendant was convicted of first degree felony murder. Counsel attacked the indictment for the reason that it did not contain the statutory allegation that the defendant was of sound memory and discretion. He recognized that such a. contention had been specifically rejected by this Court in the <em>Hill </em>(Hill v. United States) case, 22 App.D.C. 395, 400-402.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">In United States v. Green, 150 U.S. App.D.C. 222, 463 F.2d 1313 (1972), in footnote 5, we affirmed what we held in <em>Hill </em>and <em>Coleman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">The trial court in instructing the jury on the elements of felony murder (Tr. 985) set them forth clearly and explicitly. There is in the record ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s'finding of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\">INSANITY AS A DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"are-dedup-0\">Appellant attacks Section 207(6) of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970, P. L. 91-358, which added a new sentence at the end of 24 D.C.Code \u00a7 301(j), so as to place the burden upon a defendant asserting insanity as a defense to prove this defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 301(j), as amended, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-11\">Insanity shall not be a <em>defense </em>in any criminal proceeding in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, unless the accused or his attorney in such proceeding, at the time the accused enters his plea of not guilty or within fifteen days thereafter or at such later time as the court may for good cause permit, files with the court and serves upon the prosecuting attorney written notice of his intention to rely on such defense. No person accused of an offense shall be acquitted on the ground that he was insane at the time of its commission unless his insanity, regardless of who raises the issue, is affirmatively established by a preponderance of the evidence. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-12\">This ease presents no ex post facto question, as the provision became effective February 1, 1971, prior to the September 24, 1971, date of the homicide in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-13\">Appellant\u2019s first attack on the statute in question is that it applies only to insanity and not to productivity. He is clearly wrong in this for the reason that the Act is addressed to the defense \u00f3f insanity, which, in this jurisdiction, at the time of the offense charged in this indictment, was a unitary concept which required proof of insanity and productivity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>Appellant next argues that the Act is unconstitutional on its face. In reliance upon our decision in United States v. Thompson, 147 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 452 F.2d 1333, cert. denied, 405 U.S. 998, 92 S.Ct. 1251, 31 L.Ed.2d 467 (1972), appellant seeks to demonstrate that since a different standard of proof concerning the defense of insanity is provided by Section 207(6) of the Court Reform Act than is applicable in other federal jurisdictions, that the Act amounts to a denial of equal protection. The <em>Thompson </em>case was concerned with two standards, each enunciated by Congress, each applicable to bond pending appeal. We decided that insofar as D. C.Code offenses are concerned the standard enunciated in the Court Reform Act and applicable specifically to the District of Columbia should apply, and that the standard enunciated by Congress insofar as federal offenses are concerned, should apply to those offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">The District of Columbia is unique in our constitutional system. <em>See </em>District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U.S. 418, 93 S.Ct. 602, 34 L.Ed.2d 613 (1973). This accounts for the unique situation in which jurisdiction over criminal violation of the District of Columbia Code is vested concurrently both in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, a statutory court established pursuant to Article I, see Palmore v. United States, 411 U.S. 389, 93 S.Ct. 1670, 36 L.Ed.2d 342 (Apr. 24, 1973), and in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, a constitutional court established under Article III of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">The provision of the Court Reform Act making its provisions relating to the defense of insanity applicable to offenses committed in the District of Columbia, clearly has application to the counts charging first degree felony murder in violation of 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2401 \u2014 count 2 (felony murder committed while perpetrating a robbery) and count 3 (felony murder committed while perpetrating the crime of rescuing a federal prisoner) \u2014 whether those crimes are prosecuted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">We continue to put to one side, as we did in <em>Brawner, </em>whether those provisions were intended to or can have application to a prosecution in the District Court of a violation of Title 18 of the United States Code, which is intended for enforcement throughout the Federal court system. In enacting local criminal statutes in the exercise of its singular constitutional responsibility to legislate for the District, Congress need not hew to the same path it elects in defining criminal offenses of nationwide applicability, pursuant to its Federal legislative powers. Thus viewed, we find no inconsistency whatever in applying to a D.C. Code offense \u2014 albeit tried in the United States District Court \u2014 a standard of proof different from that of a Federal offense tried, for example, in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Indeed, it would be more anomalous for one standard, at least of a substantive or crucial nature, to be applied when a D.C.Code offense is tried in the Superior Court and another when the same offense is tried in the District Court. Section 207(6) obviates this by providing that a single rule of insanity shall apply to all D.C.Code offenses, regardless of the tribunal before which they are tried. We cannot accept appellant\u2019s suggestion that this works a denial of the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-9\">Appellant also contends that Section 207(6) of the Court Reform Act amounts to a denial of due process. We find this contention equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-10\">The Supreme Court in Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 96 L.Ed. 1302 (1952), sustained an Oregon statute which required a defendant asserting insanity as a defense to prove that defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, Congress, in its exclusive constitutional authority to legislate for the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>trict of Columbia,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 7has required that a defendant asserting insanity as a defense prove such defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Congress was concerned that potentially dangerous offenders who successfully pleaded insanity as a defense might be released again to commit offenses without receiving adequate psychiatric treatment. To establish the defense of insanity prior to the Court Reform Act, it was required only that \u201csome evidence\u201d of insanity be shown.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, it was incumbent upon the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt either that the defendant was not suffering from a mental disease or defect or, if he were, that the criminal act was not the product of the mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">The difficulty which arose and which was recognized by this Court in a number of decisions was that one mandatorily committed under the provisions of Title 24, Sections 301 et seq., of the D.C. Code could be committed to a mental institution simply because the government had failed to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. Judge Fahy, in his concurring opinion in Ragsdale v. Overholser, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 308, 281 F.2d 943 (1960), expressed doubt about whether confinement in a mental institution can be predicated upon what may be nothing more than a jury\u2019s finding of reasonable doubt concerning a defendant\u2019s mental condition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In Bolton v. Harris, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 395 F.2d 642 (1968), this Court recognized the consequences of this situation and required that one found not guilty by reason of insanity should be given a hearing promptly after his commitment following a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. It was this decision, the legislative history of the Court Reform Act reflects,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that motivated Congress to specify that insanity is an affirmative defense and that one asserting it must prove it by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-10\">Reliance by appellant on the proposition thatjn re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), has, in effect, overruled Leland v. Oregon, <em>swpra, </em>is misplaced. In re Winship did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>not involve insanity as a defense. Win-ship involved proof of facts \u2014 -\u201cthe occurrence of an event\u201d \u2014 while insanity deals with proof of \u201cmental condition and propensity.\u201d United States v. James Brown, 478 F.2d 606 at 609 (January 8, 1973). It required that the elements of a juvenile offense be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This had previously been made clear in the <em>Gault </em>case, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), but the Court of Appeals of New York had affirmed a decision consistent with the New York statute that a juvenile could be found \u201cinvolved\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence. Since \u201cinvolvement\u201d authorized substantial deprivation of liberty by confinement, the Supreme Court reversed. To support his conclusion, counsel for the appellant relies on United States v. Eich-berg, 142 U.S.App.D.C. 110, 439 F.2d 620 (1971). There, a conviction of forgery and uttering was affirmed. The <em>per curiam </em>decision held that \u201cordinarily, \u2018in view of the complicated nature of the decision to be made \u2014 intertwining moral, legal, and medical judgments\u2019- the jury\u2019s verdict must stand.\u201d 142 U.S. App.D.C. at 111, 439 F.2d at 621. In a separate concurring opinion, Chief Judge Bazelon, citing In re Winship, <em>supra, </em>questioned the continued vitality of <em>Leland: </em>It is noted, however, that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Winship </em>cited with approval a group of prior decisions, including Leland v. Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">The essential elements of the charge of felony murder do not include proof of sanity. If that were the case, the Government would be required to produce evidence establishing sanity beyond a reasonable doubt as part of its direct case, before the defendant introduced an iota of testimony, and that is not and never has been the law. The elements of felony murder applicable to Count 3 are that a felony was attempted or being perpetrated and that during the course of that action the deceased was purposely killed. As to the meaning of purposely, see Collazo v. United States, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 241, 246, 196 F.2d 573, 578, cert. denied, 343 U.S. 968, 72 S.Ct. 1065, 96 L.Ed. 1364 (1952). See also <em>Coleman, Jones, </em>and <em>Green, supra. </em>In .determining whether Leland v. Oregon is modified or overruled by In re Win-ship, consideration should be given to the more recent case of Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 92 S.Ct. 619, 30 L.Ed.2d 618 (1972), in which the Court held that it was consistent with due process to determine the voluntariness of a confession by a preponderance of the evidence rather than by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, since sanity is not one of the elements of felony murder but lack of sanity may be interposed as a defense, Congress may with propriety enunciate the standard of proof required of the party asserting this affirmative defense, i. e., proof by a preponderance of the evidence. That is the situation, at least unless and until <em>Leland </em>is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">The scope and reach of the <em>Winship </em>case was one of the issues confronting the Second Circuit in United States v. Braver, 450 F.2d 799 (2d Cir. 1971). There, appellant challenged the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding the defense of entrapment. The trial judge had followed the rationale of Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Sherman, 200 F.2d 880 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (2d Cir. 1952), in which it was stated that on the issue of inducement the defense has the burden. In affirming the conviction and explaining its understanding of <em>Winship, </em>the Second Circuit at page 803 of <em>Braver </em>held that placing the burden of proving inducement on the defendant does not constitute a denial of due process. \u201cThe Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d 397 U.S. at 364, 90 S.Ct. at 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>In Phillips v. State, 86 Nev. 720, 475 P.2d 671 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 940, 91 S.Ct. 2260, 29 L.Ed.2d 719 (1971), the Supreme Court of Nevada rejected the argument that In re Win-ship changes the concept that one asserting the affirmative defense of insanity must prove insanity by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Whether sanity is an element of the crime of murder which must be proven by the state is a question that has been well-settled. Insanity is an affirmative proposition which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of proof. Gallegos v. State, 84 Nev. 608, 446 P.2d 656 (1968). Appellant is in error when he asserts that In re Winship, . . . recently decided, changes that concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">475 P.2d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">It is noted that only two of the Justices of the Supreme Court voted to review the case. 403 U.S. 940, 91 S.Ct. 2260.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">For seventy-five years Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895), has been recognized in the federal courts as authority for the proposition that when evidence of insanity is present for the consideration of the jury that it is incumbent upon the prosecution to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was responsible criminally for his acts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, the charge is felony murder, not common law murder, and accordingly, no proof of premeditation, deliberation, and malice is required. If the killing was purposely, i. e., intentionally, done during the course of the commission of a felony, or the attempted commission of a felony, the essential elements of felony murder as charged in Count 3 have been proved. <em>Davis </em>in effect confirms our earlier observation that sanity is not an essential element of the offense, for otherwise <em>Davis </em>would have required the prosecution to have proved sanity beyond a reasonable doubt as part of its direct case, whereas the Court merely left the issue as one that does not arise in the case unless there is some evidence of insanity, which typically calls on defendant to make some affirmative presentation. Of even more critical importance is the fact that the Supreme Court enunciated the <em>Davis </em>doctrine as part of its supervisory authority over the federal courts. The Court clearly reflected that no constitutional issue compelled the decision. Since Congress, as part of its constitutional authority over the District of Columbia, has established the rule which was followed by the trial court in the instant case, we recognize that Congress has acted within the bounds of its constitutional authority and the preponderance rule for an affirmative defense is not a denial of due process of law. Again, we say this in the context of Leland v. Oregon as an authoritative and binding precedent, unless modified or overruled by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">BIFURCATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-13\">In a number of eases this Court has recognized the desirability of bifurcating that portion of a criminal trial which concerns insanity as a defense. The Court has recognized that a considerable degree of discretion must be ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>corded the trial court in making its determination on this issue. In Holmes v. United States, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 152, 154, 363 F.2d 281, 283 (1966), we set forth the fundamental rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-6\">The court not only has a broad discretion in considering bifurcation, but also in prescribing its procedure, the form of the charge and submission of the questions to the jury, the admissibility of evidence in each stage, and even the impaneling of a second jury to hear the second stage if this appears necessary to eliminate prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">On the facts of this case, and particularly since Randolph Greene did not wish to interpose the defense of insanity, it appears that the trial court\u2019s ruling to bifurcate the case had a substantial basis. Additionally, it permitted the defense to call Randolph Greene as a witness in the second stage of the trial without subjecting him to cross-examination on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">There is no showing here that any evidence which counsel wished the jury to consider on behalf of LaVance Greene was excluded either prior to the time the case was submitted to the jury on the indictment or at the bifurcated stage where insanity was the sole issue. Under these circumstances, we see no basis for reversing the determination of the trial court or regarding his decision as an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">Most of our eases in which the issue of bifurcation has been raised are cases in which the trial judge refused to bifurcate. In footnote 2 in United States v. Grimes, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 184, 421 F. 2d 1119 (1969), Judge McGowan, speaking for the Court, considered five cases in which we sustained the discretion of the trial judge in denying bifurcation. There is no intimation in any of these cases that it would have been error to grant bifurcation, nor has it been contended in any of our cases that to do so would have been an abuse of discretion. In Contee v. United States, 133 U.S. App.D.C. 261, 262, 410 F.2d 249, 250 (1969), we said: \u201c * * * the trial court should be alert to the need for separate trials whenever the accused proposes to present an insanity defense regardless of whether defense counsel makes an initial request or an initially sufficient showing of need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">Ordinarily, where the defense on the merits is confined to putting the government to its proof, failure to order bifurcation is not regarded as an abuse of discretion. See Parman v. United States, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 188, 399 F.2d 559, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 858, 89 S.Ct. 109, 21 L.Ed.2d 126 (1968). However, we have recognized as in United States v. Bennett, 148 U.S.App.D.C. 364, 460 F.2d 872 (1972), that an entire defense may be prejudiced by the intermingling at trial the insanity defense with the defense on the merits. In- Bennett\u2019s case, the testimony of the government psychiatrist that Bennett had a very good recollection of the events and that he recalled minutely what happened prior to the offense was deemed prejudicial. It is obvious that bifurcation would have been the preferable course in Bennett\u2019s case. It is also obvious that a serious question was raised under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 by the admission of such testimony. We held that reversal was required for that and other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-12\">Here, no abuse of discretion has been shown. Additionally, the obvious way to avoid confusion in instructing a jury on the standard of proof required of one interposing insanity as a defense, namely, by a preponderance of the evidence, is to bifurcate the insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-14\">PREMEDITATED MURDER OF A FEDERAL OFFICER</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-15\">Appellant raises a question whether the procedure followed under the 1970 amendments of the D.C.Code were rightly applied to his trial under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 (count 1), for premeditated murder of a federal officer. The general Federal rule provides that once the defendant has adduced appropriate evidence concerning the insanity de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>fense, the burden is on the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not have such mental disease in order to prove him guilty of having committed such an offense. Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895). A question arises as to whether the <em>Davis </em>rule, which was applicable to all other federal district courts, is inapplicable to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, by virtue of the 1970 amendment to the D.C.Code, when that court is engaged in the trial of an indictment charging violation of a federal murder statute, i. e., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114. The question raises serious issues, compare United States v. Thompson, 147 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 452 F.2d 1333 (1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 998, 92 S.Ct. 1251, 31 L.Ed.2d 467 (1972). We do not think it necessary to decide that issue in this case, however, because of the concurrent sentences for felony murder under the D.C.Code, and accordingly, we think it in the interest of justice to follow the practice set forth in the Hooper<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> line of cases, and will vacate the judgment on Count 1. We discern no prejudice to the government and this course obviates the need for ruling in this case on an issue that should be decided only where it is truly material to the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">RESCUE OF A FEDERAL PRISONER IN VIOLATION OF 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 572(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">Appellant attacks the conviction under this section of Title 18 on the same basis as his attack on Count 1 (premeditated murder of a Federal officer). The trial court sentenced the defendant LaVance Greene consecutively under this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">The sentence imposed by the trial court for the offense of rescue was consecutive to the sentence imposed for felony murder and armed robbery. In Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, at 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), the Court set forth the controlling rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-10\">Each of the offenses created requires proof of a different element. The applicable rule is that, where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a .fact which the other does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-11\">Here, the charge of felony murder (Count 3) includes every essential fact element of the rescue charge. For the reasons set forth in United States v. Benn, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 180, 476 F.2d 1127 (D.C. Cir. 1972, as amended March 8, 1973), we conclude that there has been a merger between the felony alleged as part of the felony murder in Count 3 and that a consecutive sentence for the felony of rescue is improper and that therefore the conviction of the rescue offense charged in count 5 of the indictment should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-12\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-13\">ARMED ROBBERY CONVICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AA3\">LaVance Greene\u2019s four armed robbery convictions, as a result of which he was given a concurrent sentence of 15 years to life, followed adequate instructions by the court on the essential elements of these offenses and are predicated upon clear evidence appearing in the record and since they are local offenses, the defense of insanity is controlled by the recent act of Congress to which reference has been made previously. The armed robbery counts are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">ESCAPE</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\"> Randolph Greene, the prisoner from Lewisburg Penitentiary who received permission to come to Washington under guard to attend his father\u2019s funeral, challenges his conviction of escape under section 751 of Title 18, United States Code. He affirmatively stated in open Court that he did not wish to have his counsel interpose the defense of insanity. He challenges his conviction, however, on two separate grounds. First, the government was permitted to show th\u00e1t he had on a prior occasion attempted to escape from confinement. It has long been recognized that one\u2019s motive, design, or intent may be shown by' reference to prior criminal conduct not charged in the indictment. See Drew v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 11, 331 F.2d 85 (1964), and United States v. Bobbitt, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 224, 450 F.2d 685 (1971). Randolph Greene\u2019s other objection is that he was coerced to go with his brother who was armed and directed him to leave the church and to go up the street. He states that his act in leaving the church was not voluntary and in support of that relies on the testimony of one witness who said there was nothing else he could do, and another witness who says he heard him say:\u2019 \u201cMy God, man, not this.\u201d Evidence to the contrary, relied on by the government and accepted by the jury, shows that when one of the marshals seated near Randolph Greene questioned him concerning the identity of the man who came into the church in the middle of the services, went to the casket, and after making the sign of the cross spoke to Randolph Greene\u2019s mother before leaving the church. He answered, I don\u2019t know; I\u2019ve never seen him before. That man was the defendant LaVance Greene. When directed to leave the church, the first thing Randolph told LaVance Greene was, \u201cLook out, there\u2019s another one of them outside.\u201d Further evidence of voluntary participation in the escape was Randolph Greene\u2019s question to his brother: \u201cWhich way shall we go?\u201d Further evidence to the vol-untariness of the act was that Randolph Greene followed after LaVance Greene. In the final analysis, the jury was properly and adequately instructed as to the essential elements of escape and clearly there was evidence on the basis of which the jury was justified in finding Randolph Greene guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">As to appellant LaVance Greene, the judgments on counts 1 and 5 are vacated, the judgments on counts 3, 7, 9, 11, and 13 are affirmed. The judgment as to Randolph Greene is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-10\">ON APPELLANT\u2019S SUGGESTION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-11\">Before BAZELON, Chief Judge, and WRIGHT, McGOWAN, TAMM, LEV-ENTHAL, ROBINSON, MaeKINNON, ROBB and WILKEY, Circuit Judges, sitting en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-12\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-13\">Appellant has filed a petition for rehearing <em>en banc. </em>On consideration thereof, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-14\">Ordered by the Court <em>en banc </em>that the suggestion for rehearing <em>en banc </em>is denied, a majority of the Circuit Judges who are in regular active service not having voted in favor of it (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-15\">Circuit Judges J.

In <em>Butera </em>the challenge was directed at juries drawn by the key man system prior to the effective date of the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968. It was, after hearing, rejected.

Counsel candidly concede the point was decided adversely to them by this court in Hill v. United States. They request reexamination of that case and the later cases in which it has been cited. We have reexamined the matter and are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>persuaded to change the ruling. The statutory definition is the common-law definition as given by Blackstone and by Coke. In this jurisdiction it was held by Judge Cox in Guiteau\u2019s Case that the quoted phrase means merely \u2018a responsibly sane mind\u2019. The Hill case, supra, was followed in others.

The result is a revolving door which, as now Chief Justice Burger explained in rejecting such an outcome in Overholser v. O\u2019Beirne, [112 U.S.App.D.C. 267, 276, 302 F.2d 852, 861 (1961)] allows defendants \u201cto have it both ways\u201d \u2014 to escape both conviction and commitment to a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-12\">\u201cThe Committee considers this result intolerable.

The issues in this case are not simple, and can be argued both ways. Whether the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>should be heard en banc, however, depends on an appraisal of the basic rulings. The fundamental issue is whether appellant Greene was entitled to have the Government prove his sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. Judge Bazelon is quite right in saying that this poses a substantial issue of due process. However, orderly resolution of that issue is furthered if this intermediate appellate court applies the only direct Supreme Court precedent, Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 96 L.Ed. 1302 (1951), leaving the way open for appellant to apply to the Supreme Court to obtain reconsideration of that precedent, and assessment of its current vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">As to the other broad question of equal protection, it should be emphasized that the panel opinion does not, repeat not, hold that a prosecution for U.S.Code crimes will be governed by the new D.C. Code provision shifting the burden to the defendant on the insanity issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whether some of the panel rulings are discerned by others to be correct, they are arguable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and relatively narrow, and do not now warrant en banc consideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">.

This case does not involve the problem of United States v. Thompson, 147 U.S.App. D.C. 1, 452 F.2d 1333 (1971), and I at least would have grave difficulty with an assertion that the legislature could require, in a prosecution under the national criminal code, that one Federal district court must deny important protections granted to defendants by other Federal district courts. United States (federal) Criminal Code, on the other. It also involves a due process challenge to a recent amendment to the D.C.Code requiring a defendant to prove his insanity defense by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-14\">For disarming several federal marshals, and then shooting one of them as he assisted his brother to escape, La Vance Greene was convicted of two U.S. Code offenses \u2014 -premeditated murder of a federal officer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and assisting a federal prisoner to escape; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he was also convicted of five D.C.Code offenses \u2014 felony murder,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and four counts of armed robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury rejected a plea of insanity after being instructed in accordance with the recently enacted D.C. Code provision requiring a defendant to establish his plea by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-15\">The court affirms all of appellant\u2019s D.C.Code convictions, and vacates all of his U.S.Code convictions. A brief summary of the court\u2019s holdings, and my views thereon, which I will address more fully below, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-16\">I. The court holds that the D.C.Code felony murder statute applies to U.S. Code felonies. (Court\u2019s opinion at 1150, 1151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-17\">In my view:</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-18\">A. The court\u2019s reasons do not support its interpretation of the D.C. Code felony murder statute, and there are strong reasons for limiting the statute to local offenses. (Pp. 1161-1164.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>B. If the D.C.Code felony murder provision applies to federal offenses, it is a denial of equal protection. (Pp. 1164-1165.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">C. This court\u2019s decision in United States v. Canty<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires vacation</p>\n<p id=\"ACI\">of appellant\u2019s D.C. felony murder conviction irrespective of the general application of the D.C. felony murder provision. (Pp. 1166-1165.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">II. The court expressly recognizes that the federal premeditated murder conviction, for which sentence was imposed concurrently with the sentence on the D.C.Code felony murder conviction, raises a serious constitutional question. To avoid this serious issue, it vacates the federal homicide conviction under the <em>Hooper </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Court\u2019s opinion at 1157-1158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">It also vacates the federal conviction for assisting escape because, as the underlying felony of the felony murder conviction, it merges into the felony murder. (Court\u2019s opinion at 1158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">In my view:</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">A. The court\u2019s use of <em>Hooper </em>is an improper exercise of appellate discretion. (Pp. 1166-1167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">B. It is manifestly improper to merge an underlying felony with a felony murder conviction. (Pp. 1168-1169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">III. The court concludes that it need not decide whether the D.C.Code provision governing the burden of proof on an insanity plea can apply to federal offenses since it has vacated both of appellant\u2019s U.S.Code convictions. (Court\u2019s opinion at 1153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">In my view:</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-14\">A. The court has not vacated <em>all </em>of appellant\u2019s federal offenses, because it has affirmed his D.C.Code felony murder conviction for a homicide that occurred in the commission of a <em>federal </em>offense. (P. 1170.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-19\">B. The court was required to consider the application of the D.C. burden of proof statute to federal offenses even if there were <em>no </em>U.S. Code offenses in the present case since the statute applies in \u201cany criminal proceeding in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia,\u201d which must include the trial of federal offenses. (Pp. 1170-1174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-20\">IV. The court finds that the D.C. Code burden of proof statute governing insanity pleas may constitutionally be applied to local offenses. (Court\u2019s opinion at 1152-1156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-21\">In my view:</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-22\">A. Even if it applied only to local offenses, the D.C. burden of proof statute would be a denial of equal protection. (Pp. 1173-1174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-23\">B. The D.C. burden of proof statute is a denial of due process. (Pp. 1174-1180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-25\">Appellant was convicted of felony murder under the D.C.Code for killing a deputy marshal while assisting a federal prisoner to escape in violation of the U. S.Code. The D.C.Code felony murder provision applies to homicides committed in the course of \u201cany offense punishable by imprisonment .in the penitentiary.\u201d The court finds that the words \u201cany offense\u201d were intended to include federal offenses, and that the statute so construed is not a denial of equal protection. It also fails to consider United States v. Canty,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which requires vacation of appellant\u2019s local felony murder conviction irrespective of the applicability or constitutionality of the D.C.Code felony murder statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-26\">A. STATUTORY ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AodD\">Until passage of the District of Columbia Court Reorganization Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>1970,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> all felonies committed in D.C., both local and federal, were tried in the federal district court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The 1970 Act created a court system \u201ccomparable to those in the States, separate and apart from the [federal court system].\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And the Supreme Court has stated that the local court system was established in order \u201c[to] handle criminal cases only under statutes that are applicable to the District of Columbia <em>alone,\u201d </em>and, therefore, a defendant tried in this jurisdiction is \u201cno more disadvantaged . than any other citizen of any of the 50 States who is tried for a <em>strictly local crime.\u201d </em>Palmore v. United States, 411 U.S. 389, 407, 410, 93 S.Ct. 1670, 1681, 1682, 36 L.Ed.2d 342 (1973) (emphasis supplied). Thus, the Court has made it plain that the Court Reorganization Act contemplates two separate court systems, each administering a separate code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Nevertheless, this court fails to consider this critical history of the Court Reorganization Act, and contrary to <em>Pal-more, </em>concludes that the two codes were generally intended to \u201cmesh with each other.\u201d It rests on the following three assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">First, it says:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-6\">\u201cThe Federal Criminal Code embodied in Title 18 and the District of Columbia Code of Title 22. were both enacted by Congress and were intended to exist together. Johnson v. United States, 225 U.S. 405 [32 S.Ct. 748, 56 L.Ed. 1142] (1912).\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1150.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">The court\u2019s claim that the two codes were intended to \u201cexist together,\u201d and its citation to <em>Johnson, </em>the case from which those words were taken, is plainly misleading since <em>Johnson </em>stands for the proposition that the two codes are \u201cseparate instruments\u201d that are <em>not </em>intended to mesh with each other. <em>Johnson </em>involved a challenge to the original D.C. Code, which was enacted in 1901,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on the ground that its homicide provision did not allow juries to prohibit capital punishment in murder cases. The United States Criminal Code, which was enacted in 1909,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> did permit juries to nullify capital punishment. Johnson claimed that the U.S.Code was intended to modify the D.C.Code since the original D.C.Code, still in force at the time of Johnson\u2019s case in 1912, provided that \u201cso far as [future] acts [of Congress] may vary from or conflict with any provision contained in this code, they are to have effect as subsequent statutes and as repealing any portion of this act inconsistent therewith.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court rejected this argument because \u201cCongress certainly in enacting the [1901] District Code, recognized the expediency of separate provisions for the District of Columbia,\u201d and \u201c[h]aving <em>definite territorial operation, </em>[the U.S. and D.C. Codes] can <em>exist together.\u201d </em>225 U.S. at 418-419, 32 S.Ct. at 752, 753 (emphasis supplied). As a general principle, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-13\">the effect of separation is important and necessarily had its purpose. The codes had in the main special spheres of operation and provisions accommodated to such spheres. 225 U.S. at 417, 32 S.Ct. at 752.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-14\">Thus, <em>Johnson </em>strongly undercuts this court\u2019s conclusion that the two codes were intended to <em>mesh. </em>On the contrary, it indicates that long before <em>Pal-more, </em>indeed since the inception of the two codes, they have been viewed as separate and independent instruments. This court ignores the <em>Johnson </em>holding, and simply lifts two words \u2014 \u201cexist together\u201d \u2014 from the decision, and cites them wholly out of context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-15\">The court\u2019s second assertion is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-16\">\u201cWe believe further that [the two codes] were intended to mesh with each other, and that they have been so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>construed in the past. [Citations omitted.]\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1150.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">The court relies solely upon some early eases in this Circuit which held that the federal conspiracy statute could charge conspiracies to violate the D.C.Code as well as conspiracies to violate the federal code.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It implies that because this one section has been held to apply across the two codes, Congress generally intended them to mesh. The D.C.Code felony murder provision, however, has been in effect for over seventy years, and the court cites no case, nor have I been able to find any case, in which it has been applied to a federal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Moreover, application of the federal conspiracy statute to local offenses filled an important need: conspiracies to violate the provisions of the D.C.Cdde would otherwise have gone unpunished, because prior to the Court Reorganization Act of 1970 <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the D.C.Code lacked a general conspiracy section. No such lacuna has ever existed with respect to the homicide sections of the two codes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, appellant was convicted under both the local felony murder provision, and the federal premeditated murder statute, for the same killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">Finally, application of the federal conspiracy statute to local offenses raises no serious equal protection issues since the result is solely to allow punishment for those who conspire to violate the D.C. Code. In effect, Congress enacted a local conspiracy statute and placed it in the federal code. Since Congress has not punished such conspiracies differently under any other provision there is no potential constitutional infirmity. Application of the D.C.Code felony murder provision to U.S.Code offenses, on the other hand, raises a serious equal protection problem that will be discussed below.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">Finally, the court asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1245-11\">\u201cTo adopt appellant\u2019s construction would lead to an anomalous result, one that Congress could not conceivably have intended. If one [committed a killing] during the course of a robbery on the street in front of a bank, he could be prosecuted for felony murder under the D.C.Code, but if during the course of a robbery in a bank a killing occurred, that robber could not be prosecuted for felony murder under the D.C.Code.\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1151.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-12\">I assume the court is claiming that it would be anomalous to hold the D.C. felony murder statute applicable to all robberies committed in D.C. except bank robberies. Congress, however, has made it a federal crime \u2014 applicable in D.C. as well as every other jurisdiction \u2014 to commit a homicide in the course of any bank robbery.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There is nothing anomalous about punishing, on the one hand, purely local robberies (and any homicides that occur in the course of their commission) under the D.C.Code, and, on the other hand, punishing those robberies and homicides that are of national concern under the U.S.Code, even if they all take place in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-13\">On the contrary, it is the court\u2019s interpretation of the D.C. felony murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>statute, not appellant\u2019s, that leads to an anomalous result: namely that Congress intended to punish homicides that occur in the course of a bank robbery more severely in D.C. than in the remainder of the country. The D.C. felony, murder statute, which the court holds applicable to federal bank robberies, carries a mandatory life sentence with parole eligibility only after twenty years,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> whereas the federal bank robbery statute\u2019s felony murder provision carries a sentence of ten years to life imprisonment,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> with parole eligibility after one third of any sentence is served, but in no case beyond fifteen years.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">In sum, the court\u2019s three assertions simply do not support its conclusion. Indeed, at least the first and third justifications appear to cut the other way. Moreover, the court ignores our opinion in United States v. Thompson, 147 U.S. App.D.C. 1, 452 F.2d 1333 (1971). There, appellant had been convicted of two U.S.Code violations in this jurisdiction, and was seeking release pending appeal. He argued that his petition for release should be governed by the federal bail statute.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The government urged that it be judged under the harsher standards of the D.C.Code bail statute which applies to anyone \u201cconvicted of <em>any criminal offense </em>committed in the District of Columbia . in violation of an Act of Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We held that this provision was intended to apply only to those convicted of <em>D.C. Code offenses. </em>Thus, the court\u2019s decision in this ease violates the spirit, if not the holding, of <em>Thompson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-16\">B. EQUAL PROTECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-17\">Reading the D.C. felony murder statute to include U.S. felonies raises a serious equal protection issue that the court simply fails to confront.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In the court\u2019s view, Congress intended to punish someone who kills a federal marshal while escaping (or assisting another to escape) in the District of Columbia under the D.C.Code felony murder statute, as well as under the federal murder and escape statutes, whereas in every other jurisdiction Congress intended to punish exactly the same conduct solely under the two federal statutes, neither of which has an applicable felony murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>provision.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As a result, Congress has imposed a <em>mandatory </em>sentence of twenty years to life in D.C. for the same conduct as to which it has imposed a sentence ranging from \u201cany term of years\u201d to a <em>maximum </em>of fifteen years to life in every other jurisdiction.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\">In <em>Thompson, supra, </em>we held that when Congress establishes \u201cdiscriminatory classifications affecting District residents\u201d with respect to federal crimes, equal protection requires that \u201cthe justification offered must actually be <em>convincing.\u201d </em>452 F.2d at 1341 (emphasis in original). Yet this court does not suggest even a colorable legislative justification for imposing greatly disparate sentences for the same conduct.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The simple fact \u2014 one that apparently eludes the court \u2014 is that the <em>only </em>reason to apply the D.C.Code to conduct that has already been made criminal under the U.S.Code is to increase sentences solely for those who commit their crimes in this jurisdiction.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">C. UNITED STATES v. CANTY</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">Even if the D.C. felony murder statute may validly include federal offenses, our decision in United States v. Canty, 152 U.S.App.D.C. 103, 469 F.2d 114 (1972), which the court ignores, requires dismissal of appellant\u2019s D.C.Code felony murder conviction.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In <em>Canty, </em>the defendant committed a bank robbery while armed. He could have been charged with violating section \u201cd\u201d of the federal bank robbery statute (bank robbery while armed),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> which carries a twenty-five year maximum sentence. Instead, he was charged with simple bank robbery under the federal statute,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> which carries a twenty year maximum sentence, and assault with a deadly weapon under the D.C.Code,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> which carries a ten year maximum. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>sum, by going outside the federal bank robbery statute, and charging in part under the D.C.Code, the government was able to increase the defendant\u2019s potential maximum sentence from 25 to 30 years. We vacated the D.C.Code assault conviction, holding that the government is prohibited from \u201cventuring outside the federal scheme,\u201d and thereby \u201ccircumvent[ing its] carefully crafted hierarchy of penalties.\u201d 469 F.2d at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">In the present case, appellant was charged with one count of premeditated murder under the federal code, which carries a mandatory sentence of 15 years to life, and also one count of felony murder under the D.C.Code, which carries a mandatory sentence of 20 years to life. The federal homicide statute, like the federal bank robbery statute in <em>Canty, </em>is carefully subdivided to cover varying degrees of the same offense; it includes two degrees of murder, two types of manslaughter, and attempted murder and manslaughter, and each crime carries a different penalty. Hence, the only reason for the government to go outside this \u201ccarefully crafted federal scheme,\u201d and charge under the D.C. Code, was to increase appellant\u2019s minimum sentence by at least five years.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Canty </em>prohibits this.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">The court affirms appellant\u2019s D.C. Code felony murder conviction without discussion of (1) a grave equal protection problem, (2) the Court Reorganization Act, (3) the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Patmore, </em>and (4) our decisions in <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Canty </em>\u2014 all of which require dismissal of the D.C.Code felony murder conviction. Moreover, it does so gratuitously since appellant was also convicted of premeditated murder under the federal homicide statute for the same killing, and the sentences on the D.C. and federal murder convictions were imposed concurrently. In the face of all this, one must wonder why this court pursued the course it did. I think we can glean some light from parts V and VI of its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">JI</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">In part V, the court concludes that it has the discretion to vacate appellant\u2019s federal premeditated murder conviction under the <em>Hooper </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <em>Hooper </em>is a judicially created doctrine of appellate discretion allowing vacation of a conviction raising \u201can issue not governed by controlling precedent,\u201d when the sentence imposed on it is concurrent with a sentence on a valid conviction. 432 F.2d at 606. In this cas\u00e9, the sentence on the federal premeditated murder conviction was concurrent with the sentence on the D.C. felony murder conviction, and the court found that the federal conviction \u201craises serious issues.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> in part VI, the court holds that it is required to vacate the federal conviction for assisting escape because it was the underlying felony of the D.C. felony murder conviction, and therefore merges into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">Thus, by affirming the D.C.Code felony murder conviction, the court believes that it is able to vacate both of appellant\u2019s federal convictions. This affirm-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>anee notwithstanding, I think that it was an unwise use, if not an abuse, of discretion to vacate the federal murder conviction, and that it borders on the ridiculous to merge the federal assisting escape conviction into the local felony murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">A. THE FEDERAL PREMEDITATED MURDER CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Appellant attacked this conviction claiming that application of the D.C. statute \u2014 which requires a defendant to establish his plea of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 to federal offenses tried in this jurisdiction is a denial of equal protection because in every other federal trial the prosecution must prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Acknowledging the power of this argument, the court vacates the federal murder conviction for the reason given in <em>Hooper </em>that \u201c[i]t better serves the general interest of the administration of justice if the court limits its resources to the determination of those questions and cases that must be decided, especially in light of the ever-mounting docket that besets this and other appellate courts.\u201d 432 F.2d at 606. <em>Hooper </em>states, however, that a conviction raising a difficult issue should be vacated only when \u201cno present public interest or need is furthered\u201d by resolution of the issue. The issue that triggered the use of the <em>Hooper </em>doctrine in this case is whether the D.C. burden of proof statute can be applied to federal offenses. That issue is bound to recur frequently. By postponing its resolution, and thereby allowing application of the D.C. statute governing burden of proof to trials in our federal district court, we undercut both justice <em>and </em>efficiency. Since many convictions will be secured under this questionable statute, there will be strong incentive for upholding it in order to avoid reversals; and, if wholesale reversals are ultimately required, we will suffer the burden of many time-consuming retrials. The simple fact \u2014 which again appears to elude the court \u2014 is that when the constitutionality' of a statute of general application is called into question, justice and fairness require an expeditious resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-11\"><em>Hooperizing </em>appellant\u2019s federal murder conviction can perhaps be viewed as indicative of a strong, albeit misguided, commitment to judicial restraint. That same restraint, however, is not evidenced in other parts of the opinion. Appellant also challenged his grand and petit juries, claiming in part that \u201cyoung people\u201d were inadequately represented in violation of the federal jury selection statute.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Although the court denies this claim because it was not timely raised in the trial court, it proceeds to expound its view that \u201cyoung persons\u201d should not be considered a cognizable group for jury composition, and concludes:</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-12\">We have thought it useful to discuss problems presented by appellant\u2019s thesis even though, in view of the lack of timely objection, we do not decide this matter on the merits. (Court\u2019s opinion at 1150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-13\">The court reached out for this issue on an admittedly \u201cinadequate record,\u201d and despite the lack of controlling precedent in this jurisdiction and a decision of a Sister Circuit holding \u201cyouth\u201d to be a cognizable class for jury selection as a matter of <em>constitutional </em>law.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-14\">Thus, contrary to <em>Hooper, </em>and on an issue that was clearly not before it, the court devoted its \u201ctime and energies to the research, and opinion writing, incident to appropriate determination of an issue not governed by controlling precedent.\u201d 432 F.2d at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>B. THE FEDERAL ASSISTING ESCAPE CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"Aieu\">Since the sentence imposed for this federal conviction was consecutive to the sentence for the D.C. felony murder conviction, the court was unable to <em>Hooperize </em>it in order to avoid deciding the constitutionality of the D.C. burden of proof statute governing insanity as it applies to federal offenses. The court does find, however, that the D.C. \u201ccharge of felony murder [while assisting an escape] includes every essential fact element of the [federal assisting escape] charge,\u201d and concludes, therefore, that there has been a \u201cmerger between the felony alleged as part of the felony murder,\u201d and vacates the federal assisting escape conviction. (Court\u2019s opinion at 1158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">The government itself pointed out in its petition for rehearing<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> that this merger was predicated on a wholly erroneous understanding of the felony murder doctrine.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> At common law, homicides were divided into two categories, murder and manslaughter, with murder requiring a showing of \u201cmalice.\u201d Any homicide committed in the course of a felony was considered murder because malice could be implied from the commission of the felony.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> When homicides were further subdivided by statute into first degree murder, second degree murder and manslaughter,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> the doctrine of felony murder was preserved, and the underlying felony was viewed as providing the \u201cpremeditation\u201d and \u201cdeliberation\u201d otherwise required for first degree murder, as well as malice, where necessary.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-12\">Given this rationale for the felony murder doctrine, it strains credulity to hold that the underlying felony merges into the felony murder.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The statute proscribing the underlying felony \u2014 robbery, for example \u2014 is designed to protect a wholly different societal interest from the felony murder statute, which is intended to protect against homicide.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>The underlying felony is an essential element of felony murder only because without it the homicide might be second degree murder or manslaughter.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Clearly, neither manslaughter nor second degree murder merges with any other felony like robbery or assisting a prisoner to escape.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">This analysis undoubtedly accounts for the court\u2019s failure to cite a single case suggesting that a felony murder and the underlying felony merge.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Indeed, it explains why this court has affirmed both the underlying felony and the felony murder in countless cases.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">In short, to avoid deciding whether the D.C.Code burden of proof statute governing the insanity plea can be applied to U.S.Code offenses, the court affirms appellant\u2019s D.C.Code felony murder conviction, and vacates his U.S.Code convictions for premeditated murder and assisting escape. Thus far, I have tried to show that well-settled judicial doctrine required the court to do the opposite of what it has done: namely, to vacate the D.C.Code felony murder conviction, and decide if the application of the D'.C. burden of proof statute to appellant\u2019s federal offenses was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-14\">The court\u2019s failure to adhere to established legal doctrine was by no means inconsequential. Even if the D.C.Code burden of proof provision was properly applied to appellant\u2019s federal offenses, the course taken by the court increased his minimum sentence by more than three years.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> And, if the burden of proof could not be applied to his federal offenses, appellant is entitled to a new trial on the insanity phase of his convictions<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> under a more favorable burden of proof.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-15\">The court\u2019s tortured course was not only prejudicial to appellant, it was also of no avail. In the following section I will show that even if the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>been correct in taking each of the steps discussed so far, it was still required to decide whether the D.C. burden of proof statute could apply to federal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">In Part III, the court upholds the application of the insanity burden of proof statute to D.C.Code offenses, and also decides \u201cto put to one side [the questions of] whether those provisions were intended to or can have application to a prosecution in the District Court of [a federal offense].\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1153.) It is able to do this, it believes, because it has vacated appellant\u2019s federal convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">Notwithstanding these vacations, I believe the court was required to consider whether the D.C. burden of proof statute could apply to federal offenses for two reasons: first, because it has wittingly or unwittingly approved the statute\u2019s application to a federal offense by affirming appellant\u2019s D.C. felony murder conviction for a homicide committed in the course of a <em>federal </em>offense; and second, because if the D.C. burden of proof statute cannot constitutionally be applied to federal offenses, the whole statute, including' its application to D.C. Code offenses, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-13\">A. D.C.CODE FELONY MURDER WHILE COMMITTING A FEDERAL OFFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"A95\">The court affirms appellant\u2019s D.C. Code felony murder conviction on the ground that the D.C. burden of proof statute can be applied to local offenses. The underlying felony of the felony murder conviction, however, was the <em>federal </em>offense of assisting a prisoner to escape; without proof of this federal offense, the felony murder conviction necessarily fails.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus, it is clear that on this U.S.Code offense appellant had the burden under the D.C. statute to prove his sanity by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-14\">B. BASIC PRINCIPLES OF EQUAL PROTECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-15\">Even without any federal convictions before it, the court was required to consider whether the D.C. burden of proof statute could apply to U.S.Code offenses. Appellant argued first that the statute in plain terms applies to \u201cany criminal proceeding in the District Court,\u201d which obviously includes the trial of federal offenses;<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> on this point, the government agreed.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Second, he claimed that such a legislative classification is either underinclusive<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> because it does not apply to federal crimes tried in other jurisdictions, or overinclusive<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>does not apply exclusively to D.C.Code offenses, and that for either reason, it is a denial of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">In the face of this challenge, the court\u2019s decision to \u201cput to one side\u201d the applicability of the D.C. burden of proof statute to federal offenses evidences a misunderstanding of basic equal protection analysis. By claiming that the D.C. burden of proof statute is overinclusive because it applies to federal offenses tried in the District of Columbia, appellant acknowledges that Congress might well be able to enact a burden of proof statute limited to local offenses,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> unless of course it would be a violation of due process.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Congress, however, has chosen to pass a <em>different </em>statute. And by failing to consider the overinclusive aspect of that statute, this court has decided to \u201cmake a new law, not to enforce an old one\u201d; and \u201cthis,\u201d the Supreme Court has held, \u201cis no part of our duty.\u201d <footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Obviously, every equal protection challenge could be rejected if a court is willing to ignore the existing statutory classification.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">By failing to address the equal protection issue, the court forces us to choose between two unacceptable alternatives. Either we can read the D.C. burden of proof statute to apply only to local offenses, or we can hold that its application to federal offenses is not a denial of equal protection. Limiting the statute to local offenses is not only contrary to its language<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and legislative history,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>but also leads to the imposition of two different burdens of proof on the issue of sanity<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> when federal and local offenses are joined in federal district court.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">On the other hand, holding that the statute may apply to U.S.Code offenses tried in this jurisdiction requires us to find that the \u201cjustification offered\u201d by Congress for limiting its application to federal offenses tried in the District is \u201cactually <em>convincing.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>69</em></footnotemark><em> Thompson, supra, </em>452 F.2d at 1341. The justification offered<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> was our decision in Bolton v. Harris, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 395 F.2d 642 (1968), where we held that the government could not <em>automatically </em>commit for long term treatment those found not guilty by reason of insanity; first, it had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they were mentally ill and dangerous at the time of commitment.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Congress feared that <em>Bolton </em>would allow \u201cdangerous criminals, particularly psychopaths to win acquittals of serious criminal charges on grounds of insanity by raising a mere reasonable doubt as to their sanity and then to escape hospital commitment because the government is unable to prove their insanity following acquittal by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d-<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> This reasoning rests on a misapprehension about how the insanity defense has been administered in this jurisdiction.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Even if it were a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>able concern, however, it is inadequate as a justification for a classification distinguishing between D.C. and other jurisdictions. In D.C. there is a statutory-procedure, applicable to both local and federal offenses, that permits post-trial confinement of those found not guilty by reason of insanity.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> No such statute applies to federal offenses tried in other jurisdictions, where an accused found not guilty by reason of insanity is <em>released.'</em><footnotemark><em>75</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He may, of course, be committed pursuant to a state civil commitment statute,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> but no state permits long term civil commitment unless the <em>state </em>establishes mental illness by at least a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Therefore, there is no justification, let alone a convincing one, for singling out the District of Columbia, and applying a different burden of proof on federal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">Thus, the court in the present case\u2014 by failing to consider the equal protection issue raised by the D.C. burden of proof statute \u2014 has forced us to choose in subsequent cases between two wholly unacceptable choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-13\">The court finally affirms appellant\u2019s D.C.Code felony murder conviction and his D.C.Code robbery convictions, all of which rested on the application of the D.C.Code provision placing .the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>on the defendant to establish his insanity defense by a preponderance of the evidence. It holds that the burden of proof statute is neither a denial of equal protection nor due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">A. EQUAL PROTECTION</p>\n<p id=\"At1N\">The court summarily concludes that the application of a burden of proof standard for D.C.Code offenses different from that for federal offenses is not a denial of equal protection because \u201c[i]n enacting local criminal statutes [for the District of Columbia], Congress need not hew to the same path it elects in defining criminal offenses of nationwide applicability.\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1153.) Rather than resting upon this sort of <em>ipse dixit, </em>it seems to me that equal protection requires some consideration of the reasons that would permit the same legislature to impose a burden of proof for the trial of D.C. crimes that is different from the one applied in the trial of federal crimes.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">While I am troubled that the court fails to conclude that Congress is barred from enacting a different burden of proof statute for D.C.Code offenses, I am even more concerned that the court thinks the question unworthy of serious consideration. The District of Columbia, which is over seventy percent black,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> is wholly disfranchised. Traditionally, this would call forth a higher standard of equal protection scrutiny.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> In this jurisdiction, however, it appears that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">B. DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"aqf-dedup-1\">The court also rejects appellant\u2019s argument that any statute, irrespective of application, requiring a defendant to prove his insanity is a denial of due process. Appellant relies on In Re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), which held that the government must \u201cpro[ve] beyond a reasonable doubt . . . every fact necessary to constitute the crime,\u201d and claims that sanity is such a fact. In rejecting this contention, the court advances several arguments, reasons, and cases, which I shall examine in some detail. First, however, it is helpful to place the question in its proper historical context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-12\">In 1895, Justice Harlan writing for a unanimous Supreme Court reversed a murder conviction because the trial court had instructed the jury that \u201cthe burden of proof of the insanity rests with the defendant.\u201d Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469, 477, 16 S.Ct. 353, 354, 40 L.Ed. 499. The Court found that sanity was an \u201cessential fact\u201d of the crime of murder, and that the burden was on the prosecution \u201cto show beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 16 S.Ct. at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-13\">In 1952, the Court upheld the constitutionality of an Oregon statute requiring the defendant to prove his insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 96 L. Ed. 1302, and indicated that <em>Davis </em>was not a constitutional holding, \u201cbut only the rule to be followed in federal courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797, 72 S.Ct. at 1007. Justices Frankfurter and Black dissented, arguing that, by definition, a homicide without sanity is not a murder. They noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>that \u201c[t]his duty of the State of establishing every fact of the equation which adds up to a crime, and of establishing it to the satisfaction of a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is the decisive difference between criminal culpability and civil liability.\u201d Id. at 805, 72 S.Ct. at 1011. After <em>Leland, </em>we continued to apply the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard in this jurisdiction.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-4\">Finally, in 1970, in <em>Winship, </em>which involved an adjudication of juvenile delinquency,<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> the Court went beyond the factual context of the case before it to hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-5\">Lest there remain any doubt about the constitutional stature of the reasonable-doubt standard, we explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon <em>proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. </em>397 U.S. at 364, 90 S.Ct. at 1073 (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">Due to the intentionally broad holding of <em>Winship, </em>the question for this court in deciding whether the D.C. burden of proof statute violates due process is whether <em>Winship </em>overrules. <em>Leland sub silentio </em><footnotemark>83</footnotemark> \u2014 that is, whether \u201csanity\u201d is a \u201cfact necessary to constitute the crime.\u201d <em>Davis </em>held that sanity was such a fact. Indeed, it is at least instructive that in setting out its holding the <em>Winship </em>Court returned to the <em>Davis </em>formulation of \u201cevery fact necessary to constitute the crime.\u201d This court fails to mention <em>Winship\u2019s </em>plain adoption of the <em>Davis </em>formulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-11\">The court offers nine justifications for its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-12\">\n<em>First:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-13\">\u201cWinship involved proof of facts \u2014 \u2018the occurrence of an event\u2019 \u2014 while insanity deals with proof of \u2018mental condition and propensity.\u2019 United States v. Brown, [155 U.S.App.D.C. 402, 478 F.2d 606, 609 (1973)].\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1155.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1257-14\">On the contrary, sanity, as <em>Davis </em>clearly indicates, has always been a factual question, and nothing else. The panel cites no cases, and I believe there are no cases, suggesting that sanity, unlike the act in question, is not a factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-15\">The court\u2019s reliance on United States v. Brown is misplaced. When <em>Brown </em>refers to \u201cmental condition and propensity,\u201d it is explicitly describing \u201cdangerousness,\u201d which is, presumably, a present status indicative of future behavior.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Insanity, on the other hand, involves the same sort of factual inquiry needed to determine premeditation, deliberation, and intent, all of which are clearly covered by <em>Winship </em><footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-16\">\n<em>Second:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-17\">\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Win-ship </em>cited with approval a group of prior decisions, including Leland v. Oregon.\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1155.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"And\">The Court did cite <em>Leland </em>once, (as part of a string citation that included <em>Davis), </em>but only to support a proposition that can hardly comfort my brethren:</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-18\">Expressions in many opinions of this Court indicate that it has long been assumed that proof of a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>charge beyond a reasonable doubt is constitutionally required. 397 U.S. at 362, 90 S.Ct. at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">Immediately thereafter, the Court quotes approvingly from the <em>Leland dissent:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-5\">[i]t is the duty of the Government to establish . . . guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This notion \u2014 basic in our law and rightly one of the boasts of a free society \u2014 is a requirement and a safeguard of due process of law in the historic, procedural content of \u201cdue process.\u201d 397 U.S. at 362, 90 S.Ct. at 1071, <em>quoting </em>343 U.S. at 802-803, 72 S.Ct. 1002 (elipses in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">Then, further down the page, the <em>Win-ship </em>Court had this to say about <em>Davis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOQR\">In <em>Davis </em>a murder conviction was reversed because the trial judge instructed the jury that it was their duty to convict when the evidence was equally balanced regarding the sanity of the accused. This Court said: \u201cOn the contrary, he is entitled to an acquittal of the specific crime charged if upon all the evidence there is reasonable doubt whether he was capable in law of committing crime. . No man should be deprived of his life under the forms of law unless the jurors who try him are able, upon their consciences, to say that the evidence before them ... is sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.\u201d 397 U. S. at 362-363, 90 S.Ct. at 1072, <em>quoting in part </em>160 U.S. at 484, 493, 16 S.Ct. 353 (elipses in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1258-11\">These quotations are the heart of the Court\u2019s ruling on the burden of proof standard. They leave precious little doubt that <em>Winship </em>intended to include sanity within its constitutional holding.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-12\">\n<em>Third:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-13\">\u201cThe essential elements of the charge of felony murder do not include proof of sanity.\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1155/)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1258-14\">The D.C. burden of proof statute applies to all crimes, not just felony murder. Thus, the question before the court was whether sanity is generally an element of criminal behavior. Indeed, the court\u2019s summary affirmance of the application of the new burden of proof statute to appellant\u2019s robbery convictions indicates that it was not concerned with the elements of a particular offense in deciding the statute\u2019s constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-15\">Even if it was appropriate to decide the constitutionality of the statute by considering a particular offense, felony murder was an especially poor selection. Its statutory definition, unlike that of most crimes, requires the perpetrator to be \u201cof sound memory and discretion.\u201d 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2401. The court fails to consider this statutory definition when it discusses the constitutionality of the burden of proof statute as it applies to felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-16\">Earlier in its opinion, however, the court rejected appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that \u201cthe government must prove [sound memory and discretion]\u201d was error. The court suggested that this issue is \u201cwell-settled\u201d against appellant be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>cause several cases<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> have held that sound memory and discretion need not be alleged in the indictment. The cases cited by the court, however, all rely upon Hill v. United States, 22 App.D.C. 395 (D.C.Cir.1903), which, while holding that \u201csound memory and discretion\u201d need not be alleged in the <em>indictment, </em>also noted with approval that the trial judge had instructed the jury that they must find \u201cbeyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant . . . was a person of sound memory and discretion,\u201d and that the government \u201cestablish [ed] the fact of sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 22 App.D.C. at 408. Thus, whether the government need prove \u201csound memory and discretion\u201d in a felony murder case is hardly \u201cwell-settled.\u201d <footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">Thus, even if we were to read <em>Win-ship </em>not to include sanity within its holding, it might still be argued that once Congress chooses to make sanity a part of the statutory definition \u2014 as it has with felony murder \u2014 the government must prove the existence of this element beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-7\">\n<em>Fourth:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-8\">\u201cHere [unlike <em>Davis'], </em>the charge is felony murder, not common law murder, and accordingly, no proof of premeditation, deliberation, and malice is required.\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1156.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1259-9\">While this distinction between <em>Davis </em>and the present case is true, it is also irrelevant. <em>Davis, </em>of course, has never been limited to premeditated murder eases.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-10\">Moreover, the court\u2019s distinction between premeditated murder and felony murder cuts in the wrong direction, as the Supreme Court in <em>Leland, </em>and this court in United States v. Brawner, 153 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 471 F.2d 969 (1972) (en banc), seem to suggest. When the prosecution must prove \u201cpremeditation and deliberation\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury is allowed to consider the evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental illness in deciding whether the government has satisfied its burden on these cognitive factors, the government is required to make a significant showing on mental state and intent. Thus, in setting out the facts in <em>Leland, </em>the Court was careful to note that the trial judge had instructed the jury that the state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-15\">premeditation, deliberation, malice and intent, . . . [and] that the evidence adduced during this trial to prove defendant\u2019s insanity shall be considered ... in regard to the ability of the defendant to premeditate, form a purpose, to deliberate, act willfully, and act maliciously. 343 U.S. at 794-795, 72 S.Ct. at 1005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1259-18\">And in <em>Brawner, </em>in explaining why the jury should be allowed to consider the evidence of mental illness on the question of intent, we made specific reference to the effect of the recently enacted D.C. statute governing the burden of proof on insanity pleas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-19\">[T]o the extent that the [D.C. burden of proof statute] leads to a conviction of first degree murder when the evidence is in equipoise on the issue of insanity, there would be an additional miscarriage of justice if the evidence were not available for consideration as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>raising a reasonable doubt on the issue of premeditation and deliberation. 471 F.2d at 1002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">Appellant in this case was made to suffer precisely this \u201cadditional miscarriage of justice,\u201d although the court here makes no mention of it. His trial was conducted under the now defunct Fisher<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> doctrine, which prohibited the jury from considering the evidence of a defendant\u2019s mental illness in deciding whether the requisite mental state for murder existed. Indeed, the miscarriage of justice was even greater here since the trial court bifurcated appellant\u2019s trial over his objection; thus, the jury was wholly cut off from the evidence on appellant\u2019s mental state, and was unable to consider it even in the informal sense of jury notification tolerated in this jurisdiction <footnotemark>91</footnotemark> It is notorious that juries consider evidence of mental disorder to return verdicts for lesser degrees of homicide <footnotemark>92</footnotemark> as a compromise between a conviction of first degree murder and an acquittal by reason of insanity.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">Appellant challenged the trial court\u2019s action bifurcating the trial over his objection. This court simply holds that bifurcation is largely within the \u201cdiscretion\u201d of the trial court; it cites no case permitting bifurcation over the objection of the defense.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> More importantly, it does not consider how this problem is affected by the jury\u2019s widely known reluctance to accept an insanity plea, which is further aggravated by the fact that the <em>defendant </em>had to prove his insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-11\">Once again, then, even if we were to hold that due process does not generally require the prosecution to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt, it might well be argued that appellant was denied due process in this case because the jury was totally barred from weighing the evidence of his mental condition as bearing on the degree of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-12\">\n<em>Fifth:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-13\">\u201cIf [sanity were an essential element of felony murder], the Government would be required to produce evidence establishing sanity beyond a reasonable doubt as part of its direct case, before the defendant introduced an iota of testimony, and that is not and never has been the law. <em>Davis </em>in effect confirms [this] observation . . . for otherwise <em>Davis </em>would have required the prosecution to have proved sanity beyond a reasonable doubt as part of its direct case.\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1155, 1156.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1260-16\"><em>Davis </em>explicitly holds that sanity is a \u201cfact essential to constitute the crime,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his view is not at all inconsistent with the\u201d requirement that the government need not satisfy its burden until the accused produces \u201csome evidence\u201d of insanity.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> 160 U.S. at 485-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>486, 16 S.Ct. at 357.

Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 92 S.Ct. 619, 30 L.Ed.2d 618 (1972), in which the Court held that it was consistent with due process to determine the volun-tariness of a confession by a preponderance of the evidence rather than by proof beyond a reasonble doubt.\u201d (Court\u2019s opinion at 1155.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\"><em>Winship, </em>in plain terms, does not apply to the burden of proof required in testing the voluntariness of a confession. Thus, the question in <em>Lego </em>was whether to <em>extend Winship, </em>not whether to apply it. The Court decided not to extend it because \u201ca voluntariness hearing has nothing whatever to do with improving the reliability of jury verdicts.\u201d 404 U.S. at 486, 92 S.Ct. at 625. The insanity defense, on the other hand, has a great deal to do with \u201cthe reliability of jury verdicts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">\n<em>Seventh:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-9\">\u201c[In United States v.

The <em>Braver </em>court indicated, and the Supreme Court has subsequently reaffirmed,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> that if the prosecution proves propensity, the entrapment defense fails, irrespective of a showing of governmental inducement. Thus, inducement obviously negates no element of the crime since the crime can be proved notwithstanding such a showing. Propensity, on the other hand, bears directly on criminal intent; if propensity is not proved, proof of the crime fails. On propensity, as <em>Braver </em>noted, and as this court fails to mention, the government has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-15\">\n<em>Eighth:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-16\">\u201cIn Phillips v.

For what it is worth, however, the Nevada opinion explicitly rests on the \u201cwell-settled\u201d rule that \u201cinsanity is an affirmative proposition.\u201d <footnotemark>98</footnotemark> In this jurisdiction, we have repeatedly held that the insanity plea is more than an affirmative defense, and that at times the interest of justice requires the court or prosecution to raise the issue even over the objection of the defendant.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> In fact, the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>of proof statute in question provides that the defendant must prove his insanity \u201cregardless of who raises the issue.\u201d The court also notes that the Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari </em>in the Nevada ease, with only two Justices dissenting.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> The Supreme Court itself, however, has repeated countless times that a denial of <em>certiorari </em>\u201ccarries with it no support of the decision in that case, nor of any of the views in the opinion supporting it.\u201d Agoston v.

It would be hollow, to say the least, for us to look at the label attached to the question at issue in deciding if <em>Winship </em>was meant to apply. Such an approach would allow the state to require a defendant to prove his \u201calibi <em>defense\u201d </em>by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Compare </em>Stump v. Bennett, 398 F.2d 111 (8th Cir. 1968) (en banc) (violation of due process to require defendant to prove alibi defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-11\">Thus, the cases, propositions, and arguments marshalled by the court fail to support its conclusion that <em>Winship </em>does not require the government to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. On the contrary, almost without exception, they support precisely the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-13\">The issues in this case are critical to the fair administration of justice \u2014 for the prosecution<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> as well as the defense. Moreover, they are central to the proper functioning of the new relationship between the federal criminal system and the recently created D.C. system. Because of the importance of these matters, it was necessary in setting forth my views to show that the opinion of the court ignored controlling precedent,<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> misstated,<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> misrepresented<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> and misapplied<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> several authorities, and manifested a failure to understand basic principles of equal protection analysis <footnotemark>106</footnotemark> and the felony murder doc-trin\u00e9.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> It was my hope and expectation that the court would offer a reasoned response fully ventilating all of these issues.

The court does consider a different equal protection argument, raised by appellant, to the effect that the D.C.Code felony murder statute is a denial of equal protection because it applies to homicides committed during \u201cany offense,\u201d whereas the U.S.Code felony murder provision, applicable in \u201cthe special maritime and territorial jurisdiction\u201d of the United States, is limited to four felonies \u2014 rape, arson, burglary and robbery. The court rejects this argument, apparently relying upon the following analysis: (1) Virginia could enact a felony murder statute that applies to all homicides, including those committed during a federal offense; (2) Congress, legislating for the District of Columbia, has the same powers as the Virginia legislature; (3) therefore, the D.C. felony murder statute is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-14\">This syllogism indicates that the court misunderstands appellant\u2019s equal protection challenge. In the hypothetical constructed by the court, the Virginia legislature enacted a <em>single </em>felony murder statute. The gravamen of appellant\u2019s claim, on the other hand, is that Congress lacks adequate justification for enact-ting <em>two different </em>felony murder statutes, one for D.O., and one for the special maritime and territorial jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-19\">Although I am not persuaded by the court\u2019s analysis, I do agree with its conclusion that this particular equal protection claim is without merit. The federal maritime and territorial jurisdiction is limited to \u201cthe high seas,\u201d \u201cforts,\u201d \u201cU.S. aircraft,\u201d etc. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7 (1970). For these areas Congress has enacted a skeletal set of substantive criminal provisions, and therefore a limited felony murder statute. For D.C., however, Congress has enacted a broad code of offenses to deal with a more complex set of criminal problems, and therefore has also enacted a wider-reaching felony murder statute. Accordingly, there is no denial of equal protection. <em>See </em>Coleman v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 168, 334 F.2d 558, 565 (1964). <em>Compare </em>United States v.

I know of no principle of statutory construction that would allow us to limit the amendment to a different set of offenses than that covered by the section that it amends. Indeed, the court specifically relies on the fact that the amending portion of section 301 (j) is to be read as an integrated part of the whole section.

The data do not indicate which crimes were charged in these cases, hence it is not possible to determine whether these were \u201cserious offenses.\u201d Commentators, however, suggest that insanity acquittals are not won in serious cases, particularly murder trials. <em>See </em>Chernoff &amp; Schaffer, Defending the Mentally Ill: Ethical Quicksand, 10 Amer.Crim.L.Rev. 505, 510-11 &amp; n. 23 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-16\">Second, it appears that no one acquitted by reason of insanity has been released at a <em>Bolton </em>hearing <em>unless </em>Saint Elizabeths Hospital recommended release.

The Court\u2019s reasons for constitutionalizing the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard also demonstrate its intention to include sanity within the holding:</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-10\">The accused during a criminal prosecution has at stake interests of immense importance, <em>both </em>because of the possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of <em>the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the eonviction. </em>Accordingly, a society that values the good name and freedom of every individual should not <em>condemn </em>a man for commission of a crime when there is reasonable doubt about his guilt. 397 U.S. at 363-364, 90 S.Ct. at 1072. (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-18\">The rationale upon which the insanity defense rests is that a person who is unable to control himself at the time he commits an antisocial act should not be \u201ccondemned\u201d or \u201cstigmatized.\u201d <em>See </em>Holloway v.
