Bookcliff filed a third party complaint against MUD and prayed that judgment be rendered in its favor in any amount adjudged to be due from Bookcliff to plaintiff; and also for damages resulting from flooding of the project which was the subject of the construction contract. The controversy between Raymond International and Bookcliff was settled. The third party claim was tried before the court, which found the issues in favor of MUD and from the ensuing judgment Bookcliff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-19\">We have considered appellant\u2019s contentions and find them lacking sufficient substance to warrant interference with the district court\u2019s soundly reasoned opinion, which is reported at 347 F. Supp. 208 (D.Neb.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-20\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
