The Board also concluded that three employees had been discriminatorily discharged for their Union activities in violation of Section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-17\">As to one of the employees, the Board overturned a finding of the Administrative Law Judge that the discharge had been based on valid reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-18\">On review of the record, it appears that there is substantial evidence to sustain the findings of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-19\">Enforcement of the Order of the National Labor Relations Board, 199 NLRB No. 94, is hereby granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
