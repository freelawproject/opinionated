Appellant contends that such a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d summons is invalid and seeks reversal of the District Court enforcement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">The validity of such a summons issued pursuant to Section 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 has been expressly upheld in recent decisions of the Seventh Circuit, United States v. Turner, 480 F.2d 272 (7th Cir. 1973), and the Fourth Circuit, United States v. Theodore, 479 F.2d 749 (4th Cir. 1973). Following the result and the reasoning in those opinions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">Both <em>Turner </em>and <em>Theodore </em>arose under fact situations similar to the case at bar: names, addresses, and social security numbers of the defendant\u2019s clients were required through a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d summons after an improperly completed \u201ctest\u201d return was prepared by the defendant as a facet of the Service\u2019s Tax Preparers Project. In <em>Turner, </em>the Court enforced the summons holding that there were no criminal purpose or self-incriminatory demands inherent in the summons, and that it was not illegally broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">In <em>Theodore, </em>the Court, after rejecting the defendant\u2019s criminal purpose objection, refused to enforce the summons due to overbreadth and vagueness. The IRS had originally requested that Theodore \u201cproduce all of the returns and all of the work records relating to all of his clients for the years 1969-1971.\u201d 479 F.2d at 755. The Court reasoned that the totality of the information sought amounted to a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d As to the IRS\u2019s secondary request for only the names, addresses and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>social security numbers of Theodore\u2019s clients, the Court remanded the issue to the District Court to determine whether the IRS had any reasonable or practical means at its disposal short of a manual search, to compile the desired lists.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>Carter has combined several of the arguments urged by Turner and Theodore in their respective cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">(1) Carter contends that the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d summons is improper because there are no named taxpayers under investigation. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u2019s administrative summons power is sufficiently broad, however, to allow such a summons. Section 7602 explicitly authorizes an inquiry into the tax liability of any person for any internal revenue tax. There is no provision requiring that the taxpayer be known to the Commissioner prior to issuance of the summons. See Tillotson v. Boughner, 333 F.2d 515 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 85 S.Ct. 260, 379 U.S. 913, 13 L. Ed.2d 184 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">(2) The IRS\u2019s request for names, addresses, and social security numbers of those taxpayers who sought Carter\u2019s help was not an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Section 7602 provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, the Secretary or his delegate is authorized\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">(1) To examine any books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or material to such inquiry</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">The power given the IRS under this section has been characterized as an inquisitorial power, similar to that of the grand jury. United States v. McKay, 372 F.2d 174, 176 (5th Cir. 1967). The requirement that the information sought be relevant and material to the inquiry was met in the case at bar when Carter incorrectly prepared a sample return for an investigator operating under the Service\u2019s Tax Preparers Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">(3) Carter\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was not violated by the request. Carter is merely asked to resubmit information which has been given to the Government previously under his signature as preparer of the tax returns. The privacy and confidentiality protected by the Fifth Amendment does not include information of this nature. Couch v. United States, 409 U.S. 322, 335-336, 93 S.Ct. 611, 34 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">(4) Carter questions the use of the 7602 summons in a manner which may lead to a criminal investigation. Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 536, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d-580 (1971), answered this objection by enforcing the summons in a case where it was issued in good faith and prior to a recommendation for criminal prosecution. <em>See also </em>United States v. White, 477 F.2d 757 (5th Cir. 1973), aff\u2019d on rehearing en banc, 487 F.2d 1335 (5th Cir. 1973). The summons here was issued in good faith and prior to any recommendation for criminal prosecution. The fact that the summons may produce evidence that subsequently may be used in a criminal prosecution is no basis for objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">(5) There was no denial of due process by the District Court\u2019s enforcement order of December 19, 1972. Carter had the opportunity to present any defense or argument he desired to that Court at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
