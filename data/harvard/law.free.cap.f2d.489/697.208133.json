App. \u00a7 462. By its judgment, the district court found that Shippee had not presented a prima facie case of conscientious objector status to his local Selective Service Board. After a careful review of the documents which Shippee presented to his local board as a basis for conscientious objector status and all the surrounding facts elicited in the trial below, we believe the district court was completely correct and thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Appellant presents two contentions which he alleges require reversal. First, Shippee asserts that he was prejudiced by the local board\u2019s failure to enunciate the underlying reasons for denying his application or to notify him that he had not made out a prima facie case. Secondly, it is contended that he was denied procedural fairness by the inclusion of a summary of the local board\u2019s hearing in his file which was sent to the Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\"> We find no merit in either of these contentions. Shippee failed to establish a prima facie case before the board and it is apparent that he was not prejudiced by the board\u2019s silence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Secondly, appellant admitted at trial that the summary included in his file was correct and adequately reflected the proceedings conducted at the local board\u2019s hearing. It is thus apparent that he suffered no harm by its inclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-10\">. <em>See </em>United States v.
