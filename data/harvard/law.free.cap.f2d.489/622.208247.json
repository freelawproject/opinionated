The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $138,000. On appeal, Phoenix argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that Brad\u2019s notified Phoenix within a reasonable time after the discovery of the loss, as required by the policy, and that Brad\u2019s therefore forfeited any right to recover under the policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">Brad\u2019s was an Alabama company engaged in the manufacture of M-125 fuses under government defense contracts. The losses involved here were occasioned when Maurice Dailey, vice president of the company, received cash payments for open market sales of brass scrap to Culp Iron &amp; Metal Co., Brad\u2019s major open market customer for brass scrap. Dail-ey made the sales over a fifteen-month period from October 1967 to January 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">The chronology of events leading to Brad\u2019s discovery of Dailey\u2019s defalcations was as follows. In January 1969, Giles Roy Compton, comptroller for Brad\u2019s began to suspect that Dailey had been receiving cash for the sales of brass scrap to Culp. According to his own testimony, Compton\u2019s suspicion at this time was not that Dailey was appropriating the cash for his own personal use, but only that Dailey was taking cash for the sales and violating the company\u2019s established accounting procedures. At the time Compton asked Henry Culp, Jr., of Culp Iron &amp; Metal, to give him a list of the cash payments made to Compton. Shortly thereafter, Compton went to Dailey and confronted him with the charge that Dailey had been violating company procedures by receiving cash for the brass scrap sales; Dailey admitted to having received over $100,000 in cash payments, and agreed that in the future he would abide by company procedures. Dailey resigned as vice president in mid-March 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-17\">After receiving the list of payments from Culp, Compton checked Brad\u2019s bank accounts and books to determine whether cash deposits corresponding to the payments on the list could be found. He testified that he had had difficulty identifying any corresponding deposits. In April 1969, Brad\u2019s hired certified public accountants from Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. to prepare corporate tax returns and financial statements and to do a general audit of the company. During this audit, the accountants too had diffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>culty locating cash deposits corresponding to the payments received by Dailey. In June 1969, the accountant in charge of the audit, with Compton\u2019s help, procured from Culp the record of the payments made to Dailey, and was allowed to see Culp\u2019s accounts payable ledger. The accountant then checked Brad\u2019s records, and found that none of the transactions were recorded in Brad\u2019s accounts; again he had difficulty locating deposits corresponding to the cash transactions. The accountant reported his difficulties to a meeting of Brad\u2019s officers and directors on July 22, 1969. He told the meeting that he could not find entries in Brad\u2019s books accounting for the amounts received by Dailey, and said that he needed to make a further investigation to determine what had become of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">At that time, John C. Bradford, Chairman of the Board and sole stockholder in Brad\u2019s, instructed the Arthur Andersen accountants to proceed with the investigation. Shortly after the meeting, however, these instructions were countermanded by Brad\u2019s attorneys in Los Angeles, who were representing Bradford and Brad\u2019s in connection with an IRS audit of Bradford\u2019s personal and Brad\u2019s corporate income tax returns for 1968, and who wanted all relevant records sent to California. The papers were not returned to the Arthur Andersen accountants until April 1970. At that time, they resumed their investigation of the payments made to Dailey. By June 1970, the Arthur Andersen accountants had advanced with their analysis of Brad\u2019s books to the point where it appeared clear that Dailey had misappropriated substantially all of the cash he had received from Culp, with the exception of amounts delivered on five different dates totalling $60,500. These amounts were deposited in Brad\u2019s accounts and could be traced, by inference, to the payments from Culp. On June 9, 1970, Brad\u2019s notified Phoenix of the loss from Dailey\u2019s defalcations. On November 9, 1970, Brad\u2019s filed proof of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The fidelity bond between Brad\u2019s and Phoenix provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">This bond is executed and accepted subject to the agreements, limitations and conditions set forth herein, which conditions shall be conditions precedent to recovery under this bond</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">8. Notice of Loss and Filing of \u2019 Claim: Upon discovery by the insured of any dishonest act on the part of any employee the insured shall, within a reasonable time after such discovery, give written notice thereof addressed to the company ....</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">. Affirmative proof of loss . shall be filed with the company at its home office within three months after such discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Phoenix's argument in this Court has two prongs. Phoenix argues first that the evidence at trial was not sufficient to support a jury finding that the notice given by Brad\u2019s in June 1970 satisfied the contractual condition of notice to the insurer \u201cwithin a reasonable time after . . . discovery [by the insured of any dishonest act on the part of any employee]\u201d. Second, it argues that a failure to provide notice within a \u201creasonable time\u201d defeats any rights Brad\u2019s may have had under the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Phoenix\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment is premised on the assumption that Brad\u2019s \u201cdiscovered\u201d Dailey\u2019s \u201cdishonest act\u201d, within the meaning of the policy, either in February 1969, at the time of Compton\u2019s confrontation with Dailey, or in July 1969, at the time of the accountant\u2019s report to the officers. Phoenix thus assumes that the delay in giving notice was either 11 or 16 months, and argues that either constitutes an unreasonable delay. We cannot, however, accept the assumption that the jury was bound to conclude that Brad\u2019s had \u201cdiscovered\u201d a \u201cdishonest act\u201d either in February or in July 1969. In February, the evidence establishes only that Compton knew that Dailey had been following an improper accounting procedure, not that he had been misappropriating funds or that he had been dishonest in any other way. In July, the evidence estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>lished that the accountants could not be sure even that the cash payments made by Culp had been lost, let alone that they had been lost through dishonesty on Dailey\u2019s part. It is significant that only later did the accountants verify that $60,500 worth of cash payments in fact had not been diverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Phoenix makes several arguments in support of its view that discovery occurred in July 1969. ,We find all of them unpersuasive. Phoenix argues that the notice requirement attaches when the <em>loss </em>is discovered, and does not await ascertainment of the <em>extent </em>of the loss. In fact, what the terms of the policy require is discovery of a <em>dishonest </em>act; but in any event, the accountants were not prepared in July 1969 to assure Brad\u2019s even that a loss had occurred. Phoenix urges that the notice given was untimely because Brad\u2019s was not sufficiently diligent in pursuing its investigation into the possibility of its employee\u2019s dishonesty. We are unable, however, to read the bond as creating a duty of diligence on the insured\u2019s part in discovering an employee\u2019s dishonesty; even were we prepared so to read the bond, moreover, it is not clear that we could hold that Brad\u2019s had breached any such duty of diligence. See FDIC v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Ins. Co., 5 Cir. 1970, 426 F.2d 729; National Surety Co. v. Alabama Farm Bureau Cotton Ass\u2019n, 5 Cir. 1934, 68 F.2d 816. Phoenix also argues that Brad\u2019s learned no specific new piece of information after July 1969, and suggests that this implies it had full knowledge of Dailey\u2019s dishonesty in July 1969. The suggestion is without merit, since it was only after July 1969 that Brad\u2019s learned for a <em>fact </em>that the money Daily had received had not in any form been turned over to Brad\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Since we conclude there was evidence to support a jury finding that Brad\u2019s did not discover the dishonesty of Dailey until June 1970\u00a1 there is no reason for us to inquire into the merits of the second prong of the appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
