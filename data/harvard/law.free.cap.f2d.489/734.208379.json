Since the subsequent Supreme Court opinion fixes the only disposition that is possible, the two judges issuing the present opinion have decided that the selection of a third judge is unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b816-13\">OPINION ON REMAND</p>\n<author id=\"b816-14\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b816-15\">In Naughten\u2019s original appeal to this court, the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for habeas relief was reversed. 476 F.2d 845 (9th Cir. 1973). The ap-pellee\u2019s petition for rehearing was denied by an equally divided vote of the twelve judges who then constituted this court. Thereafter, the appellee sought, and was granted, a writ of certiorari, and on December 4, 1973, the Supreme Court issued an opinion in which the judgment of our court was reversed. 414 U.S. 141, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-16\">The mandate of the Supreme Court was received by the Clerk of our court of January 7, 1974. After reciting that the original judgment of our court is reversed, the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate provides that the cause is \u201cremanded [to our court] for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of this court.\u201d Only one issue was presented in Naughten\u2019s original appeal, and since that issue has now been finally resolved, adversely to him, the District Court\u2019s Order denying Naughten\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
