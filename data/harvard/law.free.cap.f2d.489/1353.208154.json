Campbell of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1436-6\">STEVENS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\">The district court dismissed an indictment charging that defendant, a convicted felon, had received a firearm \u201cin commerce and affecting commerce,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 352 F.Supp. 113. The government\u2019s appeal raises two questions: (1) whether, since the dismissal was based on facts not set forth in the indictment, the order is appealable; and (2) whether, since defendant\u2019s possession of the firearm was unrelated to its earlier interstate shipment, the indictment charged an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-8\">The indictment is drafted in the language of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After discovery indicated that the firearm had only crossed a state line on one occasion several months before it came into his possession, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment. In response to that motion, the government stipulated to the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-17\">On March 1, 1970, the gun was shipped from Miami, Florida, to a retailer in Alton, Illinois. Six months later the retailer sold it to a pawnbroker, who resold it to a third party. After that party discovered that the gun was missing, it was found in defendant\u2019s possession. There is no suggestion that defendant had any connection with the interstate shipment or with either of the subsequent sales. Thus, the government has stipulated that its evidence will simply establish (a) that defendant is a convicted felon, and (b) that he possessed a firearm which had previously moved in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-18\">The district court considered these facts in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488. The district judge noted that the Court had rejected the government\u2019s original interpretation of the statute, namely, that no nexus between a receipt or possession and interstate commerce need be shown; the district judge then concluded that since this defendant\u2019s possession was neither in commerce, nor had any effect on commerce, the nexus required by the <em>Bass </em>rationale was not present. He rejected the government\u2019s argument that the case was controlled by dicta in the <em>Bass </em>opinion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> relying instead on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>thrust of the Court\u2019s reasoning which requires an unambiguous expression of congressional intent before state criminal jurisdiction may be duplicated by federal regulation under the commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">We first consider the jurisdictional issue and then the <em>Bass </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-7\">The government invokes our jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, as amended effective January 2, 1971. 84 Stat. 1880, 1890.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That amendment cured the statutory objection to our jurisdiction that we reviewed <em>en banc </em>in <em>Ponto </em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> Grochowski </em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <em>Gustavson</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, that amendment could not overcome the alternative ground for decision in those cases, namely, that dismissals predicated on facts not set forth in the indictment were actually acquittals from which appeal was foreclosed by the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution. See United States v. McCreery, 473 F.2d 1381 (7th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-17\">The <em>Ponto </em>\u201cacquittal\u201d rationale is inapplicable here. In each of the cases in which that rationale was applied, the alleged offense was a refusal to submit to induction into the Armed Forces in violation of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462. Under that statutory scheme, judicial review of the classification process is normally unavailable until the registrant is required to defend a criminal charge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In such cases, determination of guilt or innocence typically turns on an analysis of the defendant\u2019s Selective Service file. <em>Ponto </em>holds that the judge\u2019s ruling on the merits of the defense which is most typically asserted at trial is, in effect, an acquittal whether the ruling is made after or before the jury is impaneled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-18\">The rulings in <em>Ponto, Grochowski, Gustavson </em>and <em>McCreery </em>did not involve the sufficiency of the government\u2019s charge. As those opinions respectively stressed, each of the dismissals sustained the merits of an affirmative defense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the case before us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>however, the government\u2019s stipulation is a particularization of the general allegation in the indictment. By revealing the facts it is prepared to prove, the government has, in effect, narrowed the charge in the indictment. The question decided by the district court was whether the indictment, as so limited, describes a violation of \u00a7 1202(a). It is clear that a dismissal based on a determination of the sufficiency of the charge, as limited by this type of stipulation, is subject to appellate review. See United States v. Fruehauf, 365 U.S. 146, 157-158, 81 S.Ct. 547, 5 L.Ed.2d 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">We therefore hold that the rationale of <em>Ponto </em>does not defeat our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">It is fair to state the issue on the merits as whether the Supreme Court\u2019s dicta describing the reach of the receipt offense in \u00a7 1202(a) really means what it appears to say. Four other circuits have recognized that the language of the <em>Bass </em>opinion is directly applicable to facts comparable to those before us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The problem which the district court\u2019s decision identifies, however, is whether the apparent meaning of that language is consistent with the reasoning which led the Court to reject the government\u2019s original construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-12\">The government had construed the statute as broadly covering every possession or receipt of a firearm by a convicted felon. That construction had been accepted by five circuits, but, in <em>Bass, </em>the Second was persuaded to construe the statute more narrowly to avoid the constitutional issue that would otherwise exist.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this case the district court felt that a comparable constitutional problem is presented by the application of the statute to these facts. For it is conceded that defendant\u2019s possession was not in commerce and did not affect commerce. There would appear to be no greater constitutional support for the application of the statute to cases like this than for applying it to every possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1438-13\">It is quite clear, however, that the <em>Bass </em>decision does not evidence any doubt by the Supreme Court with respect to the power of Congress to prohibit all such possessions. Its opinion makes no reference to the constitutional question which troubled the Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>Circuit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, as the Court\u2019s decision in Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686, demonstrates, the constitutional support for the statute is provided by the congressional evaluation of the category of transactions of which this is a part,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> rather than a judicial evaluation of the significance of the particular transaction before it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s concern with the constitutionality of the statute as applied here was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the argument that there need be no nexus whatever between interstate commerce and a felon\u2019s possession or receipt of a firearm did, however, rest on guides to construction of federal criminal statutes which also support defendant here. As in Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 28 L.Ed.2d 493, the Court resolved the ambiguity in a federal criminal statute in favor of lenity and of avoiding a significant change in the Federal-State balance not clearly required by the statement of Congress\u2019 purpose.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s broad description of the receipt offense would also seem to offend those important policies. Nevertheless, the entire opinion demonstrates that Mr. Justice Marshall\u2019s choice of language was deliberate and precise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">In <em>Bass, </em>the government had argued that \u00a7 1202, enacted as a part of Title VII, and \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and (h), enacted as a part of Title IV of the same statute, would be substantially redundant if an interstate commerce nexus were required for both sections. Although the Court did not accept this argument, it did adopt a construction which minimized the extent of the redundancy. It held that \u201cTitle VII complements Title IV by punishing a broader class of behavior\u201d 404 U.S. at 342, 92 S.Ct. at 520. Unlike Title IV, Title VII is not limited to the sending or receiving of firearms \u201cas part of an interstate transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343, 92 S.Ct. at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-7\">Similarly, the Court expressly stated that the receipt offense is \u201csignificantly broader in reach\u201d than the possession offense. <em>Id. </em>at 350, 92 S.Ct. 515. Apparently possession is not proscribed unless the gun is \u201cmoving interstate or on an interstate facility, or if the possession affects commerce.\u201d\u00bb <em>Id. </em>at 350, 92 S.Ct. at 524. The differentiation between possession and receipt plainly indicates that no direct connection with commerce is required for the latter offense. Thus, as in other criminal statutes cited by the Court, a federal jurisdictional fact, which may well be extra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>neous to the basic policy of the statute, is an essential element of the offense.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">Finally, the Court expressly noted that the considerations of federalism and lenity did not require it to adopt the narrowest possible reading of the statute, since its broad reading appropriately reflected the basic legislative purpose of restricting firearm-related activity of convicted felons. <em>Id. </em>at 351, 92 S.Ct. 515. Thus, even if the broad reach of the receipt offense proscribed by \u00a7 1202 is arguably almost as extensive as if the government had prevailed in <em>Bass, </em>the Court\u2019s reading does require proof of a jurisdictional fact relevant \u201cto federal criminal jurisdiction alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 92 S.Ct. 515. Since that fact is alleged in this indictment, even as limited by the government\u2019s stipulation, the dismissal was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1436-10\">. That section was enacted as a part of Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 197, 236. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-11\">\u201cAny person who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-12\">\u201c(1) has been convicted by a court of the United States or of a State or any political subdivision thereof of a felony . . . and who receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce . . . any firearm shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1436-15\">.

The Government can obviously meet its burden in a variety of ways. We note only some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>these. For example, a person \u2018possesses . . . in commerce or affecting commerce\u2019 if at the time of the offense the gun was moving interstate or on an interstate facility, or if the possession affects commerce.

CAMPBELL, Senior District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A7W\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-7\">\u25a0 I reluctantly concur in reversing the dismissal of this indictment, and do so only because I consider United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) as allowing no other result under the facts here presented. In <em>Bass, </em>\u201cthe Government proceeded on the assumption that \u00a7 1202(a)(1) bans all possessions and receipts of firearms by convicted felons, and that no connection with interstate commerce had to be demonstrated in individual cases.\u201d 404 U.S. at 338, 92 S.Ct. at 517. Applying principles of statutory construction, the Court held the phrase \u201cin commerce or affecting commerce\u201d related not only to conduct involving <em>transportation </em>of firearms, but also to instances in which the defendant is charged with either <em>receiving </em>or <em>possessing </em>firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-8\">Mr. Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court, then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-10\">\u201cThere is a second principle supporting today\u2019s result: unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance. . . . In traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal balance, the requirement of clear statement assures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involved in the judicial decision. In the instant case, the broad construction urged by the Government renders traditionally local criminal conduct a matter of federal enforcement and would also involve a substantial extension of federal police resources. Absent proof of some interstate commerce nexus in each case, \u00a7 1202(a) dramatically intrudes upon traditional state criminal jurisdiction. Absent a clearer statement of intention from Congress than is present here, we do not interpret \u00a7 1202(a) to reach the \u2018mere possession\u2019 of firearms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1440-14\">Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s brief concurring opinion indicates that he would have said no more, and had Mr. Justice Marshall done so, I would affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this indictment. However, the Court\u2019s opinion continues with the statement that \u201cwe conclude that the Government meets its burden here <em>[i. e., </em>with respect to the offense of \u201creceiving\u201d a firearm] if it demonstrates that the firearm received has previously traveled in interstate commerce.18\u201d 404 U.S. at 350, 92 S.Ct. 523. Footnote 18 of the Opinion advises that \u201cthis reading preserves a significant difference between the \u2018receipt\u2019 offenses of Title IV and Title VII. See supra at 342-343.\u201d At page 343, 92 S.Ct. at page 520 of the Opinion, the Court notes that, unlike \u00a7 1202(a), Title IV is \u201climited to the sending or receiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>ing of firearms as part of an interstate transportation.\u201d See also, footnote 10, 404 U.S. at 343, 92 S.Ct. at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-4\">This \u201csignificant difference\u201d leads to only one conclusion: that if a firearm has <em>ever </em>traveled in interstate commerce previous to the time defendant \u201creceives\u201d it, his receipt of that firearm is proscribed by \u00a7 1202(a)(1), even if the defendant\u2019s receipt of the weapon involved a wholly intrastate transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">While this conclusion is dictated by the specific language of the <em>Bass </em>decision, I find its implications entirely inconsistent with all that Justice Marshall had to say regarding the need for a \u201cclearer statement of intention from Congress\u201d before the court would construe \u00a7 1202(a) as requiring no \u201cinterstate commerce nexus in each case\u201d, a statutory construction which, in the Court\u2019s view, \u201cdramatically intrudes on traditional state jurisdiction.\u201d It is difficult to conceive of an instance in which a person charged with possession of a firearm may not also be charged with receiving it. And if all the Government need demonstrate is that the \u201cfirearm received has previously traveled in interstate commerce\u201d, \u00a7 1202(a) effectively proscribes virtually all acts involving possession or receipt of firearms by a person previously convicted of a felony. If the defendant is charged with having received the weapon in any state other than the state wherein it was manufactured, the firearm will necessarily have previously traveled in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">The fortuitous circumstances which would have to exist to render \u00a7 1202(a)(1) inapplicable are so unlikely that, in practice, the statute \u201crenders traditionally local criminal conduct a matter of federal enforcement\u201d, a change in the \u201cfederal-state balance\u201d which Justice Marshall had indicated would not be recognized \u201cabsent a clearer statement of intention from Congress\u201d.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
