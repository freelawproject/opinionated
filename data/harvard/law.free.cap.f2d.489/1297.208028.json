(GTE Sylvania Incorporated), attorney of record, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1380-10\">S. Wm. Cochran, Washington, D.

The penultimate paragraph of our opinion is modified by striking the period at the end thereof and inserting: \u201cfor purposes of interference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-18\">2. The remand is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-19\">3. The decision of the board that the limitation \u201csodium iodide present in amount of at least 0.17 mg./cc. of said arc tube volume\u201d constitutes new matter for purposes of 35 U.S. C. \u00a7 132, requiring rejection of claims 18 through 21, is affirmed. As pointed out by the board, appellants\u2019 specification, unlike Edris, does not disclose the volume of the discharge lamp or any basis for determining the volume; and the Koury affidavit does not overcome this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>deficiency because its conclusion is unaccompanied by the facts needed to support it. Appellants\u2019 waiver precludes consideration of further showing or amendment which might have been made under Rule 196(b). However, we point out that the fact that both parties have joined in requesting the court to rule on the merits of a new rejection does not preclude the court from remanding a case for further proceedings before the Patent Office when the court deems the circumstances appropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
