The microbus had passed the crest of a small hill and was proceeding down the grade at the time of the accident. When the vehicle passed the crest of the hill, the driver noted that his speed was about 40 miles an hour. As the vehicle continued down the hill, the bus began \u201cpicking up some speed, a little too much.\u201d To reduce his speed, the driver attempted to downshift the vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Beeause he had some difficulty in locating the gearshift lever, the driver took his \u201ceyes off the road\u201d and in some way \u201cpulled the steering wheel\u201d causing the vehicle to veer \u201cto the right\u201d into \u201cthe driveway\u201d. The plaintiff screamed, causing the driver to look up. As the driver did, he \u201csaw a telephone pole headed right toward us\u201d. He tried to cut back into the road but there \u201cwas an oncoming vehicle the other way, so it was either the telephone pole or another vehicle.\u201d He chose the telephone pole. The bus hit the pole on its right front. The plaintiff was seated in the center of the seat, next to the driver, with her left leg under her. As a result of the impact, her right leg was caught between the back of the seat and the dashboard of the van and she was apparently thrown forward. She sustained severe injuries to her ankle and femur. She seeks to recover for her injuries, and her mother for medical expenses, from the vehicle manufacturer, contending that the latter was guilty of negligent design in the location of the gearshift in its vehicle and in the want of crashwor-thiness of its vehicle. The action was tried without a jury. The District Court dismissed the claim relating to the gearshift but concluded that the defendant manufacturer had been guilty of negligence <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in failing to use due care in the- design of its vehicle by providing \u201csufficient energy-absorbing materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>or devices or \u2018crush space,\u2019 if you will, so that at 40 miles an hour the integrity of the passenger compartment would not be violated\u201d, and that, as a result, the injuries of the plaintiff were enhanced \u201cover and above those injuries which the plaintiff might have incurred.\u201d From judgment entered on the basis of that conclusion in favor of the plaintiff and her mother, the defendants have appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\"> The correctness of the finding by the District Court that the defendant manufacturer was guilty of negligent design in this case depends on the determination of what extent a car manufacturer owes the duty to design and market a \u201ccrashworthy\u201d vehicle, one which, in the event of a collision, resulting accidentally or negligently from the act of another and not from any defect or malfunction in the vehicle itself, protects against unreasonable risk of injury to the occupants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The existence and nature of such a duty is a legal issue, for resolution as a matter of law. So much all the authorities agree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There are, however, two fairly definite lines of conflicting authority on whether there is such a duty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *One group of which <em>Evans</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is the leading authority, holds that no such duty rests on the manufacturer, since the \u201cintended use\u201d of an automobile does not extend to collisions. The other, while relieving the manufacturer of any duty to design an accident-proof vehicle, would impose a duty to use reasonable care in the design and manufacture of its product so as \u201cto eliminate any unreasonable risk of foreseeable injury\u201d as a result of a collision, for which the manufacturer may not be responsible. <em>Larsen </em>is the primary authority for this rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-13\">This is a diversity case and, as such, the rights of the parties are governed by Virginia law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is conceded that there is no binding Virginia precedent on a car manufacturer\u2019s duty to design a \u201ccrashworthy\u201d vehicle. The plaintiffs argue, though, that the general trend of the decisions in Virginia, as evidenced by the opinion of this Court in Spruill v. Boyle-Midway, Incorporated (4th Cir. 1962) 308 F.2d 79, ranges Virginia with those jurisdictions imposing liability for negligent design in failing to take reasonable precautions against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>unreasonable risks of harm to passengers by reason of a collision. For purposes of this decision, it may be assumed that this is the trend of the Virginia decisions. Assuming it to be applicable to the facts of this case, however, the <em>Larsen </em>rule will not support recovery by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">In arguing in favor of liability, the appellees stress the foreseeability in this mechanical age of automobile collisions, as affirmed in numerous authorities, and would seemingly deduce from this a duty on the car manufacturer to design its vehicle so as to guard against injury from involvement of its vehicle in any such anticipated collisions. The mere fact, however, that automobile collisions are frequent enough to be foreseeable is not sufficient in and of itself to create a duty on the part of the manufacturer to design its car to withstand such collisions <em>under any circumstances. </em>Foreseeability, it has been many times repeated, is not to be equated with duty; <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is, after all, but one factor, albeit an important one, to be weighed in determining the issue of duty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Were foreseeability of collision the absolute litmus test for establishing a duty on the part of the car manufacturer, the obligation of the manufacturer to design a crash-proof car would be absolute, a result that <em>Larsen </em>itself specifically repudiates.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After all, \u201c[N] early every accident situation, [involving an automobile] no matter how bizarre, is \u2018foreseeable\u2019 if only because in the last fifty years drivers have discovered just about every conceivable way of wrecking an automobile.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>The key phrase in the statement of the <em>Larsen </em>rule is <em>\u201cunreasonable risk </em>of injury in the event of a collision\u201d, not foreseeability of collision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The latter circumstance is assumed in collision cases under the <em>Larsen </em>principle; it is the element of \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d that is uncertain in such cases and on which the determination of liability or no liability will rest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It would patently be unreasonable \u201cto require the manufacturer to provide for every conceivable use or unuse of a car.\u201d Nader &amp; Page, Automobile Design and the Judicial Process, 55 Cal.L.Rev. 645, 646. Liability for negligent design thus \u201cis imposed only when an unreasonable danger is created. Whether or not this has occurred should be determined by general negligence principles, which involve a balancing of the likelihood of harm, and the gravity of harm if it happens against the burden of the precautions which would be effective to avoid the harm.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In short, against the likelihood and gravity of harm \u201cmust be balanced in every case the utility of the type of conduct in question.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The likelihood of harm is tied in with the obviousness of the danger, whether latent or patent, since it is frequently stated \u201cthat a design is not unreasonably dangerous because the risk is one which any one immediately would recognize and avoid.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The purposes and intended use of the article is an even more impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>tant factor to be considered. After all, it is a commonplace that utility of design and attractiveness of the style of the car are elements which car manufacturers seek after and by which buyers are influenced in their selections.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In every case, the utility and purpose of the particular type of vehicle will govern in varying degree the standards of safety to be observed in its design. This was recognized in the Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which undertakes \u201cto establish motor vehicle safety standards for motor vehicles.\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq. In prescribing such standards, the Secretary is directed to \u201cconsider whether any such proposed standard is <em>reasonable, practicable and appropriate for the particular type of motor vehicle * * </em>*.\u201d Section 1392(f)(3). (Italics added.) Stated somewhat differently, the safety of every type of vehicle is to be evaluated under this Act in connection with what is \u201creasonable, practicable and appropriate\u201d for its special type. And this is the same rule that has been judicially applied, even in <em>Larsen </em>type cases.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, in Dyson v. General Motors Corporation (D.C.Pa. 1969) 298 F.Supp. 1064, 1073, a case which followed and applied the <em>Larsen </em>rule, the Court emphasized that design safety must take account of \u201cdifferentiation between various models of automobile\u201d and involves \u201ca recognition of the inherent characteristics of each.\u201d It pointed out that a convertible could not be made \u201cas safe in roll-over accidents as a standard four-door sedan with center posts and full-door frames.\u201d The convertible was only required to be as reasonably safe as its intended use would allow and \u201cnot appreciably less safe than other convertibles.\u201d Price is, also, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>factor to be considered, for, if a change in design would appreciably add to cost, add little to safety, and take an article out of the price range of the market to which it was intended to appeal, it may be \u201cunreasonable\u201d as well as \u201cimpractical\u201d for the Courts to require the manufacturer to adopt such change.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Of course, if an article can be made safer and the hazard of harm may be mitigated \u201cby an alternate design or device at no substantial increase in price\u201d, then the manufacturer has a duty to adopt such a design<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> but a Cadillac may be expected to include more in the way of both conveniences and \u201ccrashworthiness\u201d than the economy car. Moreover, in a \u201ccrashworthy\u201d case, it is necessary to consider the circumstances of the accident itself.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As <em>Dyson </em>puts it, \u201cit could not reasonably be argued that a car manufacturer should be held liable because its vehicle collapsed when involved in a head-on collision with a large truck, at high speed.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In summary, every case such as this involves a delicate balancing of many factors in order to determine whether the manufacturer has used ordinary care in designing a car, which, giving consideration to the market purposes and utility of the vehicle, did not involve unreasonable risk of injury to occupants within the range of its \u201cintended use\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>\u201cIn the light of the recognizable risk, the conduct, to be negligent, must be unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1155-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>Applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this particular case, it is clear that there was no violation by the defendant of its duty of ordinary care in the design of its vehicle. The defendant\u2019s vehicle, described as \u201ca van type multipurpose vehicle\u201d,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> was of a special type and particular design. This design was uniquely developed in order to provide the owner with the maximum amount of either cargo or passenger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>space in a vehicle inexpensively priced and of such dimensions as to make possible easy maneuverability <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> To achieve this, it advanced the driver\u2019s seat forward, bringing such seat in close proximity to the front of the vehicle, thereby adding to the cargo or passenger space. This, of course, reduced considerably the space between the exact front of the vehicle and the driver\u2019s compartment. All of this was readily discernible to any one using the vehicle; in fact, it was, as we have said, the unique feature of the vehicle. The usefulness of the design is vouchsafed by the popularity of the type.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It was of special utility as a van for the transportation of light cargo, as a family camper, as a station wagon and for use by passenger groups too large for the average passenger car. It was a design that had been adopted by other manufacturers, including American. It was a design duplicated in the construction of the large trucking tractors, where there was the same purpose of extending the cargo space without unduly lengthening the tractor-trailer coupling. There was no evidence in the record that there was any practical way of improving the \u201ccrashability\u201d of the vehicle that would have been consistent with the peculiar purposes of its design. The only theory on which the plaintiffs posited their claim of negligent design was, to quote the language of their brief in this Court, that \u201c[T]he 1968 Volkswagen station wagon did not provide the protection for the front seat passengers as did the \u2018normal\u2019 or standard passenger car.\u201d The \u201cnormal or standard passenger car\u201d, to which, under the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the vehicle was required to conform if it was to meet the test of reasonable design, was defined by the plaintiffs on one occasion as \u201ca standard American made vehicle, which is a configuration with the passengers in the middle and the motor in the front\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and on another as \u201ca passenger car with an engine in front and with a long hood * * <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> And all of their expert testimony was to this point. These experts offered by the plaintiffs concededly made no attempt to compare for safety of design or for any other purpose defendant\u2019s special type of vehicle with similar types made by other manufacturers or indicated any way in which safety in such vehicles could have been improved, given the peculiar purpose of the vehicle. They completely disregarded the rule developed in <em>Dyson, swpra, </em>and the standards developed by Congress in the Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which would compare vehicles of the same type in determining safety standards. These experts contented themselves with arriving at the reasonable design of the defendant\u2019s vehicle by one test and that was by comparing it with the 1966 midsized Ford passenger car.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In short, the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of negligent design and the thrust of all their expert testimony on such point was that, to meet the test of ordinary care in design so as to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>\u201cunreasonable risk\u201d of injury, the vehicle of the defendant had to conform with the configuration of the standard American passenger car, vintage 1966, <em>i. e., </em>its motor must be in front, not in the rear; its passenger compartment must be \u201cin the middle\u201d; and the space in front of the passenger compartment must be approximately the same as that in a \u201cstandard American passenger car.\u201d Under this standard, any rear engine car would be \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d; any microbus or front-end tractor \u2014 both in wide use in 1968 and now \u2014 would be declared \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> To avoid liability for negligent design, no manufacturer could introduce any innovative or unique design, even though reasonably calculated to provide some special advantage such as greater roominess. Such a strait-jacket on design is not imposed, whether the rule applied is that of <em>Evans </em>or of <em>Larsen. </em>If a person purchases a convertible, as <em>Dyson </em>makes clear, he cannot expect \u2014 and the Court may not impose on the manufacturer the duty to provide him with\u2014 the exact kind of protection in a rollover accident as in the \u201cstandard American passenger car\u201d. The situation is similar when he purchases a microbus: The distance between the front and the passenger compartment is minified in order to provide additional cargo or passenger space just as the convertible is designed to provide openness. It is entirely impermissible to predicate a conclusion of negligent design simply because a vehicle, having a distinctive purpose, such as the microbus, does not conform to the design of another type of vehicle, such as a standard passenger car, having a different nature and utility. As a matter of fact, the defendant offered evidence \u2014 unrefuted in the testimony \u2014 that its design, at least so far as \u201ccrash space between the front and the passenger compartment, was equal to or superior to that of other vehicles of like type.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">The District Court, however, seems to have accepted plaintiffs\u2019 theory, though expressing it somewhat differently from the standard stated by the plaintiffs in their brief. It stated the standard of ordinary care in design to require that a vehicle be able to withstand a \u201chead-on\u201d collision at 40 miles an hour <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> without a violation of \u201cthe integrity of the passenger compartment\u201d, and held that the defendant had \u201cviolated\u201d its duty in failing to meet this standard. Accepting the principle that a manufacturer must anticipate that its product will likely at some point in its use be involved in a collision, does ordinary care demand that, in taking precautions, it must provide against impacts at a speed of 40 miles per hour? Is this the \u201creasonable risk\u201d, as it has been defined in the authorities quoted <em>supra, </em>against which the manufacturer must provide protection? And why \u201c40 miles an hour\u201d as the standard anyway? This standard was adopted, it seems clear from the District Court\u2019s order, because the plaintiffs contended that a \u201cstandard American passenger car\u201d had sufficient \u201ccrash space\u201d that its passenger compartment would not have been invaded in a 40 mile impact. This conclusion rests on some measurements made by the plaintiffs\u2019 experts in comparing the \u201ccrasha-bility\u201d of a microbus and that of a 1966 Ford passenger car. No tests were made by these experts to confirm experimentally these conclusions. The plaintiffs\u2019 experts merely measured the distance from the exact front of the micro-bus and the point where the plaintiff had collided with the interior of the van and compared that distance with the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>tance between the front and passenger seat of a 1966 Ford passenger car; and because the distance in the latter instance was greater than in the former, they concluded that, had the plaintiff been riding in a 1966 Ford passenger car, she would have escaped injury. But, as we have already seen, in determining whether a vehicle has been negligently designed so far as safety is concerned, the special purpose and character of the particular type of vehicle must be considered, and a microbus is no more to be compared with a standard 1966 passenger type car than the convertible instanced in <em>Dyson </em>is to be compared with a standard hard-top passenger car. Both the plaintiffs and the District Court employed an improper standard in determining whether the defendant had been guilty of negligent design.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">It, perhaps, may not be amiss to note that there is not substantial evidence to sustain a finding that as a result of the design of the microbus the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were enhanced. <em>Cf., </em>Yetter v. Rajeski, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 108-109 (364 F.Supp.). In fact, the record seems clear that in any event the plaintiff, who had made no endeavor to protect herself with a seat belt, would have received severe injuries, irrespective of the type of vehicle she may have been riding in. There was testimony \u2014 which was not seriously questioned \u2014 that experiments conducted under the auspices of the Department of Transportation indicated that \u201cthe average barrier equipment velocity for fatalities, the mean velocity is only 33 miles per hour * * <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> It may be that in every case the injuries may be somewhat different but any \u201chead-on\u201d collision at a speed of 40 miles an hour or more will result in severe injuries to the occupants of a vehicle and, certainly in 1968, no design short of an impractical and exorbitantly expensive tank-like vehicle (see, Alexander v. Seaboard Air Line Railroad Company, <em>supra, </em>346 F.Supp. 320) could have protected against such injuries; in fact, it is doubtful that even such a vehicle could have. Can it be said that a manufacturer in 1968 must have, in its design, so built its vehicle as to protect against such an \u201cunreasonable risk of injury\u201d? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">Reversed and remanded with directions to the District Court to enter judgment in favor of the appellants-defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1150-10\">.

As in Larsen v. General Motors Corporation (8th Cir. 1968) 391 F.2d 495, 506, the Court based its decision on ordinary negligence principles rather than warranty or strict liability.
