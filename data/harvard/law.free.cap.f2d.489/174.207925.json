Winters was indicted by the Grand Jury of Holmes County, Mississippi, on a charge of murder arising out of the shooting death of one E. T. Branch. On the advice of retained counsel Winters pled guilty to that charge and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Winters now seeks federal habeas relief alleging that Negroes were illegally excluded from the grand jury which indicted him, that his guilty plea was not voluntary and intelligent, and that he was denied effective counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">\n<em>The Grand Jury Discrimination Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Based upon two separate but factually interrelated legal theories we hold that Winters may not assert the alleged grand jury discrimination as a grounds for habeas relief. First, his counsel\u2019s actions constituted a valid waiver to all objections to the composition of the grand jury, and second, Winters\u2019 guilty plea foreclosed his assertion of that constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\"><em>Waiver by Counsel </em>\u2014 As the court below found on clear record evidence, Winters\u2019 attorney fully considered the possibility of raising constitutional objections to the racial composition of the grand jury, but rejected that course of action in favor of a plea of guilty. By such a plea his client was assured of receiving the prosecution\u2019s recommendation of a life sentence (with the possibility of a parole after serving ten years), thus avoiding what counsel reasonably considered was the distinct possibility of the death sentence. Counsel testified that the threat of his urging these constitutional objections to the jury selection procedures was the \u201cpry pole\u201d that he used in getting the state to allow the defendant to enter a guilty plea. In his opinion as an experienced criminal attorney this procedure utilized the unlawful condition in the most effective way. Even the most skillful trial tactician should be hard pressed to fault counsel\u2019s considered and conscientious strategy to waive this option in return for practical assurance that his client would not be executed. Where, as here, a competent attorney who is well-versed in the defense of murder charges deliberately refrains from making a known constitutional objection to the composition of a grand or petit jury for strategic purposes, there has been a deliberate by-pass and waiver under Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">The effect of this waiver was not vitiated by the attorney\u2019s failure to consult with Winters about the -constitutional objections to the jury composition. As <em>Fay </em>points out, \u201c[a] choice made by counsel not participated in by the petitioner does not automatically bar relief.\u201d 372 U.S. at 439, 83 S.Ct. at 849. The implication of this last statement \u2014 that some strategic decisions which entail the waiver of a constitutional right may be made by counsel without consultation with the accused \u2014 was made express in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 85 S.Ct 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX5\">Although trial strategy adopted by counsel without prior consultation with an accused will not, <em>where the circumstances are exceptional, </em>preclude the accused from asserting constitutional claims, see Whitus v. Balkcom, 333 F.2d 496 (5th Cir. 1964), we think that the deliberate bypassing by counsel of the contemporaneous-objection rule as a part of trial strategy would have that effect in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdV\">379 U.S. at 451-452, 85 S.Ct. at 569 (emphasis supplied). <em>Henry </em>requires inferior federal courts to determine whether the circumstances of a particular case are in the <em>exceptional </em>category from which the bar of waiver, created by the good faith actions of a criminal defendant\u2019s attorney, has been lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The majority opinion of the panel that originally decided this case, which we today reverse, would have created a per se rule that even an intentional, strategic waiver by a lawyer of his client\u2019s constitutional rights cannot be binding. Specifically, the opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">Both the State courts and the district court in this case held that Winters\u2019 plea of guilty waived his right to complain of the array of jurors in Holmes County. The rationale for such view is that Winters\u2019 lawyer knew of the right and that 'by failing to raise the objection counsel effectively waived the right for Winters. <em>But it is axiomatic that Winters is the one who must make the waiver, not his attorney. </em>Winters had no idea that he could object to the jury composition. Before a waiver can be effective it must be knowingly given. Since Winters had not been informed of the right, his waiver did not encompass its relinquishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">466 F.2d at 1395-1396 (emphasis supplied). Under this reasoning, the exception which <em>Henry </em>explicated would have swallowed the basic rule on which it is engrafted. \"Axiomatic\u201d or not, this syllogism \u2014 that since the rights are those of the defendant, he alone may waive them \u2014 must be rejected. To require an explanation of only the most important rights which arise during the course of a trial, with the advantages and disadvantages of raising each issue, in terms that would enable a defendant to make an intelligent and knowing waiver creates a heavy enough burden for both clients and lawyers. We refuse to enlarge the attorney\u2019s duty to include the responsibility to inform the defendant of every possible constitutional claim. <em>See </em>Developments in the Law \u2014 Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1110-11 (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">Our concern here is more basic than the effect of such a rule on already crowded court dockets; it is that the rule contended for by Winters would make it virtually impossible to conduct a criminal trial in the future. Looking past the disruptive effect on counsel and the confusing impact on the defendant himself, it would be a futile command to require that a trial judge continually satisfy himself that the defendant was fully informed as to, and in complete accord with, his attorney\u2019s every action or inaction that involved any possible constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">Our Constitution has been held to afford all criminal defendants the right to counsel. The cardinal precept upon which the establishment of this right is predicated is that most defendants are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>untutored in the law and are unqualified to conduct their own defense. It would be incongruous to reflexively allow a defendant such as Winters to void his conviction when his privately-employed lawyer did what he was retained to do \u2014 -use his skill and knowledge of the law to further the best interests of his client \u2014because the lawyer did not first reason out his every action with his client and obtain his knowing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Though there are instances where a defendant\u2019s personal waiver is required, our examination of the facts of this case in search of the exceptional circumstances required by Henry discloses no such personal waiver right was present here. Case law demonstrates that the exceptional circumstances which justify a requirement that the defendant personally waive the right vouched-safe may be grouped in two broad categories: first, where there is evidence of fraud, or gross negligence or incompetence on the part of the defendant\u2019s attorney; and, second, where an inherently personal right of fundamental importance is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">As to the first category, there is absolutely no evidence in this record that the attorney for the defendant did anything other than to conscientiously represent the defendant to the best of his ability. As discussed <em>infra, </em>there is no substance to any charge of incompetence or negligence in this case. Thus, we need discuss here only Winters\u2019 attack on the good faith of his selected attorney, based on his interpretation of the language in United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, 263 F.2d 71, 82 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 850, 80 S.Ct. 109, 4 L.Ed.2d 89 (1959), where this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">As Judges of a Circuit comprising six states of the deep South, we think that it is our duty to take judicial notice that lawyers residing in many southern jurisdictions rarely, almost to the point of never, raise the issue of systematic exclusion of Negroes from juries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">This language from <em>Goldsby </em>has in subsequent cases been construed to support the proposition that this court must take judicial notice that white lawyers in this circuit almost always will sacrifice their Negro clients\u2019 rights to be tried by a constitutionally selected jury out of a fear of community opprobrium or social ostracism. Whether such judicial notice was court recognition of adjudicative facts or of legislative facts, <em>see </em>K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 15.03 (1958), the majority of the court en banc now announces that it does not consider such breach of trust by counsel to be so prevalent in any jurisdiction of this circuit that this court should, in the absence oUproof, place all or even some lawyers in this circuit under the cloud of such an accusation. Winters, and those raising a similar defense in the future, may not rely on any court to \u201cnotice\u201d without proof that attorneys in this circuit are not to be trusted to make a strategic or tactical decision to challege unconstitutional jury discrimination. When the record discloses that an attorney has deliberately waived a right his client may have had to raise an objection to the racial composition of a grand or petit jury, this court will not, in the absence of proof, assume that the attorney breached any obligation to his client.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> <em>Goldsby </em>excused a timely failure to object to an illegally constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>petit jury based upon a recognition that the lawyer had been presented with a Hobson\u2019s choice between accepting an improper jury and raising a challenge only to secure to his client the right to be tried by a properly chosen venire which was prejudiced by the attack on \u201cthe system.\u201d This reasoning, which is valid whenever such probable prejudice could be demonstrated to exist, is inapplicable to the facts here. <em>Goldsby </em>itself recognizes that while the Hobson\u2019s choice will excuse an attorney\u2019s failure to timely object to an illegally constituted <em>petit </em>jury it will not excuse a failure to object to the racial composition of a <em>grand </em>jury. 263 F.2d at 80-81, 84. <em>See </em>Whitus v. Balkcom, 333 F.2d 496, 501-502 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 931, 85 S.Ct. 329, 13 L.Ed.2d 343 (1964). <em>See also </em>Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). In the case at bar we need not reach the petit jury issue either. Winters\u2019 counsel never faced this choice. His decision to use the potential of raising such an objection to assure his client safe passage past the hazard of a death sentence obviated any need to make the \u201cgrisly choice\u201d as to the jury he did not face. Therefore, we need not decide whether the \u201cHobson\u2019s\u201d problem had dissipated at the time of Winters\u2019 plea <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or whether it persisted until such time when Negroes were regularly called for jury duty in the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Since it is clear that there is no evidence here of breach of trust, fraud, or overreaching, and since we hold that Winters\u2019 counsel was neither negligent nor incompetent, this case does not fall within the first branch of exceptions to the general rule that personal waiver is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">It does not fall within the second branch of exceptions either. It is not such an inherently personal fundamental right that it can be waived only by the defendant and not by his attorney. Such personal fundamental rights include the right to plead guilty (which of course encompasses the waiver of numerous rights), the right to waive trial by jury, the right to waive appellate review and the right to testify personally. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>See Developments in the Law \u2014 Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1011-n. 102 (1970). Without intimating any opinion as to whether these fundamental rights may ever be waived by an attorney for his client, it is sufficient for the purposes of this case to point out that the right to be indicted or tried by a constitutionally composed jury is not one of the rights traditionally considered so inherently personal that only the defendant may waive it. In United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, <em>supra, </em>this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">The evidence in this case fairly considered shows no waiver by the appellant himself but at most by his counsel without his express authority. In ordinary procedural matters, the defendant in a criminal case is bound by the acts or nonaction of his counsel. That might extend to the waiver of the objection that Negroes were systematically excluded from the grand jury. In noncapital cases, it might extend to a like waiver as to . the petit jury. <em>It might extend to such a^waivev even in capital cases, \u2022where the record affirmatively shows that the particular jury was desired by defendant\u2019s counsel after conscientious consideration of that course of action which would be best for the client\u2019s cause.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">263 F.2d at 83 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In Whitus v. Balkcom, <em>supra, </em>noted with approval in Henry v. Mississippi, <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. at 451-452, 85 S.Ct. at 569, we quoted the language of <em>Goldsby </em>and stated that in the circumstances described there could be a \u201ctrue waiver based on a free option.\u201d 333 F.2d at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In Cobb v. Balkcom, 339 F.2d 95 (5th Cir. 1964), there was no evidence of any deliberate bypass by counsel for the defendant. The court properly held that the lawyer\u2019s statem\u00e9nt that he was satisfied with the jury was insufficient to show an intent to waive a right to achieve a strategic advantage. The court specifically pointed out that \u201c[w]e are not presented here with a waiver case where a \u2018particular jury was desired by defendant\u2019s counsel after conscientious consideration of that course of action which would be best for his client\u2019s cause,\u2019 see United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, <em>supra.\u201d </em>339 F.2d at 101 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Finally, United States ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, 304 F.2d 53 (5th Cir. 1962) involved a situation where the evidence on which to base the constitutional claim was unknown to the defendant or his counsel at the original trial, and was not easily ascertainable. Since the evidence was not available it was held that there could be no deliberate bypass. <em>See </em>304 F.2d at 69. <em>See also </em>Whitus v. Balkcom, <em>supra, </em>333 F.2d at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">This court thus does no more than adhere to its established rule that a constitutional objection to the composition of a grand or petit jury may be waived by an attorney without consultation with his client where there is \u201cconscientious consideration of that course of action which would be best for his client\u2019s cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\"><em>Waiver by Guilty Plea </em>\u2014 In addition to the attorney\u2019s valid waiver of the jury discrimination claim, there is an alternative basis for our holding that such a claim, could not provide a basis for ha-beas relief in this case. Since the original panel decision in this cause the Supreme Court has made it manifestly clear that Winters\u2019 guilty plea is a complete bar to habeas relief grounded on grand jury discrimination. Tollett v. Henderson, <em>supra. </em>There the court, relying on McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970); Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 90 S.Ct. 1458, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (1970), and Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970), stated that \u201crespondent\u2019s guilty plea here . . . forcloses independent inquiry into the claim of discrimination in the selection of the grand jury.\u201d 411 U.S. at 266, 93 S.Ct. at 1607. <em>Tollett </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>requires this court to reject Winters\u2019 petition for relief based on his jury discrimination claim if we find that his guilty plea was voluntary and intelligent and that he was afforded effective counsel. We turn next to those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\n<em>The Validity of the Guilty Plea</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><em>Knowledge of Every Possible Constitutional Right is Not </em>Required\u2014 Petitioner grounds his attack on the voluntary and understanding character of his guilty plea by arguing that he was never advised that he had a right to object to the systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury that indicted him and from the petit jury which would have tried him had he gone to trial. This in itself, however, is not enough to render his plea invalid. As the Supreme Court stated in Tollett v. Henderson, <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\"><em>. </em>A guilty plea, voluntarily and intelligently entered, may not be vacated because the defendant was not advised of every conceivable constitutional plea in abatement he might have to the charge, no matter how peripheral such a plea might be to the normal focus of counsel\u2019s inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">The principal value of counsel to the accused in a criminal prosecution often lies not in counsel\u2019s ability to recite a list of possible defenses in the abstract, nor in his ability, if time permitted, to amass a large quantum of factual data and inform the defendant of it. Counsel\u2019s concern is the faithful representation of the interest of his client and such representation frequently involves highly practical considerations as well as specialized knowledge of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">411 U.S. at 267, 93 S.Ct. at 1608.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Just as McMann v. Richardson, <em>supra, </em>stands for the proposition that habeas corpus relief is not ipso facto available where counsel has given erroneous advice to his client who pleads guilty as a result thereof, similarly a federal habeas court will not intervene where the attorney merely failed to inform his client of a single possible constitutional claim which he thought best to use as a coin for barter with the prosecution. Where the attorney reached a more than arguably correct decision involving many complicated and uncertain variables, we will not impose a rule requiring that he inform his client as to the precise nature of each variable. A lawyer does not have to conduct a course in constitutional law for his client to validly discharge his position of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Winters may not attack the voluntary and intelligent character of his guilty plea by pointing to his counsel\u2019s failure to discuss either his existing right to challenge the racial composition of the grand jury or his potential right to challenge any unconstitutionally constituted petit jury in the event he determined to go to trial. The character of the plea may be challenged only by petitioners showing that his counsel\u2019s advice was not \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d McMann v. Richardson, <em>supra; </em>Tollett v. Henderson, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\"><em>The Effectiveness of Winters\u2019 Counsel </em>\u2014 We have no doubt that the advice Winters received from his counsel met the standards of McMann. Winters predicates his ineffective counsel claim both on the failure of his retained counsel to advise him of his constitutional right to challenge the jury composition and on a more general claim that the attorney did not devote the necessary time, energy, and interest to petitioner\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">The merits of the more specific charge \u2014 the failure to inform Winters of his right to challenge the grand jury \u2014have been amply dealt with in the earlier portion of the opinion. Suffice it to say that, just as an attorney\u2019s failure to consult with his client does not necessarily vitiate the attorney\u2019s waiver of a constitutionally protected right, an attorney\u2019s failure to consult with his client on every possible constitutional claim does not constitute ineffective counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Winters\u2019 more general claim of ineffective counsel is settled by the district court\u2019s conclusion that the claim was not founded in fact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">[The attorney] interviewed petitioner at the Holmes County Jail promptly upon being employed and prior to the arraignment. This could not have been more than five days after the employment, and was probably less. After interviewing petitioner, the at\u2022torney promptly undertook such investigation as in his judgment was required. He then sought a mental examination of petitioner in order to determine whether or not the defense of insanity would be available. He conferred not only with petitioner, but with members of his family and with the state\u2019s attorneys on numerous occasions. He was fully aware of all of petitioner\u2019s rights, but was also aware of the almost overwhelming evidence against petitioner. His devotion to petitioner\u2019s cause is amply demonstrated by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">The facts surrounding the death of Branch as related to [the attorney] by petitioner presented a clear case of murder under Mississippi law. [The attorney\u2019s] conferences with members of petitioner\u2019s family confirmed that petitioner had given his family the same version of the facts. It should also be remembered that certain unidentified members of petitioner\u2019s family were present at the scene . of the killing. It is not unreasonable to assume that those members of petitioner\u2019s family told what they knew either to [the attorney] or to the other members of the family. It is sig-nifieant that [the attorney\u2019s] interviews with the family produced no conflicts with the version of the facts related to [the attorney] by petitioner. [The attorney\u2019s] conversations with the state\u2019s attorneys further confirmed petitioner\u2019s version of the facts. There is nothing before this court to indicate that even if [the attorney] had interviewed other witnesses he would have learned anything different from what he was told by petitioner, petitioner\u2019s family and the state\u2019s attorneys. It is possible, indeed likely, that some attorneys in the same circumstances might have interviewed other witnesses. However, in the absence of a showing that [the attorney\u2019s] failure to interview such witnesses resulted in his being unaware of available evidence which could have been used to the benefit of petitioner, the court is of the opinion that such failure did not render [the attorney\u2019s] assistance to petitioner ineffective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">333 F.Supp. at 1040-1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Finally, even in the calm of retrospect we do not fault counsel\u2019s advice that Winters should plead guilty in exchange for a lesser penalty. Lawyers worth their salt acutely feel the oppressive weight of professional responsibility when it must carry the stake of human life. If the jury exclusion claim had been successfully asserted, it would have at most only postponed the day of the final judgment. On the facts of this case, we cannot say any able defense lawyer would have made or should have allowed a client to make a different decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even ig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>noring the racial overtones which the dissenters emphasize as so important to this time and place for procedural purposes, Winters\u2019 exchange of a lethal shotgun blast for a prior verbal insult and a fisticuff makes his lawyer\u2019s trade of a term of imprisonment which could be as short as ten years for the chance to gamble on the death sentence look like a sure thing. But conceding <em>arguendo, </em>that the attorney was mistaken in his decision not to attack the jury composition, surely that judgment was well \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d McMann v. Richardson, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">RIVES, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom JOHN R. BROWN, Chief Judge, concurs in part, and GOLDBERG, Circuit Judge, concurs:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">With deference I dissent and adhere to the majority holding of the original panel (466 F.2d 1393 at 1397) reversing and remanding this case for an eviden-tiary hearing on the issue of whether Negroes were in fact systematically excluded from grand <em>and petit juries </em>in Holmes County, Mississippi, at the time of Winters\u2019 indictment and conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">I respectfully submit:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">(1) that the unilateral action of his counsel does <em>not </em>bar Winters from seeking relief based on systematic exclusion of Negroes from either the grand or petit jury;</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">(2) that Winters\u2019 guilty plea was <em>not </em>voluntary and intelligent;</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">(3) that Winters was <em>not </em>furnished effective assistance of counsel;</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">(4) that <em>Goldsby </em>(263 F.2d 71) should remain fully applicable in jurisdictions like Holmes County, Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"APK\">The four issues just outlined are so overlapping and mutually interlocking that they can best be discussed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">The population of Holmes County, Mississippi, is about 70% black and 30% white. We, of course, take judicial notice of the census figures.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the 1960 Census, Holmes County had 2218 white males and 3913 nonwhite males (Winters\u2019 habeas petition averred that 99% of those listed nonwhite were Negroes). According to the 1970 Census, Holmes- County had a total population of 23,120 of which 15,743 were Negroes, 68% of the total. Thus, for every seven Negroes there were approximately three white persons in Holmes County. Yet Winters\u2019 federal habeas petition averred that \u201cat the time of the indictment of the petitioner, either no Negroes or only a very small percent had ever been on the jury list.\u201d (App. p. 8.) At each step of his postconviction proceedings in the state court and in the federal court, Winters has consistently attacked the petit jury array as well as the grand jury composition (see App. pp. 4, 6, 7, 11 to 16). He has never had an opportunity to prove that Negroes were in fact systematically excluded from either the grand jury or the petit jury. This appeal should be decided upon the assumption that, if afforded that opportunity, Winters might be able to prove the truthfulness of his aver-ments.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">Certainly this Court cannot proceed on the assumption upon which Winters\u2019 attorney acted; namely, that the racial composition of the jury made no difference. \u201cI have always assumed that jurors try the facts.\u201d (App. p. 90, see also App. pp. 86-87.) For the Court to proceed upon such an assumption would be wholly unrealistic and would amount to holding unnecessary all of that long line of jurisprudence forbidding systematic exclusion of persons from jury serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ice because of their race. Indeed, Mr. Crawley misconceived his role as an advocate for Winters as opposed to that of amicus curiae.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The racial composition of the juries, grand and petit, was of utmost importance because the case literally shrieks with racial overtones. Branch, a middle-aged white man with a bad reputation in the community, severely slapped Winters, an 18-year-old Negro, because Winters talked to a Negro girl employee in Branch\u2019s beer joint. Infuriated by the slap, Winters left the beer joint, drove to get a shotgun, and returned to kill Branch. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Perhaps we can better envision the case if in our mind\u2019s eye we picture it as one in which the races of the parties are reversed. That is to say, a middle-aged black man with a bad reputation in the community runs a beer joint in which he employs a white girl. A white boy, 18 years old, undertakes to talk to the girl and the black man severely slaps the white boy. The white boy, infuriated by the slap, leaves the beer joint, drives to get a shotgun, and returns to kill the black man. Would any member of this Court be so certain that the white boy would suffer the death penalty unless he entered a bargained plea for a life sentence? Would it be certain that the white boy would be indicted for murder? Would it be fair for that white boy to be indicted for murder by an all-black grand jury and to be tried before an all-black petit jury with whites systematically excluded from jury service? Certainly not. Before this Court, Winters stands on an equal footing with that white boy. Each is entitled to a trial before a jury of his peers from which members of his race have not been systematically excluded. '</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">There could scarcely exist a clearer or more extreme case in which an attorney undertook to act unilaterally, without consulting or advising his client as to his rights or as to the pertinent facts to be considered in reaching a decision to plead guilty or not guilty. That is shown by the following express and detailed findings of fact made by Judge Ready, the federal district judge; quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4g\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>However well-intentioned he may have been, Mr. Crawley wholly misconceived his role as attorney for Winters. In reaching a decision to change his plea to guilty and accept life imprisonment as punishment, Winters was entitled to the <em>advice </em>of his attorney, not to his virtual <em>dictation. </em>Mr. Crawley simply had no right or authority to assume the ultimate responsibility for Winters\u2019 destiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Winters was not lacking in intelligence. That is readily demonstrated from reading his testimony before the state trial judge at the hearing of his motion to vacate (App. 59-78). Judge Keady found as a fact that, \u201cAlthough lacking in formal education, petitioner was intelligent and capable of normal understanding.\u201d (333 F.Supp. 1036).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The right and responsibility to reach the ultimate decision as to pleading .guilty or not rested squarely upon the shoulders of Winters himself. Winters was denied that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In Developments in the Law \u2014 Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1110, the author states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-16\">\u201cAny attempt to devise a waiver rule independent of the allocation of authority between attorney and client in the trial court is doomed to failure. The waiver question requires a determination as to which of the two may act authoritatively in the proceedings looking to a final judgment of guilt or innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">In a classic affirmation of the need for the defendant\u2019s personal participation in a significant by-pass decision, the Supreme Court stated in Fay v. Noia, 1962, 372 U.S. 391, 438-439, 83 S. Ct. 822, 849, 9 L.Ed.2d 837:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-18\">\u201c. . . We therefore hold that the federal habeas judge may in his discretion deny relief to an applicant who has <em>deliberately by-passed </em>the orderly procedure of the state courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-20\">\u201cBut we wish to make very clear that this grant of discretion is not to be interpreted as a permission to introduce legal fictions into federal ha-beas corpus. The classic definition of waiver enunciated in Johnson v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 [58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461] \u2014 \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\u2019 \u2014 furnishes <em>the controlling standard </em>... At all events we wish it clearly understood that the standard here put forth depends on the <em>considered choice of the petitioner </em>.... A. choice made by counsel not participated in by the petitioner <em>does not automatically bar relief.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The clear mandate of the <em>Noia </em>standard is that the defendant must personally participate in the by-pass decision. The admonition in the last sentence does little to undermine the strength of the standard dictated by the entire paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The key question is to what extent, if any, does Henry v. Mississippi, 1965, 379 U.S. 443, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408, limit the broad language of <em>Noia </em>emphasizing the need for defendant\u2019s personal participation in the by-pass decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The majority recognizes, as it must, that after <em>Henry </em>there are instances where a defendant\u2019s personal waiver is required. According to the majority, those instances fall into two categories: First, where there is evidence of incompetence on the part of the defendant\u2019s attorney; and, second, where an inherently personal right of fundamental importance is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In the original panel opinion, the majority held that Winters\u2019 guilty plea was not intelligently entered and, hence, any waiver incorporated in that plea was ineffective. That holding rendered academic the issue of Crawley\u2019s right to independently waive Winters\u2019 potential jury objection. I adhere to the view that Winters\u2019 conviction should be reversed on the ground that his guilty plea was constitutionally invalid, but assuming arguendo that the plea was competent, I would hold, in contrast to the majority, that the right to racially nondiscriminatory grand and petit juries is so important as to require a personal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">The majority\u2019s rhetorical statements that \u201cWe refuse to enlarge the attorney\u2019s duty to include the responsibility to inform the defendant of every possible constitutional claim\u201d and \u201cA lawyer does not have to conduct a course in constitutional law for his client to validly discharge his position of trust\u201d tend to obscure the real issue involved \u2014 whether the constitutional right to racially nondiseriminatory grand and petit juries is one of those paramount rights which must be personally waited by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">For almost a century the Supreme Court has consistently held that \u201ca conviction cannot stand if it is based on an indictment of a grand jury or the verdict of a petit jury from which Negroes were excluded. . . . \u201d Whitus v. Georgia, 1966, 385 U.S. 545, 549, 87 S. Ct. 643, 646, 17 L.Ed.2d 599.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s emphatic sustained confirmation of the constitutional, right to racially nondiseriminatory grand and petit juries, I submit that that right is far too important to be taken out of the defendant\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">The majority places great weight upon the following language in <em>Henry, supra </em>at 451-452, 85 S.Ct. 564, 569:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">\u201cAlthough trial strategy adopted by counsel without prior consultation with an accused will not, where the circumstances are exceptional, preclude the accused from asserting constitutional claims, see Whitus v. Balkcom, 333 F.2d 496 (5th Cir. 1964), we think that the deliberate by-passing by counsel of the contemporaneous-objection rule as a part of trial strate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>gy </em>would have that effect in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">In spite of the Supreme Court\u2019s explicit reference to Whitus v. Balkcom as an example of \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the majority concludes that the present case does not fall within the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d portion of the <em>Henry </em>rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With that conclusion, I categorically disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In Whitus v. Balkcom, this Court recognized the \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d imposed upon both a black defendant and his white attorney in jurisdictions with a history of racial segregation and an all-white jury system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201cBut the burden is exceptionally heavy when the life and liberty of an accused depend on the weight to be given something as imponderable as the extent of the additional anti-Negro reaction that would be engendered by attacking the all-white jury system. As if this were not sufficiently difficult, there is the intolerable complication that the reaction against an attorney who raises the exclusion issue may stretch from persiflage to ostracism.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-10\"><em>Whitus, supra, </em>333 F.2d at 505, 506. Thus, there are two Hobson\u2019s choices\u2014 one faced by the black defendant and the other by his white attorney. The majority ignores completely the constitutionally impermissible choice forced upon the black defendant, ruling only on the issue of the attorney\u2019s Hobson\u2019s choice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa5\">\u201c. . . the majority of the court en banc now announces that it does not consider such breach of trust by counsel [referring to the judicial notice taken in Goldsby v. Harpole that southern lawyers rarely raise the issue of systematic exclusion of Negroes .from juries] to be so prevalent in any jurisdiction of this circuit that this court should, in the absence of proof, place all or even some lawyers in this circuit under the cloud of such an accusation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Assuming that the majority\u2019s prospective overruling of <em>Goldsby </em>and disclaimer of any \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d facing modern southern lawyers is correct (a conclusion I do not accept),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Hobson\u2019s choice \u2014 that imposed upon the black defendant himself \u2014 which was recognized in <em>Goldsby </em>(see 263 F.2d 82) and formed the heart of the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Whitus </em>\u2014 certainly faced Winters in Holmes County, Mississippi in 1963. The key to the holding in <em>Goldsby </em>and in <em>Whitus, </em>the unconstitutional burden shouldered by the accused, endures as an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d specifically recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Henry. </em>The probity of the black defendant\u2019s white attorney, the issue with which the majority is preoccupied, is irrelevant to the central thrust of the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d rule. Even assuming that the waiver of the constitutional claim is calculated to benefit the defendant, if the advantage to be gained by the waiver is the avoidance of improper racial prejudice, then the attorney\u2019s decision will not bind the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">To obviate what appears to me to be mistaken reliance by the majority on Tollett v. Henderson, 1973, 411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235, I quote the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice Rehnquist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-14\">\u201cWe thus reaffirm the principle recognized in the <em>Brady </em>trilogy: a guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process. When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea. He may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea by showing that the advice he received from counsel was not within the standards set forth in <em>McMa/nn.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 1608, 36 L.Ed.2d 235, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Thus the issue is now precisely drawn: When Winters pleaded guilty, was the advice he received from counsel \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal eases\u201d? I submit that that question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Winters was ignorant both as to the constitutional invalidity of the indictment and as to his prospects for a fair trial before a jury of his peers from which members of his race were not systematically excluded. Mr. Crawley was fully aware of Winter\u2019s rights and of their prospective violation in a trial on the merits, but he failed completely to give Winters any advice whatsoever on the subject. Thus Winters was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out that in the <em>Brady </em>trilogy the facts giving rise to the constitutional claims were generally known both to the defendants and to their attorneys prior to the entry of the guilty pleas, and that in <em>Tollett </em>such facts were unknown both to the defendant and to his attorney. Here the facts were known to Mr. Crawley but they were not known to Winters. This case differs from both the <em>Brady </em>trilogy and <em>Tollett </em>in that here the defendant\u2019s attorney was under a positive duty to advise the defendant of his constitutional rights and that in the absence of objection those rights would be violated. Mr. Crawley completely, indeed deliberately, failed to give Winters any such advice. Thus Winters was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Further, it is plain error for a trial court to accept a plea of guilty without an affirmative showing that the defendant himself intelligently and voluntarily entered his plea. Boykin v. Alabama, 1969, 395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274. \u201cWhat is at stake for an accused facing death or imprisonment demands the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u201d <em>Boykin, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 243-244, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1712. The voluntariness of the plea \u201ccan be determined only by considering all of the relevant circumstances surrounding it.\u201d Brady v. United States, 1970, 397 U.S. 742, 749, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1469, 25 L.Ed.2d 747. A plea of guilty waives the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to trial. Such a waiver not only must be voluntary but must be a knowing, intelligent act done with \u201cawareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u201d The defendant must have an opportunity to make \u201can intelligent assessment of the relative advantages of pleading guilty,\u201d <em>Brady, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 748 n. 6, 90 S.Ct. at 1469, and to \u201crationally weigh the advantages of going to trial against the advantages of pleading guilty,\u201d <em>Brady, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 750, 90 S.Ct. at 1470.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">From the record in this case, one must conclude that Winters\u2019 attorney refrained from giving him any advice as to Winters\u2019 right to challenge the racial composition of both the grand jury and the trial jury. Being ignorant of such matters, and with his attorney deliberately failing to give him any pertinent advice, it was simply impossible for Winters to make an intelligent choice to change his plea from not guilty to guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>I conclude that Winters\u2019 guilty plea was not valid; he was not furnished effective assistance of counsel; the unilateral action of his counsel was not a waiver by Winters; <em>Goldsby\u25a0 </em>should remain fully applicable in jurisdictions like Holmes County, Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">GODBOLD, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom JOHN R. BROWN, Chief Judge, and WISDOM, Circuit Judge, concur:</p>\n<p id=\"A7S\">The Supreme Court, in Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965), recognized that under exceptional circumstances trial strategy adopted by counsel without prior consultation with the accused will not preclude the accused from later constitutional claims. In the opinion for the Court Justice Brennan cited the decision of this circuit in Whitus v. Balkcom, 333 F.2d 496 (5th Cir., 1964), as an example of \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d 379 U. S. at 451, 85 S.Ct. at 569, 13 L.Ed.2d at 415. In <em>Whitus, </em>Judge Wisdom\u2019s opinion for this court had addressed itself to, inter alia, the \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d imposed upon the white attorney for a black defendant in places where as a consequence of past practices of segregation there has been an all-white jury system. 333 F.2d at 505-509. The teaching of <em>Whit-us </em>in this respect is not that an attorney who does not question the racial composition of the jury is necessarily lacking in competence or is failing to conscientiously represent his client. Rather it is that the defendant is prejudiced in a constitutional sense when his counsel, however, able and conscientious, is presented with such a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In this case I do not fault counsel nor do I question the bona fides of his conclusion that the case against his client was such that he considered the racial composition of the jury to be immaterial. But those considerations do not solve the constitutional issue. To cite the conclusion conscientiously made by counsel who knows the facts about the jury system, or to conclude that faced with the possibility of a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d he secured a good plea bargain for his client, is no answer to the principle that the constitution forbids that the choice be injected into the case in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">The majority opinion gives lip service to the interplay of <em>Henry </em>and <em>Whitus </em>but undercuts it. There can be little doubt that Holmes County is a place where as a consequence of past practices there has been racial exclusion of Negroes from juries. Winters\u2019 counsel, on the scene, recognized this<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and elected to employ it as a lever in plea bargaining. I do not understand the majority to deny the past history of racial exclusion but rather to confess and avoid. One prong of the avoidance is that viewed in retrospect Winters\u2019 counsel made effective use of the very deficiency of which Winters now complains. The difficulty with this approach \u2014 that Winters really got a \u201cgood deal\u201d and ought not to complain \u2014 is that had Winters been informed of the racial exclusion point he might have elected to stand on it and take his chances before a properly constituted jury. While we do not know, he just might have been acquitted or convicted of some lesser offense. He was deprived of participation in the decision as to what election to make, and that deprivation cannot be cured by the subsequent reaction of judges that, considering all, he came out remarkably well.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">The theory, asserted to avoid <em>Whitus, </em>that as to the petit jury Winters\u2019 attorney never faced the \u201ccruel choice\u201d because he made a plea bargain before a trial court convened, will not stand ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>amination. The possible assertion of racial composition of Holmes County juries was the springboard for plea bargaining. The matter of whether \u2014 and how \u2014 racial composition would be raised if no plea bargain was agreed upon necessarily was a factor in counsel\u2019s deci-sional process. The ultimate moment of truth never came, but it would have arisen had there been no plea bargain. The \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d may not be inflicted either in the courtroom at trial or ahead of trial as a factor necessarily part and parcel of plea bargining.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The second prong of the majority\u2019s confession and avoidance is to conclude that this is not an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d case within Henry v. Mississippi. Necessarily my brothers must draw the teeth of Justice Brennan\u2019s reference in <em>Henry </em>to <em>Whitus </em>as an example of \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d In <em>Whitus, </em>a waiver-by-counsel case, there was a history of racial exclusion of Negroes from juries to which was applied the \u201cjudicial notice\u201d rule of Goldsby v. Harpole, 263 F.2d 71 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 850, 80 S.Ct. 109, 4 L.Ed.2d 89 (1959). The majority in the present ease, therefore, recede from <em>Goldsby </em>and would require the client whose right to object to racial composition of a jury has been waived by his counsel, to prove that in waiving without the client\u2019s consent the attorney failed in his obligation. (Presumably there would be failure of obligation if it could be shown that the attorney was unwilling to raise the issue of racial exclusion or that the possibility of having to raise the issue was a significant factor in the plea bargaining process.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The majority do not say that <em>Goldsby </em>was wrong <em>ab initio. </em>Indeed a group of judges none of whom was on this court in 1959, and most' of them not even on the bench, are hardly in position to say that JJ. Rives, Brown (now Chief Judge) and Wisdom, erred in 1959 in considering particular subject matter\u2019to be of such general currency at that time as to be accepted as true without proof. The principle then established in <em>Golds-by </em>was not one of universal application but rather by its own terms was limited to \u201cmany jurisdictions.\u201d It is possible that in some places where past segregation practices once commanded the application of <em>Whitus-Goldsby </em>time and change have so erased history that the choice \u2014 faced by counsel knowing the facts \u2014 of whether to attack the racial composition of the jury is no longer a choice between the lesser of two evils. But it is for the state to prove by objective facts that the particular jurisdiction is not one of the \u201cmany jurisdictions\u201d in which <em>Goldsby </em>applies. That was not done here. It strikes me as inappropriate to wipe out an established rule having specialized application throughout the range of a giant six-state circuit by means of a sweeping pronouncement in a ease in which the concern is racial exclusion in a single county in one state, and to do this without objective facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The defendant ^ in this case pleaded guilty, while the defendants in <em>Henry </em>and <em>Whitus </em>had been found guilty after trial. The majority opinion refers to Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973), holding that a state criminal defendant who had pleaded guilty could not thereafter raise by federal habeas corpus a claim of racially-related infirmity in the grand jury selection process. In <em>Tollett </em>the Court stated that the counselled defendant who has entered a guilty plea \u201cmay only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea by showing that the advice he received from counsel was not within the standards set forth in <em>McMann </em>[McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 770-771, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763, 773 (1970), which stated that the test is whether the advice was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal eases].\u201d But in <em>Tollett </em>neither the petitioner nor his counsel knew how the grand jury had been selected or that Negroes were systematically excluded. 411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d at 239. Tollett\u2019s complaint was not that his attorney had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>been faced with an unconstitutional \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d but rather that he had failed to make diligent inquiry to ascertain the facts concerning racial exclusion, an issue which the court left open to be determined on remand under <em>McMcmn </em>standards. It seems to me that <em>Tollett </em>has no application to the situation where counsel <em>does </em>know of the all-white jury system and is thrust eyeball-to-eyeball against the cruel choice described in <em>Whitus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">One of the reasons that the \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d of <em>Whitus </em>was an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d under <em>Henry </em>is the risk that against a background of historical exclusion of blacks from the jury the white attorney will fail to confer with and advise his black client about attacking the system, or, if the attorney does confer with him, that the advice may be colored by counsel\u2019s fear of harm to his client\u2019s cause or his concern (conscious or unconscious) for his own status in the community. <em>Whitus, supra, </em>333 F.2d at 505-506. It makes no sense to apply <em>McMann\u2019s </em>standards of competence to a situation with respect to which the Supreme Court has recognized that the risks to the defendant are independent of counsel\u2019s competence. Thus, the <em>Whi-tus-Henry </em>combination remains viable where \u2014 or, more specifically, at the very least where \u2014 the complaint is not that counsel does not know enough but that he knows so much that the risks to his client are too great.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">. Particularly is this true where, as here, the defendant is illiterate. On facts somewhat similar to the ones in the case at hand, this court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">[I]t is unrealistic for this court to attach significance to the presence or absence of consultation of the attorneys with the defendants and the presence or absence of express consent by the defendants to the so-called waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">Whitus v.

Here Winters has made no showing at all that the attorney\u2019s decision was in any way motivated by other than a desire to save his client\u2019s life. Indeed, what evidence there is more refutes than- proves any contention that the attorney refrained from challenging the grand jury out of a fear of social, extralegal pressures. The district attorney, an elected official much more sensitive to community reaction than petitioner\u2019s attorney, was persuaded by the attorney\u2019s willingness to use this possible defense to intercede with the court for a guilty plea and a prison term sentence in an easy-to-prove case of coldblooded interracial murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-5\">.

Moreover, it is practically certain the number of times such challenges or the active use of the leverage of such a position by defense counsel took place in unreported trial court situations is much, much greater. For example, the Mississippi Supreme Court, in refusing Goldsby\u2019s state court collateral attack on his conviction, noted that counsel for one of Goldsby\u2019s codefend <em>&lt;nts </em>timely made such a challenge to the g and jury.

I take this opportunity to correct a confusing error in footnote 2 to my dissent to the original panel decision in this case, 466 F.2d at 1399. The footnote should conclude \u201cit is not inappropriate to note that in <em>G-oldsby </em>and [other] of the cases examined, the defense was effectively raised, but the defendant was eventually executed after retrial with a proper jury. A Pyrrhic victory indeed.\u201d (Corrected word in brackets.) This reference to Goldsby\u2019s execution and the execution of several of those more-than-twenty referred to in that footnote who initially raised their jury claim in the state courts was not intended to fault the <em>Goldsby </em>court\u2019s reasoning by hindsight. It merely suggests that no one can quarrel with the forceful truth forecast by the results of those cases had Winters\u2019 attorney chosen to submit his case to a jury in order to formally raise the constitutional claim. A motion won is a poor exchange for a client\u2019s life lost.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-17\"><em>. </em>United States v.

The only evidentiary hearing was that in the state trial court on Winters\u2019 motion to vacate, and the only evidence as to the facts and circumstances of the killing was the hearsay testimony of Mr. Crawley as to what Winters had told him. Mr. Crawley testified to different, if not inconsistent, versions on direct examination (App. 81, 82) and on re-direct examination (App. 97). Judge ICeady adopted the latter version: \u201cA total distance of approximately 40 miles had been traveled from the beer joint to the friend\u2019s hous.e and back\u201d (333 F.Supp. 1037). Forty miles travel by automobile would probably consume less than an hour in time. Under Mississippi law, it would be for the jury to say whether there had been sufficient time for cooling of Winters\u2019 feelings of outrage to furnish the \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d essential for a conviction of murder, and consequently whether the crime amounted to murder or manslaughter. In a case where the state of agitation extended from Monday night until Wednesday afternoon, the Mississippi Supreme Court said: \u201cThere is no fixed period of time for cooling.

Did it occur to you that under Mississippi law, you might have waived the defendant\u2019s right to object on the grounds of systematic exclusion of Negroes as jurors?</p>\n<p id=\"AaK\">\u201c \u2018A. I was aware that any motion must be filed before arraignment. I was also aware that in view of the seriousness of the constitutional questions that could be raised, that it would be reversible error for the court to overrule the motion, probably. \u201cMr. Fitzgerald,\u201d the supreme thing in my mind at the time was saving this man\u2019s life. I felt then and now that I must do and did do at that time all I could to save this man from the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"APW\">\u201c \u2018Q. Were you concerned with whether or not you were making the decisions your client would have made?</p>\n<p id=\"abq-dedup-0\">\u201c \u2018A. Well, insofar as making decisions are concerned, I accepted the responsibility of this man\u2019s destiny when I accepted employment. I was representing him to the best of my ability, and I cannot say 1 would have allowed him to make any decision which I felt would put his life in jeopardy. Before I could do that, I would have asked the court to allow me to withdraw, I could not knowingly allow him to make a decision which would put his life in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"ASF\">\u201c \u2018Q. But it went a little deeper than that because you did not inform him of what his rights were, did you, as to the composition of the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"ARz\">\u201c \u2018A. Insofar as his constitutional rights with regard to the composition of the Grand and Petit Juries, I did not discuss that with him, as I say, I was more concerned with saving this man\u2019s life than anything else.\u2019 \u201d 333 F.Supp. 1039 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\">.

It is important to note that <em>Henry </em>involved a situation requiring an immediate courtroom decision. The logical conclusion to be drawn from the facts in <em>Henry </em>is that <em>Henry </em>eliminates the requirement of personal participation only as to decisions involving ongoing courtroom tactics. This interpretation is buttressed by the fact that <em>Henry </em>made no mention of limiting <em>Noia, </em>and Mr. Justice Brennan wrote both opinions. <em>Noia </em>involved a nontrial issue \u2014 the right to appeal, whereas <em>Henry </em>involved a trial issue\u2014 admission of a police officer\u2019s damaging testimony. This case falls within that class involving nontrial strategy to which the <em>Noia </em>mandate applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In Brookhart v. Janis, 1966, 384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314, a habeas case, decided during the term following <em>Henry, </em>the Supreme Court found that the petitioner\u2019s alleged waiver of the right to cross-examine witnesses by agreeing to let the state prove merely a prima facie case did not meet the standards of Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461, since petitioner obviously did not appreciate the significance of counsel\u2019s agreement to accept proof of a \u201cprima facie\u201d case. In holding that petitioner\u2019s right to confrontation could not be waived by counsel, the Court found \u201cnothing in <em>Henry\u201d </em>that could \u201cpossibly support\u201d a contrary result. Winters, like the petitioner in <em>Brookhart, </em>gave up his right to trial and confrontation by succumbing to a bargain (struck by counsel) whose significance Winters did not appreciate. In <em>Brookhart, </em>as in <em>Noia </em>and <em>Winters, </em>there was time for the attorney to advise his client ; a Henry-type courtroom tactical decision was not involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b269-14\">. In order to reach the conclusion that the second leg of the <em>Whitus </em>holding is now incorrect, the majority finds it necessary to prospectively repudiate this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Goldsby </em>that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-15\">\u201cAs Judges of a Circuit comprising six states of the deep South, we think that it is our duty to take judicial notice that lawyers residing in many southern jurisdictions rarely, almost to the point of never, raise the issue of systematic exclusion of Negroes from juries.\u201d (263 F.2d at 82.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">That quotation was lifted out of context. The quotation had been preceded by a long paragraph showing the prejudicial effect on the defendant himself caused by raising the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>issue. See Goldsby v. Harpole, 263 F.2d at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"A_4\">The judicial notice taken in <em>Goldsby </em>was judicial notice of a legislative fact, not an adjudicative fact, see Judicial Notice, 55 Col-um.L.Rev. 945 (1955) ; K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 15.03 (1958) ; Note, 72 Yale L.J. 559 (1963) ; and as a crucial link in the Court\u2019s reasoning process, it was perfectly proper. The majority\u2019s citation of Mississippi Supreme Court decisions which involved jury discrimination objections made prior to <em>Goldsby </em>does not undermine the fact that in <em>many </em>southern jurisdictions such objections were <em>rare. </em>Happily the number of such jurisdictions is now much less, but in predominantly Negro jurisdictions like Holmes County, Mississippi, the battle has not been won.</p>\n<p id=\"A9L\">A few quotations from cases decided in this Circuit will reveal actual testimony supporting the position taken in <em>Goldsby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-9p\">Winters\u2019 attorney, Mr. Crawley, testified that although he has represented many Negro defendants,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agt\">\u201cHe had <em>never </em>filed such a challenge himself, but knew of <em>one </em>case in which a white attorney had challenged the composition of a jury on racial grounds in Kosciusko, without adverse social or economic effects.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 333 F.Supp. at 1037.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsyN\">\u201cHonorable Carl Booth, who had been the State prosecuting attorney in Mobile since 1943, testified that <em>no motion </em>based on the exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury or the petit jury had ever been made prior to Seals\u2019 trial . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)

He had <em>never </em>attacked the composition of a jury on the ground that Negroes were systematically excluded.\u201d (Emphasis added.) U. S. ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, 304 F.2d at 68.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWl\">\u201cThe evidence adduced in support of the petition included sworn statements of the sheriff and 'deputy clerk of the Superior Court of Jasper County, who had held their positions, respectively, for 21 and 30 years, that no Negroes had ever served on a grand or traverse jury in the county during the past 30 years . . .. These officials stated also that they had <em>never </em>heard counsel for a Negro defendant in a criminal case <em>raise any constitutional objection to the composition of a jury </em>panel from which the names of grand and traverse jurors were drawn.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Cobb v. Balkcom, 5 Cir. 1964, 339 F.2d 95, 98.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVt\">\u201cThe affidavit of Cobb\u2019s trial counsel showed that he had been a member of the Georgia Bar since 1934; that he had defended many Negroes charged with felonies in the county, and that he had <em>never </em>seen a Negro serving on a traverse jury in the county. He stated that he had <em>never </em>raised the issue of a systematic exclusion of Negroes from juries . . ..\u201d (Emphasis added.) Cobb v.
