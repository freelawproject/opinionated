The court summarily denied the motion sua sponte. The action of the trial court was erroneous, however, since plaintiff had a right to amend its complaint once, no responsive pleading having been filed. Case v. State Farm Mutual Automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1961, 294 F.2d 676, 678; Breier v. Northern California Bowling Proprietor\u2019 Ass\u2019n, 9 Cir., 1963, 316 F.2d 787, 789. Leave to amend should be freely given by the district court, and under the circumstances here, plaintiff should be afforded an opportunity to amend its complaint as requested, and test its claim on the merits. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
