At issue in the present appeal is the validity of a resolution adopted by the Memphis City Council directing the mayor and comptroller to withhold $250,000 from funds previously approved for use by the Memphis Board of Education. Said sum approximated the cost of the busing of school children ordered by the District Court, and in oral argument in this Court the City\u2019s attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ney frankly conceded that the City\u2019s action was a protest against such Court ordered busing. The District Judge found that the City took such action in an effort to prevent busing as a means of desegregation and issued an order restraining such unlawful defiance of the Court\u2019s orders. This appeal followed, and we affirm, holding that the action of the District Court was required to accomplish a constitutionally mandated result.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Appellees seek costs and attorneys\u2019 fees in this case and in the dispute involving the School Board\u2019s gasoline supply. In support of this request appellees cite Rule 38, Fed.R.App.P., which empowers an appellate court to \u201caward just damages and single or double costs to the appellee\u201d when the appeal is determined to be frivolous. Alternatively, appellees suggest the application of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1617, which entitles the prevailing party to attorneys\u2019 fees in a suit against \u201ca local educational agency, a State (or any agency thereof) for failure to comply with any provision of [Chapter 36 of the General Educational Provisions Act of 1972] . or for discrimination on the basis of race . . . [in] elementary or secondary education . . . .\u201d Finally, appellees cite Northcross v. Memphis Board of Education, 412 U.S. 427, 93 S.Ct. 2201, 37 L.Ed.2d 48 (1973), to buttress their claim. In that case the Supreme Court held that attorneys\u2019 fees should normally be awarded in discrimination cases, and that it required a special circumstance of unfairness to defeat this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">We find that the appeals in these eases are essentially frivolous in nature, constituting an attempt by appellant to interfere with the desegregation plans ordered by the District Court. Although appellant is technically neither a \u201cState\u201d nor \u201can agency thereof,\u201d the spirit of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1617 and <em>North-cross, supra, </em>justify the award of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees to appellees in this case. In addition, we are empowered to make this award under Rule 38, Fed.R. App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Costs including an attorney\u2019s fee of $500 is hereby assessed against the City of Memphis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
