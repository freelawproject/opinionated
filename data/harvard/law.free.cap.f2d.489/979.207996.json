He was tried by a jury and convicted on two counts and sentenced to concurrent five year terms. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-16\">Before trial Carmichael filed a motion to suppress a quantity of checks seized in his automobile at the time of his arrest under an arrest warrant. The judge conducted a hearing during which a Secret Service agent, Hussey, whose affidavit was filed in sole support of the arrest warrant, testified. The agent\u2019s affidavit was based upon information given to him by an informant alleged to be reliable. The judge precluded inquiry into the reliability of the informant, found the supporting affidavit of the agent was not facially insufficient, and denied Carmichael\u2019s motion on the ground that the warrant was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-17\">Carmichael contends that the district judge erred in denying him an opportunity to challenge the reliability of the government informant. He further contends that the judge erred in ruling that the affidavit supporting the application was sufficient on its face. We hold that the affidavit was facially insufficient and that the district judge erred in refusing to suppress the evidence. We need not consider whether the judge erred in precluding defendant\u2019s questioning of the agent concerning the reliability of the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-18\">After the judge precluded questions concerning the informant\u2019s reliability, Carmichael\u2019s attorney stated that the \u201cfirst\u201d reason for the motion to suppress was that \u201con its face the affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>davit is insufficient\u201d as based on \u201chearsay upon hearsay.\u201d The court denied the motion to suppress urged on the basis of this \u201cfirst\u201d reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">A federal magistrate issued the war-' rant for Carmichael\u2019s arrest. The affidavit supporting the warrant application is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-6\">And the complainant states that this complaint is based on the fact that your complainant was told by a reliable informant, whose information in the past has led to the conviction of at least six people, that T. W. ALLEN, ROBERT E. CARMICHAEL and JOHN DOE have in their possession numerous treasury and commercial cheeks one which is a check made payable to Photo Finishers, in the amount of $5,276.00. The confidential informant told your complainant that he has seen these checks in the possession of one of the defendants and that the defendant who had possession told him that the checks would be given by ROBERT E. CARMICHAEL to JOHN DOE and then to T. W. ALLEN, and that these checks were stolen from the mail, and that ROBERT E. CARMICHAEL, T. W. ALLEN and JOHN DOE would cash or cause these checks to be cashed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">The substance of the affidavit is that the agent\u2019s \u201cconfidential informant\u201d told him that he, the informant, had \u201cseen\u201d the cheeks in possession of \u201cone of the defendants,\u201d that that defendant in possession of the stolen checks told the \u201cconfidential informant\u201d that the checks would be given by Carmichael to \u201cJohn Doe\u201d and then to T. W. Allen, that the checks were stolen, and that Carmichael, Allen and \u201cDoe\u201d would cash, or cause the cashing of, the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">We think the affidavit is insufficient on its face to establish probable cause for Carmichael\u2019s arrest. We shall assume that the \u201cconfidential informant[\u2019s]\u201d reliability is sufficiently established. A common sense reading of the affidavit, Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 415, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), justified the magistrate in treating as probable the \u201cconfidential informant[\u2019s]\u201d report relating to those matters which he personally observed. We think that there was probable cause shown for the magistrate to conclude that \u201cone of the defendants\u201d possessed the checks. <em>Spinelli </em>at 412, 89 S.Ct. 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">Nevertheless, there is nothing in the hearsay information given by the \u201cconfidential informant\u201d that identifies Carmichael as the possessor. Carmichael is implicated in the check cashing scheme solely through the allegations of \u201cthat defendant\u201d whom the \u201cconfidential informant\u201d had seen in possession of the checks and who told the \u201cconfidential informant\u201d what role he said Carmichael would play in cashing the stolen checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">When the affidavit of special agent Hussey was presented to the magistrate for his consideration it was patently ambiguous. Given the information provided on the face of the affidavit it is not possible to identify the \u201cdefendant who had possession\u201d of the checks and therefore it is not possible to establish his reliability. During the hearing on the motion to suppress the government revealed that T. W. Allen was the informant. At that point it became possible to read agent Hussey\u2019s affidavit in such a fashion that the ambiguity is somewhat dissipated. The statement can now be read to indicate that T. W. Allen told agent Hussey that he saw the checks in the possession of Robert Carmichael and that Carmichael told Allen that he would give the cheeks to \u201cJohn Doe\u201d who would in turn give them to Allen. Nothing in the record before this court intimates that the magistrate was presented information at the time the arrest warrant was sought that would allow him to interpret the affidavit in the manner we have described.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">We recognize that an affidavit \u201cneed not reflect the direct observations of the affiant and may rest upon hearsay\u201d so long as a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay is presented, Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 271, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>and that the affidavit must be tested by us in a \u201ccommonsense and realistic fashion,\u201d United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965). We find nothing, however, in the affidavit before us which tends to show the reliability of \u201cthat defendant\u201d who had possession of the stolen checks. The government does not argue that this unidentified \u201cdefendants[\u2019s]\u201d statements were against his penal interest. See United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 583, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971). The \u201cconfidential informant [\u2019s]\u201d report to the agent of the hearsay implication of Carmichael is of no aid to establish reliability or credibility of \u201cthat defendant.\u201d <em>Spinelli, supra </em>at 413 n. 3, 89 S. Ct. 584. The \u201cconfidential informant\u201d received his information indirectly and the affidavit does not show that he explained to the agent why \u201cthat defendant\u201d in the alleged conspiracy was reliable. <em>Spinelli, supra </em>at 416, 89 S.Ct. at 589. There is nothing in the affidavit which sets forth \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d necessary to enable the magistrate \u201cindependently to judge\u201d the validity of \u201cthat defendant[\u2019s]\u201d observation of the criminal activity attributed to Carmichael. Nor was there any other source of information given in the affidavit to corroborate the statement of the second informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">We hold, by virtue of this court\u2019s decision in United States v. Roth, 391 F.2d 507, 511 (7th Cir. 1967), that the district judge committed reversible error in denying Carmichael\u2019s motion to suppress. The arrest warrant was based on hearsay upon hearsay. <em>Roth, supra </em>at 511, and thus the district judge erred in admitting at trial the evidence seized incident to Carmichael\u2019s arrest under the warrant. The government does not argue that even if the arrest warant was invalid there was nevertheless sufficient evidence to support Carmichael\u2019s conviction. The conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Should Carmichael be tried again under the counts in the indictment before us, it may be useful for the trier of fact to have our decision on contentions \u2014other than that with respect to the motion to suppress \u2014 raised by Carmichael. We see no merit in his contention that reversible error was committed in the ruling which permitted the government to cross-examine Carmichael about criminal activity on February 4, 1969, where the offense in issue was alleged to have been committed February 10, 1969. In the first place, a government witness testified that he was in Carmichael\u2019s apartment on February 4 and saw Carmichael with a check subject of Count IY of the indictment, that it was taken from an envelope containing a number of other checks and that he heard discussion that the checks were stolen and efforts would be made to cash them. This testimony tended to prove Carmichael\u2019s knowledge that the checks he was accused of possessing had been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">Carmichael testified that he did not know how the checks got into his car. The court permitted the government to cross-examine Carmichael concerning the February 4 incidents. This ruling was not erroneous, since the examination bore on an element of the offense charged. United States v. Wall, 225 F.2d 905, 907 (7th Cir. 1955); United States v. Turner, 423 F.2d 481, 483, 484 (7th Cir. 1970); United States v. Phillips, 375 F.2d 75, 79 (7th Cir. 1967). This court\u2019s opinion in United States v. Phillips, 401 F.2d 301, 305 (7th Cir. 1968), is not to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">There is no merit in the contention that the court erred in permitting the agent to testify in rebuttal in view of Carmichael\u2019s denial of knowledge of the theft of the checks. See United States v. Lambert, 463 F.2d 552 (7th Cir.) decided June 12, 1972. The contention presupposes that the cross-examination of Carmichael was \u201cimpermissible.\u201d We have decided to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">Because the court erred in denying the motion to suppress the facially insufficient affidavit and erred in permitting the introduction of the evidence at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>trial, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">FAIRCHILD, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
