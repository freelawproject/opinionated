The appeal is, therefore, moot and must be dismissed on that ground. While the dismissal of the defendants\u2019 appeal will allow the order of the district court to stand we note that under the law of the Virgin Islands, as set out in the Restatement of Judgments, \u00a7 69(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the order will not be conclusive against the defendants in a subsequent suit on a different cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The appeal will be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-14\">. \u201c\u00a7 69.

Under 1 V.I.C. \u00a7 4 this subsection of the Restatement states the common law rule in the Virgin Islands which is applicable to this case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
