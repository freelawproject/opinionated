(Garlock), for its fiscal year ending December 27, 1964, in the sum of $93,335.83, and that-ending December 26, 1965, in the sum of $27,061.49. These determinations were made on the basis that Garlock, S.A. (S.A.), a Panamanian corporation and originally a wholly owned subsidiary of appellant, was a \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d (CFC) within the meaning of \u00a7 957(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and against the claim that \u00a7 951 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, is unconstitutional. Section 951, which was enacted in 1962, provides that a United States shareholder of a CFC must include in income its pro rata share of the corporation\u2019s \u201csubpart F income,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 952, whether or not that income has been distributed to the shareholder. All of S.A.\u2019s income was subpart F income, and there is no question that appellant is a \u201cUnited States shareholder\u201d within .\u00a7 951(b). Thus the primary question before the court is whether S.A. was a CFC during 1964 and 1965 within \u00a7 957 (a), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">The term \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d means any foreign corporation of which <em>more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power </em>of all classes of stock entitled to vote <em>is owned </em>(within the meaning of \u00a7 958 (a) ), or is considered as owned by applying the rules of ownership of \u00a7 958 (b) , by United States shareholders on any day during the taxable year of such foreign corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">(Emphasis added.) While appellant-concedes that it owned 50 per cent of the \u201ctotal combined voting power\u201d of all classes of stock' entitled to vote, it contends that it did not own \u201cmore than 50 per cent\u201d thereof so that S.A. was not a CFC. We disagree and affirm the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Appellant in 1964 and 1965, the tax years in question, was a publicly owned and listed manufacturer of industrial components such a3 gaskets, packings and seals. In 1958 it had organized S.A. with $50,000 in paid-in capital and for the purpose of marketing appellant\u2019s products in Europe and Asia. Through December, 1962, S.A. had one class of common stock issued and outstanding, all of which was owned by appellant. On December 4, 1962, however, the president of appellant submitted a written report to his board of d.rectors proposing a recapitalization of appellant\u2019s subsidiary, S.A. That report, quoted in full in the Tax Court opinion, urged that, because the Revenue Act of 1962 contains provisions taxing earnings of CFC\u2019s after January 1, 1963, whether or not those earnings were repatriated as dividends, \u201cTo avoid this tax result it will be necessary to change the capital stock structure and voting rights in such a way that Garlock, S.A., will no longer be a \u2018controlled foreign corporation\u2019 as defined in the Revenue Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">The report went on to spell out the proposed revision of the S.A. capital structure: Garlock would retain a $100,-000 common stock investment (1,000 shares, $100 par) but S.A. would create a new issue of $100,000 callable, cumulative preferred stock (1,000 shares, $100 par), the preferred shares each to be entitled to one vote along with each common share. The report went on to propose that S.A. would \u201cplace this stock [the preferred] with foreign investors who understand our motives and are willing to vote their stock with us in return for an ample dividend rate \u2014 probably 8 per cent.\u201d It pointed out that Garlock would be \u201cprotected from loss of actual control by the following provisions in the preferred stock: a. Stock callable at any time. b. Preferred stock transferrable [sic] only with consent of Garlock, S.A.\u201d The report mentioned specifically two foreign investors who had been approached and had said that they \u201cunderstood the situation,\u201d and expressed the belief that one of them would \u201cinvest\u201d in the new preferred stock when issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">The report was approved by Garlock\u2019s board of directors at the December, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>1962, board meeting and the necessary authority delegated to management; the recapitalization was duly carried out by the directors and shareholders of S.A. under Panamanian law. The same special meeting of S.A. shareholders authorizing the recapitalization and the issuance of voting preference stock also amended the articles of incorporation to provide for the election of directors by a majority vote for terms of from one to five years, the term to depend upon the vote at the time of the respective election, and elected four directors to serve for a term of five years or until their successors were elected and qualified. These four included Garlock\u2019s president, vice president, export manager, and assistant secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">One of the two specifically mentioned investors in appellant\u2019s president\u2019s report was Willard International Financial Co., Ltd. (Willard), a Bahamian corporation, which happened to have as counsel the same law firm which was tax counsel to appellant. Willard was the parent corporation of Canadian Camdex Investments, Ltd. (Camdex), a Canadian corporation; Camdex subscribed to the S.A. preferred stock. While the call-ability provision and absolute restrictions on transferability were not included as terms of the subscription agreement, it was provided that the shares were to be transferable only with the prior written consent of the board of directors of S.A., which consent was not to be \u201cunreasonably withheld.\u201d Additional safeguards to the subscriber included: (1) a provision for arbitration in the event of any dispute between the holders of the preferred and common shares as to any corporate matter relating to the business or affairs of S.A. or the rights, obligations or ownership of the preferred stock; (2) a provision to the effect that at all times S.A. was to retain a net current asset or working capital position of at least 200 per cent of the total par value of the preferred stock, i. e., $200,000, in the absence of which any preferred shareholder could demand a purchase at par by S.A.; and (3) a provision giving each preferred shareholder the right after one year from date of issue, on 120 days\u2019 written notice, to sell the preferred stock to S.A. at par.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Camdex subscribed for the full $100,-000 of S.A. preferred with money from its parent, Willard, and retained 10 per cent of the 1,000 shares it thus received, selling 350 shares in February of 1963 to Nederlandse Overzee Bank, N.V., 350 shares to a nominee company for the Bank of Nova Scotia, and the remaining 200 shares to American African Finance Corp., a corporation organized under the law of French Somaliland. At the time of the issuance of the preferred stock the 8 per cent dividend rate it carried exceeded the interest rate prevailing in the foreign market. On October 1, 1963, the board of directors under Panamanian law duly amended S.A.\u2019s bylaws to increase the number of directors from four to five; three Garlock men were retained, but the president of Willard (who was also an officer of Camdex) was added to the board as was the managing director of a Canadian investment banking concern which was the ultimate purchaser of the 350 shares bought for the Bank of Nova Scotia. No meeting of the shareholders of S.A. was held in 1963, but at an April 1, 1964, shareholders\u2019 meeting the five directors elected at the directors\u2019 meeting on October 1, 1963, were duly elected for one year or until their successors were elected and qualified. They were similarly re-elected on April 7, 1965. The above are the essential facts, and while the Tax Court opinion covers them in more detail, they will do for our purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Appellant argues principally that \u00a7 957 (a) makes the CFC test only the simple mechanical one of ownership of more than 50 per cent of the voting stock, regardless of the ownership of the voting power. That is, appellant would read the words of the statute, \u201cmore than 50 per cent of the total combined voting power <em>of </em>all classes of stock entitled <em>to </em>vote,\u201d with utmost literality. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>argues that the Tax Court majority opinion substituted an \u201cactual control\u201d test for the numerical statutory test and thereby ignored the plain meaning of the statute, erroneously interpreted the legislative intent and erroneously applied the doctrine of substance over form.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">But, to go to the heart of the matter, the Tax Court opinion relied squarely on Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.957-1 (b) (2). This regulation provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that any arrangement to shift formal voting power away from United States shareholders \u201cwill not be given effect if in reality voting power is retained.\u201d It provides further that \u201cThe mere ownership of stock entitled to vote does not by itself mean that the shareholder owning such stock has the voting power of such stock for purposes of section 957.\u201d In the very situation of this case, where another class of stock is outstanding, the regulation states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">the voting power ostensibly provided such other class of stock . will be disregarded [1] <em>if the percentage of voting power ... is substantially greater than its proportionate share of the corporate earnings, </em>[2] <em>if the facts indicate that the shareholders of such other class of stock do not exercise their voting rights independently or fail to exercise such voting rights, and [3] if a principal purpose of the arrangement is to avoid the classification of such foreign corporation as a controlled foreign corporation under section 957.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">(Emphasis added.) Here the Tax Court properly found, on the basis of the original \u201creport\u201d to appellant\u2019s board of directors, that a principal purpose of the arrangement was to avoid the classification of S.A. as a CFC; appellant cannot and does not argue to the contrary. While it is suggested that the holders of the preferred <em>could </em>have exercised voting rights independently, in fact there is no indication that they did so, and indeed at all times a majority of the board of directors consisted of appellant\u2019s officers. Finally, the percentage of mathematical voting power of the preferred shareholders (50 per cent) was substantially greater than its proportionate share of the corporate earnings: in 1963, 1964 and 1965 S.A.\u2019s net profit was $94,-260.61, $173,382.60 and $50,171.20 respectively, but the preferred shareholders received dividends of only $8,000 per year \u2014 in other words, in the year 1965 a maximum of 16 per cent. The regulation, in short, applies exactly to the case at hand. Appellant\u2019s argument that the preferred shareholders of S.A. did exercise their voting rights independently, Brief at 44, is not seriously pressed. Rather, the appellant claims that the regulation must be held invalid as an arbitrary and unsanctioned extension of the statute, one contrary to the \u201clegislative intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">We believe, however, that the regulation, as applied to the facts in this case, is proper and within the direct aim and purpose as well as the plain meaning of the statute. The test in the statute is one of ownership of \u201cvoting power,\u201d a term which, to be sure, is open to at least two different interpretations: appellant\u2019s would relate it solely to the record ownership of the number of votes attached to all classes of stock entitled to vote; appellee\u2019s interpretation is that ownership of voting power is to be determined after full consideration of legal and equitable aspects of ownership. The statute was enacted to help effectuate \u201celimination of the tax haven device,\u201d as set forth in President Kennedy\u2019s recommendations on tax revision, see H.R.Doc. No.140, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1961). The Ways and Means Committee report on the Revenue Act of 1962 stated that \u201cYour committee has also ended tax deferral for American shareholders in certain situations where the multiplicity of foreign tax systems has been taken advantage of by American-controlled businesses to syphon off sales profits from goods manufactured by related parties either in the United States or abroad.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.1447, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>58 (1962). <em>See also </em>S.Rep.No.1881, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 2, 78-80 (1962). In floor debate on the bill Senator Kerr specifically referred to the fact that, if the bill were passed, \u201cIt will no longer be possible to flout our tax laws by simply setting up an address company, say in Panama, to sell goods in Europe which did not originate in Panama, which never in fact were in Panama, and which had nothing to do with Panama.\u201d 108 Cong.Rec. 17752 (1962). As Secretary of the Treasury Dillon had testified, the Administration\u2019s \u201cprimary objective in this field . . . [was] to preserve the integrity of the U.S. dollar and to help in the balance of payments. .\u201d Hearings Before the House Committee on Ways and Means on the President\u2019s 1961 Tax Recommendations, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 348 (1961). In the light of this legislative history, the ap-pellee\u2019s implementation of congressional intent by promulgation of regulations consistent with the statutory design seems to us plainly correct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Taxpayers generally are fond of quoting Judge Learned Hand\u2019s statement that \u201cAny one may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the Treasury; there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one\u2019s taxes.\u201d Helvering v. Gregory, 69 F.2d 809, 810 (2d Cir. 1934), aff\u2019d, 293 U.S. 465, 55 S.Ct. 266, 79 L. Ed. 596 (1935). It is sometimes forgotten, however, that it was in that very case that Judge Hand\u2019s opinion for this court held that a series of transactions which suited the verbal definition of corporate reorganization in the Revenue Act of 1928 nevertheless did not meet the statutory requirements because the transactions lacked a business purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">and the words of the Act made it evident that the aim of Congress was to approve only reorganizations having such a purpose. As Judge Hand said with reference to the tax statute there involved, \u201cthe meaning of a sentence may be more than that of the separate words, as a melody is more than the notes, and no degree of particularity can ever obviate recourse, to the setting in which all appear, and which all collectively create.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810-811. So too, here, it does not advance the cause a very great deal to say that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of Congress or the \u201cintent\u201d of Congress was violated by the regulations adopted. Certainly as the statute indicates, Congress had generally in mind the elimination of the tax avoidance device known as \u201ctax haven\u201d corporations. The language it used is subject to the interpretation \u2014 one given to it by the Treasury \u2014 that it is \u201creal\u201d voting power and not the mere mechanical number of votes with which Congress was concerned. As Professor Cox reminded us some time ago, \u201clegislative intention\u201d is really simply a metaphor, which \u201cdoes not state an all-sufficient rule; it enjoins a point of view and sets a goal to which the judge aspires even while he knows it is beyond attainment.\u201d Cox, Judge Learned Hand and the Interpretation of Statutes, 60 Harv.L.Rev. 370, 372 (1947). It is significant here that the taxpayer sought out parties who understood both its motives and its situation. It is significant also that the terms of the arrangement worked out were such that the preferred shareholders would have no interest in disturbing the taxpayer\u2019s continued control. The stock was made attractive by paying a rate in excess of market for the money advanced. The stake of the preferred shareholders was, moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>quite limited, since the moment the current asset value of S.A., or its working capital was not maintained at a level of \u2014 , at least 200 per cent of the total par value of the preferred, <em>i. e., </em>$200,000, any preferred shareholder could demand a purchase by S.A. at par; indeed, after one year the preferred shareholders had the right on 120 days\u2019 written notice to require S.A. to purchase the preferred at par, that is, to have his original investment returned in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">While the arbitration provision in respect to unresolved matters we might assume to be proper under Panamanian law \u2014 without indicating whether indeed Panamanian law was applicable<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or, if applicable, that the provision would be valid<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 there is no question but that there would be little or no reason ever to resort to such an unrealistic way of running a corporation in light of the working capital and provisions for the repurchase of the preferred stock above recounted. We say \u201cunrealistic\u201d because the picture of corporate sales, management and other decisions in the fast-moving international trade world of the mid-1960\u2019s being made through the process of arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce is very nearly risible \u2014 the product, perhaps, of an imaginative tax lawyer\u2019s drafting contemplation, surely not a working solution to real business needs. Without belaboring the point one is tempted to think of the arbitration provisions of the subscription agreement as sugar coating on the taxpayer\u2019s Treasury Department pill.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">While in a given ease the issuance of a different class of stock with equal voting rights might meet the \u201cvoting power\u201d requirement in the statute, quite obviously Congress could not generally have conceived all the ramifications of corporate laws around the world which might cleverly be utilized to make a preferred stock which was rather readily redeemable and carried only a very small percentage of the earnings as interest the equivalent in voting power of common stock held by the United States shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">We agree with the appellee that the preferred shareholders\u2019 voting power here was \u201cillusory.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree also that the regulation is valid and proper as applied to the facts presented. The argument that \u00a7 951, which requires an American shareholder to include in income his pro rata share of a CFC\u2019s profits, is unconstitutional we think borders on the frivolous in the light of this court\u2019s decision in Eder v. Commissioner, 138 F.2d 27, 28 (1943). That case held constitutional the foreign personal holding provisions of the income tax laws upon which subpart F was patterned, permitting taxation of United States shareholders on the undistributed net income of Colombian corporations even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>though Colombian law made the taxpayer unable to receive such income in the United States in excess of $1,000 per month.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also Alvord v. Commissioner, 277 F.2d 713 (4th Cir. 1960); Marsman v. Commissioner, 205 F.2d 335 (4th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">. Appellant argues that the Treasury originally proposed either a voting power or a value of stock test but that since Congress used only the former, there was a \u201cconscious decision to limit the definition of a controlled foreign corporation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 21. This does not mean, however, that the voting power test ultimately adopted was to be applied strictly mechanically, as appellant would have it. Nor does it follow that, because the statute requires that the requisite percentage of voting power be owned only on any one day in the taxable year, Congress was thereby rejecting effective voting control as the test in a case where that effective voting control was vested in the United States shareholder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">. The subscription agreement, Exhibit 8, was in the form of a letter from Camdex accepted by S.A. It does not refer to any particular law to govern the interpretation or operation of the agreement. The arbitration paragraph (2) provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that there would be one arbitrator, that he would be chosen by the president of the International Chamber of Commerce, and that tiie arbitration would be held in New York City. Canadian, Bahamian and New York law are all possible alternatives to Panamanian law; there may be others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\">. For example, under New York law, were it held to apply, a corporation\u2019s affairs cannot be run under an agreement depriving directors of their power to act for and in the best interests of the corporation.

Appellant argues that tlie \u201cconstitutional\u201d issues presented in <em>Eder </em>were in fact \u201capparently\u201d waived in that case and that, therefore, <em>Eder </em>does not control our decision here. We disagree with appellant\u2019s reading of <em>Eder, </em>and note particularly Judge Frank\u2019s explicit reference to and paraphrase of Heiner v. Mellon, 304 U.S. 271, 281, 58 S.Ct. 926, 82 L.Ed. 1337 (1938). Whatever may be the continuing validity of the doctrine of Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189, 40 S.Ct. 189, 64 L.Ed. 521 (1920), as applied to the facts in this case it has no validity under <em>Mellon.
