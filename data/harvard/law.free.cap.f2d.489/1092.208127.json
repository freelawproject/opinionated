(Enterprises), a Rhode Island corporation owned by Frederick and Louis Weingeroff, George Glick, Harry and Joslyn Oken (the \u201cProvidence Group\u201d). Automatic and Enterprises each loaned $75,000 to Charm, owned one-half of its stock, and named three Charm directors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The directors designated, as Charm\u2019s officers, Goldman President, Frederick Weingeroff and Glick vice-presidents, Brown secretary, Harry Oken treasurer, and Heisler assistant vice-president.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-15\">Charm sold novelty charms and bracelets to supermarkets, the supermarkets paid Charm on delivery, and returned items not sold for full refunds. The Providence Group manufactured, packaged, and shipped the merchandise in Rhode Island, and the Chicago Group marketed the novelties in Chicago. Charm hired a promotional organization, J &amp; H International Corporation (J &amp; H) to act as its sales agent. Charm\u2019s books and records were kept in Chicago, but all checks issued by it had to be signed by an officer in Chicago and countersigned by one in Providence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-16\">Shortly after incorporation, Charm purchased from Travelers a $400,000 fidelity bond to protect it against \u201cany fraudulent or dishonest act or acts committed by any of the Employees.\u201d The bond defined \u201cEmployee\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-17\">Any natural person (except a director or trustee of the Insured, if a corporation, who is not also an officer or employee thereof in some other capacity) while in the regular service of the Insured in the ordinary course of the Insured\u2019s business during the Policy Period and whom the Insured compensates by salary, wages or commissions and has the right to govern and direct in the performance of such service, but does not mean any broker, factor, commission merchant, consignee, contractor or other agent or representative of the same general character.</p>\n<p id=\"at2-dedup-0\">Losses \u201cdue to any fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act by an Insured or a partner therein whether acting alone or in collusion with others,\u201d were excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-18\">In February, 1967 Heisler informed the Providence Group that he suspected Goldman and Brown of improperly diverting approximately $235,000 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>Charm\u2019s funds to their own use. The Providence Group determined the moneys had been diverted and secured the resignations of Goldman and Brown as Charm officers. Subsequently, Charm was unable to make refunds to supermarkets for returned merchandise and J &amp; H assumed the Charm obligation of refunding approximately $400,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">Travelers refused to pay Charm\u2019s claimed losses under the terms of the fidelity bond. Charm filed this suit and Travelers then named Brown, Goldman, and Bernie Schulman third party defendants.3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following discovery, the trial court granted Travelers\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We reversed and remanded for a trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> following which the jury found in favor of Travelers. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">No contention is made that the evidence does not support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">During the course of its deliberations, the jury sent a written question to the judge which he answered without giving notice to counsel or the parties, and in their absence. Charm\u2019s counsel first became aware of the communication one week later. Neither the note nor the judge\u2019s answer thereto were preserved for the record but affidavits in the record of two jurors set forth the general character of the inquiry and answers: the jury asked whether Brown and Goldman \u201ccould have a criminal judgment brought against them;\u201d the judge wrote back \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">Charm contends that this ex parte communication constituted reversible error per se. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">We think that the recent decisional trend away from the older per se rule<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the federal courts<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> represents sound doctrine. Judge Learned Hand said in United States v. Compagna, 146 F.2d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 324 U.S. 867, 65 S.Ct. 912, 89 S.Ct. 1422 (1945):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-10\">[I]t is true that courts are extremely jealous of [communication between judge and jury] once the jury has been locked up; and we do not wish to abate that jealousy in the least; it is most undesirable that anything should reach a jury which does not do so in the courtroom. This is, indeed, too well settled for debate. [Citing cases.] But, like other rules for the conduct of trials, it is not an end in itself ; and, while lapses should be closely scrutinized, when it appears with certainty that no harm has been done, it would be the merest pendantry to insist upon procedural regularity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">Later in Walker v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 221, 322 F.2d 434, 435 (1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 976, 84 S.Ct. 494, 11 L.Ed.2d 421 (1964), the defendant appealed his robbery conviction contending, inter alia, that the trial judge\u2019s ex parte answer to the jury\u2019s question was reversible error. Although the court agreed that the judge erred, it held: \u201cSuch an error does not require reversal, however, when the record shows with reasonable certainty that it did not prejudice the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number><em>Walker </em>and <em>Compdgna </em>were criminal cases but that does not render them inapposite; on the contrary, the refusal to apply a per se rule when an individual\u2019s liberty is at stake is persuasive authority that a more rigorous standard is not mandated in civil eases. We hold that a trial judge\u2019s ex parte communication with the jury after it has begun its deliberations is not per se reversible error, but is controlled by F.R.Civ.P. 61:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-4\">No error in . anything done by the court ... is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">In our opinion the substance of the communication did not \u201caffect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d Furthermore, at Charm\u2019s request, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-7\">To warrant recovery under the bond, the \u201cdishonest act\u201d of an employee need not be such as would involve criminal liability of the employee for its commission. The meaning of fraud and dishonesty extends beyond acts which would be criminal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">The instruction informed the jury that dishonesty was not coextensive with criminality, but was broader, and the jury\u2019s subsequent communication with the judge was irrelevant to the ultimate issue: Travelers\u2019 liability to Charm for the dishonest acts of Charm\u2019s employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although we disapprove the communication of the judge to the jury in absence of counsel, and the failure to preserve the notes, we hold that any error in the judge\u2019s conduct was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">Just prior to the commencement of trial, and over the opposition of Charm, the court permitted third-party defendant Schulman to file a $210,000 claim against Charm and Enterprises. Schul-man alleged that pursuant to an agreement, he developed two packaging machines for Charm and Enterprises for which he was to be paid $20,000 plus 20% of the savings realized from use of the machines.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The jury found in favor of Charm and against Schulman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\">Notwithstanding its favorable verdict against Schulman, Charm contends that the trial court committed reversible error in permitting Schulman\u2019s claim to be filed because it confused the jury and prejudiced Charm\u2019s suit against Travelers. Charm argues that Sehulman\u2019s claim does not arise out of Charm\u2019s suit on the fidelity bond and thus clearly violates Rule 14(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-14\">The third-party defendant may also assert any claim against the plaintiff arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the third-party plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-15\">Furthermore, Charm argues that the claim was a sham since Schulman admitted the machines were never put into operation, and at the close of trial abandoned all but $15,000 of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>Assuming, arguendo, that the Schulman claim violated Rule 14(a) and was a sham, we are not convinced that its inclusion in the case \u201cmisled and distracted\u201d the jury. Charm has failed to show it suffered prejudice; and in view of the weight of the evidence supporting the verdict, we decline to speculate that it was prejudiced.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">We find Charm\u2019s contentions that certain evidentiary rulings and jury instructions of the trial court were erroneous and prejudicial to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">During the trial, evidence was admitted relating to alleged earnings of Enterprises, Charm, and J &amp; H, and Charm\u2019s obligation to J &amp; H for the refunds paid to supermarkets. Charm argues the evidence was irrelevant and misleading.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court also excluded as hearsay testimony of Glick and Glass concerning Heisler\u2019s statements to the Providence Group of Brown and Goldman\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\"> We see no error in these rulings. The main issue in the case was whether Goldman and Brown were employees and officers of Charm who committed dishonest acts in the course of their employment and whom Charm compensated by \u201csalary, wages or commissions\u201d and whom Charm had the right to govern and direct in their work. Travelers (and Goldman and Brown as third-party defendants) maintained that they were not employees; that Charm was part of a joint venture between the Chicago and Providence Groups; and that Goldman and Brown were either partners with the members of those Groups, or that they so controlled Charm that it was merely their alter ego, so that their acts in appropriating the moneys were acts of the \u201cInsured\u201d not covered by the policy. The evidence admitted was, therefore, relevant. Glick and Glass\u2019 testimony was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that Heisler informed the Providence Group) in order to rebut the argument that a Chicago-Providenee partnership existed, and was clearly excludable hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">The district court, over Charm\u2019s objection, tendered instructions to the jury on certain corporate formalities which Charm contends misstated the 'law applicable to \u201csmall corporations\u201d and were prejudicial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>with Charm that a closely held corporation need not comport with all the technical requirements of the Illinois Business Corporation Act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the instructions given herein were not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">Charm also argues that the court\u2019s instruction with respect to the method of salary payment was erroneous and contrary to this court\u2019s prior decision in this case. In material part, that instruction read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-12\">(3) That such fraudulent or dishonest acts, if any, were committed by employees whom Charm compensates by salary, wages or commissions, <em>during that period, the same period. . </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">In our earlier decision reversing the grant of summary judgment in favor of Travelers, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-14\">If the trier of fact should find that Charm compensated or intended in the future to compensate, Goldman and Brown for services performed in the ordinary course of business for Charm . the trier of fact could reasonably find that Goldman and Brown were employees of Charm within the policy definition, even if their compensation <em>was not periodic and regular </em>and even if any compensation paid was combined with a distribution of the profits of the company. <em>{Charm, supra, </em>at 611 of 447 F.2d; emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-15\">Thus- Charm contends that the instruction required it to prove more than this court said was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-16\">We hold that the instruction was not improper. We do not think that the instruction contradicts this court\u2019s earlier statement. \u201cPeriodic\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cduring that period,\u201d and therefore compensation, even though not periodically and regularly paid, could have been paid during the period in question. Furthermore, the language of our prior opinion should not be extended beyond that purpose for which it was intended. We there reversed a summary judgment against Charm; we did not promulgate jury instructions,</p>\n<p id=\"a_z-dedup-0\">Charm also contends that it was error to give a missing witness in-struction with respect to Heisler. We .hold that even if it was erroneous it was not prejudicial,</p>\n<p id=\"aal-dedup-0\">judgmeilt affirmed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1176-12\">.

Professor Wright maintains: \u201cWhen all of the circumstances about the communication are known, and when it can be said \u2018with certainty that no harm has been done,\u2019 it would be insisting on form to reverse.\u201d 3 Federal Practice and Procedure, 203 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1178-16\">. Admittedly the communication is susceptible to differing interpretations, but none of them relate to whether Brown and Goldman were employees who performed a dishonest act in the scope of their employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1178-17\">. Charm contended that the claim was untimely, was sham and false under F.R.C.P. 11, and violated F.R.C.P. 14(a). The district court eventually determined, that Enterprises was not a proper party and eliminated reference to it in its jury instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">. There is no basis in the record to attribute to Travelers any purposeful tactical wrongdoing with regard to the Schulman claim. Travelers\u2019 counsel referred to it only once, in a statement that is too fragile to support any inference of wrongdoing:</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">Your Honor, on behalf of defendant Travelers, we have no objection to the amended answer nor to the counterclaim, since it involves the same issues, and we think it would be better to dispose of everything at one time. [Tr. 4, June 19, 1972]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">. Charm also contends that this allegedly irrelevant evidence might have been excluded had the court conducted a pretrial conference as requested by Charm. The holding of a pretrial conference is within the court\u2019s discretion; and at the June 5, 1972 hearing on the holding of a conference, the court said: \u201cIf you want to limit it to some specific thing, or set me out something we can dispose of on the pretrial, I would be glad to.\u201d The court appeared willing to hold the conference had the subject been specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"AbRA\">.
