E. Thompson in <em>1956 </em>in settlement of his claims under his subcontract with Curtis Builders, Inc. (Curtis), which in turn had contracted to build two rocket launchers for the Department of the Navy, accrued and should have been included in the income reported jointly by him and Mrs. Thompson for the years <em>1953 </em>and <em>1954. </em>L. E. Thompson, 30 T.C.M. 1383, \u00b6 71,321 P-H Memo TC (1971). We disagree, reverse, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-20\">The facts are fully stated in the Tax Court\u2019s memorandum decision and need be only summarized here:</p>\n<p id=\"b370-21\">On June 30, 1952, Curtis entered into a contract with the Department of the Navy to construct two rocket launchers for use at the Naval Proving Ground, Dahlgren, Virginia. The work was to be completed by March 29, 1954. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the contract, Curtis was entitled to receive partial payments as the work progressed. These progress payments could cover delivered materials, work done at the Contractor\u2019s assembly plant, and preparatory work.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Under Article 25 of the prime contract, the government had the right to terminate the agreement, in whole or in part, for default.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the event of such a \u201cdefault termination,\u201d Curtis was entitled to the reasonable value of \u201cwork performed which [was] in place at the site on the effective date of termination.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the government had the right to require Curtis to deliver work in progress to another contractor and to require that steps be taken to preserve and protect other property, all at the expense of the government, there was no provision for compensation for non-delivered or preparatory work.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">The prime contract also made provi-' sion for termination at the' option of the government.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the event of such an \u201coption termination,\u201d Curtis was entitled to whatever amount it and the government contracting officer agreed upon<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or, failing agreement, to an amount determined under a complex \u201ccost plus\u201d formula.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under an \u201coption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>termination\u201d therefore, undelivered products and preparatory work were compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">On December 30, 1952, Curtis subcontracted with taxpayer L. E. Thompson, d/b/a Parkersburg Die and Tool Company, to fabricate and furnish three rocket launcher track assemblies, each 3,000 feet in length. The subcontract provided that the prime contractor was \u201cbound to the Subcontractor by all the obligations that the Owner assume [d] to the Contractor under the Agreement, General Conditions, Drawings and Specifications, and by all the provisions thereof affording remedies and redress to the Contractor from the Owner.\u201d However, with respect to payment, Curtis and taxpayer did not rely on incorporation of the payment provisions of the original contract. Instead, they agreed that taxpayer would be paid the sum of $249,509.75 for the entire job, with progress payments to be made under the following terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">90% of value of material <em>on job site </em>by 25th day of each month to be paid by the 15th day of each month <em>following delivery </em>provided that the Subcontractor submits requisition in duplicate to Contractor\u2019s office no later than 25th day of the month. Balance will be paid within thirty days after completion and acceptance by the owner. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Thus, unlike the prime contractor who was entitled to progress payments for preparatory work and undelivered items, taxpayer\u2019s right to payment under the subcontract was limited to work delivered to the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">From June, 1953 to December, 1953, Curtis made loans to the taxpayer and beginning in January, 1954 and continuing until October, 1954, it made a series of weekly advances. The characterization of these payments is not in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">The value of certain cast steel yokes shipped to the job site at Dahlgren, Virginia, by directive of the government, and invoiced by taxpayer to Curtis, were shown on taxpayer\u2019s books as reductions in the amount taxpayer owed Curtis on the loans and advances. In this appeal, it is not disputed that the amounts invoiced in 1953 and 1954 were includible in taxpayer\u2019s income for those years. Other than these certain east steel yokes, taxpayer made no other deliveries to the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">By letter dated November 30, 1954, Curtis (but <em>not </em>taxpayer) was advised that its contract with the government was terminated \u201ceffective immediately due to your default in performance.\u201d While the Curtis contract was thus terminated, the government instructed taxpayer to continue to perform his subcontract, although it does not appear that the government elected to have Curtis formally assign its rights under the subcontract to the government as was the government\u2019s right.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Taxpayer protested this directive but was not permitted to discontinue his performance until approximately 70 days after November 30, 1954. It does not appear that Curtis ever took any formal or explicit action to terminate taxpayer\u2019s subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">During the next two years, negotiations were carried on by and between Curtis, taxpayer, and the government. The government finally agreed to rescind the termination of Curtis\u2019 contract for \u201cdefault in performance\u201d and \u201cter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>mination at the option of the government\u201d was substituted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the latter, Curtis was entitled to substantial payment and on November 30, 1956, payment by the government was made to Curtis. Of the total payment, $256,135.-85 was paid to Curtis on account of taxpayer\u2019s work. From this sum Curtis deducted $117,000.00 due it for loans and advances to taxpayer and paid $65,744.-94 to the Small Business Administration for the principal and interest on a loan made to the taxpayer. Curtis then paid the taxpayer the remainder of $73,390.-91. Taxpayer and his wife reported as income in their joint income tax return for 1956, the $256,135.85 paid in settlement in that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Prior to February, 1954, taxpayer and Curtis\u2019 president discussed what action they would take in the event the government terminated the contract. They agreed that if the contract was terminated, Curtis\u2019 president would request its bonding company to pay taxpayer in full and then either the bonding company or Curtis would employ taxpayer to redesign and construct the rocket launchers. There is no evidence, however, that the bonding company acceded to this agreement, or that the agreement was subsequently carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The Commissioner\u2019s determination that taxpayer followed an accrual method of accounting is unchallenged in this appeal. For accrual method taxpayers, the tax year in which income is includible is determined under Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.451-1 (a), 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.451-1(a), which sets forth the principles of tax accounting applicable here. That Regulation provides in pertinent part that</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">[u]nder an accrual method of accounting, income is includible in gross income when all the events have occurred which fix the right to receive such income and the amount thereof can be determined with reasonable accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Thus, accrual of income for tax purposes depends on satisfaction of both the \u201call events\u201d test and the \u201creasonable accuracy\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Under the facts of this case, we do not think that any part of the payment made to the taxpayer in 1956 accrued in 1953 or 1954. Under the payment terms of the subcontract, taxpayer was entitled to compensation only for work delivered to the job site. Under the subcontract payment provision, taxpayer had no <em>right </em>to payment for preparatory work such as the tooling of machines \u2014 a major part of his effort in 1953 \u2014 nor did he have a <em>right </em>to payment for partially completed but undelivered work in his Parkersburg, West Virginia, plant. Taxpayer did not accrue a <em>right </em>to payment until 1956 when, after two years of strenuous personal effort by the taxpayer and fifty-four meetings, the government was finally persuaded to substitute an \u201coption termination\u201d for the \u201cdefault termination.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>We are unpersuaded by the government\u2019s argument that Curtis\u2019 statement of its willingness to persuade its bonding company to pay taxpayer if the government terminated the contract requires a different result. There is no evidence that the bonding company received the request, or that if received, it agreed to honor it. It, therefore, cannot be said that taxpayer gained a <em>right </em>to receive payment from the bonding company at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Furthermore, we find unconvincing the government\u2019s argument that delivery was not a condition precedent to payment because taxpayer was in fact paid without delivery. Taxpayer received payment in 1956 by virtue of the government\u2019s substitution of a \u201ctermination at the option of the government\u201d for \u201ctermination for default.\u201d Prior to that time, taxpayer had no right to payment, except for the yokes which were delivered \u2014 and for which payment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Finally, we do not accept the alternative position argued by the government that even if delivery was a precondition to payment, it was a mere ministerial act akin to the presentation of a bill and thus no obstacle to the accrual of a right to payment. Under the facts of this contract, it is doubtful that delivery of three rocket launcher track assemblies, each 3,000 feet in length, from Parkers-burg, West Virginia, to Dahlgren, Virginia, could be construed as an insignificant part of the consideration bargained for and a mere ministerial duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">We have not been asked to review certain other aspects of the tax liability of taxpayers for 1953 and 1954 which were decided by the Tax Court. Some recom-putation of that overall liability is in order. We reverse the Tax Court insofar as it included the sums of $67,774.13 and $181,735.63 in taxpayers\u2019 taxable income for 1953 and 1954, respectively, and remand the ease for recomputation of overall liability for those years. Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\">.

If, as we hold, taxpayer did not accrue income in 1953 or 1954 under the payment provisions of the subcontract, we perceive no other theory under which it might be said that income accrued in those years:</p>\n<p id=\"aqj-dedup-0\">Termination of the subcontract occurred, either in November, 1954, when the government notified Curtis of the complete termination of the prime contract, or in February, 1955, when the government stated that taxpayer could discontinue performance. If on termination of the Curtis contract an as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>signment of taxpayer\u2019s subcontract to the government occurred by operation of law, the obstacles which required two years and fifty-four meetings to surmount were in themselves sufficient to prevent the taxpayer\u2019s accrual of a right against the government to the settlement eventually made. If no assignment occurred, then taxpayer\u2019s only rights were against Ourtis. In that case, it is possible that the subcontract\u2019s borrowing provision operated to put taxpayer in Curtis\u2019 shoes and Curtis in the government\u2019s such that taxpayer could request that <em>Curtis </em>grant an \u201coption termination\u201d of the <em>subcontract </em>because taxpayer was not in default, even though the prime contract was in \u201cdefault termination.\u201d However, it is uncertain (a) whether the borrowing provision would have this effect, (b) whether the Curtis contract grants a court-enforceable right to substitution of \u201coption termination\u201d for \u201cdefault termination\u201d, (c) whether taxpayer\u2019s costs under \u201coption termination\u201d could be calculated with reasonable accuracy, (d) whether Curtis had the capacity to pay, and (e) whether Curtis would have paid without litigation. The cumulative effect of these uncertainties is that we could not say that all the events necessary to fix the right to an amount calculable with reasonable accuracy had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">If the subcontract\u2019s borrowing provision \u201cpassed through\u201d to the taxpayer the benefit of any obligation which the government owed to Curtis, then the taxpayer\u2019s derivative right could have accrued no earlier than 1956 when \u201coption termination\u201d was substituted for \u201cdefault termination\u201d in the Curtis contract. Significantly, this is the construction of the subcontract\u2019s borrowing provision which the parties adopted by their conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">Of course, it is possible that the borrowing clause did not incorporate the Curtis contract\u2019s termination provisions into the subcontract. In that case, taxpayer might have had an action for breach of contract in which he could have sought reliance damages, although these would have been of uncertain magnitude. For tax purposes, taxpayer would not have accrued a right to a reasonably precise amount. See 2 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 1265 (1967) (\u201cAnticipated damages are not ac-cruable in the year of breach or in the year of commencement of litigation, except in the comparatively unusual case where the taxpayer\u2019s rights are reasonably certain, the amount is ascertainable and, ordinarily, has been accrued on the taxpayer\u2019s books.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
