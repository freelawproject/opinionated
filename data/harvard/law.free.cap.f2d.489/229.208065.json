The criminal case was assigned to the respondent judge. On December 20, 1971, the defendant Siegel made a pre-trial motion for discovery which asked that the Government be ordered to produce \u201cstatements made by any co-defendant hereto, together with whom defendant Siegel is intended to be tried <em>JJ '</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-29\">On March 24, 1972, Judge McMillen ordered that the Government produce \u201c [statements of all defendants which mention Robert Siegel in connection with this case . . . .\u201d Subsequently, the Government refused to comply with respondent\u2019s order. Trial was ordered to proceed as scheduled, but the Court indicated that it would exercise its discretionary power under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>16(g) Fed.R.Crim.P. to prohibit the Government from introducing into evidence the statements which were not produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The Government filed a petition for issuance of a writ of mandamus on August 4, 1972. The petition asks this Court to order Judge McMillen to vacate his order of March 24, 1972. We grant the writ of mandamus and direct the respondent to modify his order to deny the defendants access to statements made by Robert Buss to the Government until such time as Buss has testified on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Section 3500 of Title 18 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report in the possession of the United States which was made by a Government witness or prospective Government witness (other than the defendant) to an agent of the Government shall be the subject of subpoena, discovery, or inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500 (Cum.Supp.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The prohibition of \u00a7 3500 is engrafted on Rule 16(b) of the Fed.R.Crim.P. The Government relies on these prohibitions in refusing to comply with respondent\u2019s order and in seeking a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">We agree that Rule 16(b) and \u00a7 3500 prohibit a district judge from ordering production of statements of Government witnesses, whether or not they are co-defendants, before they have testified. Robert Buss is the only co-defendant named by the Government as a prospective witness for the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">We realize that the writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy reserved for extraordinary circumstances. Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 107, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967). On the record before us two grounds appear which bear the weight of justification for this writ. First, the writ is necessary to confine the district court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction. Jurisdiction in this context is not limited by a \u201ctechnical definition\u201d but rather encompasses judicial usurpation of power. Will v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 95, 88 S.Ct. 269. Secondly, on the record it appears that the respondent intends to force this cause to trial and then to invoke his power under Rule 16(g) Fed.R.Crim.P. to prevent the testimony of Buss from being presented. The Government has admitted that without Buss\u2019 testimony it cannot establish its ease. Without mandamus, the Government would be remediless.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Mandamus will prevent the respondent from \u201cusurping power\u201d by ignoring the prohibition of the Jencks Act. The legislative history of the Act leaves no doubt that a statement of a Government witness cannot be discovered until after he testifies. The Senate Report on the Jencks Act contains the following declaration :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">[I]t is the specific intent of the bill to provide for the production of statements, reports, transcriptions or recordings, as described in the bill, after the Government witness has testified against the defendant on direct examination in open court, and to prevent disclosure before such witness has testified. S.Rep.No.981, 85th Cong. 1st Sess. (1957), U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News 1957, p. 1863.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">The Conference Report provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-14\">The changes agreed upon by the conferees ... (3) make it abundantly clear that no such statement need be produced until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial. Conf.Rep.No.1271, 85th Cong. 1st Sess. (1957), U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News 1957, p. 1870.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">Since initial passage, the Act has been amended only to expand the coverage of the prohibition. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500 (Cum.Supp.1972); cf. H.Rep.No.91-1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970). Moreover, \u00a7 3500 has repeatedly withstood Constitutional challenge. <em>E. g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The Act limits the prohibition to Government witnesses or prospective Government witnesses. The prosecution has stated that co-defendant Buss is its only witness or prospective witness that will be called against the two remaining co-defendants Robert Siegel and Arthur Veals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with respondent that defendants are entitled to the statements of any other co-defendants. 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6l6.03[2], at 16-24 (2d ed. 1953); and Rezneck The New Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 54 Geo.L.J. 1276, 1286 (1966). Accordingly the writ shall issue to deny defendants\u2019 access to Robert Buss\u2019 statements until he testifies at the trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-15\">.
