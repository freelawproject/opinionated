While these motions were pending, the Commissioner issued the license to Freitag.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court declined to hold that the case was mooted and granted Freitag\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court concluded (1) the ordinance was invalid on its face, and (2) plaintiff had been denied due process. The defendants appeal, raising four issues: (1) the judicial remedy of mandamus was readily available against an improper denial of a license; (2) whether Freitag, in fact, had been denied due process by the defendants; (3) whether the case has been mooted; and (4) if the constitutionality issue is not moot, whether a licensing ordinance, to be valid, need expressly provide for notice and hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-7\">On January 4, 1971, Freitag, wishing to drive a taxicab within the City of Chicago, applied to defendant Carter, the Commissioner of the Public Vehicle License Commission, for a public chauffeur\u2019s license which Chicago cab drivers are required to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-8\">While investigating the application, Carter learned that Freitag had previously been a patient in a state mental hospital.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 28.1-3 of Chapter 28.1 of the Municipal Code lists lack of \u201cinfirmity ... of mind\u201d as a prerequisite for the issuance of a public chauffeur\u2019s license. In a letter to Frei-tag dated January 19, 1971, Carter denied the application. However, the letter also stated, \u201cIf you wish to have this denial reviewed, please call at this office . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-9\">Freitag immediately asked for such a review and, on January 21, 1971, the Commissioner, after obtaining Freitag\u2019s permission, wrote the state mental hospital requesting information regarding plaintiff\u2019s condition at the time of his discharge from the institution and information pertinent to Freitag\u2019s ability to drive a cab. In response, the Administrative Physician at the hospital gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>a brief history of Freitag\u2019s connections with the hospital,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, described his mental condition at the time of his hospitalization, and stated that the hospital had had no contact with Freitag since October 1957. The record does not reveal that defendant Carter showed plaintiff the Administrative Physician\u2019s letter or the hospital records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">Upon receipt of the letter, Carter\u2019s office forwarded it to the Medical Section of the Chicago Police Department, which, on February 5, 1971, indicated that Freitag might be a \u201cbad risk.\u201d This evaluation apparently was based solely on the fourteen-year-old information, for no expert assessed Freitag's mental condition as of 1971. If so, it would appear to reflect an archaic attitude in the field of mental health. Indeed, the defendants never gave plaintiff any mental tests nor were there facts before the Commissioner to indicate any present questionable mental status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">Receiving no word from Carter on the reconsideration, Freitag in late February 1971 telephoned the Public Vehicle License Commission. Freitag claims that he was told his application had been denied by the Commission\u2019s psychiatrist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He asked for an appointment to see Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\">On February 22, 1971, the two met in Carter\u2019s office. According to Freitag, Carter stated that the Commission doctor had -told him to deny the license. Carter supposedly then refused to explain why the doctor had so advised. According to the affidavit Carter made for the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, Carter never announced a final denial of plaintiff\u2019s application. The Commissioner maintains that he had merely indicated to Freitag that further investigation would be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-10\">After this conference, Freitag sought legal aid. His lawyer wrote Carter several letters and interviewed him in an effort to secure Freitag a license. On August 17, 1971, Freitag filed the present lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-12\">Defendants contend that because of the \u201cready availability of the traditional mandamus procedure, which in Illinois has long been regularly employed to compel the issuance of licenses improperly withheld,\u201d Freitag has \u201cno justifiable claim of denial of due process to assert in a federal court.\u201d However, the defendants deny that they are thereby arguing that an applicant must resort to the state mandamus remedy before proceeding in the federal courts to assert or preserve a claim of denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-13\">The heart of Freitag\u2019s complaint is the demand for a formal notice of reasons for the denial and a hearing at which he may cross-examine witnesses and present evidence on his behalf. The complaint does not request the immediate issuance of a chauffeur\u2019s license, although it does include a prayer for $25,000 damages. We fail to understand why the existence of a state mandamus procedure forecloses Freitag from seeking relief in the federal courts. Perhaps the defendants are really arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>that the license ordinance should be read in conjunction with the state mandamus provisions in order to \u201csave\u201d the ordinance. Even if that is the proper way to construe the ordinance, that argument does not go to the availability of the federal forum. The mandamus contention, to the extent that the existence of this remedy is supposed to mean that the ordinance considered in the mandamus-availability context therefore provided due process, would not be sufficient to override an actual denial of due process if such is the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">The defendants contend that the district court improperly granted summary judgment on the issue of whether Frei-tag was in fact denied due process. They argue that plaintiff clearly was accorded due process or, alternatively, that \u201cthere were, at least, disputed material issues of fact . . . . \u201d We disagree. In our opinion there was \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact and . the moving party [was] entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">First, contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertion, Commissioner C\u00e1rter did issue a \u201cfinal\u201d denial of Freitag\u2019s application for a public chauffeur\u2019s license. His letter of January 19th stated, \u201cThis is to advise you that your application . has been denied.\u201d Later, after Freitag\u2019s legal representative demanded that Freitag be issued a license, Carter wrote the City\u2019s Corporation Counsel seeking advice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-8\">\u201cWhen [Freitag\u2019s] fingerprints were returned from the FBI in Washington, it showed that he had been a patient at the Manteno State Hospital. [H]e agreed to sign a release letter to the hospital .... [W]e then presented [the hospital\u2019s] information to the Medical Section of the Chicago Police Department for their opinion which was that Mr. Freitag would be a \u2018bad risk.\u2019 <em>We then notified Mr. Freitag that his application for a public chauffeur\u2019s license was denied.\u2019\u2019 </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-11\">The letter then describes Carter\u2019s meeting on May 7, 1971, with Freitag\u2019s legal representative: \u201cNo decision was reached other than the license was denied. . . . \u201d The representative\u2019s recollection of the meeting corroborates this statement: \u201cWhen I asked Mr. Carter the date he denied Mr. Freitag\u2019s license, he said that it was not noted in Freitag\u2019s file but the date of denial was within a week after receiving the letter of January 29 from Manteno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-15\">The only documents in the record that suggest Carter never made a final denial are Carter\u2019s affidavits attached to the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion and answer. In his second affidavit, Carter claimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-16\">\u201cAlthough both Mr. Freitag and an employee of [his] legal counsel . . . misunderstood my actions and language and interpreted my failure to immediately issue a license to Freitag as a final denial of the issuance of the same, that was never my intention. <em>Whether or not I actually stated that the failure to immediately issue a license to Freitag was preliminary, final, or otherwise, I intended that it be merely preliminary and assumed Freitag and [his legal </em>representative] <em>had understood it as such. </em>... I did not tell [Fr\u00e9i-tag] that a final denial had been decided upon regarding his license nor did I authorize anyone else to make such a representation to him. . \u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-19\">The firm characterization of lack of final denial is undermined by the unequivocal nature of the characterization of the action when it was actually taken. Under these circumstances, Carter\u2019s speculations and eonclusionary statements concerning his intentions and words enunciated six months after the fact raise no genuine material issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-20\">Second, the summary judgment documents reveal that the defendants failed to accord Freitag due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>when denying him a public chauffeur\u2019s license. A governmental licensing body which judges the fitness of an applicant must afford that applicant adequate notice and a hearing. See, <em>e. g., </em>Willner v. Committee on Character and Fitness, 373 U.S. 96, 83 S.Ct. 1175, 10 L.Ed.2d 224 (1963); Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Ed.2d 796 (1957); Goldsmith v. United States Board of Tax Appeals, 270 U.S. 117, 46 S.Ct. 215, 70 L.Ed. 494 (1926). In <em>Goldsmith, </em>the Court held that the Board, although vested with the discretion to deny Goldsmith admission, could exercise that discretion only \u201cafter fair investigation, with such a notice, hearing and opportunity to answer for the applicant as would constitute due process.\u201d 270 U.S. at 123, 46 S.Ct. at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">Here Carter\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d consisted of unearthing fourteen-year-old psychiatric records, <em>see Schware, </em>353 U.S. at 243, 246, 77 S.Ct. 752, and checking whether Freitag had been convicted of a disqualifying offense. At no time did Carter inquire into the plaintiff\u2019s present mental condition or show him the \u201cevidence\u201d against him. Only after he had denied Freitag\u2019s application and Freitag had requested an explanation did the Commissioner mention the conclusion of the City doctor that plaintiff might be a \u201cbad risk.\u201d Carter refused to elaborate on that answer. There is no indication that Carter told plaintiff the name of the police department doctor or gave him an opportunity to question him. <em>See Willner, </em>373 U.S. at 105, 83 S.Ct. at 1181:</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\">\u201cThere seems no question but that petitioner was apprised of the matters the Committee was considering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">\u2018But a \u201cfull hearing\u201d \u2014 a fair and open hearing \u2014 requires more than that. . . . Those who are brought into contest with . Government in a quasi-judicial proceeding aimed at the control of their activities are entitled to be fairly advised of what the Government proposes and to be heard upon its proposals before it issues its final command.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-9\">Morgan v. United States, 304 U.S. 1, 18-19, [58 S.Ct. 773, 82 L.Ed. 1129]</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-10\">Petitioner had no opportunity to ascertain and contest the bases of the Committee\u2019s reports to the Appellate Division, and the Appellate Division gave him no separate hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-12\">Although the defendants apparently had originally urged mootness on the ground that Freitag in fact received a chauffeur\u2019s license in October 1971, on this appeal their only mootness claim is that recent amendments to the Chicago Municipal Code have rendered the declaratory judgment (and injunctional) portion of the district court\u2019s order holding the ordinance unconstitutional \u201cnot only erroneous, but also moot.\u201d The amendments to which the defendants advert concern Chapter 101 of the Municipal Code, \u201cGeneral Licensing Provisions.\u201d Adopted by the City Council on August 30, 1972, the amendments provide, as the defendants assert, \u201ca definite time-scheduled procedure of administrative notice and hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-13\">The determinative issue, therefore, is whether the amended sections of Chapter 101 apply to applications for public chauffeur licenses, the specific subject of Chapter 28.1 of the Municipal Code. The matter admits of no easy resolution, for Chapter 101 is not a model of adept drafting and the ordinances contain no cross-referencing provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-14\">The \u201cdue process amendments\u201d are part of section 101-5 the pertinent passages of which refer to the Mayor, not to the Commissioner of the Public Vehicle License Commission: \u201cIf the <em>mayor disapproves the license application </em>the unsuccessful applicant shall be notified in writing, of the reasons for the disapproval,\u201d etc. \u201cThe <em>mayor </em>shall within 15 days after such hearing has been concluded . . . .\u201d Section 28.1-4 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>Chapter 28.1 states in part: \u201cIf the <em>commissioner </em>shall be satisfied that the applicant is of good character and reputation and is a suitable person <em>he shall issue the license.\u201d </em>[Emphases added.] Further, section 101-5 of Chapter 101, which also discusses investigations of license applications, provides for the city collector to play a role in the investigations but the city collector is nowhere mentioned in the investigation portions of Chapter 28.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">These seeming inconsistencies lead Freitag to conclude that \u201cit is doubtful that the General Licensing Ordinance controls the Public Chauffeurs\u2019 Licensing Ordinance . . ., which has not been amended.\u201d However, this conclusion ignores other sections of the General Licensing chapter that strongly suggests that the chapter is meant to apply to all licensing situations except where \u201cotherwise specifically provided.\u201d Because Chapter 101 does not itself note these \u201cotherwise\u201d exceptions, we must assume that we are to find the exceptions from a reading of the rest of the Municipal Code. In short, the duty to reconcile apparently conflicting chapters and to interconnect the various requirements set out in several chapters falls on the readers of the Code, the drafters of the Code having neglected such niceties. <em>Cf. </em>section 1-19: \u201cAll general provisions, terms, phrases, and expressions contained in this code shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the city council may be fully carried out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">Our reading of Chapter 101 as a whole, with particular reference to sections 101-1 through 101-4, the sections preceding the \u201cdue process\u201d provisions, convinces us that the city council did not intend to limit the chapter to only those licenses which the Mayor is authorized to grant. Under this interpretation, the administrative procedures set out in Chapter 101, section 101-5, apply to the denial of a public chauffeur\u2019s license. We realize that this entails the substitution of the words \u201cCommissioner of the relevant Commission\u201d and \u201chead of the pertinent department\u201d for the word \u201cmayor\u201d in some of Chapter 101\u2019s provisions, but this interpretation seems more consonant with the tenor of the General Licensing chapter than does Freitag\u2019s approach. N\u00f3 completely satisfactory resolution of the problem is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-9\">Turning to the judgment of the district court in the light of the foregoing discussion, we note that the order of February 14, 1972, which was incorporated by reference in the final judgment of June 5, 1972, held that Chapter 28.1 et seq. is unconstitutional because \u201cit does not provide for adequate notice and hearing procedures in the event of disapproval of an application for a chauffeur\u2019s license.\u201d The order then stated, \u201cAny applicant denied a chauffeur\u2019s license shall be given adequate notice of the reasons therefor and a hearing which complies with the standards of procedural due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-10\">The two-pronged attack of the defendants is that this portion of the holding is erroneous because it is not necessary that the ordinance expressly provide for notice and hearing and that, in any event, since another ordinance now provides for notice and hearing for chauffeur license applicants, the question is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-11\">As we have indicated, the amended General Licensing Ordinance, which was not before the district court, can be so read as to provide for notice and hearing. We, therefore, do not deem it necessary to decide the facial constitutionality question, although we note the language of Judge Kiley in a recent decision of this court, Brooks v. Center Township, 485 F.2d 383, 385 (7th Cir. 1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-12\">\u201cWe hold that the statute is constitutionally infirm facially for want of due process in failing to provide, inter alia, a pre-termination hearing, an effective opportunity for Brooks to defend, and want of due notice of rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>sons for termination. Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 264-268, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">Irrespective of the decision that might be reached on the facial uneonstitu-tionality question here, the fact is that the district court correctly determined that Freitag was denied procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">Although we have referred in this opinion to the \u201cdefendants,\u201d under the authority of City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973), and Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), only Commissioner Carter is properly a party defendant. Neither party to the appeal questioned the jurisdiction of the district court but in the light of the last cited authorities the district court did not have jurisdiction over the municipality in this \u00a7 1983 action. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment as to the City of Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">Insofar as the judgment of the district court orders \u201cany applicant,\u201d presumably referring to the members of the class in the action below, to be provided procedural due process, since the amendments to the General Licensing Ordinance were not effective at the time the final judgment order was entered, we affirm as to the Commissioner that portion of the judgment inasmuch as it merely makes it clear that any other applicant for such a license is entitled to due process irrespective of whether the chauffeur\u2019s ordinance spells out the steps thereof. The defendants, conceding that the General Licensing Ordinance does spell out those steps and that they are applicable to the present type of situation, would seem to have little ground for complaint in the affirmance of the judgment below as to the Commissioner, which we now order. Finally, by virtue of the affirmance herein ordered, Freitag is entitled to recovery from the Commissioner of the stipulated damages in the amount of $1500. The cause is remanded for the entry of the damage judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1460-14\">. Chapter 28.1, \u201cPublic Chauffeurs,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-15\">\u201c28.1-3. Applications for public chauffeur licenses shall be made in writing to the commissioner upon forms provided by him therefor. They shall . . . disclose any information as to [the applicant\u2019s] character, reputation, physical qualifications, past employment and conduct which the commissioner deems relevant to the question of qualification of the applicant ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-17\">\u201cEvery applicant shall . . . not be subject to infirmity of body or mind . . . which may render him unfit to drive a public passenger vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-29\">\u201c28.1-4. The character and reputation of each applicant shall be investigated under the supervision of the captain of the police district in which the applicant resides, and a report of such investigation . . shall be forwarded by the captain to the commissioner of police, who shall forward the same to the commissioner together with his recommendation. If the commissioner shall be satisfied that the applicant is of good' character and reputation and is a suitable person to be entrusted with driving a public passenger vehicle he shall issue the license. Pending such investigation the commissioner may issue a temporary permit ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-31\">\u201c28.1-6. The fingerprints of each applicant shall be submitted to the commissioner of police for examination into the criminal record, if any, of the applicant.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1461-10\">. Before the lawsuit was filed, the Commissioner had written Freitag advising that his application had been reconsidered but was being held up until another set of fingerprints could be taken. The defendants complain of the fact that Freitag, instead of submitting a second set of fingerprints, proceeded with the filing of his lawsuit. The letter, however, does not clearly state that the application would be granted on the second submission of fingerprints, there merely being reference to the application\u2019s being reconsidered. Further, the purpose indicated by the defendants for the second set of fingerprints was to ascertain whether Freitag might have been convicted of disqualifying offenses in the period of time elapsing after the first submission. This would seem to be a questionable basis for the request, as presumably the initial set of fingerprints could have been processed through criminal records for the ascertainment of any subsequent arrests or convictions. In any event, any damages from an earlier denial had already been inflicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1461-11\">. On this appeal, defendants do not argue that mootness resulted from the subsequent granting of the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-13\">The order was silent as to plaintiff\u2019s demand for damages. In June 1972, however, pursuant to Rule 68, Fed.R.Civ.P., the defendants made an offer of judgment for $1500. Freitag accepted. Payment of the $1500 was conditioned upon Freitag\u2019s prevailing on this appeal. By their offer, the defendants did not admit that they are liable or that the ordinance is unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1461-14\">. The application form contained the following: \u201cHave you ever been under treatment at a hospital or asylum for a mental condition? No \u25a1 Yes \u25a1 If so, where and when?\u201d While the record is not entirely clear, it would appear that the particular questions were physically separated from other questions on the form. The mental institution questions were not answered, although in fact Freitag had been a patient at such an institution. No explanation for the failure appears in the record. There is also nothing in the record to indicate whether the Commissioner\u2019s treatment of the application may have been in part an adverse reaction to the omission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1462-8\">. Freitag\u2019s statement in this respect is the only reference we are able to find in the record to indicate that the doctor in the Medical Section of the Chicago Police Department possessed any qualifications in psychiatry. The affidavit of the Commission employee who talked to Freitag merely states, \u201cI told Freitag that his application and certain materials in his file had been reviewed by a doctor on the staff of the Chicago Police Department and that doctor had cautioned our office against an immediate issuance of the license sought since it appeared that Freitag may be a bad risk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
