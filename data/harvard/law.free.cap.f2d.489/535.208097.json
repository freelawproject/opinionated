KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b618-25\">The securities laws provide a myriad of safeguards designed to protect the interests of the investing public. Effective implementation of these safeguards, however, depends in large measure on the members of the bar who serve in an advisory capacity to those engaged in securities transactions. The standard of diligence demanded of the legal profession to meet this responsibility is a matter on which we are required to comment in the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-26\">On April 2, 1971, the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] filed a complaint charging twelve defendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including the appellee, Stuart Schiffman, with participation in a partially successful scheme to distribute over one million unregistered shares of the common stock of Spectrum, Ltd. in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of- 1933 [the 1933 Act] (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e) and the antifraud provisions of that Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a)) and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [the 1934 Act] (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b)). Although the Commission has obtained permanent injunctions against at least ten of the defendants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it was unsuccessful in its effort to gain preliminary injunctive relief against Schiffman, an attorney who allegedly prepared an opinion letter on the basis of which some of the unregistered securities were sold. Judge Tenney, after reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>affidavits, cross-affidavits, exhibits, and depositions filed by the SEC and by Schiffman, denied the SEC\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing, on the grounds that there were no material facts in dispute, and concluded that Schiffman\u2019s conduct, although perhaps negligent,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not rise to a violation of the securities laws. Upon a careful examination of the record, we find the existence of a highly material factual conflict. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to Judge Tenney for an evidentiary hearing in which the disputed issues can be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">A detailed account of the intricacies of the multi-party stock manipulation venture which prompted this action, the principal features of which were unchallenged below,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>is set forth in the extensive supporting affidavit filed by the SEC. For purposes of this appeal, however, we limit our recitation to background information necessary for an understanding of Schiffman\u2019s alleged role in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In September, 1969, Louis Marder, representing the Westward Investment Corporation, and Bernard Goldenberg and Joseph Dye, representing Spectrum, Ltd., agreed to a merger of Westward into Spectrum. The purpose of this merger was to provide a vehicle for the distribution of unregistered Spectrum securities which could later be sold to an unwitting public.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">Section 5(c) of the 1933 Act states that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly ... to sell . . . any security unless a registration statement has been filed as to such security.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e. To avoid this registration requirement, a plan was devised, principally by Marder and Goldenberg, which relied on a two-step procedure for securing exemption from Section 5. First, a large block of unregistered Spectrum common stock would be issued to the shareholders of Westward in the merger of Westward into Spectrum. This stock would be exempt from the registration mandate of Section 5 pursuant to Commission Rule 133,\u00ae which provided that the exchange of shares between a surviving corporation and the shareholders of a disappearing corporation in the course of a merger would not be considered a \u201csale\u201d within the purview of Section 5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, under Section 4(1) of the 1933 Act, the recipients of this unregistered Spectrum stock would be able to dispose of these securities, again without the filing of a registration statement as a predicate to the transaction, as long as the seller was not deemed to be \u201can issuer, underwriter or dealer\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">For Marder, who controlled Westward, successful implementation of this plan presented one obvious stumbling block \u2022 \u2014 Rule 133 classified a controlling shareholder of the \u201cconstituent corporation\u201d (Westward) as an \u201cunderwriter\u201d and, therefore, a person not qualified for exemption under Section 4(1). Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>cordingly, prior to the merger Marder commenced distributing some of his Westward shares to various friends, many of whom, as the court below found, were in fact unaware of their status as Westward shareholders. Following the merger, Marder intended to effect the sale of the Spectrum stock received by his acquaintances in transactions which, because of the stock\u2019s nominal ownership by non-controlling former Westward shareholders, would appear to satisfy the criteria for a Section 4(1) exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The stage was set for the successful charade upon consummation of the Spectrum-Westward merger on November 10, 1969. Of the 4,596,465 shares of Spectrum stock issued in the exchange, approximately one million shares went to Marder\u2019s corps of nominees. By obtaining the necessary stock powers from these individuals, Marder was in a position to begin the illicit sale of unregistered Spectrum securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">On the day of the merger, November 10, Spectrum\u2019s general counsel, Morton Berger, wrote an opinion letter to Spectrum\u2019s transfer agent in which he instructed the agent on the proper classification of the Spectrum shares then being issued. Berger\u2019s letter, based upon representations by Goldenberg and Marder, included his opinion that the merger complied with' the requirements of Rule 133 and that certain recipients of the newly-issued Spectrum stock should receive shares labelled \u201crestricted\u201d- \u2014 i. e. not for public sale \u2014 because these former Westward shareholders, whom Berger listed, were considered to be \u201cunderwriters\u201d pursuant to Rule 133(c). Berger concluded his letter by opining that the remaining former Westward shareholders, whose names Berger did not recite, could be issued Spectrum securities without a restrictive legend.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">On November 25, 1969, Berger wrote a second letter, this time to the president of Spectrum, in which he listed those persons who had received unrestricted shares of Spectrum stock pursuant to the merger. This letter, however, was not in the form of an opinion letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Retracing our steps, on November 13 and November 28, 1969, Marder delivered for sale a total of 125,000 shares of unrestricted Spectrum stock, nominally owned by William and John Doyen, to Michael Gardner, a principal at the registered broker-dealer firm of Gardner Securities. Gardner balked at the sale of these unregistered securities, despite their unrestricted nature, insisting upon an opinion letter which stated that these shares were considered exempt from the registration requirements of Section 5. Although Marder possessed the Berger letters of November 10 and November 25, Gardner viewed them as insufficient, apparently because the November 10 letter failed to specify the individuals entitled to exemption, while the November 25 letter did not purport to be an opinion letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Although Gardner called Berger about preparing the requisite opinion letter, Berger refused to issue such a letter on behalf of any shareholder. Because of this refusal, Gardner communicated with Schiffman stating that he wished to discuss a securities matter the details of which Gardner failed to provide on the telephone. Schiffman responded by meeting Gardner at his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">It is at this juncture \u2014 Schiffman\u2019s debut so to speak \u2014 that the crucial factual controversy arises. According to Schiff-man\u2019s affidavit submitted in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction, he visited Gardner\u2019s office twice in late November. On the first occasion, he and Gardner spoke in general terms about Gardner\u2019s securities business and Gardner introduced him to James Morse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>one of Gardner\u2019s clients. At the second meeting, several days later, Morse was again present at Gardner\u2019s office. On this occasion, Morse mentioned that a friend of his, a Mr. Doyen, was in need of some help and asked Schiffman if he would speak to Doyen. After Schiffman agreed, Morse telephoned Doyen. Morse handed the instrument to Schiffman and Doyen proceeded to explain to Schiffman that he owned some unregistered stock in Spectrum, Ltd. for which he wanted an opinion letter that would indicate that the securities could be sold without registration. Schiffman allegedly responded that since he had no knowledge of the underlying transactions, he would be hesitant to write such a letter. But, Schiffman claims that his reluctance was overcome when Morse showed him the two Berger letters. Schiffman then proceeded to advise Doyen that he would prepare an opinion letter which would \u201cverify\u201d Berger\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Schiffman\u2019s version of these meetings at Gardner\u2019s office is sharply in conflict with Gardner\u2019s recollection of the events, as described in his affidavit submitted by the SEC. Gardner recalls only one meeting with Schiffman at which not only Morse was present but Louis Marder as well. Gardner\u2019s affidavit then notes, quite specifically, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">I [Gardner] introduced Schiffman to Marder and Morse for the purpose of Schiffman representing Marder and Morse. Marder and Morse asked Schiffman, in my presence, to prepare an opinion letter for securities of Spectrum that were going to be sold <em>by Marder and Morse. </em>[emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The affidavit concludes with the statement : \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">I do not recall at any time .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmK\">Morse telephoning one William Doyen, giving the telephone to Schiffman, and Schiffman speaking to Doyen about an opinion letter to be prepared by Schiffman concerning either Doyen\u2019s stock, or any other stock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">In any event, Gardner was evidently satisfied that Schiffman would write the opinion letter because, sometime before its preparation, he proceeded to sell 50,000 shares of Spectrum stock jointly owned by the Doyens. As for Schiff-man, he claims to have arranged a conference with Berger so that he could learn more about the Spectrum stock for which he had agreed to write an opinion letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">What transpired at this meeting between Schiffman and Berger is also the subject of conflicting documentary versions. Both men agree that Berger gave Schiffman the two letters dated November 10 and November 25. Berger, however, in his affidavit submitted in the preliminary injunction proceeding, added that he warned Schiffman that he \u201csuspected that this stock [the unregistered Spectrum securities] was going to be traded by a control person and therefore the stock should not be freely traded.\u201d This account did not appear in Berger\u2019s two prior depositions, also part of the record below. Schiffman, on the other hand, in his reply affidavit, denied that Berger uttered any warning whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">It is uncontroverted that following this meeting Schiffman prepared an opinion letter which closely paralleled the Berger opinion letter of November 10 with one key addition \u2014 it contained the names of those shareholders, mentioned only as a group by Berger, who could sell their Spectrum stock in a transaction exempt from the registration requirement of Section 5. Although Schiffman\u2019s letter, dated December 4, was addressed to Doyen, Schiff-man delivered it to Gardner\u2019s office because Schiffman had never received Doyen\u2019s address. Subsequently, on December 8, Schiffman sent a second letter to Doyen, again through Gardner\u2019s office, in which Schiffman stated that his opinion letter of December 4 was not to be used for the sale of unregistered Spectrum stock. No such caveat, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ever, was incorporated in the December 4 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The use to which Schiffman\u2019s opinion letter of December 4 was put is a matter of some uncertainty. The SEC has alleged that in January, 1970, Marder showed the Schiffman letter to \u201cCanadian citizen # 1\u201d in order to assure this anonymous Canadian that the Spectrum shares that he had agreed to purchase from Marder could be traded without registration. The SEC charges that \u201cCanadian citizen # 1\u201d subsequently sold 15,000 shares of this unregistered Spectrum stock in the Canadian market. Although these allegations were never contested by Schiffman, they also remain unsupported by any independent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Eighteen months after this documentary joust commenced, Judge Tenney, on October 10, 1972, denied the SEC\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Schiffman from further violations of \u00a7\u00a7 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the 1933 Act and \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act. He concluded that there was no evidence, apart from the bare allegations by the SEC, that any unregistered Spectrum stock had been sold on the basis of Schiffman\u2019s opinion letter. Recognizing that Schiffman might still have violated the securities laws as an aider and abettor, the district court, after pronouncing a standard of liability which required actual knowledge of the illegal scheme, found a dearth of' credible evidence in the papers before him to sustain a finding of such knowledge on Schiffman\u2019s part. Judge Tenney finally noted that even if Schiffman were considered negligent in preparing his opinion letter, there had been no showing that, \"unless enjoined, he would be likely to run afoul of the law in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> We should note, at the outset, that had the denial of temporary injunctive relief been based solely on the failure to demonstrate a propensity for future violations, we would hesitate before disturbing such conclusion. SEC v. Bangor Punta, 331 F.Supp. 1154 (S.D.N.Y.1971), aff\u2019d sub nom. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 480 F.2d 341, 393-395 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 924, 94 S.Ct. 234, 38 L.Ed.2d 158 (1973). Judge Tenney, however, went well beyond this rationale, finding no evidence whatsoever of any violation, nor even sufficient factual uncertainty to justify an evidentiary hearing. It is especially as to this latter holding, the declination to hold an evidentiary hearing, that we find error for we believe that the district judge failed to properly heed our admonition that \u201ca judge should not resolve a factual dispute on affidavits or depositions for then he is merely showing a preference for \u2018one piece of paper to another.\u2019 Sims v. Greene, 161 F.2d 87, 88 (3d Cir. 1947).\u201d Dopp v. Franklin National Bank, 461 F.2d 873, 879 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">As in <em>Dopp, </em>we need give no special deference to the district court\u2019s finding that there were no material issues of fact in dispute for \u201cwe are in as good a position as [he] to read and interpret the pleadings, affidavits and depositions. . . . \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Examination of this record, moreover, discloses a sharp factual conflict bearing heavily on the critical question of Schiffman\u2019s actual knowledge of the scheme to illicitly distribute unregistered Spectrum stock at the time he agreed to draft the December 4 opinion letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">On Schiffman\u2019s part, he has steadfastly maintained that he was ignorant of the Marder plan. Yet, these protestations of innocence are met squarely on two fronts \u2014 by the affidavits of Gardner and Berger. Although we do not disagree with the district court that the Berger affidavit would seem to be incredible on its face in light of Berger\u2019s failure to make any mention of his alleged warning to Schiffman in the course of two prior depositions, we cannot overlook the dispute between Gardner and Schiffman over the events and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>participants at the crucial meeting<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> at Gardner\u2019s office in late November, 1969. If Gardner\u2019s statement that Marder personally asked Schiffman for an opinion letter so that Marder could sell unregistered Spectrum stock is true \u2014 and only a hearing could determine this \u2014 then Schiffman\u2019s claim of unawareness of the scheme would appear thin. To be sure, Gardner\u2019s veracity may be questioned,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but no more nor less than Schiffman\u2019s, in view of Schiffman\u2019s stake in the outcome of this lawsuit. Accordingly, since oral testimony is a medium far superior for evaluating credibility than the cold written word, we consider an eviden-tiary hearing essential to the proper disposition of this case. <em>See </em>SEC v. Frank, 388 F.2d 486 (2d Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"> Since our decision necessitates further proceedings in the lower court, we would be remiss if we failed to comment on the appropriate rule of law to be applied by the district judge. Judge Tenney properly recognized that if Schiffman\u2019s opinion letter were in fact used to sell unregistered Spectrum stock in violation of Section 5,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> although his status as an \u201cunderwriter\u201d might be uncertain,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> he could be liable, nevertheless, as an aider and abettor to Marder\u2019s illicit venture. SEC v. North American Research &amp; Development Corp., 424 F.2d 63, 82 (2d Cir. 1970). In assessing liability as an aider and abettor, however, the district judge formulated a requisite standard of culpability \u2014 actual knowledge of the improper scheme plus an intent to further that scheme \u2014 which we find to be a sharp and unjustified departure from the negligence standard which we have repeatedly held to be sufficient in the context of enforcement proceedings seeking equitable or prophylactic relief. SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1096 (2d Cir. 1972); Hanly v. SEC, 415 F.2d 589, 596 (2d Cir. 1969); SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulfur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 854-855 (2d Cir. 1968) (en banc), cert. denied, sub nom. Kline v. SEC, 394 U.S. 976, 89 S.Ct. 1454, 22 L.Ed.2d 756 (1969). <em>Cf. </em>Lanza v. Drexel, 479 F.2d 1277, 1304 (2d Cir. 1973) (enbanc).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">We do not believe, moreover, that imposition of a negligence standard with respect to the conduct of a secondary participant is overly strict, at least in the context of this case. The legal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>fession plays a unique and pivotal role in the effective implementation of the securities laws. Questions of compliance with the intricate provisions of these statutes are ever present and the smooth functioning of the securities markets will be seriously disturbed if the public cannot rely on the expertise proffered by an attorney when he renders an opinion on such matters. Schiffman, himself, realized that his opinion letter of December 4 could be used in due course to sell unregistered securities and sought to prevent that use by his subsequent letter to Doyen of December 8. This belated effort was ineffectual, however, since the limitation expressed in the second letter could hardly affect the potency of the December 4 opinion letter which remained unrestricted on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">We do not find persuasive the argument by one recent commentator that since \u201cthe alleged aider and abettor will merely be engaging in customary business activities, such as loaning money, managing a corporation, preparing financial statements, distributing press releases, completing brokerage transactions, or giving legal advice, [a requirement that he] investigate the ultimate activities of the party whom he is assisting [may impose] a burden upon business activities that is too great.\u201d Ruder, Multiple Defendants in Securities Law Fraud Cases: Aiding and Abetting, Conspiracy, In Pari Delic-to, Indemnification and Contribution, 120 U.Pa.L.Rev. 597, 632-633 (1972). In the distribution of unregistered securities, the preparation of an opinion letter is too essential and the reliance of the public too high to permit due diligence to be cast aside in the name of convenience. The public trust demands more of its legal advisers than \u201ccustomary\u201d activities which prove to be careless. And, to be sure, where expediency precludes thorough investigation, an attorney can prevent the illicit use of his opinion letter by prohibiting its utilization in the sale of unregistered securities by a statement to that effect clearly appearing on the face of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Nor does Professor Ruder\u2019s analogy to the strict scienter requirement for <em>criminal </em>liability of an aider and abettor seem appropriate to gauge the quality of conduct sufficient to warrant injunctive relief in a civil action. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938). The disparate consequences cannot be glossed over when striking the balance between private rights and the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">We could not conclude without emphasizing that the standard of culpability we find appropriate for the author of an opinion letter in an action for injunctive relief only should not be construed to apply to more peripheral participants in an illicit scheme or, for that matter, to criminal prosecutions or private suits for damages. Those questions are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Nor do we suggest that the degree of scienter may not be highly relevant to a determination of whether the defendant has the propensity to commit future violations, a requisite to injunctive relief. In this regard, the SEC has indicated on this appeal that, subsequent to the argument of the instant case in the district court, Schiffman has been enjoined for violations of the securities laws on two separate occasions<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and has pleaded guilty to a third such violation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On remand of this case, we can see no reason for precluding the SEC from introducing this evidence on the propensity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">For the reasons stated, the order of the district court is reversed and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>case remanded for further proceedings, In light of the untoward delay, we strongly urge that the hearing on the application for a preliminary injunction be consolidated with the trial on the merits pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2), and the case advanced for disposition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-15\">.

Rule 133 conditioned exemption on the submission of the merger proposal to a vote of the disappearing corporation\u2019s shareholders. Although no such vote was taken, Marder apparently hoped to conceal this omission. We should add that even if a vote had been taken, the distribution would not have qualified for a Rule 133 exemption because of the existence of the illicit scheme at the time of the merger agreement.

Schiffman makes much of the fact that Berger, whose opinion letter of November 10 was a critical element in the scheme, was not joined as a defendant below.
