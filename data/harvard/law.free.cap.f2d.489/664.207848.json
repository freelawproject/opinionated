For the purpose of this opinion we use the word \u201cintentional\u201d as meaning \u201cwith intent to deceive the magistrate.\u201d Of course, Phillips intended to use the name \u201cFinley.\u201d In that sense, his incorrect statement was intentional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b747-6\">TUTTLE, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">This case primarily concerns the extent to which misrepresentations in affidavits by Government agents vitiate the search warrant issued pursuant thereto. Appellant Titus Thomas, a/k/a Tee, was convicted of possession of 128.46 grams of heroin, a Schedule I narcotic drug substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). This appeal seeks reversal on three grounds: (1) that the admitted misrepresentations in the affidavit by agent Phillips should vitiate the search warrant; (2) that the search conducted at night was illegal; and (3) that the arrest and search incident thereto were invalid. We readily find no merit in the latter two contentions, but determine that this ease presents substantial questions regarding the standards for evaluating affidavits containing misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">However, careful consideration causes us to hold that this affidavit, purged of the factual errors, is sufficient to support the search warrant because (1) the misrepresentations were not intentionally <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made and (2) if unintentionally committed, the misrepresentations were not material to the showing of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">The facts are undisputed. On May 8, 1972, agent Phillips of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs made the following affidavit in support of his application for a search warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">\u201cAccording to two reliable informants hereto referred to as Source 1 and Source 2 [both informants have furnished intelligence in the past that has led to the arrest and seizures of heroin] James H. FINLEY is a heroin trafficker. Source 1 supplied intelligence on September 20, 1971, that FINLEY conferred with him and at this time FINLEY stated that he was supplying numerous southern cities and that he wanted to expand his operations to include New Orleans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-15\">\u201cAt this time FINLEY advised Source 1 that he would supply him with large quantities of heroin in the near future. FINLEY was driving a 1971 Lincoln bearing Alabama license 2A15335. The vehicle was registered to him at 470 East Ridge Road, Mobile, Ala.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-16\">\u201cOn Monday, May 1, 1972 Source 1 advised Affiant that FINLEY was in New Orleans and that FINLEY had sent an unknown male to him to-advise him that FINLEY had a supply' of heroin and could supply him with as much heroin as he wanted. Source 1 attempted to get in touch with FINLEY with negative results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-18\">\u201cOn Sunday, May 7, 1972 Source 2 called Affiant and states that he had met earlier in the day with FINLEY and that FINLEY was residing at 2116 Iberville Street . . . Source 2 stated that he went to 2116 Iberville Street and talked with FINLEY about selling drugs for him. Source 2 told FINLEY that he was too afraid to do it. FINLEY explained to the source that he had rented an apartment across the street at 2117 Iberville and that he was keeping his cache at that location. FINLEY stated that he had to package some heroin and at this time he took Source 2 to the apartment [as described below]. The Source related that FINLEY lifted the bed in the apartment and removed a small suitcase and removed numerous packages. Source 2 then advised he left the apartment and told FINLEY that he was afraid of being caught by the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>\u201cOn Sunday, May 7, 1972 at approximately 6:00 PM Affiant placed the premises of 2116 and 2117 under surveillance. At approximately 7:45 PM Affiant observed an unknown Negro male exit 2116 Iberville, go across the street to the door between 2115 and 2117 Iberville, use a key and enter the door. In approximately three minutes the unknown Negro male exited the premises and walked to the corner of Galvez Street and turned out of af-fiants\u2019 vision. In approximately five minutes the unknown Negro re-appeared and walked back and entered 2116 Iberville Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">\u201cWHEREFORE Affiant respectfully requests . . . that a nighttime warrant pursuant to section 509 of the Controlled Substances Act ... be issued because of the need to search at the next most reasonable opportunity and because in my experience as a narcotics investigator drugs are likely to be more open for delivery and dealing at night and thus more exposed to seizure under a search warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The name, \u201cJames H. Finley\u201d was capitalized as shown in the above recital. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, agent Phillips admitted that the informants mentioned in the affidavit did not designate the party discussed by the name of \u201cJames H. Finley,\u201d but consistently referred to him as \u201cTee\u201d during each conversation with Phillips. It was Phillips\u2019 testimony that he, not the informants, as stated in the affidavit ascribed the name \u201cJames H. Finley\u201d to the party discussed by the informants based on certain deductions after additional investigation. The affidavit, however, clearly states that the informants avowed that \u201cJames H. Finley\u201d had shown source 2 the narcotics' and had solicited both sources 1 and 2 as salesmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Source 1 had related to Phillip that \u201cTee\u201d met him in a 1971 Lincoln with an Alabama license tag 2A15335. Agent Phillips discovered through further investigation that this 1971 Lincoln had been associated in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Office in Mobile, Alabama with heroin traffic and was registered to \u201cJames H. Finley.\u201d Phillips deduced that \u201cTee\u201d was \u201cJames H. Finley\u201d and used this name in the affidavit. Phillips did not learn that the man arrested was the appellant Titus Thomas who was the same person known as \u201cTee\u201d until after appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Agent Phillips obtained the search warrant around 8:00 or 9:00 p. m. on May 8, 1972. The search warrant was executed shortly thereafter, at approximately 10:00p. m., at 2115-2117 Iber-ville Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, by agents Phillips, Costa and Curry. The landlady furnished these officers a key to 2117 after they showed her the search warrant; heroin was found both under the bed and in a locked suitcase. After seizing the contraband the officers proceeded to an area directly across from the premises searched and observed the front of 2116 Iberville Street. The landlady stated that Dickinson and Titus Thomas were the occupants of the apartment, and described Thomas as fifty years old, with receding hair, graying mustache, bright skin, heavy set and about six feet tall. While waiting across the street the agents observed Dickinson enter the apartment with a woman. After approximately ten or fifteen minutes, Dickinson, Thomas and two women left 2116 Iberville, and proceeded down the sidewalk. They stood for a moment or two; it appeared that they were going to separate; the women began to leave. The officers arrested Thomas and Dickinson as they were stepping off the curb on the side of the street opposite them at 2117 Iberville. The keys in Thomas\u2019 .pocket fit the suitcase and the door to 2117 Iberville where the heroin had been located.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Phillips did not state to the magistrate his reason for believing \u201cTee\u201d \u2019s name was \u201cJames H. Finley.\u201d Phillips had assumed that \u201cFinley\u201d and \u201cTee\u201d were the same persons since September of 1971, the time the circumstances concerning the automobile occurred. Also, both informants had stated that \u201cTee\u201d was from Mobile, Alabama, the resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>dence of \u201cFinley.\u201d The record does not reflect the specific physical description the two informants gave to Phillips of the persons they separately referred to as \u201cTee,\u201d but Phillips testified that the description of the person he was investigating was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">\u201cHe was brown skinned, 45 years old. He would have had short hair, heavyset, heavy build, 230, 240 pounds, black male.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Phillips had conducted a surveillance of 2116-2117 Iberville Street on the night prior to the issuance and execution of the search warrant on May 8, 1972. Phillips noted in the affidavit that on May 7, 1972, he observed a \u201cNegro male\u201d entering the apartment, but did not give any further description of this man. For these reasons, Phillips maintains that he did not intentionally misstate the facts in the affidavit prepared on May 8, 1972, because he believed \u201cTee\u201d to be \u201cFinley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The trial court found that Phillips maintained a good faith belief based upon his investigation that \u201cTee\u201d was in reality a man named \u201cFinley.\u201d The erroneous theory of \u201cTee\u201d \u2019s true identity was deemed trivial and insignificant as regarding the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause. The court upheld the nighttime search and did not discuss the validity of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">II. MISREPRESENTATION IN AFFIDAVITS</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The vast majority of decisions resolving attacks on the sufficiency of affidavits underlying search warrants are reached on the assumption that the affiant\u2019s statements are true. But how is a court to deal with a defense attack on the veracity of statements made by the affiant or other government agents? This Court\u2019s task is twofold: (1) to determine what standards should be applied in evaluating the validity of affidavits containing misrepresentations; and (2) to consider whether this affidavit passes muster under those stand-</p>\n<p id=\"AWka\">ards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-18\">In United States v. Upshaw, 448 F.2d 1218 (5th Cir. 1971) and in two recent cases, United States v. Jones, 475 F.2d 723 (5th Cir. 1973) and United States v. Morris, 477 F.2d 657 (5th Cir. 1973), this Court had occasion to consider \u201cmisrepresentative\u201d affidavits supporting search warrants. These decisions determined that after deleting the erroneous statements, the affidavits were totally lacking in facts tending to show the requisite probable cause, and thus held the search warrants pursuant thereto invalid. In United States v. Upshaw, <em>supra, </em>448 F.2d at 1218, 1222, appear the following pertinent comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-19\">\u201cPurged of its erroneous statements, the affidavit was wholly lacking in facts tending to show that Davis was printing checks or identification documents or that any of the documents were on the premises of the print shop. Stripped of its incorrect assertions, the affidavit became like that in Nathanson v. United States, 290 U.S. 41, 54 S.Ct. 11, 78 L.Ed. 159 (1933), consisting of nothing more than the bare statement of affiant\u2019s belief and cause to suspect that items were in a specified location. Mere affirmance of belief or' suspicion is not enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 47, 54 S.Ct. at 13, 78 L.Ed. at 162. <em>See also </em>Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-21\">\u201cOnce it came to the attention of the court, from the testimony at the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>tion to suppress hearing, that evidence had been seized on the basis of statements 'of facts erroneously made by the affiant which struck at the heart of the affidavit\u2019s showing of probable cause, the court was required to grant the motion [to suppress] . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Moreover, this Court in United States v. Morris, <em>supra, </em>477 F.2d at 662, aptly summarized the rationale for suppressing evidence obtained due to erroneous affidavits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"awy-dedup-0\">\u201cA contrary rule would leave the warrant requirement embodied in the fourth amendment open to circumvention by overzealous officials willing to make erroneous affidavits in the hope that the resultant search or arrest will yield conclusive proof of criminal conduct. The warrant procedure operates on the assumption that statements in the affidavit presented to the issuing magistrate are at least an accurate representation of what the affiant knows though possibly inadequate to show probable cause. It would quickly deteriorate into a meaningless formality were we to approve searches or arrests based upon misrepresentation or incorrect factual statements. \u25a0 Thus when an affidavit contains inaccurate statements which materially affect its showing of probable cause, any warrant based upon it is rendered invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In this trio of cases this Court adopted the bifurcated procedure of excising the misrepresentative parts from the affidavit and then examining the residue for probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The difference with this case is that after purging this affidavit of its misrepresentations, probable cause for issuance of a search warrant still exists, even if the affidavit is viewed in the light most favorable to the appellant-defendant. If the consistent use of the name \u201cFinley\u201d were deleted, there would be nothing to link sources 1 and 2, and the information from sources 1 and 2 must satisfy probable cause requirements independent of each other. Source 1 could not conceivably alone constitute sufficient probable cause. Accordingly, this Court must evaluate what is left in source 2, after eliminating source 1 and all the misrepresentations in source 2. Even if we accept this view, sufficient probable cause remains in source 2 alone. The non-misrepresent-ative residue in source 2 discloses that: \u201cX\u201d met source 2 at 2116 Iberville Street; that \u201cX\u201d asked source 2 to sell heroin; that \u201cX\u201d said he was keeping a cache in his apartment which he showed source 2. Additionally Phillips had substantiated the reliability of the source, stating that he had furnished intelligence in the past. Thus, the affidavit complies with the well-established two-prong test for assaying affiants\u2019 hearsay statements in that: (1) the affidavit presents sufficient objective evidence to enable the magistrate to conclude that the unnamed informant is credible or that his information is reliable, and (2) the affidavit sets forth some underlying circumstances which reveal the source of the informer\u2019s information pertaining to the criminal activity. <em>See </em>Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964); Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Therefore, this case presents the issue, which this Court has not heretofore squarely faced: How is a misrepresenta-tive affidavit to be treated when after deleting the false material, there remain facts which might have supported a magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\"> The crucial question becomes whether, after deletion of the errors, surveying the non-misrepresentative residue for probable cause is the only standard to be applied in evaluating the effect of inaccurate affidavits supporting search warrants. We conclude not, in light of the fact that courts of several other circuits have adopted additional tests, and more importantly, this Court sounded the following significant caveat in a footnote in United States v. Morris, <em>supra, </em>477 F.2d at 662 n. 6.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u201cWe feel compelled to emphasize that there is nothing in the record which indicates that the erroneous statement in Williams\u2019 affidavit was intentionally or willfully made. Nothing in this opinion is intended to suggest to the contrary.\u201d ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">This comment appears to intimate that whether the misrepresentation was \u201cintentional\u201d or \u201cwillful\u201d may affect in some circumstances the validity of the affidavit. Also, the district court in the instant case based its decision upholding the sufficiency of this affidavit not only on the fact that the name error was insignificant and not integral to a showing of probable cause, but also because the affidavit was made in good faith. The district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">\u201cIn the present case, Phillips maintained a good faith belief, based upon his experience in law enforcement and upon his investigation of narcotics cases, that \u2018Tee\u2019 was in reality a man named \u2018Finley.\u2019 The Court finds no <em>willful attempt to deceive </em>the magistrate, and it is clear that Phillips\u2019 erroneous theory of \u2018Tee\u201ds real identity was trivial and insignificant as regard the magistrate\u2019s determination that there was probable cause requisite to the issuance of a search warrant. . \u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axu-dedup-1\">Therefore, we hold that affidavits containing misrepresentations are invalid if the error (1) was committed with an intent to deceive the magistrate, whether or not the error is material to the showing of probable cause; or (2) made non-jntentionally, but the erroneous statement is material to the establishment of probable cause for the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">This standard of evaluating the intent of the agent-affiant is supported by decisions in other circuits. .A recent opinion by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Carmichael, 7 Cir., 489 F.2d 983 [1973] extensively examined inaccurate affidavits supporting search warrants. First, although the Supreme Court has not decided the extent to which a court may permit an attack on a warrant where the allegations of the affidavit establish probable cause, the Seventh Circuit significantly held criminal defendants are entitled to a hearing under the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-15\">\u201c . . . in United States v. Pearce, 7th Cir., 275 F.2d 318, 321-322 (1960), this Court expressed its opinion in dicta that the propriety of such a hearing \u2018is hardly open to question.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-17\">\u201cWe now hold that a defendant is entitled to a hearing which delves below the surface of a facially sufficient affidavit if he has made an initial showing of either of the following: (1) any misrepresentation by the government agent of a material fact, or (2) an intentional misrepresentation by the government agent, whether or not material. See generally United States v. Dunnings, 425 F.2d 836, 840, 2d Cir. 1969, certiorari denied, 397 U. S. 1002, 90 S.Ct. 1149, 25 L.Ed.2d 412; United States v. Halsey, 257 F. Supp. 1002 (S.D.N.Y.1966); Kipper-man, \u2018Inaccurate Search Warrant Affidavits as a Ground for Suppressing Evidence,\u2019 84 Harv.L.Rev. 825 (1971).\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-20\">After determining that in certain circumstances a defendant was entitled to a hearing on the factual validity of an affidavit supporting a search warrant, the court proceeded to set the standards under which evidence would be suppressed;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsZ\">\u201cHowever, once such hearing is granted, more must be shown to suppress the evidence. Evidence should not be suppressed unless the trial court finds that the government agent was either recklessly or intentionally untruthful. A completely innocent misrepresentation is not sufficient for two reasons. Most importantly, the primary justification for the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct (see Kipper-man supra at 831, and cases cited), and good faith errors cannot be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>terred. Furthermore, such errors do not negate probable cause. If an agent reasonably believes facts which on their face indicate that a crime has probably been committed, then even if mistaken, he has probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. Such errors are likelier and more tolerable during the early stages of the criminal process, for issuance of a warrant is not equivalent to conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">\u201cNegligent misrepresentations are theoretically deterable, but no workable test suggests itself for determining whether an officer was negligent or completely innocent in not checking the facts further. We therefore concluded that evidence should not be suppressed unless the officer was at least reckless in his misrepresentation. Even where the officer is reckless, if the misrepresentation is immaterial, it did not affect the issuance of the warrant and there is no justification for suppressing the evidence. Arguably, the same- conclusion could be reached as to deliberate but immaterial misrepresentations. However, we conclude that if deliberate government perjury should ever be shown, the court need not inquire as to. the materiality of the perjury. The fullest deterrent sanctions of the exclusionary rule should be applied to such serious and deliberate government wrongdoing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">This discussion by. the court substantially adopts, with one modification, the standards for evaluating affidavits set forth in Kipperman, \u201cInaccurate Search Warrant Affidavits As A Ground For Suppressing Evidence,\u201d 84 Harv.L.Rev. 825, 830-33 (1971). In short, the author proposes that evidence should be suppressed when there is either (1) an intentional misstatement by an affiant-agent, whether material or immaterial to showing probable cause; or (2) a negligent or unreasonable assertion in an affidavit, if material to showing probable cause, but <em>not </em>where (3) the mistake is innocent, even if material to probable cause. The only modification to Kipper-man\u2019s analysis made by the Seventh Circuit was that mere ordinary negligence is not sufficient, for the misrepresentation must amount to recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Two other decisions are noteworthy. In United States v. Bowling, 351 F.2d 236, 421-422 (6th Cir. 1965), the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld a search warrant based on an affidavit containing factual errors, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">\u201cUnder this circumstance, we read the denial of the motion to suppress evidence as a holding that there was probable cause for the warrant and that errors in the affidavit were immaterial or unintentional,2 such as are produced by drafting \u2018by non-lawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation.\u2019 United States v. Ven-tresca, <em>supra, </em>380 U.S. at 108, 85 S.Ct. at 746.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit also briefly considered the effect of misrepresentations in affidavits in United States v. Bridges, 419 F.2d 963, 966-967 (8th Cir. 1969), where the defendant argued, for the first time on appeal, that the government agent falsely swore that the defendant had been convicted in 1961 for \u201cnarcotics violations and received a sentence of nine years.\u201d Treating this contention in a footnote, the court dismissed the issue by pointing out that there was no showing in the record that the agent made the statement with \u201cfraudulent intent\u201d and that the error was \u201cimmaterial\u201d since it was highly unlikely that any weight would be given a 1961 conviction for narcotics addiction in determining probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant in 1968. These two decisions by no means thoroughly considered the issue, but did inject the element of intent as a possible standard for evaluating the effect of misrepresentations in affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Other eases discussing inaccurate search affidavits have generally involved situations where, after deletion of the misrepresentations, the affidavit is clearly lacking in probable cause. <em>See </em>United States v. Harwood, 470 F.2d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>322, 324-325 (10th Cir. 1972); United States v. Roth, 391 F.2d 507, 511 (7th Cir. 1967); United States v. Botsch, 364 F.2d 542, 546 (2d Cir. 1966), cert, denied, 386 U.S. 937, 87 S.Ct. 959, 17 L.Ed.2d 810 (1967); United States v. Pearce, 275 F.2d 318 (7th Cir. 1960); United States v. Henderson, 17 F.R.D. 1 (D.D.C.1954). The Seventh and Fourth Circuits have also held that the willful or intentional use of a fictitious name as the affiant\u2019s signature on a search warrant affidavit, intentional use of a fictitious name as the affiant\u2019s signature on a search warrant affidavit <em>per se </em>voids the warrant. United States ex rel. Pugh v. Pate, 401 F.2d 6 (7th Cir. 1968) and King v. United States, 282 F.2d 398 (4th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Without further citation of authority we are convinced that there would be a sufficient \u00bfasis for invalidating a search warrant if the error was intentional, even though immaterial to the showing of probable cause. In fact, a warrant issued following an intentional misstatement of fact by an affiant-agent would present the clearest case for suppression. Kipperman\u2019s reasoning is worth repeating:</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">\u201cThis would be a clear case of proscribed government action (perjury) which could be to some degree deterred by quashing warrants based thereupon. One could analogize intentional inaccuracy by the affiant to the knowing use of perjured testimony at trial and hold that the public policy against government distortion requires automatic suppression of the evidence obtained in such a manner regardless of prejudice. Thus an in-tehtional misstatement of fact in the affidavit would be fatal even if it were immaterial to proving probable cause, of if, unbeknownst to the lying af-fiant, the facts alleged in bad faith turned out to be true.\u201d Kipperman, <em>supra, </em>at 831. invalidating warrants pursuant to intentional misrepresentations by government agents is a logical corollary of the deterrence philosophy underlying the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Therefore, the next step is to determine whether Phillips\u2019 misrepresentations were intentional or unintentional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If unintentional, we have already concluded that the error was not material to the showing of probable cause, and therefore would not provide a basis for quashing the warrant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, if the error was intentionally committed, the materiality of the error to the establishment of probable cause is not a prerequisite to invalidating the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Foremost, it should be emphasized that the statements regarding the name \u201cJames H. Finley\u201d were clearly misrep-resentative; the only open question is whether the misrepresentation was in good faith or with an intent to mislead. Phillips may have in good faith deduced from his investigation about the license tag of the 1971 Lincoln that \u201cTee\u201d was \u201cJames H. Finley.\u201d However, Phillips drafted the affidavit so artfully that it appeared that these informers had called the party in question \u201cFinley,\u201d and not that Phillips had merely deduced that \u201cTee\u201d must be \u201cFinley.\u201d Phillips did not state the mental processes he followed to make this deduction, which he easily could have done. The use of the name \u201cFinley\u201d also made it appear that sources 1 and 2 were conclusively referring to the same person. The consistent use of the name Finley tied these informant tips together: at sixteen places the name \u201cFinley\u201d is capitalized, thus emphasizing the correctness of the investigation about this person. The error was blantantly misrepresentative.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">However, the saving feature is that through his investigation Phillips had secured the license tag number from the informants, discovered the car was registered to James H. Finley; he knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>that both \u201cTee\u201d and \u201cJames H. Finley\u201d were from Mobile, Alabama, and consequently had a valid basis for assuming that \u201cTee\u201d was \u201cJames H. Finley.\u201d Although the issue is a difficult one, we feel compelled to affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the agent\u2019s belief was made in good faith and not with an intent to deceive the magistrate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In conclusion, we determine that the affidavit, purged of its errors, sufficiently supports the search warrant issued pursuant thereto because the misrepresentations (1) were not intentional, or (2) were not material to the showing of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">III. THE NIGHTTIME SEARCH</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The search warrant was executed around 10:00 p. m., May 8, 1972. The warrant itself was a blank form filled in by the magistrate. At the beginning the form provided for the name of the affiant, and \u201cThat he (has reason to believe) (is positive) that . . .\u201d probable cause to search the named premises exists. These alternative parenthetical were footnoted to a paragraph in the warrant which recited,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">\u201cThe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide: \u2018The warrant shall direct that it be served in the daytime, but if the affidavits <em>are positive </em>that the property is on the person or in the place to be searched, the warrant may direct that it be served at any time.\u2019 Rule 41(e).\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a3u-dedup-0\">In the warrant issued by the magistrate, the parenthetical \u201cis positive\u201d was crossed out. All agreed that the trial court correctly held that Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 41(c) could not authorize this night search, because the affiant was not positive that the contraband was at the place to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">However, the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 41(h) state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">\u201cThis rule does not modify any act, inconsistent with it, regulating search, seizure and the issuance and execution of search' warrants in circumstances for which special provision is made. . The term \u2018daytime\u2019 is used in this rule to mean the hours from 6:00 a. m. to 10:00 p. m. according to local time. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">The trial court held that this night search was proper under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 879, because such act fell within the exception as allowed in Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 41(h). It is provided in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 879 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-14\">\u201c(a) A search warrant relating to offenses involving controlled substances may be served at any time of the day or night <em>if </em>the judge or United States magistrate issuing the warrant <em>is satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that grounds exist for the warrant and for its service at such time.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">The appellant\u2019s contention is that the italicized words require the magistrate to make an affirmative statement on the face of the warrant showing his satisfaction that probable cause existed to believe that the search was necessary at night. It is noted that before the command to search, the warrant recited,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-16\">\u201cI am satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that the property so described is being concealed on the (premises) above described and that the foregoing grounds for application for issuance of a search warrant exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">The warrant concluded with- the command,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-18\">\u201cYou are hereby commanded to search forthwith the (place) named for the property specified, serving this warrant and making the search (in'the daytime) (at any time in the day or night) . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-19\">The parenthetical \u201cin the daytime\u201d was crossed out. Thus, the appellant stresses that this warrant only stated the magistrate\u2019s satisfaction with the showing of probable cause to search and commanded that the warrant be served \u201cat any time in the day or night,\u201d but failed to include any statement by the magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>trate that he was satisfied that there was probable cause for the execution of the warrant specifically at\" night. The appellant basically argues that the magistrate was required to state on the face of the warrant why he was authorizing the night search, without citing any case law to substantiate the position that more should have been done by the magistrate..</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The government responds that section 879(a) requires only a determination by the magistrate that the night search was necessary, without demanding explanation on the warrant itself or the reasons therefore. It is stressed that Phillips on the last page of the warrant application stated adequate reasons for needing a night search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">\u201cIt is also requested that a nighttime warrant pursuant to section 509 of the Controlled Substances Act, (P.L. 91-513) be issued because of the need to search at the next most reasonable opportunity and because in my experience as a narcotics investigator drugs are more likely to be open for delivery and dealing at night and thus more exposed to seizure under a search warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Furthermore, it is asserted that the magistrate by the act of crossing out the section of the form \u201cin the daytime\u201d evidenced his finding of probable cause for a nighttime search and was not required to include statements on the face of the warrant specifically regarding the night element of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">The resolution of this issue is assisted by examining the prior law regarding federal narcotics search warrants, 18 U. 5. C. \u00a7 1405(1) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, which was superseded by 21 U.S.C., \u00a7 879(a). Section 1405(1) provided, in pertinent part, that a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\">\u201c. . . Search warrant [relating to narcotics offenses] may be served at any time of the day or night if the judge or United States Commissioner issuing the warrant is satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that the grounds for the application exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">Section 1405(1) was uniformly interpreted to require <em>only </em>a showing of probable cause to search in order for a warrant relating to narcotics to be executed at night. In other words, if the warrant could legally issue, it could be served at any time, day or night. United States v. Stallings, 413 F.2d 200, 207 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 396 U.S. 972, 90 S.Ct. 460, 24 L.Ed.2d 440 (1969); United States v. Pittman, 439 F.2d 906, 909 (5th Cir. 1971); United States v. Tucker, 262 F.Supp. 305 (S.D.N.Y.1966). The appellant contends that the new narcotics search warrant provision, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 879(a), is significantly different because the judge must not only be satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that grounds exist for the warrant, but also \u201cfor its service at such time.\u201d This language, argues appellant, is a new requirement, commanding affirmative action by the magistrate and probable cause to issue the warrant specifically at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-17\">This argument would be plausible, were it not for the fact that the legislative history of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 879 reveals that no change was intended in application or meaning of section 1405(1) with the enactment of section 879(a).- Indeed, the House Report notes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-18\">\u201cSubsection (a) of this section [21 U. S.C. \u00a7 879] incorporates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1405 and authorizes service of a search warrant at any time of the day or night if probable cause has been established to the satisfaction of the judge or U.S. Magistrate issuing the warrant.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>A recent decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, United States v. Gooding, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 259, 477 F.2d 428, 432-439 (1973), extensively considered these two statutes, reviewing their legislative history and previous interpretations of section 1405(1). In the opinion of the Court, section 879(a) was a \u201cdirect descendant\u201d of section 1405(1) and did not require a special showing of a need to search at night. <em>Id. </em>at 432-438. <em>See </em>United States v. Thomas, 294 A.2d 164 (D.C.App.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">In conclusion, it is significant that agent Phillips did affirmatively state adequate reasons for conducting the search at night, since it was necessary to search immediately and the warrant was obtained at 8:00 p. m. Consequently, we are not required to determine whether specific reasons for searching at night must be given in addition to the general-showing of probable cause. We only hold that where the magistrate did cross out \u201cdaytime\u201d and did have an explanation in the affidavit adequately justifying the nighttime search, the magistrate was not required to repeat or further elucidate the special grounds for issuing the search at night on the warrant itself. Accordingly, the search warrant was properly issued and executed at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">IV. LEGALITY OF THE ARREST</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The trial court did not reach the legality of the arrest, because it ruled that the prior warrant seizures \u2022 were legal and thus led to the valid arrest. The appellant claims that the search warrant was illegal, therefore the arrest was illegal. Moreover, if the arrest was illegal, the taking of the keys from appellant was illegal. However, since this Court concludes that the search warrant was legal, this issue is pretermitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\">. At this juncture it is important to emphasize that tins case does not raise the issue of whether a defendant is entitled to a hearing to test the underlying factual validity of the affidavit on the basis of which a warrant has been issued. This question is yet to be resolved by the Supreme Court, and none of the Fifth Circuit cases heretofore concerning misrepresentative search warrants presented the question. <em>See </em>United States v. Morris, 477 F.2d 657, 662 n. 3 (5th Oir. 1973) ; United States v. Jones, 475 F.2d 723, 726 (5th Cir. 1973) ; United States v.
