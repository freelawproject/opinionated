S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>See </em>United States v. Hester, 465 F.2d 1125 (8th Cir. 1972) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Essentially Hester asserts that his conviction should be vacated because: 1) he was unlawfully arrested; 2) he was denied effective assistance of counsel; 3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>he was denied a fair trial; 4) government agents perjured themselves during trial. Specifically Hester claims that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to establish these claims, as the district court denied his motion without a hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Generally speaking, no hearing need be held on a \u00a7 2255 motion where the files and records of the case demonstrate that the petitioner is not entitled to relief, or, where the motion raises only a question of law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; Mixen v. United States, 469 F.2d 203, 205 (8th Cir. 1972, cert. denied, 412 U.S. 906, 93 S.Ct. 2297, 36 L.Ed.2d 971 (1973); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 599 at 626 (1969). In addition, a hearing is not required where the motion is stated in vague and conelusory terms. <em>See </em>United States v. Journey, 474 F.2d 1003 (8th Cir. 1973). With these considerations in mind, Hester\u2019s claims will be considered briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">1. <em>Unlawful Arrest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Although Hester claims that he was never \u201cofficially arrested,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it appears that what Hester actually claims is that the <em>prosecution </em>used, during trial, a statement obtained from him in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The problem with this argument is that the transcript of trial clearly indicates that <em>defense counsel, </em>who was retained, not the prosecution, used Hester\u2019s statements to impeach the credibility of certain government agents. <em>See </em>Tr. 106-111, 361. Therefore, Hester\u2019s assertion is simply not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">2. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Hester claims his retained counsel was ineffective. However, Hester is not entitled to relief or a hearing where the allegation raises simply a matter of trial tactics. <em>See, e. g., </em>Hanger v. United States, 428 F.2d 746, 747-749 (8th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1022, 91 S.Ct. 586, 27 L.Ed.2d 634 (1971). Specifically Hester claims that counsel should have called as witnesses certain unnamed persons, and further that counsel should not have suggested that Hester testify in his own behalf. These allegations are nothing more than quarrels with the tactics counsel used to defend Hester. <em>See, e. g., </em>Churder v. United States, 294 F.Supp. 207, 212-214 (E.D.Mo.1968), aff\u2019d per curiam, Churder v. United States, 417 F.2d 633 (8th Cir. 1969); Mitchell v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 57, 259 F.2d 787, 792, 794, cert. denied, 358 U.S. 850, 79 S.Ct. 81, 3 L.Ed.2d 86 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">3. <em>Fair Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">Hester claims he was not afforded a fair trial since a juror allegedly slept through portions of the trial. Hester has never raised this allegation before. Other courts which have considered the \u201csleeping juror\u201d problem have suggested that the trial court should be apprised, at once, of the misconduct. <em>See </em>United States v. Curry, 471 F.2d 419, 421-422 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Carter, 433 F.2d 874, 876 (10th Cir. 1970). Hester, failing to apprise the trial court of this alleged misconduct, should not be allowed to inject \u201ca defect into the trial, and later claim its benefit.\u201d United States v. Curry, <em>supra, </em>471 F.2d at 422.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>4. <em>Perjury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Hester claims that certain government agents perjured themselves. He clearly relies on the files and records, specifically the transcript of trial and an exhibit he attached to his motion, in order to prove his allegation of perjury. As the district court indicated, while there may have been inconsistencies in the statements of some of the agents, such inconsistencies do not rise to the level of perjury. In this situation no hearing was required. <em>See </em>Rodriguez v. United States, 473 F.2d 1042, 1043 (5th Cir. 1973). More fundamentally, Hester did not allege that the statements were used by the prosecution with knowledge of the falsity. This failure is fatal to Hester\u2019s claim. Derringer v. United States, 441 F.2d 1140, 1142 (8th Cir. 1971); Holt v. United States, 303 F.2d 791, 794 (8th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 970, 83 S.Ct. 1095, 10 L.Ed.2d 132 (1963); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 595 at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The denial of the motion is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-15\">. Hester brought a habeas corpus action, a coram nobis action and a \u00a7 2255 action. The district court considered the allegations raised in the habeas action, and the coram nobis action in terms of a \u00a7 2255 motion. These three filings were considered together by the court in United States v. Hester, 361 F.Supp. 1404 (E.D.Mo.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-28\">. Hester has prosecuted another \u00a7 2255 motion on grounds other than those asserted here. For this Court\u2019s decision affirming the denial of the motion, see United States v. Hester, 72-1748 (8th Cir., March 22, 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">. Normally, irregularities associated with arrest are not cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See, e. g., </em>Williams v. United States, 344 F.2d 264, 265 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 857, 86 S.Ct. 112, 15 L.Ed.2d 95 (1965); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 595 at 607.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">. We note that the transcript, including the poll of the jury, shows no misconduct on the . part of the jurors. Furthermore, the judge who presided over the \u00a7 2255 motion was also the judge who presided over Hester\u2019s criminal trial, and he has not indicated any memory of juror misconduct. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Curry, <em>supra, </em>471 F.2d at 422; United States v. Carter, <em>supra, </em>433 F.2d at 876: \u201cThe conduct of the juror in open court was a matter of which the trial court had judicial knowledge and could take judicial notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
