The third-party complaint, filed January 16, 1973, alleged that if Bulk Food was liable to Addison, then appellant was liable to the same extent to Bulk Food for breaching its warranty of workmanlike performance. Appellant moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that a recent amendment to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq. (1970), precluded its liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>The district court denied the motion, holding that the amendment did not apply retroactively to injuries incurred prior to its effective date, November 26, 1972. 863 F.Supp. 1016. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">As the district court pointed out in its well-reasoned opinion, there were several amendments to the Compensation Act in 1972. Together they effected a comprehensive revision of party rights where a longshoreman is injured while working on shipboard. One part of this revision was the elimination of stevedore indemnity to the shipowner on the theory of breach of a workmanlike performance warranty, the provision at issue here. The amendments further provided for increases in workmen\u2019s compensation benefits payable to the injured longshoreman by his employer, the stevedore, and for abolition of the longshoreman\u2019s right to seek recovery against the shipowner for unseaworthiness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>33 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 905(b), 906(b)-(d), 907(a)-(i), 910(f)-(h) (Supp. II, 1972), <em>amending </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 905-907, 910 (1970); Falletta v. Costa Armatori, 476 F.2d 316, 317 n. 1 (2d Cir. 1973); Bell v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., 363 F.Supp. 156, 159 (M.D.Fla.1973). Thus, the injured longshoreman lost a theory of recovery against the shipowner, previously established in Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946), but gained increased benefits from the stevedore. The shipowner lost the right to seek indemnity from the stevedore, previously established in Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956), but gained freedom from one theory of liability for the longshoreman. The stevedore was obliged to pay increased benefits to the longshoreman but was no longer required to indemnify the shipowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">Our reading of the legislative history, which includes explicit statements on point by congressional sponsors,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> convinces us that this intricate and interdependent revision of party rights was intended to have only prospective effect. Bell v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., <em>supra, </em>363 F.Supp. at 159; <em>see </em>Eskine v. United Barge Co., 484 F.2d 1194, 1196 (5th Cir. 1973); Julian v. Mitsui O. S. K. Lines, Ltd., 479 F.2d 432, 434 (5th Cir. 1973). Indeed, even if the legislative history were silent, where Congress has nullified rights of recovery previously established by Supreme Court precedent we would in any event feel constrained to follow the long standing rule of construction that statutes be given only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>prospective effect unless Congress has unmistakably manifested a contrary intention. Greene v. United States, 376 U.S. 149, 160, 84 S.Ct. 615, 11 L.Ed.2d 576 (1964); Union Pac. R. R. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., 231 U.S. 190, 199, 34 S.Ct. 101, 58 L.Ed. 179 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Finally, the fact that the shipowner in the instant case did not file its third-party complaint against appellant until after the effective date of the 1972 amendments does not detract from the soundness of the district court\u2019s conclusion. The critical date was that of the longshoreman\u2019s injury. It was then that his rights vested against the shipowner and the shipowner\u2019s rights in turn vested against the stevedore. Appellant\u2019s other contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1123-20\">.
