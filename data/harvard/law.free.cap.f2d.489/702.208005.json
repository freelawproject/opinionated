We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-22\">After unsuccessfully challenging his conviction on direct criminal appeal, Marlin v. State, Fla.App.1972, 268 So.2d 548, Marlin filed a habeas petition in the court below raising the same contentions as were rejected by the state court. As grounds for relief, Marlin alleged: (1) he was deprived of a fair trial by certain prejudicial remarks made by the prosecutor during the closing argument, as well as by the trial judge\u2019s refusal to strike the testimony of one witness; and (2) the jury panel from which Marlin\u2019s jury was selected was illegally constituted under the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in State v. Silva, Fla.1972, 259 So.2d 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-23\">Marlin\u2019s first contention does not present error of constitutional magnitude. Bryant v. Caldwell, 5 Cir. 1973, 484 F.2d 65; Buchannon v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-24\">As to the second contention, the district court held that Marlin was precluded from attacking the composition of his jury for failure to timely object to the jury array.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court concluded that under Davis v. United States, 1973, 411 U.S. 233, 93 S.Ct. 1577, 36 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>216, the failure to timely object must be construed as a waiver of any future challenge to the jury selection. We agree. Rivera v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1974, 488 F.2d 275 [No. 73-2982, January 17, 1974].</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-15\">. Counsel for Marlin made an objection to the jury array immediately following its selection. The Florida appellate court found that this did not meet the requirements of Rule 3.300, Fla.Cr.P.R., 33 F.S.A., which requires that the objection be in writing and filed prior to examination, of any prospective juror.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
