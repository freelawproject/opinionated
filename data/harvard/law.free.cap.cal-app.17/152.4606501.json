Subsequently after an interval of several months, defendant returned and demanded of his wife that she give him $250. This she did, on his agreeing to a separation after the Japanese custom, paying the money from her earnings as such prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Whether or not the evidence may be said to support a charge of -conniving at the placing of the wife in a house of prostitution or not, it certainly supports the charge that he permitted her to remain in such house, which is all that is required to support a conviction under the information. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shotwell, </em>27 Cal. 403; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>28 Cal. 507; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>68 Cal. 434, [9 Pac. 457].)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>It is also contended that the character of the house was not sufficiently proved. This is also without merit. Several witnesses, police officers, testified to the general reputation of the premises as being a house of prostitution, and which they described as consisting of the third floor of a certain house containing little rooms, at the door of which gaudily dressed Japanese girls were accustomed to sit, and in which rooms they received the visits of Chinese men. At the entrance to the premises was a sign \u201cNo white men allowed.\u201d During the time the wife of defendant remained in the house there were no other inmates, but during such time she and the keeper, a woman, followed the calling of prostitutes. The character of the house was amply proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">No other points are made for a reversal, and the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Lennon, P.
