First, the evidence had upon the preliminary examination is not authenticated in any manner. Second, while the aggressive acts of defendant were directed toward a third party, they were done in the presence of the officer and so terrorized him that he was prevented from discharging a duty and the effect of which was to resist such officer. As to the other offense of assault with a deadly weapon, it may be, if the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Sylva, </em>143 Cal. 62, [78 Pac. 814], is to be followed as a correct exposition of the law, that upon a final trial it might be held insufficient to warrant a conviction of the exact offense charged, although not of lesser offenses embraced therein. But upon a preliminary hearing, we regard the unauthenticated evidence presented as insufficient, even if authenticated, to warrant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Assuming that reasonable grounds are shown to warrant the magistrate in binding the petitioner over, the bail is n-ot excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">Writ denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
