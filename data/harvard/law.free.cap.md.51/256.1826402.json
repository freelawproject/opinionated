The right acquired is in the nature of an easement in, not a title to a freehold in the land; and such right or easement is limited in duration to the existence of the market, and is to be understood as acquired subject to such changes and modifications in the market during its existence, as the public needs may require. The purchase confers an exclusive right to occupy the particular stalls, with their appendages, for the purposes of the market and none other. If the owner be disturbed in the possession of the stalls, he may maintain case or trespass, according to the nature and circumstances of the injury, against the wrong-doer. But he cannot convert them to any other use than that for which they were sold, and in this use of them he is required to conform to the regulations of the market as prescribed by the ordinances of the city.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b272-6\">In all cases there should be a previous ordinance directing the sales of stalls in public markets in the City of Baltimore, as by the terms of the power contained in Art. 4, of the Public Local Laws, sec. 638, it is contemplated that the judgment and discretion of the Mayor and City Council should be exercised, as to the manner of making the sales and the term for which the stalls should be sold.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b272-7\">In a case where the act done is strictly within the powers of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and could have been authorized to be done in the manner in which it has actually been done, but the corporation has failed to comply with some formality or regulation which it should not have neglected ; in such case, after both parties to the transaction have acted and proceeded as if all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>preliminary formalities and regulations bad been complied with, and rights have attached, the corporation itself could not be heard in a Court of justice to set up, with a view of defeating the rights of the other party with whom it has dealt, that it had neglected to observe some formality or regulation that regularly it should have observed before entering into the transaction. The other party to such a transaction, on the same principle, is equally estopped to deny the validity of the act done.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b273-4\">Appi\u00edal from tbe Circuit Court for Howard County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>instituted in the Superior Court of Baltimore City, by the appellee against the appellant, to recover the amount of certain promissory notes drawn by the appellant in favor of the appellee.

It is clear that the sale made by said Maccubbin is bad. The question arises, is it capable of ratification ? The appellant contends that the sale is a nullity, and an Act of ratification <em>ultra vires. </em>The legislative grant is a special grant, and gives no such power. 1833, <em>ch. </em>35; 1852, <em>eh. </em>30; 1853, <em>ch. </em>260, and <em>Pub. Local </em>Laws, <em>Art. </em>4, <em>sec. </em>638. The exercise of the power to sell by an ordinance <em>subsequent </em>to the sale, is repugnant to the legislative grant. The appellee must be considered, not as a <em>principal, </em>or even <em>quasi </em>principal, but only a political <em>agent </em>of limited powers, and modes of executing them. <em>Rittenhouse vs. Mayor &amp; C.

The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore is authorized to \u201c lease, sell or dispose of the stalls and stands in any market, <em>in any manner, and for any term, </em>they may think proper.\u201d <em>Public Local Laws, Art. </em>4, <em>sec. </em>638.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The same power is specially given in the case of the Richmond market, by the Act of 1852, ch. 30. No general ordinance regulating the manner of such sales has ever been passed. In some few cases special ordinances have been' passed, directing the City Comptroller to sell and dispose of the stalls in particular market houses; but in far the larger number of cases, such sales have been made by officers of the city government, without special ordinance or direction. Such sales have been made in accordance with the long established and well known custom or usage of the city government, and where special ordinances have been passed, they were merely declaratory of such custom or usage. A custom or usage thus established, and which is strictly in accordance with the charter of the corporation has all the force of law, and is binding on all parties.

This is peculiarly a case in which the purchaser must be presumed in law to have acted with full knowledge and notice of the scope and limits of the comptroller\u2019s power and authority whether fixed by special ordinance, or by long established custom and usage of the corporation. <em>Reynold\u2019s Case, </em>20 <em>Md., </em>14; <em>Kirkley\u2019s Case, </em>29 <em>Md., </em>109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-6\">The sale in this case was clearly within the power of the municipal corporation to authorize.

At this.sale, the appellant became the highest bidder for and purchaser of two of the butchers\u2019 stalls offered; the price bid for one being $1,600 and for the other $2,200. In compliance with the terms of sale, he paid the Comptroller in cash, the one-fourth of the purchase money, and gave his six promissory notes for the remaining three-fourths, payable respectively at four, eight and twelve months from their date. At the time of paying the cash and passing the notes, the appellant accepted a receipt from the Comptroller describing the stalls, and stating that the stalls were sold subject to the ordinances that were then existing or that might thereafter be passed by the city, regulating markets. The appellant at once entered into possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>of the stalls, and continued to use and occupy them until sometime in the year 1815. During all this time he paid to the City Comptroller, under the ordinances regulating the markets, the annual rent and license fee required to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">At the trial below several prayers were offered by the appellant, all of which were rejected; but there are only two questions presented for discussion on this appeal. 1. Whether, as contended by the appellant, the appellees sold a larger interest or estate in the stalls than they were authorized by law to sell; and 2. Whether all the necessary preliminary conditions had been complied with to enable the appellees to make a valid sale of the stalls.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">1. It is admitted that the city corporation is seized in fee simple of the Richmond Market; that is to say, the corporation is seized in fee of the ground and the structures thereon; and that such ground was acquired under the Act of 1833, ch. 35, and the supplements thereto, for the purposes of such market and no other. This being the nature of the title held by the city corporation, the power to dispose of the stalls, in that and the other markets of the city, is given by the Public Local Code, Art. 4, sec. 638, which is expressed thus: \u201cThe Mayor and City Council may lease, <em>sell </em>or dispose of the stalls and stands in any market, in any manner, and for any term they may think proper.\u201d And it is now contended, that inasmuch as the sale of the stalls to the appellant was without express limitation as to the duration of the right, it was a sale of the entire freehold interest and estate of the corporation in the stalls, and that, as the corporation was required to <em>hold </em>the ground in trust for the public purposes of a market, such sale was in contravention of that special trust, and therefore it was made without legal authority. In other words, that the corporation has transcended its authority in making the sale of the stalls to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>This contention results, as we think, from a misconception of the nature of the right or estate acquired by the purchase of the stalls. The purchase of these stalls in a public market, like the purchase of a pew in a church, does not confer on the purchaser an absolute property, but a qualified right only. The right acquired is in the nature of an easement in, not a title to, a freehold in the land; and such right or easement is limited in duration to the existence of the market, and is to be understood as acquired subject to such changes and modifications in the market, during its existence, as the public needs may require. The purchase confers an exclusive right to occupy the particular stalls, with their appendages, for the purposes of the market and none other. If the owner be disturbed in the possession of the stalls, he may maintain case or trespass, according to the nature and circumstances of the injury, against the wrong-doer. But he cannot convert them to any other use than that for which they were sold, and in this use of them he is required to conform to the regulations of the market as prescribed by the ordinances of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">This is by analogy to the principles applied in respect to the rights of pew-holders; and, in our opinion, the analogy between those rights and the rights acquired in the stalls is sufficiently exact to make the principles applicable in the one case equally applicable in the other. See <em>Gay vs. </em>Baker, 17 <em>Mass., </em>425; <em>Daniel vs. Wood, </em>1 <em>Pick., </em>102; <em>Howard vs. First Parish, &amp;c., </em>7 <em>Pick., </em>188 ; <em>Jackson vs. Ronnesville, </em>5 <em>Metc., </em>127; <em>Shaw vs. Beveridge, </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>26; <em>Hinde vs. Charlton, L. R., </em>2 <em>C. P., </em>104; <em>Washb. on Eas., (3rd Ed.) </em>636.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">This then being the nature and character of the right disposed of, it is clear, we think, there was no such excess in the estate sold as is supposed by. the appellant. The city had express authority to sell or dispose of the stalls, and that in any manner, and for any term, it might think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>proper. Under tbis comprehensive authority, the sale might well be made as it was, without express limitation as to the duration of the right in the vendee. That is limited by the duration of the market; and while it was perfectly competent to the city to have sold for any shorter term, it was also competent to it to sell the stalls for the entire period of the existence of the market, and that is the effect of the sale to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">2. With respect to the second question, we think there should be no serious doubt. It appears that the sale of the stalls was made without previous ordinance, prescribing the manner of the sale, and for what term the stalls should be sold. It is admitted that some of the stalls in the other markets of the city have been sold without previous ordinance, and that some have been sold under special ordinances directing the sale; so that there has been no uniform practice upon the subject. But it is certainly true that there should be, in all cases, a previous ordinance directing the sales; as by the terms of the power it is contemplated that the judgment and discretion of the Mayor and City Council should be exercised, as to the manner of making the sales, and the term for which the stalls should be sold. However, in a case like the present, where the act done is strictly within the powers of the corporation, and could have been authorized to be done in the manner it has actually been done, but the corporation has failed to comply with some formality or regulation which it should not have neglected, but which has in fact been omitted; in such case, after both parties to the transaction have acted and proceeded as if all preliminary formalities and regulations had been complied with, and rights have attached, the corporation itself could not be heard in a Court of justice to set up, with a view of defeating the rights of the other party with whom it has dealt, that it had neglected to observed some formality or regulation that regularly it should have observed before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>entering into the transaction in question. This principle of estoppel is applicable to corporations generally; <em>Bargate vs. Shortridge, 5 H. L. Cas., </em>297; <em>Zabriskie vs. Clev. Col. &amp; Cin. R. Co., </em>23 <em>How., </em>381; and it is equally applicable to a municipal corporation as to any other. <em>Moran vs. Comm\u2019rs of Miami County, </em>2 <em>Black, </em>722; <em>Pendleton County vs. Avery, </em>13 <em>Wall., </em>298, 305-6; <em>County of Randolph vs. Post, </em>93 <em>U. S., </em>502, 513. If then the city corporation is estopped to question the validity of the sale to the appellant, upon the same principle he is equally estopped to deny the validity of such. sale. He was bound to take notice of the authority and the circumstances under which the City Comptroller acted; and if his rights acquired under the contract of purchase are placed beyond question by the corporation, and he is fully protected and secured therein, there can be no ground for declaring that the notes sued on were without consideration, or that the consideration has failed. The appellant was placed in full possession and enjoyment of the stalls, and he continued in such possession for nearly three years after the sale; and it was from no defect of title, or disturbance on the part' of the city, that he ceased to use the stalls. Under the admitted facts of the case, we think the Court was entirely correct in rejecting all the prayers offered by the appellant, and entering the judgment for the appellees ; and that judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Axl\">(Decided 26th March, 1879.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
