The agent had, in fact, no authority from the defendant to make such an offer. When the plaintiff found a house which suited his requirements and requested the corporation to buy it for him, the president of the . . . corporation'denied that the agent . . . had authority to bind it as he had purported to do and ultimately repudiated the agent\u2019s promise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The plaintiff, relying on <em>Rackemann </em>v. <em>River Bank Improve</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>ment Co. </em>167 Mass. 1, and <em>Dennette </em>v. <em>Boston Securities Co. </em>206 Mass. 401, contends, that the decree granting relief, based on these findings, should be affirmed. But the plaintiff, who is not shown to have been illiterate, or to have paid his money without ample opportunity to read it, is bound by the contract, which constitutes the final agreement of the parties, and cannot be varied by proof of prior representations of the defendant\u2019s agent. <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Burrell, </em>193 Mass. 534, 536. <em>Colonial Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Bragdon, </em>219 Mass. 170. <em>Eastern Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>E.
