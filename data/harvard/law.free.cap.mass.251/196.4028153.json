The trial court having dismissed the cross bill, we are asked to reverse the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The law is plain: \u201c In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the estate of a bankrupt and a creditor the account shall be stated and one debt shall be set off against the other, and the balance only shall be allowed or paid.\u201d U. S. St. 1898, c. 541, \u00a7 68a. See \u00a7 1 (11). <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Wordell, </em>178 Mass. 350, 353. The claim of the trustee established under the original bill rested on Handy\u2019s violation of a fiduciary duty. It was not a debt, nor in the nature of a debt, claim or demand springing from the obligation of an express or implied contract or arising from implication of law. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>3 Met. 522, 526. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Windsor Trust Co. </em>213 N. Y. 27. The terms \u201c mutual debts\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>mutual credits\u201d are correlative, and to authorize a set-off on the record the element of mutuality of obligation between debtor and creditor in the same right is necessary. It is absent, and the decree is affirmed with costs. <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>104 U. S. 303. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>129 U. S. 252. <em>Western Tie &amp; Timber Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>196 U. S. 502. See G. L. c. 232, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
