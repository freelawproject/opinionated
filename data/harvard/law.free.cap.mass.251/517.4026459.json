The jury on the evidence of the plaintiff and his witnesses would have been warranted in finding, that on May 7, 1921, he entered into a contract in writing for the purchase of a new \u201cFive Ton Macear Truck, \u201d which was delivered May 18, 1921, and used in his business as a mover of \u201cbales of cotton and wool.\u201d But after using it, he told the defendant\u2019s president \u201cthat the truck was not running good, that itwas blowing out gaskets and causing . . . trouble every time he took it out.\u201d The reply was \u201cthat every truck was the same way until they were worked out.\u201d It could be found that the motor which was in the truck when it came from the factory had been taken out and a second hand motor installed previous to the sale. The plaintiff sent the truck to the defendant to be repaired, and it appeared on examination that the valves of the motor had been used before the sale, and that a crack running between intake valves raised the block so that the heads would not come down firmly on the gaskets, which caused them to blow out, reducing the motor to one half of its working power. A new block was put in and the valves reground, but after repeated efforts to remedy these defects the plaintiff sold the truck and brought this action in contract for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The rights of the parties depend upon the written contract which expressly abrogates all previous negotiations, and states that \u201cno modifications of this agreement shall be binding upon either party unless ... in writing . . . accepted and agreed to by the Purchaser,\u201d and approved by an executive officer of the company. <em>Will M. Kinnard Co. </em>v. <em>Cutter Tower Co. </em>159 Mass. 391. The material provision, however, is the \u201cguarantee,\u201d whereby the company guarantees all parts of trucks against defective material and workmanship for a period of ninety days from date of delivery \u201cto the extent that they will furnish free of charge, f.o.b. factory, new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>parts in exchange for defective parts provided said defective parts are returned to the factory charges prepaid. This guarantee does not apply to tires, electrical equipment or other accessories not manufactured-by the company, nor to damages nor breakages resulting from wear or tear, accidents or misuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The plaintiff bases his right to recover solely on the ground, that the \"guarantee\u201d constitutes an express warranty. But there is no affirmation nor representation of the quality of the materials or condition of the truck; nor did the defendant promise that it could be satisfactorily operated. If the language implies that parts of the truck when it was used might show defects, the defendant undertook only to furnish free of charge new parts in exchange for defective parts when returned to the factory, charges prepaid, within ninety days from the date of delivery. <em>Henshaw </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>9 Met. 83, 88. <em>Glackin </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>226 Mass. 316. <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Louis K. Liggett Co. </em>243 Mass. 243, 246. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 14. The case of <em>American Locomotive Co. </em>v. <em>National Wholesale Grocery Co. Inc. </em>226 Mass. 314, on which the plaintiff relies, was an action against the buyer for repairs made by the seller to a motor truck purchased under a contract materially different.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The motion for a directed verdict should have been granted, and the exceptions must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
