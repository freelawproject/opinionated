L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 86; c. 139, \u00a7\u00a7 14,15. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>236 Mass. 281. The cases were tried together, and submitted to the jury under instructions to which no exceptions were taken. A verdict of not guilty was returned on the first complaint, but, having been convicted on the second complaint, the defendant moved to set aside the verdict, and that a verdict of not guilty be entered by order of court. He also filed a motion in arrest of judgment. The motions were denied and the case is here on his exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">It is settled, that the two offences are not the same but are separately punishable, and the acquittal or conviction on either complaint is not a bar to a conviction and sentence on the other complaint. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>8 Allen, 548, 550. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>163 Mass. 98, 102. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haddad, </em>251 Mass. 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>It is provided by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 34, that \u201cNo motion in arrest of judgment shall be allowed for a cause existing before verdict, unless it affects the jurisdiction of the court, \u201d and nothing was open to the defendant except matters appearing of record when the motion in arrest of judgment was filed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>150 Mass. 334, 341. The court, however, for reasons just stated, had jurisdiction of the offence charged, and no error of law appearing in the denial of both motions, the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
