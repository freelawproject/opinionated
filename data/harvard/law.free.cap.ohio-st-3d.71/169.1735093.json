Starman </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 578, 615 N.E.2d 344, and with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Licking County in <em>Farley v. Farley </em>(1992), 85 Ohio App.3d 113, 619 N.E.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The issue certified to this court is \u201cwhether a domestic relations court retains jurisdiction to grant visitation rights under R.C. 3109.051 to a \u2018former\u2019 grandparent despite a step-parent adoption under R.C. 3107.15. In other words, what effect, if any, does R.C. 3107.15 have on the provisions of R.C. 3109.051 in the context of a step-parent adoption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed on the authority of <em>In re Martin </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 250, 626 N.E.2d 82, and <em>In re Adoption of Ridenour </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 319, 574 N.E.2d 1055, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated. This court finds no abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b310-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b310-9\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b310-10\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AzZ\">dissenting. This case involves a stepparent adoption where the adoptees, aged seven and five, have enjoyed a long, close relationship with their paternal grandparents. Those grandparents now seek visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">This court should take the opportunity it missed in <em>In re Martin </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 250, 626 N.E.2d 82, to recognize the important public policy reasons for allowing courts to grant visitation rights to grandparents in non-stranger adoption cases where such visitation is in the best interests of the child. This court noted with apparent approval in <em>In re Adoption of Ridenour </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 319, 327, 574 N.E.2d 1055, 1062, that at least five states permit grandparent visitation after a stepparent adoption. Adopted children should not be forced to trade a continuing, loving relationship with grandparents for the stability of an adoptive home. Certainly, in many cases it is in the child\u2019s best interest to have both, and trial courts should have the power to make that determination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
