Limbach </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 3, 20 OBR 76, 484 N.E.2d 691, syllabus, we interpreted similar language contained in R.C. 5733.12, the statute controlling refunds of franchise tax, and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201cThe requirement in R.C. 5733.12 that an application for refund of Ohio corporation tax be filed \u2018within three years of the date of the illegal or erroneous payment of the tax\u2019 takes effect, as to estimated payments of the tax made in compliance with R.C. 5733.021(B), at the time the annual corporation report is timely filed or should have been filed, whichever is earlier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">We reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 5, 20 OBR at 77-78, 484 N.E.2d at 693, that a taxpayer cannot actually determine that it has illegally or erroneously paid the tax until it files its final report. Furthermore, this reading balances the taxpayer\u2019s relief with the commissioner\u2019s power to assess, under R.C. 5733.11, additional taxes, based on errors in the filed report. The commissioner may issue assessments three years from the date the final franchise tax report is filed. Finally, we noted that a corporate taxpayer does not receive a full three-year period to seek a refund if the statute begins to run when it files each estimated tax payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">We rule the same here. R.C. 5747.11 empowers the commissioner to refund illegal, erroneous, or excessive payments of income tax if the taxpayer files an application for refund within four years from the date when a return is timely filed or should have been filed. Thus, Lee had until April 15, 1991, four years from the due date of his 1986 income tax return, R.C. 5747.08(G), to apply for a refund. Since he failed to so apply, the commissioner correctly dismissed his refund application, and the BTA appropriately affirmed the commissioner\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the BTA\u2019s decision because it is reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b713-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
