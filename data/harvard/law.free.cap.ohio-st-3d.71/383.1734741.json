Our decision to hold the majority shareholder of a legal professional association vicariously responsible for the disciplinary offenses of attorneys employed by the association is specifically authorized by Gov.Bar. R. III(3)(C), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">\u201cA breach of * * * [any duty imposed by the Supreme Court Rules for the Government of the Bar or the Code of Professional Responsibility] on the part of the [legal professional] association shall be considered a breach upon the part of the individual participating in the breach and the shareholder, director, and officer having knowledge of the breach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The misconduct committed in this case resulted either from policies imposed by D.U Schultz\u2019s majority shareholder or from her specific instruction. Donna C. Schultz is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years; however, one year of that period is suspended on the condition that she satisfactorily complete one year of supervised probation in accordance with the guidelines stated by the panel\u2019s report. Costs taxed to respondent Schultz.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b526-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
