Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. Alternatively, he seeks a return of the cause to the commission for further consideration and an amended order. We deny both requests and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">Claimant\u2019s challenge rests on the erroneous belief that the commission was bound by Farrell\u2019s vocational assessment. Part of the commission\u2019s authority to weigh and evaluate evidence, however, is the freedom to reject it as unpersuasive. Particularly as to vocational assessments, \u201c[t]o bind the commission to a rehabilitation report\u2019s conclusion makes the rehabilitation division, not the commission, the ultimate evaluator of disability, contrary to <em>[State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946].\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ellis v. McGraw Edison Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 92, 94, 609 N.E.2d 164, 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Preliminary to awarding either of the petitioned remedies herein, there must be a finding of noncompliance with <em>Noll, supra. </em>The adequacy of an order\u2019s reasoning often turns on the consistency between the ultimate decision and the factors cited in support thereof. Where the factors cited, for example, readily suggest claimant\u2019s amenability to re-employment, the length of the commission\u2019s reasoning is generally immaterial, and mandamus relief will be denied. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Hart v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 95, 609 N.E.2d 166. On the other hand, a longer explanation by the commission will not suffice where the factors discussed do not readily coincide with the decision issued, and mandamus relief will be granted. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Soto v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 146, 630 N.E.2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The present explanation meets the <em>Noll </em>requirement. Medically, the claim is allowed exclusively for \u201cbroken left foot.\u201d That injury preceded claimant\u2019s denial of permanent total disability compensation by eight years. His permanent medical impairment was found to be quite low \u2014 ten percent. Equally important, aside from his education, claimant\u2019s nonmedical profile cannot be conclusively characterized as vocationally unfavorable. Claimant was sixty years old when permanent total disability compensation was denied \u2014 an age that need not automatically be considered an impediment to employment. Claimant\u2019s work history is even more conducive to characterization as an employment asset. Despite his tenth grade education, claimant possessed the intelligence to run his own produce business for six years. There is thus \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant \u201chas the intelligence and skills to be rehabilitated/retrained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The appellate judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
