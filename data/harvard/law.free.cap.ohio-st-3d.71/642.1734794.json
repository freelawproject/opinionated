Serv-A-Portion, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 78, 31 OBR 190, 508 N.E.2d 964, syllabus. At issue are the items that fall within the phrase \u201ccost of the deposition.\u201d Claimant\u2019s position rests largely on the misperception that \u201cexpenses\u201d and \u201ccosts\u201d are synonymous. They are not. \u201c \u2018[Cjosts\u2019 are not synonymous with expenses unless expressly made so by statute.\u201d <em>Benda v. Fana </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 259, 263, 39 O.O.2d 410, 413, 227 N.E.2d 197, 201. See, also, <em>Centennial Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 50, 23 O.O.3d 88, 430 N.E.2d 925; <em>State ex rel. Michaels v. Morse </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 599, 607, 60 O.O. 531, 535, 138 N.E.2d 660, 666 (\u201cthe subject of costs is one entirely of statutory allowance and control\u201d). Given former R.C. 4123.519(C)\u2019s language, or lack thereof, claimant must overcome a major hurdle in establishing the reimbursability of expenditures sought. Upon review, we find that claimant does not establish an entitlement to further repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">\n<em>Videotape testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">Dr. Elmer\u2019s deposition was preserved in both stenographic and videotape forms. Commission policy permits reimbursement for only one. The commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>argues that reimbursement for both improperly imposes on the Surplus Fund. The appellate court agreed, writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-4\">\u201c * * * It would be unreasonable to hold that there is any requirement obligating the commission to reimburse for multiple forms of deposition. It is prudent for the commission to use what discretion it has to limit surplus fund spending in a reasonable manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">This result was also suggested in <em>State ex rel. Hakos v. Colasurd </em>(Dec. 28, 1993), Franklin App. No. 92AP-1151, unreported, at 5, 1993 WL 540288, where the court pointed out that \u201ca claimant initially has the option of using a written deposition or videotape. The costs of one of these forms of deposition is reimbursable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">We recognize that the Court of Appeals for Lawrence County reached a different conclusion in <em>Clark v. Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 153, 623 N.E.2d 640. However, given the principle that an expense is not a \u201ccost\u201d unless expressly made so by statute, we favor the reasoning employed by the Franklin County Court of Appeals; because former R.C. 4123.519(C) did not authorize payment for multiple forms of deposition testimony, reimbursement should not be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Claimant also argues that the liberal construction mandate of R.C. 4123.95 dictates dual payment. A liberal construction directive, however, does not empower us to read into a statute something that cannot reasonably be implied from the statute\u2019s language. <em>Szekely v. Young </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 213, 22 O.O.2d 214, 188 N.E.2d 424, paragraph two of the syllabus. Dual payment was, therefore, properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">\n<em>Expert witness fee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Absent statutory directive, an expert witness fee is not a \u201ccost.\u201d <em>In re Election of November 6, 1990 for the Office of Atty. Gen. of Ohio </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 1, 577 N.E.2d 343. See, also, <em>Gold v. Orr Felt Co. </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 214, 21 OBR 228, 487 N.E.2d 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">Former R.C. 4123.519 did not contain the necessary directive. In <em>Perry v. Connor </em>(1983), 8 Ohio App.3d 283, 8 OBR 376, 456 N.E.2d 1340, syllabus, the Franklin County Court of Appeals denied expert witness reimbursement under former R.C. 4123.519(C), writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-11\">\u201cThe \u2018cost of the deposition,\u2019 as that phrase is used in R.C. 4123.519, includes only the stenographic costs, which include the cost of the court reporter attending the deposition and the fee for producing the original and copies that are required, but does not include the cost of the physician\u2019s fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201c * * * To encourage the production of testimony by deposition, R.C. 4123.519 is calculated to relieve claimant from additional charges that are required when testimony is presented by deposition, rather than by a witness in court. Hence, the term \u2018cost of the deposition\u2019 is properly interpreted to mean only costs which are added because a deposition is used. The physician\u2019s fee is applicable in either event.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-6\"><em>Moore v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 259, 18 OBR 314, 480 N.E.2d 1101, does not dictate a contrary result. <em>Moore </em>defined the issue before it as \u201cwhether the \u2018cost of the deposition,\u2019 recoverable by a claimant whose right to participate or to continue to participate in the State Insurance Fund is sustained or established * * * allows * * * recovery for the fee charged by an expert for preparing and giving the deposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 18 OBR at 315, 480 N.E.2d at 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">This is not the question, however, that <em>Moore </em>answered. The majority instead wrote at the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-10\">\u201cPursuant to R.C. 4123.519, a common pleas court may tax to the employer the costs of an expert\u2019s witness fee [for] preparing and giving his deposition as a \u2018cost of any legal proceedings authorized by this section.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">While <em>Moore </em>set out to decide the question under an earlier version of R.C. 4123.519(C), it actually answered it under R.C. 4123.519(E). <em>Moore </em>apparently treated Sections (C) and (E) interchangeably \u2014 an error alluded to in <em>Akers, supra, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 79, 31 OBR at 191-192, 508 N.E.2d at 965, fn. 1. <em>Moore, </em>therefore, does not authorize expert fee reimbursement under former R.C. 4123.519(C). Recovery under former R.C. 4123.519(E), moreover, is impossible, since repayment under that subsection hinges on a claimant\u2019s successful establishment of a right to participate for the condition at issue. Since the claimant in the instant case did not prevail, <em>Moore </em>does not control.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">\n<em>Video replay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">This is not a recoverable \u201ccost of the deposition\u201d according to <em>Hakos, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-14\">\u201c * * * Since R.C. 4123.519 does not specifically mandate that the cost of playing a videotaped deposition be included as surplus fund payment for the cost of a deposition, this court cannot read into the statute additional wording or expand the scope of the statute beyond its literal meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-15\">Further reinforcing this position is <em>Gold, supra, </em>21 Ohio App.3d 214, 21 OBR 228, 487 N.E.2d 347, which suggested that .regardless of the character of litigation, videotape depositions are governed by C.P.Sup.R. 12(D). Section (D)(1) sets forth various expenses associated with videotape depositions and specifies by whom the costs are to be assumed. Section (D)(1)(c) provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201c[t]he expense of playing the videotape recording at trial shall be borne by the court.\u201d As such, reimbursement to claimant is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b786-7\">Moyer, C.J., Wright, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b786-8\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., dissent and would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-13\">. The quoted provision, though reworded, is now found in R.C. 4123.512(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
