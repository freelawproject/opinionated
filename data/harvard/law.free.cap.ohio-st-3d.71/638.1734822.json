At issue is her request for a host of treatment modalities two to three times per week for five to seven weeks. The commission denied authorization of treatment based on the reports of Drs. Greenspan and DuVall. The appellate court found that these reports were not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision. For the reasons to follow, the appellate judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The appellate court erred in finding that the commission order lacked \u201csome evidence.\u201d While the passage of time may have eroded the relevancy of Dr. Greenspan\u2019s observations, the probative value of DuVall\u2019s report remains intact. The passage of time does not change the relevancy of his declaration that claimant\u2019s allowed condition resolved itself years earlier, and that any other discovered conditions were unrelated to that allowed condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">We also disagree with the appellate court\u2019s determination that the commission inherently rejected DuVall\u2019s report by authorizing further treatment. To the contrary, the commission specifically denied further treatment on two occasions. The fact that the commission did not prohibit the self-insured employer from considering the issue later does not constitute an affirmative authorization of treatment. Therefore, Dr. DuVall\u2019s report is not removed from evidentiary consideration by <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87, and is \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">We also note that claimant\u2019s own doctor, Dr. Foughty, does nothing to negate Dr. DuVall\u2019s opinion that any back problems that claimant has are caused by arthritis and disc disease \u2014 nonallowed conditions. To the contrary, Dr. Foughty\u2019s August 21, 1991 report strongly suggests that he is treating her solely for arthritis. At no point in his reports does he ever state that claimant\u2019s treatment is related to her allowed sprain. While his November 1991 report indicates that treatment is for an \u201cexacerbation of her original injury,\u201d he is careful to avoid saying that it is an \u201cexacerbation of her allowed conditions.\u201d Under these facts, we find this to be an important distinction, since Dr. Foughty feels claimant\u2019s arthritis arose from her muscle sprain. However, the possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>causal relationship between claimant\u2019s arthritis and her industrial injury is irrelevant unless and until claimant seeks to have arthritis included in her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ-\">Accordingly, the judgment of the appellate court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b782-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
