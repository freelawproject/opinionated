(See Appendix, <em>infra.) </em>We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law and have reviewed the death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality. Upon review, and for the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and uphold the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">R.C. 2929.05 requires this court to review capital cases in a certain manner. However, the statute does not require that we address and discuss, in opinion form, every proposition of law raised by the parties. <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 520 N.E.2d 568, 570; <em>State v. Bonnell </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 179, 181, 573 N.E.2d 1082, 1085; and <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1993), 66; Ohio St.3d 339, 342, 612 N.E.2d 1227, 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Here, appellant presents a number of arguments which have previously been addressed by this court, and which have been resolved in a manner unfavorable to appellant. Many of the matters raised by appellant merit no discussion given the events at trial and the governing law. Moreover, a number of appellant\u2019s arguments have been waived, since appellant failed to preserve the alleged errors at either the trial court or appellate level. Upon review of appellant\u2019s propositions of law, we fail to detect any errors that would undermine our confidence in the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial. We address in detail only those issues that merit some discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Appellant\u2019s trial commenced on October 12, 1990. On October 26, 1990, the prosecutor provided appellant with a fingerprint analysis report concerning fingerprints that had been lifted from appellant\u2019s Buiek in February 1989. On November 1,1990, the state called Everett Justice, a fingerprint expert, to testify for the prosecution. Appellant objected to Justice\u2019s proposed testimony on the basis that the state had not provided appellant with a fingerprint analysis report before trial. Appellant requested that the trial court preclude Justice from testifying regarding the fingerprint evidence. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection and permitted Justice to testify. Appellant never requested a continuance to prepare for Justice\u2019s testimony or to conduct an independent fingerprint analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Additionally, appellant was not specifically informed before trial that Dr. Robin Cotton, the state\u2019s DNA expert, would be called to testify at trial concerning DNA frequency estimates. Several months before trial, appellant had been provided with the state\u2019s DNA report matching appellant\u2019s blood to the blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>found on the victim. However, a DNA frequency report had not been prepared until after trial commenced. At trial, Cotton testified that appellant\u2019s blood matched the blood samples found on the victim\u2019s body and clothing. She testified further that the statistical frequency with which appellant\u2019s DNA banding pattern appears in the Caucasian and African-American populations is one in 280,000 and one in 1.3 million, respectively. Appellant did not object to Cotton\u2019s testimony concerning DNA frequency estimates until well after Cotton had testified on direct and cross-examination. Appellant never requested a continuance with respect to the DNA frequency statistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Similarly, appellant was not informed before trial that Robert Young, the state\u2019s expert in blood splatter and bloodstain interpretation, would be called to testify for the prosecution. Indeed, Young was not contacted to analyze the photographic evidence taken at the crime scene until after trial commenced. At trial, appellant sought to bar Young from testifying because, among other reasons, the state had not notified appellant of this expert prior to trial. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objections. Following a lengthy voir dire of the witness, appellant requested a forty-eight-hour continuance to prepare for Young\u2019s trial testimony. Appellant was granted a continuance in excess of forty-eight hours. Thereafter, Young was permitted to testify as an expert in blood splatter interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In his first proposition of law, appellant claims that he was deprived of a fair trial because the prosecutor violated the rules of discovery by failing to notify appellant before trial that the state would present expert witnesses concerning blood splatter and fingerprint evidence, and expert testimony concerning DNA frequency estimates. Appellant suggests that the state engaged in \u201ctrial by ambush\u201d and that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to exclude the testimony of the state\u2019s \u201csurprise\u201d witnesses. We reject appellant\u2019s arguments for two reasons. First, appellant did not raise these issues in the court of appeals. Thus, his arguments have been waived. Second, appellant has failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the witnesses to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Crim.R. 16(E)(3) provides for the regulation of discovery in a criminal case and permits a trial court to exercise discretion in determining the appropriate sanction for a discovery violation. <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 78, 571 N.E.2d 97, 110; <em>State v. Parson </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 442, 445, 6 OBR 485, 487, 453 N.E.2d 689, 691; and <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 31, 42, 3 O.O.3d 18, 24, 358 N.E.2d 1051, 1059. Crim.R. 16(E)(3) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201cIf at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We have held that where a prosecutor violates Crim.R. 16 by failing to provide the name of a witness, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in allowing the witness to testify where the record fails to disclose (1) a willful violation of the rule, (2) that foreknowledge would have benefited the accused in the preparation of his or her defense, or (3) that the accused was unfairly prejudiced. <em>State v. Heinish </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 231, 553 N.E.2d 1026, syllabus. See, also, <em>Wiles, supra, </em>59 Ohio St.3d 71, 79, 571 N.E.2d 97, 110; and <em>Parson, supra, </em>6 Ohio St.3d 442, 6 OBR 485, 453 N.E.2d 689, syllabus. The same tripartite test applies for determining whether a trial court has abused its discretion in admitting other evidence that was not properly disclosed under Crim.R. 16. See, generally, <em>Parson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In the case at bar, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony of the various witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">First, we are convinced that the prosecutor did not willfully violate Crim.R. 16. A review of the record reveals that the state prepared its case late and inadvertently failed to have a fingerprint analysis completed before trial. Upon discovery of that mistake, a fingerprint examiner was immediately contacted by the prosecution. A fingerprint analysis report was provided to the defense the day it was written. The state\u2019s blood splatter evidence became available under similar circumstances. Further, we find that the state\u2019s failure to provide DNA frequency estimates before trial was also due to an inadvertent mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Second, we do not believe that foreknowledge would have aided appellant in the preparation of his defense. As to Dr. Cotton\u2019s testimony, defense counsel knew months before trial that DNA evidence would be forthcoming, and counsel must have known that frequency statistics are an integral part of DNA evidence. By April 1990, appellant had the prosecution\u2019s DNA report (but not a frequency report) and his own DNA experts were testing samples and presumably working on DNA frequency statistics. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that appellant was unduly surprised by Cotton\u2019s testimony or the contents of the state\u2019s DNA frequency report. Nor are we convinced that prior knowledge of the names of the fingerprint and blood splatter experts would have aided appellant in preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Third, appellant has failed to show that he was unfairly prejudiced by the admission of the testimony of the various experts. Appellant requested a continuance to prepare for Young\u2019s trial testimony concerning blood splatter analysis. The continuance was granted and was of sufficient duration to permit defense counsel to prepare for cross-examination. Further, appellant never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>requested a continuance to prepare for the DNA and fingerprint evidence even though a continuance would have been sufficient to rectify any claimed harm. Under these circumstances, the trial court could have properly determined that appellant was prepared to go forward. See <em>Edwards, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.2d 31, 42-43, 3 O.O.3d 18, 24-25, 358 N.E.2d 1051, 1060. Thus, no prejudice occurred. See <em>Wiles, supra, </em>59 Ohio St.3d 71, 80, 571 N.E.2d 97, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Contrary' to appellant\u2019s contentions, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony of the various witnesses. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">During discovery, appellant moved for the pretrial release of all statements made by Muncy and Dempsey, apparently claiming a right to the statements under Crim.R. 16(B)(l)(a)(i) through (iii)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (B)(1)(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied appellant\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">In his second proposition of law, appellant suggests that he was entitled to the statements of Muncy \u00e1nd Dempsey prior to trial. We disagree. Muncy and Dempsey were not \u201cco-defendants\u201d and, thus, appellant was not entitled to pretrial release of their statements under Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(a). See <em>State v. Wickline </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 118, 552 N.E.2d 913, 918; and <em>State v. Lane </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 77, 3 O.O.3d 45, 358 N.E.2d 1081, paragraph two of the syllabus. Nor was appellant entitled to <em>pretrial </em>release of the statements under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g), which governs the procedure for release of a witness\u2019s inconsistent prior written or recorded statements <em>after </em>the witness has testified on direct examination at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In his second and twenty-fourth propositions of law, appellant also contends that Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) was violated when the trial court denied him access to various summaries by police detectives of their interviews with particular witnesses. Specifically, following the direct examination of several witnesses, the trial court reviewed the applicable summaries and determined that the summaries did not constitute prior \u201cstatements\u201d made by the -witnesses. Therefore, the trial court found that appellant was not entitled to the summaries under the provisions of Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g). We find no reversible error in this regard. We assume that the trial court was perfectly capable of determining what constitutes a <em>witness\u2019s </em>\u201cstatement\u201d under Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g). Further, the summaries are not included in the record before this court. In this regard, we note that appellant neither requested that the summaries be included in the record nor objected when the summaries were not preserved in the record for purposes of appellate review. Thus, appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice, and none will be presumed. See, generally, <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 226, 15 OBR 311, 364-365, 473 N.E.2d 264, 316-317.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In his second proposition of law, appellant also suggests that the prosecutor improperly attempted to exonerate Muncy and Dempsey as alternative suspects in the murder, bolstered their credibility at trial, and thereby deprived appellant of the opportunity to effectively argue that Muncy and Dempsey.were responsible for the crimes. However, we find that the facts of record, the evidence at trial, and even appellant\u2019s own initial statements to police exonerated Muncy and Dempsey from any involvement in these crimes. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, the record in this case does not implicate anyone but appellant in the aggravated murder of Tina.'</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s second and twenty-fourth propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">At trial, Muncy was asked on cross-examination whether police had.instructed him prior to trial not to speak with anyone from appellant\u2019s defense team. Muncy indicated that he had been so instructed and, in fact, had refused to speak with defense investigator Tami Wall. Later, on redirect examination, Muncy testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\">\u201cQ. Mr. Schneider [appellant\u2019s trial counsel] asked you about Detective Morris telling you not to talk to anybody about this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201cQ. Do you remember what that was in relation to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\u201cA. He said don\u2019t talk to the media, friends or family. So I just \u2014 to the best of my knowledge, I assumed that was everyone, anybody who didn\u2019t have anything to do with the detective bureau.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\u201cQ. Did he explain that that would \u2014 that was because, if you talked, it might hurt their investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201cQ. Now, when Tami Wall [the defense investigator] came out, did she come out to your house? Where did she come and talk to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">\u201cA. To my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">\u201cQ. Did she inform you she was working for Kevin Scudder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-13\">\u201cQ. Did she tell you that in fact because you were a potential witness, you had no obligation at all to talk to her if you chose not to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-15\">\u201cQ. You exercised that right, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-16\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-17\">In his third proposition of law, appellant contends that the state instructed Muncy not to speak with defense counsel and thereby impeded appellant\u2019s ability to adequately prepare for trial. Appellant did not raise this issue in the court of appeals. Thus, the issue has been waived. Additionally, a review of the record demonstrates that appellant\u2019s argument lacks merit. Muncy was never specifically instructed not to speak with the defense. Further, appellant\u2019s defense investigator instructed Muncy that Muncy was not required to speak with her. Muncy apparently chose to exercise that option \u2014 and he had every right to do so. See <em>State v. Zeh </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 99, 31 OBR 263, 509 N.E.2d 414, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-18\">We find that the state did not impede appellant\u2019s access to the witness. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-19\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b412-20\">At trial, appellant\u2019s wallet was admitted into evidence without objection. The wallet contained numerous items that had not been individually admitted into evidence. Items within the wallet included a prison identification card, numerous business cards, a handwritten letter or notation that someone had heard that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>appellant was \u201cgoing to get into trouble for rape,\u201d and a document indicating that appellant had been on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In his twenty-fifth proposition of law, appellant claims that the contents of the wallet should have been removed before it was submitted to the jury. Appellant suggests that he was unfairly prejudiced because the contents of the wallet may have been considered by the jury during deliberations. The court of appeals rejected appellant\u2019s contentions, stating the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u201cDefendant made no objection to admission of the wallet into evidence even though it was obvious that the wallet contained a large quantity of paper, most of which was obviously harmless. The evidence against defendant was overwhelming and, while the contents of the wallet should not have been sent to the jury, that fact alone in all probability did not sway the jury, even if the jury looked through the contents and were aware of the harmful parts. This .situation does not lend itself to the plain error doctrine under Crim.R. 52(B). Plain error should only be recognized \u2018under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91 [7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus]. No such circumstances exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00ab \u2021 \u2021</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u201cThe failure to extract the contents of defendant\u2019s wallet presents a situation similar to that of * * * <em>[State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, and <em>State v. Spirko </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 1, 570 N.E.2d 229]. There was no objection as in <em>Bradley. </em>The inclusion was not intentional and was missed by both parties as in <em>Spirko. </em>There is no indication that the jury actually reviewed the contents of the wallet and the only witness who testified regarding the wallet said only that it contained \u2018papers.\u2019 The inferences defendant assumes that the jury made from the two or three inflammatory items contained in the plethora of papers stored in his wallet are purely speculative and, therefore, the inadvertent inclusion did not constitute reversible error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">We agree with the court of appeals\u2019 assessment of this issue. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s twenty-fifth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">In his thirty-first through thirty-third propositions of law, appellant claims that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel throughout the trial and appellate proceedings. In considering appellant\u2019s arguments, we find that appellant has failed to meet his burden of establishing ineffective assistance under the standards set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Therefore, we reject appellant\u2019s thirty-first, thirty-second and thirty-third propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In his thirty-fifth proposition of law, appellant contends that the evidence was not sufficient to establish his identity as the perpetrator of the crimes. Appellant\u2019s argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In the case at bar, appellant had a knife and desperately wanted to be alone with Tina. Appellant and Tina left Dempsey\u2019s home on February 7, 1989, at approximately 3:15 a.m. Approximately one hour later, appellant was covered with blood and was seen throwing an object (perhaps the murder weapon) into a trash dumpster. The object made a noise as it hit the dumpster. Appellant stood in a parking lot for approximately ten minutes before hysterically claiming that he had been shot and that someone was after him. During this period, appellant had apparently concocted a story to explain Tina\u2019s disappearance and to insulate himself from suspicion. That story proved to be utterly false. The evidence, if accepted, clearly established that Tina was attacked in the front seat of appellant\u2019s Buick, dragged out the driver\u2019s side, forcibly undressed, and stabbed to death while lying on the ground near the driver\u2019s side of appellant\u2019s vehicle. DNA evidence linked appellant to the killing. Evidence was also presented which, if believed, established that Tina was killed with a knife similar to the one appellant possessed on the night of the murder. Further, a broken stick found at the murder scene matched a wood chip recovered from the underbody of appellant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Upon a thorough review of the record, we find that the direct and circumstantial evidence in this case, and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom, was more than sufficient to establish appellant\u2019s identity as the perpetrator of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Appellant also contends that the state failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that appellant purposely killed Tina. However, the number and nature of Tina\u2019s stab wounds clearly established appellant\u2019s purpose to kill. Further, the jury could have reasonably concluded that appellant had the mental capacity to form a purpose to kill Tina despite what appellant may have had to drink or smoke on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Additionally, appellant suggests that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of attempted rape. We disagree. Appellant\u2019s sexual interest in Tina was apparent. The evidence indicated that appellant desperately wanted to be alone with Tina. Tina was found with her pants at her ankles and her panties at midthigh. The evidence indicated that Tina had been forcibly undressed. The killer had apparently raked his fingers over Tina\u2019s stomach and downward toward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the pubic region. Bloody hand marks were found on Tina\u2019s thighs, indicating that the killer had tried to force Tina\u2019s legs apart. Appellant\u2019s blood was found on Tina\u2019s body and clothing. A drop of appellant\u2019s blood had apparently dripped onto Tina\u2019s face while she was still alive, and while appellant was standing directly above her. This evidence was clearly sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that appellant attempted to rape Tina.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s thirty-fifth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Having considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law, we must now review the death sentence for appropriateness (also raised in appellant\u2019s ninth proposition of law) and proportionality. Appellant stabbed Tina to death during the commission of a kidnapping and an attempted rape. Again, we find that the aggravating circumstances for which appellant was found guilty (both of which are set forth in R.C. 2929.04[A][7]) were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"ALK\">In mitigation, appellant offered some evidence on the mitigating factor that he lacked a substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law because of a mental disease or defect. Dr. Henry Leland, a psychologist who examined appellant, testified that appellant has an \u201c[ojrganically caused psychosis with an atypical or mixed organic brain syndrome associated with opioid dependency and a severe personality disorder.\u201d Leland concluded that appellant had an organic brain disorder and severe personality disorder exacerbated by years of alcohol and drug abuse. Leland testified that appellant has difficulty making moral decisions and cannot distinguish between fact and fantasy.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">However, on cross-examination, Leland admitted that he had not reviewed all of appellant\u2019s institutional or medical records and had not given appellant the most sophisticated psychological diagnostic tests. Further, appellant was not given a magnetic resonance imaging test, which would have been helpful in determining whether appellant suffered from organic brain damage. Additionally, Leland admitted that he does not use the standard American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic Manual in his diagnoses.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">We find that appellant failed to establish the existence of the mitigating factor that he lacked a substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law due to a mental disease or defect. See R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). We find no credible evidence that appellant suffered from organic brain damage. However, we assign Leland\u2019s testimony concerning appellant\u2019s history and background some weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">During the mitigation hearing, Patricia A. Southward testified that she had been a school psychologist while appellant attended grade school. Southward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>testified that while in grade school, appellant had suffered from a learning disability and behavioral problems. Paula Richmond, a certified teacher for learning-disabled children, testified that appellant progressed remarkably in the fifth and sixth grades while he received specialized, intensive instruction. During this period, appellant learned to control his behavior despite a learning disability. We assign this evidence little or no weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Appellant also presented evidence that he had suffered a broken leg and other injuries in 1982 while working as a narcotics informant with the Circleville Police Department. Thereafter, appellant continued to suffer from medical problems associated with his injuries. In September 1988, appellant\u2019s left leg was surgically amputated above the knee. Apparently, the amputation was necessitated, in part, by appellant\u2019s failure to follow the medical advice of his doctors. We assign these matters little or no weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Appellant also made an unsworn statement in which he expressed sympathy for Tina\u2019s family. In his unsworn statement, appellant claimed that he had worked for several law enforcement agencies throughout the state. Appellant claimed that he has helped others cope with amputations. Appellant requested that the jury spare his life. We assign these matters very little weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Appellant claims that this court should also consider \u201cresidual doubt\u201d and \u201cthe participation of others in the crime,\u201d as additional mitigating factors. However, we have no doubt of appellant\u2019s guilt, and no credible evidence exists to implicate anyone but appellant in the aggravated murder of Tina. Thus, we find that these matters are entitled to no weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Weighing the aggravating circumstances against the evidence presented in mitigation, we find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">As our final task, we have undertaken a comparison of the sentence in this case to those in which we have previously imposed the death penalty. We have upheld the death penalty in cases involving kidnapping-murder (see, <em>e.g., State v. Brewer </em>[1990], 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 549 N.E.2d 491; <em>State v. Seiber </em>[1990], 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 564 N.E.2d 408; <em>State v. Jells </em>[1990], 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 559 N.E.2d 464; and <em>State v. Morales </em>[1987], 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 513 N.E.2d 267) and in cases involving murder during the commission of an attempted rape (see, <em>e.g., State v. Powell </em>[1990], 49 Ohio St.3d 255, 552 N.E.2d 191). Appellant\u2019s death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Moyer, C.J., A.W.
