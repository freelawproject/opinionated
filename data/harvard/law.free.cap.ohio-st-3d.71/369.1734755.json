William Sweeney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1q3x\">Both the commissioner and the BTA found, pursuant to R.C. 5727.06 as amended in 1982, that <em>all </em>of United Telephone\u2019s tangible personal property \u201cowned and located in this state\u201d was subject to personal property tax, including property not \u201cused in business.\u201d The BTA held that amendments resulting from the enactment of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 201, effective December 31, 1982, removed any former requirement that a public utility\u2019s personal property must be \u201cused in business\u201d to be taxable. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">R.C. 5709.01 establishes' the general principle that all personal property located and \u201cused in business\u201d in Ohio is taxable unless expressly exempted. The statute provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201c(B) Except as provided by division (C) of this section or otherwise expressly exempted from taxation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">\u201c(1) All personal property <em>located and used in business </em>in this state * * * [is] subject to taxation regardless of the residence of the owners thereof.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">In <em>Hatchadorian v. Lindley </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 66, 68, 21 OBR 365, 367, 488 N.E.2d 145, 147, we noted that property that is not \u201cused in business\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 5701.08 is properly excludable from personal property tax. Thus, while R.C. 5709.01 establishes the rule that personal property \u201cused in business\u201d is subject to personal property tax, we have recognized that the statutes establish a corollary rule that tangible personal property <em>not </em>\u201cused in business\u201d is not taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">R.C. Chapter 5727 codifies laws governing the taxation of public utilities such as the appellant herein, United Telephone. Prior to 1982, R.C.. 5727.06 provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">\u201cThe property owned or operated by a public utility required to make a return to the tax commissioner of its property to be assessed for taxation by the commissioner shall include such utility\u2019s plant, all real estate owned by the public utility <em>and all other property, </em>including that mentioned in section 5709.02 of the Revised Code, owned or operated by it wholly or in part within this state, <em>used in connection with or as incidental to the operation of the public utility, </em>where the same is held in common or by the individuals operating such public utility. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) (133 Ohio Laws, Part III, 2525-2526.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The descriptive phrase \u201cused in connection with or as incidental to the operation of\u2019 was removed from R.C. 5727.06 by enactment of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 201. During the tax years in question, the amended statute provided substantially as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, the taxable property of a public utility required to be assessed by the tax commissioner is each kind of property mentioned in section 5709.02 of the Revised Code and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201c(A) In the case of a railroad, all real property and tangible personal property owned or operated in this state * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201c(B) In the case of all other public utilities except freight line and equipment companies, <em>all tangible personal property owned and located in this state </em>on the thirty-first day of December of the preceding year.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (139 Ohio Laws, Part I, 2054.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The commissioner argues that R.C. 5709.01 is a general statute which contradicts former R.C. 5727.06, a special statute. The commissioner contends that former R.C. 5727.06 should be deemed to prevail over R.C. 5709.01, and that all\u2019 of United Telephone\u2019s personal property \u201cowned and located in this state\u201d should be subject to tax irrespective of whether that property is \u201cused in business.\u201d However, R.C. 1.51 directs us to first construe conflicting statutory provisions, where possible, to give effect to both. Only where the conflict is deemed irreconcilable does R.C. 1.51 mandate that one provision shall prevail over the other. We have judicially recognized similar rules of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYq\">\u201cFirst, all statutes which relate to the same general subject matter must be read <em>in pari materia. </em>See <em>Maxfield v. Brooks </em>(1924), 110 Ohio St. 566, 144 N.E. 725; <em>State, ex rel. Bigelow, v. Butterfield </em>(1936) 132 Ohio St. 5, 6 O.O. 490, 4 N.E.2d 142. And, in reading such statutes <em>in pari materia, </em>and construing them together, this court must give such a reasonable construction as to give the proper force and effect to each and all such statutes. <em>Maxfield v. Brooks, supra. </em>The interpretation and application of statutes must be viewed in a manner to carry out the legislative intent of the sections. See <em>Benjamin v. Columbus </em>(1957), 104 Ohio App. 293, 4 O.O.2d 439, 148 N.E.2d 695, affirmed (1957), 167 Ohio St. 103, 4 O.O.2d 113, 146 N.E.2d 854; <em>In re Hesse </em>(1915), 93 Ohio St. 230, 112 N.E. 511. All provisions of the Revised Code bearing upon the same subject matter should be construed harmoniously. <em>State v. Glass </em>(1971), 27 Ohio App.2d 214, 56 O.O.2d 391, 273 N.E.2d 893; <em>State v. Hollenbacher </em>(1920), 101 Ohio St. 478, 129 N.E. 702. This court in the interpretation of related and co-existing statutes must harmonize and give full application to all such statutes unless they are irreconcilable and in hopeless conflict. <em>Couts v. Rose </em>(1950), 152 Ohio St. 458, 40 O.O. 482, 90 N.E.2d 139.\u201d <em>Johnson\u2019s Markets, Inc. v. New Carlisle Dept. of Health </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 28, 35, 567 N.E.2d 1018, 1025.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Applying these principles to the case at bar, we note that former R.C. 5727.06 does not expressly exempt public utilities from the mandate of R.C. 5709.01 (\u201cExcept as * * * otherwise expressly exempted from taxation: <em>[ajll </em>personal property <em>located and used in business </em>in this state * * * [is] subject to taxation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>[Emphasis added.]). Nor does former R.C. 5727.06 describe tangible property owned by a utility and located as \u201csubject to taxation\u201d as does R.C. 5709.01. The legislature\u2019s expressed purpose in enacting Am.Sub.H.B. No. 201 was to amend existing law so as \u201cto require county auditors, instead of the Tax Commissioner, to assess the real property of all public utilities except railroads.\u201d (139 Ohio Laws 2043.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consistent with these rules of statutory interpretation, we conclude that the General Assembly removed the phrase \u201cused in connection with * * * the operation of\u2019 a public utility in amending R.C. 5727.06 in 1982 because it found that language superfluous in light of the \u201cused in business\u201d requirement set forth in R.C. 5709.01. Our conclusion is reinforced by the legislature\u2019s inclusion of the introductory phrase \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by law\u201d in the amended version of R.C. 5727.06. We thus do not read former R.C. 5727.06 as removing the \u201cused in business\u201d requirement established in R.C. 5709.01. This construction harmonizes and gives effect to both sections, as we are bound to do when possible. United Telephone was not required to pay personal property tax on property not \u201cused in business.\u201d We therefore hold that tangible personal property owned by a public utility telephone company which is not \u201cused in business\u201d is not subject to personal property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Having determined that personal property not \u201cused in business\u201d by the taxpayer is not taxable, we hold that the decision of the BTA is unreasonable and unlawful, and we reverse and remand this cause to the BTA for further proceedings to determine whether the dead and bad pairs and fiber at issue were \u201cused in business.\u201d In so doing, the BTA should apply R.C. 5701.08 in accordance with the principles set forth in <em>Hatchadorian, supra, </em>and <em>Dayton Press, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 101, 537 N.E.2d 219, which we today affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\n<em>Decision reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b513-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b513-7\">Resnick, J., concurs in the syllabus and judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\">. Prior to these 1982 amendments, the county auditor was the designated assessor of all real estate in the county except that owned by public utilities (both railroads and other utilities).
