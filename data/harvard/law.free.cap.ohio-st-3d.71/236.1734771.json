Only matters going to claimant\u2019s right to participate or continue to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system are appealable under R.C. 4123.519. <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175. Claimant\u2019s right to participate in this case, however, is secondary to the question of the commission\u2019s jurisdiction to address the compensability of the disputed conditions. This is a question properly raised in mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Saunders v. Metal Container Corp. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 85, 556 N.E.2d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">PPG\u2019s medical challenge is more complex and has two elements: Did the commission abuse its discretion (1) in \u201cclarifying\u201d the original allowed condition or (2) in specifically denying other back conditions?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In certifying the claim, PPG recognized \u201cacute back strain\u201d as an allowed condition. The disputed order states that the \u201callowance of this claim is clarified to only include the condition of \u2018chronic lumbosacral strain.\u2019 \u201d This language is susceptible to different interpretations, leaving us uncertain as to whether the commission retained or deleted \u201cacute back strain\u201d as an allowed condition. On the one hand, the reference to \u201conly\u201d suggests that the commission substituted \u201cchronic lumbosacral strain\u201d for \u201cacute back strain.\u201d On the other hand, the commission, by using the term \u201cinclude,\u201d may have retained the original condition and additionally allowed the lumbosacral condition. Clarification of this aspect of the commission\u2019s order is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Addressing those conditions that the commission specifically denied, two questions again arise: (1) Was continuing jurisdiction necessary to effect the disallowance? and (2) If so, was the commission\u2019s exercise of continuing jurisdiction proper?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">PPG maintains that R.C. 4123.515 empowered the commission to disallow certain conditions, making it unnecessary to resort to R.C. 4123.52\u2019s continuing jurisdiction authorization. We disagree. R.C. 4123.52 permits the commission to examine issues that are otherwise final and make substantive changes. This is precisely the type of jurisdiction necessary to make changes to a matter ostensibly resolved earlier \u2014 for example, the conditions arising from the claimant\u2019s industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Continuing jurisdiction, therefore, underlies questions of specific disallowance of a given condition. Continuing jurisdiction, however, may not be exercised indiscriminately. The appellate court\u2019s opinion implied that the commission lacked continuing jurisdiction to alter the claim\u2019s original allowance, since the claimant did not make a formal request to add the disputed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">We agree with the appellate court\u2019s conclusion. While we disagree with the suggestion that a request for additional allowance can be accomplished only by an express motion by the claimant, we find that a bare reference to medical conditions, as here, in a physician\u2019s correspondence or medical test summary does not constitute a request for recognition of that condition by a claimant. Because fibrosis with bulging annulus, stenosis, and degenerative disc disease were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>referenced exclusively in these types of documents, the commission erred in disallowing them at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The commission also denied \u201cherniated intervertebral disc.\u201d We again find that the commission abused its discretion, but for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Reference to a \u201cpossible herniated intervertebral disc\u201d appeared on claimant\u2019s physician fee bill. Given our holding in <em>State ex rel. Baker Material Handling Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 202, 631 N.E.2d 138, we do not view this reference as benignly as the references to the other nonallowed medical conditions. <em>Baker </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201cA self-insured employer who, subsequent to the initial allowance of a workers\u2019 compensation claim, certifies a medical condition as allowed on a \u2018Self Insured Semi-Annual Report of Claim Payments\u2019 (form C-174) has conclusively granted that additional condition as part of the claim.\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraph one of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Forms C-174 document to the commission the fee bills that have been paid. If a fee bill lists a nonallowed condition and the self-insured employer pays that bill, a subsequent enumeration of that condition on the C-174 constitutes an additional allowance of that condition. Thus, since <em>Baker, </em>fee bills that contain nonallowed conditions can be, albeit indirectly, a claimant\u2019s request for additional allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">In this instance, however, the reference in Dr. Johnson\u2019s fee bill to herniated intervertebral disc was qualified by the term \u201cpossible.\u201d We find, therefore, that the denial of a condition, the existence of which has not yet been alleged by the claimant, was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">For these reasons, we affirm those portions of the appellate judgment that: (1) found mandamus to be the appropriate remedy and (2) found an abuse of discretion by the commission in disallowing the disputed conditions. The appellate court\u2019s determination that the Industrial Commission abused its discretion in clarifying the originally allowed condition, however, is premature, given the commission\u2019s ambiguous order. Accordingly, that portion of the appellate court\u2019s judgment is reversed and the cause is returned to the commission for clarification and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-12\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
