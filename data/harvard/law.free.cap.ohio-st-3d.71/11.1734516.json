AT&amp;T contends that the function of the ASRS is to coordinate the delivery of materials to the rest of the production facility and that the primary use of the ASRS is for interplant or intraplant transfers of tangible personal property in the process of production for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The ASRS is a computer-operated complex of machinery and equipment occupying about thirty thousand square feet of floor space, with fourteen aisles containing storage bins stacked three stories high. The ASRS handles approximately sixty thousand different component parts, some of which are manufactured at the Columbus plant. Of the balance of components, about fifty percent are manufactured at other AT&amp;T plants and fifty percent by outside vendors. These component parts are stored in the ASRS, for periods varying from an hour to several weeks, until needed for assembly into finished products.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In response to a customer\u2019s order for an electronic switching system product, ASRS pulls the necessary parts and transports them to an assembly area. Computer-operated cranes in each aisle select component parts from storage bins and move them to an assembly area. As a witness for AT&amp;T stated, the ASRS \u201cregulates and times the movement of the cranes and the proceedings of the entire operation so they all come together at one centralized point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">AT&amp;T and the commissioner disagree about the proper focus on the primary use of equipment: whether it pivots on the nature of use, or the quantity of use. There is also a factual dispute over the percentage of components which are manufactured by AT&amp;T, compared with those purchased from outside suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Former R.C. 5739.02(B)(16) exempted from taxation sales to (or use by) persons engaged in manufacturing or processing \u201cof handling and transportation equipment * * * used in intraplant or interplant transfers or shipments of tangible personal property in the process of production for sale by manufacturing [or] processing * * *, where the plant or plants within or between which such transfers or shipments occur are operated by the same person.\u201d Am.S.B. No. 231, 140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 790, 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The BTA rejected AT&amp;T\u2019s contention that former R.C. 5739.02(B)(16) granted exemption from tax because the BTA could not determine whether a majority of the parts had come from other AT&amp;T facilities. However, the record shows that the ASRS was used in transporting manufactured components which were assembled into a finished product, and for no other purpose. Some percentage of these components was manufactured by AT&amp;T either in Columbus or at one of its other locations; thus, the plants between which these transfers were made were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201coperated by the same person.\u201d See <em>White Motors Corp. v. Kosydar </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 290, 296, 4 O.O.3d 451, 454, 364 N.E.2d 252, 255. Sales of handling equipment used to make such transfers are exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Where an item\u2019s exemption depends on its use, its primary use is the criterion. <em>Mead Corp. v. Glander </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 539, 42 O.O. 24, 93 N.E.2d 19. Under the second branch of the syllabus of <em>Ace Steel Baling, Inc. v. Porterfield </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 137, 48 O.O.2d 169, 249 N.E.2d 892, primary use is a qualitative consideration, not a quantitative one. We said in <em>Ace Steel Baling </em>at 140-141, 48 O.O.2d at 171, 249 N.E.2d at 895: \u201c \u2018[PJrimary use\u2019 is not merely the quotient of the time that a device is utilized in a taxable, <em>vis-a-vis </em>a nontaxable, activity. \u2018Primary use\u2019 connotes primacy in utility or essentiality, in quality as well as quantity. The value of the tool to the product is as important as the time the tool is engaged in fashioning the product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The record supports AT&amp;T\u2019s contention that the ASRS functioned in a capacity essential to AT&amp;T\u2019s manufacturing and processing of its saleable products. Whether AT&amp;T\u2019s use of the manufactured components produced by AT&amp;T constituted fifty percent or less, or more than fifty percent, is of little consequence. <em>Id. </em>In the manufacture of its products this use of the ASRS was primary. See <em>SFZ Transp., Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 602, 613 N.E.2d 1037. This decision of the BTA is unreasonable and unlawful and it is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The commissioner\u2019s cross-appeal deals with a narrow issue. She asserts that the BTA erred in excepting the HSTE based upon the BTA\u2019s finding that the HSTE was an adjunct under former R.C. 5739.01(E)(2) and 5739.01(R), and that the BTA erred in failing to find that the HSTE was used prior to the beginning of manufacturing. Rather, the commissioner contends that because the HSTE was not used within the manufacturing period, it is not entitled to an exemption from sales or use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">We agree. When items for the HSTE were purchased in 1985, R.C. 5739.01(E) and (R) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">\u201c(E) \u2018Retail sale\u2019 and \u2018sales at retail\u2019 include all sales except those in which the purpose of the consumer is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\"><em>(( </em>;{* }{5 iH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">\u201c(2) * * * to use or consume the thing transferred directly in the production of tangible personal property * * * for sale by manufacturing [or] processing ^ ^ I**</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">\u201c(R) \u2018Manufacturing\u2019 or \u2018processing\u2019 means the transformation or conversion of material or things into a different state or form from that in which they originally existed and, for the purpose of the exceptions contained in division (E)(2) of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>section, includes the adjuncts used during and in, and necessary to carry on and continue, production to complete a product at the same location after such transforming or converting has commenced.\u201d Sub.S.B. No. 112, 140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 225, 228-229, 232.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We have applied this standard many times. As we said in <em>Ball Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 474, at 478, 584 N.E.2d 679, at 682-683:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201cThe test for determining the exemption from taxation of equipment by reason of its status as adjunct under former R.C. 5739.01(S), later codified at (R), is: \u2018 * * * as announced in <em>Canton Malleable Iron Co. [v. Porterfield </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 163, 176-177, 59 O.O.2d 178, 185, 283 N.E.2d 434, 442] * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cSubsection (S) demands that the thing sought to be excepted from taxation be (1) an adjunct, (2) used at the same location, and (3) used after the transforming or conversion has commenced. Subsection (E)(2) adds the additional requirement that the thing be adjunct to <em>direct </em>use or consumption. * * * \u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>* * *\u2019 <em>Bird &amp; Son [Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1989) ], <em>supra, </em>45 Ohio St.3d [76] at 82, 543 N.E.2d [1161] at 1167.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Upon receipt at AT&amp;T\u2019s Columbus plant, the HSTE tests integrated circuits to locate any defects prior to their introduction into the manufacture of finished products. The HSTE is used before \u201cthe transforming or conversion has commenced\u201d; it is not \u201cadjunct to direct use or consumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The BTA found that the testing performed by the HSTE is exempt even though it occurred prior to the beginning of the manufacturing process. \u2022 The BTA found the HSTE was used \u201cimplicitly\u201d in an exempt fashion under former R.C. 5739.01(E)(2) and (R). The General Assembly did not authorize such an expansion of the express exception from taxation and the BTA\u2019s usurpation was unreasonable and unlawful. The BTA\u2019s decision as to the HSTE is reversed. Cf. <em>Jeep Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 67, 68, 547 N.E.2d 975, 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">As to the statutory penalty, we affirm the decision of the BTA. In <em>Jennings &amp; Churella Constr. Co. v. Lindley </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 67, 10 OBR 357, 461 N.E.2d 897, as in this case, the appellant argued that it had established a record of compliance with the tax laws. However, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">\u201cThe imposition of a penalty is mandatory; extraneous matters such as past tax records are only considerations in the remission decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 10 OBR at 360, 70, 461 N.E.2d at 900.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Frankelite Co. v. Lindley </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 29, 31, 28 OBR 90, 92, 502 N.E.2d 213, 215, where we upheld the BTA\u2019s determination that the commissioner had not abused his discretion in failing to remit the penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201cThe remission of a penalty under this provision is discretionary with the Tax Commissioner and cannot be reversed by the Board of Tax Appeals unless an abuse of discretion is demonstrated. <em>Interstate Motor Freight Sys. v. Bowers </em>(1960), 170 Ohio St. 483, 485 [11 O.O.2d 240, 241, 166 N.E.2d 229, 231]. In that case the court held that it was unlawful, for the Board of Tax Appeals to order the remission of a penalty where it had not made a specific finding that the Tax Commissioner had abused his discretion. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cThe scope of our review of board decisions, however, as set forth in R.C. 5717.04, is limited to a determination of whether the board\u2019s decision is unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The finding of the BTA that the commissioner had not abused her discretion is not unreasonable or unlawful, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the BTA is reversed in part and affirmed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\n<em>Decision reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-9\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
