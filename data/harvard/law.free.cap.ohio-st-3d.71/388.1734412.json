Gammarino never disputed that he had filed two complaints within the same interim period, and in his second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>complaint, he failed to assert the applicability of any of the circumstances enumerated in R.C. 5715.19(A)(2)(a) through (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Therefore, the BTA erred in failing to grant the auditor\u2019s motion to dismiss Gammarino\u2019s appeal on the basis that a complaint for the first year of the same triennium had already been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The decision of the BTA refusing to dismiss the complaint and requiring the board of revision to make a determination as to the value of the subject property is unreasonable and unlawful and it is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b530-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
