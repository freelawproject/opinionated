Corrigan v. Haberek </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 150, 518 N.E.2d 1206. Fiorenzo concedes that he has been found guilty of several felonies, including theft in office. However, Fiorenzo contends that the instant action is \u201cpremature since he has never been sentenced\u201d and his motion for new trial has not been ruled upon. Watkins contends that R.C. 2921.41(C)(1) requires only a finding of guilt and not a concomitant sentence in order to invoke the permanent disqualification sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Fiorenzo relies on <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 171, 12 O.O.3d 177, 389 N.E.2d 494, for the proposition that the word \u201cconvicted\u201d as used in R.C. 2921.41(C)(1) includes both the guilt determination and the imposition of sentence. In <em>Henderson, </em>at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus, we held that a defendant who has pled guilty but is awaiting sentencing for a theft offense has not been previously convicted of a \u201ctheft offense\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2913.02(B), and that in order to constitute a prior theft conviction, there must be a \u201cjudgment of conviction,\u201d as defined in Crim.R. 32(B), for the prior offense. Crim.R. 32(B) provides that a \u201cjudgment of conviction shall set forth the plea, the verdict or findings, and the sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\"><em>Henderson </em>recognizes that the term \u201cconviction\u201d normally includes both the finding of guilt and the sentence. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 218, 222, 594 N.E.2d 595, 599; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 5, 520 N.E.2d 568, 572; cf. <em>State v. Cash </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 116, 532 N.E.2d 111, syllabus. However, the language of R.C. 2921.41(C)(1) specifies permanent disqualification from, <em>inter alia, </em>any public office in this state if the public official is either \u201cconvicted of <em>or pleads guilty to, </em>theft in office.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Unlike in R.C. 2913.02(B), the General Assembly placed \u201cconvicted\u201d on equal footing with a guilty plea in R.C. 2921.41(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Thus, the plain language of R.C. 2921.41(C)(1) requires only a plea of guilty to invoke the sanction of permanent disqualification. Therefore, we believe the word \u201cconvicted\u201d as used in R.C. 2921.41(C)(1) logically refers only to a determination of guilt and does not include sentencing upon that determination. The Court of Appeals for Auglaize County in <em>In re Forfeiture of One 1986 Buick Somerset Auto. </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 558, 562-563, 632 N.E.2d 1351, 1353-1354, reached a similar conclusion in construing the phrase \u201cpleads guilty to or is convicted\u201d of R.C. 2933.43(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Moreover, the public interest is best served by precluding the possibility of further illegal activities when an official has either been adjudicated guilty or pled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>guilty to theft in office but is awaiting sentencing. Therefore, Fiorenzo was disqualified from his position as Trumbull County Engineer when he was adjudicated guilty of theft in office in November 1994. Similarly, R.C. 2921.41(C)(1) does not specify that a pending motion for a new trial must be ruled upon in order for the disqualification upon conviction or guilty plea to become effective. Given the interest in a speedy resolution of this case, see R.C. 2733.39, we allow a peremptory writ of quo warranto removing Fiorenzo from the position of Trumbull County Engineer forthwith. Fiorenzo\u2019s motion to dismiss is overruled, and Watkins\u2019s motion to expedite is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-6\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
