Upon review, we find Walther\u2019s arguments to be unpersuasive and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">After finding that the commission\u2019s first permanent total disability order violated <em>Noll, supra, </em>the appellate court vacated the order and directed the commission \u201cto enter an order which complies with <em>Noll </em>* * *.\u201d Because the entry did not expressly instruct the commission to rehear claimant\u2019s application, Walther claims that the commission erred in doing so. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">As to the argument that recomposition of the commission can form the basis for a new hearing, Walther correctly observes that a commissioner need not attend the permanent total disability hearing in order to participate in the decision. <em>State ex rel. Ormet Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 102, 561 N.E.2d 920. Due process requires only that the absentee commissioner \u201cin some meaningful manner\u201d consider the evidence presented. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 561 N.E.2d at 925. <em>Ormet, </em>however, does not prohibit rehearing, nor does <em>State ex rel. Rodriguez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 210, 616 N.E.2d 929, on which Walther heavily relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\"><em>Rodriguez </em>ruled that the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction ceased upon the filing of a complaint in mandamus. There, the claimant challenged the commission\u2019s denial of permanent total disability compensation, but before the appellate court could issue its decision, the commission <em>sua sponte </em>vacated its order and issued a new, more extensive order' denying compensation. <em>Rodriguez </em>declared' that the latter act was an abuse of discretion, reasoning that, as -with an appeal, the commission lost all jurisdiction once judicial proceedings began.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Unlike <em>Rodriguez, </em>this case does not involve continuing jurisdiction. The second order in this instance was entered, not <em>sua sponte, </em>but pursuant to court order. Equally important, given the commission\u2019s recomposition, the commission did not abuse its discretion in concluding that fairness to <em>all </em>parties would be best served by a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Walther also challenges the medical evidence on which the commission relied. The reports of Drs. Dinkin, Louis, Patil, Dillahunt and Burton were before the commission at the initial hearing. The permanent total disability award that resulted was \u201cbased particularly\u201d upon Dr. Burton\u2019s report. Confronted -with the same evidence at the second hearing, the commission chose to rely instead on the reports of Drs. Dinkin, Patil and Dillahunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Walther argues that in originally relying on Dr. Burton\u2019s report, the commission inherently rejected the other medical reports in evidence. Citing <em>State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87, Walther argues that such inherent rejection precluded the commission from relying on those reports later.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">This position, however, ignores the changes in commission membership that preceded and precipitated the second hearing. Walther\u2019s argument, if adopted, would deprive some commissioners, but not others, of the ability to consider all evidence relevant to claimant\u2019s permanent total disability application. This result is unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Walther\u2019s final argument centers on claimant\u2019s nonindustrial health problems. Permanent total disability cannot be based, wholly or partially, on nonallowed conditions. <em>State ex rel. Fields v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 437, 613 N.E.2d 230. On the other hand, permanent total disability is not barred by the mere presence of disabling nonallowed conditions, so long as the allowed conditions, in and of themselves, also prevent sustained remunerative employment. <em>State ex rel. Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 619 N.E.2d 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Claimant\u2019s nonallowed conditions undisputedly render him unemployable. Walther alleges that the commission\u2019s permanent total disability award was based in part on those conditions. We disagree with Walther\u2019s interpretation of the commission\u2019s order. Viewing the order as a whole, we are persuaded that the commission\u2019s reference to claimant\u2019s nonallowed conditions was simply an acknowledgement of its awareness of those conditions and not an inclusion of those conditions as part of the basis for finding permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">For these reasons, the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-9\">A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b248-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b248-11\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AG2\">dissenting. I believe the Industrial Commission\u2019s discussion of claimant\u2019s nonallowed conditions is so unclear that the correct course of action is to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and return the cause to the commission for the issuance of a clarification and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">By stating that the finding and award were based upon the reports of Drs. Dinkin, Patil, and Dillahunt, the commission obviously addressed the allowed conditions. However, the additional language in the report, to which the majority alluded, makes it unclear as to whether the claimant\u2019s nonallowed conditions served as a basis for the commission\u2019s finding of permanent total disability or whether the commission merely acknowledged its awareness of these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-14\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
