In addition, William Fink, a vocational expert, determined that appellant was not a viable candidate for rehabilitative services. Dr. Katz, however, reached a contrary conclusion and, in his report, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\">\u201cOPINION: I feel this represents a lumbosacral myofascitis secondary to the fall in January 1985. The tests * * * showed that there was no compression of nerve roots according to the lumbar myelogram. There are no objective findings and there is a large amount of functional overlay. * * * I do not consider this patient to be permanently and totally disabled <em>[sic </em>] from gainful employment. I feel he is able to work at his former position of employment at least from an orthopaedic [sic ] standpoint. I feel he is entitled' to a permanent partial impairment of * * * (fifty percent) of the body as a whole. Possibly psychiatric evaluation would be indicated because of the element of functional overlay and the fact that there are no objective findings by examination and tests reported on his medical records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Without question, the commission\u2019s decision, denying appellant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation, was premised <em>exclusively </em>on Dr. Katz\u2019s assessment of appellant\u2019s condition. Thus, the question before this court is whether Dr. Katz\u2019s report was \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision. For the reasons that follow, we answer this question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">Recently, in <em>State ex rel. Lopez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 445, 633 N.E.2d 528, this court considered the evidentiary sufficiency of a medical report on which the commission relied in denying a claimant permanent total disability compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The report at issue in <em>Lopez </em>also involved the same doctor at issue here, Dr. Katz. In fact, the report in <em>Lopez </em>was substantively identical to the report in the present situation in that Dr. Katz found no objective findings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>concluded that the claimant could return to heavy labor, and then, however, assessed a fifty percent permanent partial impairment. We rejected Dr. Katz\u2019s report in <em>Lopez, </em>reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">\u201cKatz\u2019s report, however, while unequivocal, is so internally inconsistent that it cannot be \u2018some evidence\u2019 supporting the commission\u2019s decision. Despite \u2018normal\u2019 physical findings, Katz assessed a high (fifty percent) degree of impairment. He then, however, concluded that claimant could perform heavy foundry labor. Being unable to reconcile these seeming contradictions, we find that the report is not \u2018some evidence\u2019 on which to predicate a denial of permanent total disability compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 633 N.E.2d at 531-532.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Clearly, Dr. Katz\u2019s report in the present situation contains the same infirmities as those contained in his report in <em>Lopez. </em>Thus, consistent with our findings in <em>Lopez, </em>we find that Dr. Katz\u2019s report in the case at bar cannot, as a matter of law, be \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Granted, the lack of \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting denial of permanent total disability compensation does not automatically equate into \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting an award. <em>State ex rel. Wilcox v. Ashtabula Cty. Hwy. Dept. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 190, 192, 593 N.E.2d 1390, 1391. However, here, the <em>remaining </em>medical evidence is overwhelming, and it unequivocally constitutes \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting an award for permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we grant relief consistent with <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and a writ of mandamus is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and unit allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b725-10\">Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A8y\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-12\">. We recognize that the court of appeals did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>State ex rel. Lopez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 445, 633 N.E.2d 528.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
