Insofar as appellant\u2019s memorandum is in support of jurisdiction over a claimed appeal as of right and in support of a motion for leave to appeal a decision under App.R. 26(A), we dismiss the appeal as not involving a substantial constitutional question and deny leave to appeal. Insofar as the memorandum attempts to appeal the question of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel under App.R. 26(B), the decision of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-6\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
