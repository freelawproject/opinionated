While we agree with the two-year suspension and conditions recommended by the board, we stay only one year of said suspension, and thereafter place respondent on a one-year monitored probation. The conditions, as recommended by the board, shall apply during the full two-year suspension and probationary period. If respondent violates any of the conditions outlined by the board during the period of his probation, the two-year term of suspension will be automatically reimposed.
