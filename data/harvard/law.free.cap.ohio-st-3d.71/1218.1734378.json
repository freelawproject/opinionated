I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision that this case was improvidently allowed. This case could have defined a property owner\u2019s due process rights in instances where a political subdivision determines that the owner\u2019s property is a nuisance and that immediate demolition is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-16\">On October 8, 1989, a commercial building owned by appellant Donald Bram was damaged by fire. On October 10, 1989, a city engineer assessed the building\u2019s condition, and on October 12, 1989, a city-hired contractor began demolition of the building. Bram did not receive notice that the city intended to demolish his building until the building had been razed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-17\">The <em>city </em>ordered the demolition pursuant to Cleveland Codified Ordinance 3103.09(f), which allows for demolition in emergency situations. That section imposes no duty to notify the property owner prior to demolition.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-18\">I would have held that the ordinance violates property owners\u2019 constitutional rights to due process. While a full-blown hearing is not possible due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>emergency safety concerns, the ordinance at least should require that the city make a good faith attempt to notify the property owner of its intent to demolish the structure prior to the actual demolition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
