This court further ordered respondent by October 8, 1993, to pay board costs and to file evidence with the court of having made restitution consistent with the court\u2019s opinion. On November 17, 1993, this court granted respondent until May 17, 1994, to pay board costs in full, including all accrued interest, and to file evidence with this court demonstrating that he made all required restitution. This court further ordered that if by May 17, 1994, respondent did not pay board costs, including all accrued interest, and did not file evidence demonstrating that he had made all required restitution, he would be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law until such time as costs were paid and evidence of having made restitution was filed with this court. On May 17, 1994, respondent submitted $2,103.75 for payment toward board costs, but did not file evidence with this court demonstrating that he made all required restitution.

Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, effective November 21, 1994, that the disciplinary sanction issued by this court against James C. Young, Attorney Registration No. 0034227, last known address in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 8, 1993, be reinstated and that accordingly, respondent\u2019s one-year suspension is suspended and he is placed on two years of probation, effective as of September 8,1993, consistent with the court\u2019s September 8, 1993 opinion and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that upon successful completion of the probationary period, respondent shall apply for termination of probation pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(9), and that the probation shall not be terminated until this court orders respondent\u2019s probation terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent shall keep the Clerk, Disciplinary Counsel, relator, and the monitoring attorney advised of any change of address where respondent may receive communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this court issue certified copies of this order as provided for in Gov.Bar R.
