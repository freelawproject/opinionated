For the reasons that follow, we find no <em>reversible </em>error with respect to any of the issues raised in this appeal and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. We address appellant\u2019s propositions of law <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">In his first proposition of law, appellant challenges his convictions, claiming that the trial court erred in permitting Timmons-Mitchell to offer her expert opinion that Randy and Christopher suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. We reject appellant\u2019s proposition for two reasons. First, appellant\u2019s arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>in support of the proposition have been waived because he failed to raise the alleged errors at the trial court level. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 288-289, 533 N.E.2d 682, 695-696; and <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 62, 552 N.E.2d 894, 899. Second, even considering the merits of appellant\u2019s contentions, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Timmons-Mitchell to testify that the children suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Appellant contends that Timmons-Mitchell lacked sufficient qualifications to testify as an expert concerning post-traumatic stress disorder in children. We disagree. The record reflects that Timmons-Mitchell, a licensed clinical psychologist, had extensive education and experience in evaluating children who were victims of sexual or physical abuse. In addition, Timmons-Mitchell is an assistant professor of psychology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and director of the child abuse treatment programs in the Division of Child Psychiatry at University Hospitals. She has evaluated and treated hundreds of children, testified as an expert witness in at least fifteen cases, and published various articles regarding children, including an article relating to post-traumatic stress disorder. Clearly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in recognizing Timmons-Mitchell as an expert in her field based upon her knowledge, skill, education, experience and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Appellant also contends that post-traumatic stress disorder in children is not a proper subject for expert testimony. Specifically, appellant claims that \u201cWhere is no evidence that post-tr\u00e1umatic stress in children has been accepted by the scientific community.\u201d Again, we disagree. \u201cPost-traumatic stress disorder\u201d is specifically identified in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\u201cDSM-III-R\u201d) (3 Ed.Rev.1987) 247-251, Section 309.89. The disorder is essentially the development of various characteristic symptoms<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> following the exposure to a \u201cpsychological distressing event that is outside the range of usual human experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247. The event causing the disorder may include rape and assault. <em>Id. </em>at 248. Most notably, the disorder is not age-specific. It can afflict <em>adults and\u25a0 children. Id. </em>at 249. Accordingly, we are convinced that post-traumatic stress disorder in children has gained sufficient recognition in the psychiatric profession to be considered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>proper subject for expert testimony. Our conclusion is supported by the decisions of a number of courts which have, before us, considered the specific issue or have been confronted with an analogous situation. See, <em>e.g., State v. Hall </em>(1992), 330 N.C. 808, 818-823, 412 S.E.2d 883, 888-891. See, also, <em>State v. Vorisek </em>(May 11, 1988), Summit App. No. 13334, unreported, 1988 WL 49422; <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson </em>(1994), 417 Mass. 536, 631 N.E.2d 50; and <em>State v. Fasy </em>(Colo.1992), 829 P.2d 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Additionally, it is well settled that expert testimony is admissible if it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence in the case or in determining a fact in issue. <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 118, 545 N.E.2d 1220, 1231. Such testimony must be beyond the common knowledge of the jurors. <em>State v. Koss </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 213, 216, 551 N.E.2d 970, 973. See, also, <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 131, 22 OBR 203, 209, 489 N.E.2d 795, 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Here, a review of the record reveals that Timmons-Mitchell\u2019s testimony was admissible under Evid.R. 702.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Timmons-Mitchell testified that her function was not to determine whether the children had been sexually abused. Rather, Timmons-Mitchell examined the children to assess whether they had suffered any psychological trauma as a result of the alleged abuse. At trial, TimmonsMitchell described various relevant symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, explained that many of the symptoms had been exhibited by the children, testified that the children suffered from this disorder and stated that such a diagnosis is widely applied to children who have been sexually abused. The expert testimony was clearly relevant and helpful in assisting the jury to understand the children\u2019s behavior. Additionally, the expert testimony provided information to the jury that was \u201c \u2018 \u201csufficiently beyond common experience.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Buell, supra, </em>at 131, 22 OBR at 209, 489 N.E.2d at 803. We specifically reject appellant\u2019s argument that the evidence should have been excluded under Evid.R. 403.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Accordingly, we find that appellant\u2019s first proposition of law lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On August 29,1990, police conducted a search of appellant\u2019s residence. During the search, Patrolman Lawrence Brazie heard appellant either say \u201cMy life is over\u201d or \u201cMy life is ruined.\u201d At trial, the.state called Brazie to testify regarding appellant\u2019s statement. Appellant objected on grounds that, during discovery, the state had failed to provide the defense with a written summary of appellant\u2019s oral statement. The trial court permitted the parties to voir dire Brazie. On voirdire examination, Brazie testified that he had met with defense counsel approximately two months before trial and had <em>verbally </em>informed the defense of appellant\u2019s pretrial statement. On the basis of this testimony, the trial court permitted Brazie to testify as to the statement made by appellant during the August 29, 1990 search.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In his second proposition of law, appellant claims that the state violated the criminal rules of discovery by failing to provide the defense with a written summary of appellant\u2019s oral statement. Appellant suggests that the trial court committed reversible error in permitting Brazie to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">\u201cUpon motion of the defendant, the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph any of the following which are available to, or within the possession, custody, or control of the state, the existence of which is known or by the exercise of due diligence may become known to the prosecuting attorney:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\"><em>CC </em># <em>% </em>\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">\u201c(ii) Written summaries of any oral statement, or copies thereof, made by the defendant or co-defendant to a prosecuting attorney or any law enforcement officer[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The record is clear that the state violated Crim.R. 16(B)(l)(a)(ii) by failing to provide defense counsel with a <em>written summary </em>of appellant\u2019s oral statement. At trial, an assistant prosecuting attorney, Melody A. White, explained to the court that no written summary had been provided to the defense during discovery because the defense had been verbally informed of appellant\u2019s statement to Brazie. In this regard, White argued that the \u201cspirit of the law had been fulfilled.\u201d She stated, \u201cwhy should I reduce something to writing for mere technicality for information he [appellant\u2019s defense attorney] already has notice of * * *[?]\u201d She stated further, \u201c[s]hould I have reduced this to writing? Absolutely. I personally try to do things to not waste my time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Contrary to White\u2019s assertions, the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d was not fulfilled by anything less than strict adherence to the rule. As White correctly recognized, Crim.R. 16(B)(l)(a)(ii) <em>required </em>that she reduce the statement to writing, in the form of a summary, to be provided to the defense during discovery. Obviously, we did not draft the criminal rules of discovery to waste anyone\u2019s time. Rather, we specifically drafted the rules to ensure the fairness of criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Having determined that the criminal rules of discovery were violated, we must now examine whether the trial court erred in allowing Brazie to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Crim.R. 16(E)(3) provides for the regulation of discovery and permits a trial court to exercise discretion in selecting the appropriate sanction for a discovery violation. See <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 78, 571 N.E.2d 97, 110; <em>State v. Parson </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 442, 445, 6 OBR 485, 487, 453 N.E.2d 689, 691; and <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 31, 42, 3 O.O.3d 18, 24, 358 N.E.2d 1051, 1059. Crim.R. 16(E)(3) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u201cIf at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">In <em>Parson, supra, </em>at the syllabus, this court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">\u201cWhere, in a criminal trial, the prosecution fails to comply with Crim.R. 16(B)(l)(a)(ii) by informing the accused of an oral statement made by a co-defendant to a law enforcement officer, and the record does not demonstrate (1) that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16, (2) that foreknowledge of the statement would have benefited the accused in the preparation of his defense, or (3) that the accused was prejudiced by admission of the statement, the trial court does not abuse its discretion under Crim.R. 16(E)(3) by permitting such evidence to be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Applying <em>Parson </em>to the case at bar, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Brazie to testify as to the oral statement made by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">First, we are not persuaded that the assistant prosecutor <em>willfully </em>violated Crim.R. 16. The trial court found that the defense had been verbally notified of the statement in question approximately two months prior to trial. Apparently, the assistant prosecutor assumed that the verbal notification had satisfied her obligations under Crim.R. 16(B)(l)(a)(ii). Although the assistant prosecutor\u2019s assumption was clearly erroneous, that assumption does not automatically equate with a willful violation of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Second, we are in no position to second-guess the trial court\u2019s determination that defense counsel had been verbally notified of appellant\u2019s statement to Brazie. While the defense was entitled to a written summary of the statement, the record does not reflect that a written summary would have benefited appellant in the preparation of his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Third, appellant never requested a continuance to prepare for Brazie\u2019s trial testimony. Under these circumstances, the trial court may have properly determined that appellant was prepared to proceed despite any claim of unfair \u201csurprise.\u201d Thus, no prejudice has been shown.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">In this proposition, appellant also claims that because Brazie could not specifically recall which statement appellant had made (either \u201cMy life is over\u201d or \u201cMy life is ruined\u201d), the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Appellant argues that \u201c[tjhere is a tremendous difference between whether the appellant said \u2018my life is over\u2019 or \u2018my life is ruined.\u2019 The statement \u2018my life is over\u2019 connotes a strong suggestion that he is admitting guilt in that his offense was discovered. \u2018My life is ruined,\u2019 on the other hand, might indicate that the charges themselves could very easily ruin his life, whether or not they were true.\u201d Therefore, appellant contends that the evidence should have been excluded under Evid.R. 403(A). We disagree. The fact that Brazie could not recall which of the statements was made by appellant affected the credibility \u2014 not the admissibility \u2014 of Brazie\u2019s testimony. Whether appellant said \u201cMy life is over\u201d or \u201cMy life is ruined\u201d made little difference. The jury could reasonably have concluded that either version of the statement indicated con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>sciousness of guilt. Similarly, the jury could reasonably have concluded that either statement pertained to the effect of the charges on appellant\u2019s life. The weight to be given Brazie\u2019s testimony was clearly a matter for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Appellant\u2019s third proposition of law concerns the recorded telephone conversations that were used to impeach the credibility of two defense witnesses. The facts relevant to this proposition are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The Crippens and Bidinosts were neighbors. The Bidinosts owned a cordless telephone. Keith and Maria Crippen owned an electronic baby monitor which they used to monitor their children. The transmitting part of the baby monitor was located in Nicole\u2019s bedroom and the receiving part was kept in the Crippens\u2019 bedroom. The day following appellant\u2019s arrest, Christopher and Randy Crippen were playing with the baby monitor. When the boys unplugged the transmitting device in Nicole\u2019s bedroom, the receiver in the Crippens\u2019 bedroom began receiving the Bidinosts\u2019 cordless telephone conversations. Only the voices of those speaking into the Bidinosts\u2019 cordless telephone handset could be heard over the monitor. The voices of those to whom the Bidinosts were speaking could not be overheard. Maria Crippen contacted police and a prosecuting attorney, and was instructed by them to record any subsequent conversations received over the baby monitor. In accordance with these instructions, Maria recorded the Bidinosts\u2019 cordless telephone communications. In October 1990, she turned the tapes over to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">In December 1990, appellant filed a motion to suppress the \u201cintercepted oral communications.\u201d On August 5, 1991, the trial court conducted a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion. At the hearing, John P. Wykoff, who worked on transmission devices, testified concerning the technical operations of cordless telephones. Wykoff explained that when a person speaks into the handset of a cordless phone, an FM signal is transmitted into the air through the antenna located on the handset. The radio transmission from the handset is then received by the base unit which, in turn, is connected with the telephone line. The testimony at the hearing indicated that when the transmitting unit of the Crippens\u2019 baby monitor became unplugged, the receiving unit of the monitor began intercepting radio signals from the Bidinosts\u2019 cordless telephone handset.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. The court held that a person who uses a cordless telephone \u201cdoes so at his own peril,\u201d and that there was no necessity for the state to secure a warrant to monitor \u201cradio communications * * * open to everyone who had * * * FM receiving equipment.\u201d The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>In his third proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the contents of the recorded telephone conversations. Appellant contends that R.C. 2933.52 prohibited the interception and taping of the conversations, and that R.C. 2933.63<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> required that the contents of the intercepted communications be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Appellant\u2019s contentions present this court with an issue of first impression involving the rights of Ohioans to be free from unauthorized invasions of their cordless telephone communications. R.C. 2933.52(A) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u201c(A) <em>No person purposely shall do any of the following:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">\u201c(1) <em>Intercept, </em>attempt to intercept, or procure any other person to intercept or attempt to intercept <em>any wire or oral communication;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">\u201c(2) Use, attempt to use, or procure any other person to use or attempt to use any interception device to intercept any wire or oral communication, if either of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">\u201c(a) The interception device is affixed to, or otherwise transmits a signal through, a wire, cable, satellite, microwave, or other similar method of connection used in wire communications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">\u201c(b) The interception device transmits communications by radio, or interferes with the transmission of communications by radio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">\u201c(3) Disclose, or attempt- to disclose, to any other person the contents, or any other evidence derived from the contents, of any wire or oral communication, knowing or having reason to know that the contents, or evidence derived from the contents, was obtained through the interception of the -wire or oral communication in violation of sections 2933.51 to 2933.66 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>With certain exceptions not pertinent here, R.C. 2933.52(A) prohibits a person from purposely intercepting a wire or oral communication.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Maria Crippen overheard and recorded cordless telephone conversations to which she was not a party through the use of her electronic baby monitor device. She did so at the urging of the police and prosecutor, who did not attempt to obtain an interception warrant. Obviously, the monitoring of the conversations was <em>purposely </em>done. Thus, R.C. 2933.52(A) prohibited this conduct if the act of monitoring the cordless telephone conversations constitutes an \u201cinterception\u201d of \u201cwire communication[s]\u201d or \u201coral communication[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">R.C. 2933.51(A) defines \u201cwire communication\u201d as \u201cany communication that is made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wires or similar methods of connecting the point of origin of the communication and the point of reception of the communication.\u201d Division (B) of the statute defines \u201coral communication\u201d as \u201cany human speech that is used to communicate by one person to another person.\u201d The term \u201cintercept\u201d is defined in R.C. 2933.51(C) as \u201cthe aural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of an interception device.\u201d R.C. 2933.51(D) defines an \u201cinterception device\u201d as \u201cany electronic, mechanical, or other device or apparatus that can be used to intercept a wire or oral communication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Appellee contends that the cordless telephone conversations received over the Crippens\u2019 baby monitor were not \u201coral communications\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2933.51(B). Appellee suggests that the monitor received \u201cradio waves\u201d transmitted from the Bidinosts\u2019 cordless telephone handset. However, we find that the cordless telephone communications received over the monitor were clearly \u201coral communications\u201d as defined in R.C. 2933.51(B). The voices heard over the Crippens\u2019 baby monitor came from the Bidinosts\u2019 cordless telephone handset when the Bidinosts used the telephone to communicate with others. Maria Crippen did not hear and record \u201cradio waves.\u201d Rather, she heard and recorded people speaking on a cordless telephone. The definition of \u201coral communication\u201d in R.C. 2933.51(B) is not specifically limited to face-to-face human speech. The definition refers to <em>any </em>human speech used to communicate by one person to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Additionally, appellant correctly recognizes that cordless telephone conversations also fit the statutory definition of \u201cwire communication.\u201d The evidence at the suppression hearing indicated that when a telephone call is made from a cordless telephone, the outgoing communications travel from the handset to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>base unit via radio waves. From there, the communication travels through the telephone lines. Although no evidence was presented at the hearing regarding <em>incoming </em>communications, the same physical principles apply. See, generally, <em>State v. McVeigh </em>(1993), 224 Conn. 593, 598-599, 620 A.2d 133, 136. Namely, if a call is made to a home serviced by a cordless telephone, and the cordless phone is used to receive the call, the incoming message travels through the telephone lines to the cordless telephone base unit. From the base unit, the incoming message is transmitted to the handset via radio waves. Thus, incoming and outgoing communications on a cordless telephone are made, in part, through the use of the facilities for the transmission of communications through the aid of wires connecting.the point of origin of the communication to the point of reception. Therefore, radio wave portions of cordless telephone communications are also \u201cwire communications\u201d as defined in R.C. 2933.51(A). Accord <em>McVeigh, supra </em>(Radio wave portions of cordless telephone communications are \u201cwire communications\u201d protected by Connecticut Wiretap Act.).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Further, there is no question that the Bidinosts\u2019 cordless telephone communications were \u201cintercepted\u201d by Maria Crippen. Again, the term \u201cintercept\u201d is defined as \u201cthe aural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of an interception device.\u201d R.C. 2933.51(C). The contents of the Bidinosts\u2019 oral communications were \u201caurally\u201d acquired through the use of the Crippens\u2019 electronic baby monitor. The monitor was indeed an \u201cinterception device\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2933.51(D), since the device was obviously capable of intercepting the Bidinosts\u2019 cordless telephone communications when used for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Accordingly, we find that the purposeful interception of the Bidinosts\u2019 cordless telephone conversations was prohibited by the terms of R.C. 2933.52(A). Therefore, pursuant to R.C. 2933.63, the trial court was required to suppress the contents of the recorded communications. We hold that the provisions of R.C. 2933.52(A), prohibiting the purposeful interception of wire or oral communications through the use of an interception device, apply to cordless telephone communications that are intentionally intercepted and recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">We recognize, as did the court of appeals, that there exists a substantial body of case law from other jurisdictions holding that cordless and/or mobile telephone communications do not fit within the protections afforded by statutes prohibiting the interception of oral communications, since users of cordless or cellular telephones have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their telephone communications.

Hall </em>(C.A.9, 1973), 488 F.2d 193; and <em>State v. Delaurier </em>(R.I.1985), 488 A.2d 688. However, the above-cited cases address the protections afforded radio telephone or cordless telephone communications in light of applicable federal and/or state statutory definitions of \u201coral communication,\u201d which differ from Ohio\u2019s statutory definition of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">For instance, the federal law prohibiting interception of oral communications defines an \u201coral communication\u201d as one in which a person has a justifiable expectation that the communication is not subject to. interception. Section 2510(2), Title 18, U.S.Code. Conversely, under Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme, the question whether users of cordless telephones have a reasonable expectation of privacy is <em>not </em>an issue that must be considered in determining whether a communication is an \u201coral communication\u201d as defined in R.C. 2933.51(B). R.C. 2933.51(B) is clear and unambiguous. In Ohio, the terms of the statute defining \u201coral communication\u201d clearly encompass cordless telephone conversations. In any event, we seriously question the proposition that people communicating on cordless telephones have no legitimate expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Fundamental rights should not be sacrificed on the altar of advancing technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Similarly, we recognize that our determination today that cordless telephone communications are protected \u201cwire communications\u201d is contra to a number of decisions from other jurisdictions which have held that cordless telephone communications are not wire communications. However, we are not persuaded to reach a similar conclusion under Ohio law. In our judgment, Ohio\u2019s definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d is free from ambiguity and clearly encompasses cordless telephone communications. Therefore, we are not at liberty to interpret Ohio\u2019s definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d as excluding cordless telephone communications. Where, as here, a legislative enactment is free from ambiguity, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>apply, not interpret, the enactment. See <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum,. Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 50, 524 N.E.2d 441, paragraph three of the syllabus (\u201cIn matters of construction, it is the duty of this court to give effect to the words used, not to delete words used or to insert words not used.\u201d); <em>Ohio Dental Hygienists Assn. v. Ohio State Dental Bd. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 21, 23, 21 OBR 282, 284, 487 N.E.2d 301, 303 (\u201cAbsent ambiguity, a statute is to be construed without resort to a process of statutory construction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Accordingly, we believe that the very terms of Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme prohibiting the purposeful interception of wire or oral communications mandate the conclusions we have reached in this case. Further, we are unable to reconcile the state\u2019s arguments in this case with the arguments it advanced in <em>State v. Larabee </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 357, 632 N.E.2d 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In <em>Larabee, </em>Gerald Larabee recorded a number of cellular telephone calls he was able to overhear on a ham radio. For this activity, Larabee was indicted for purposely intercepting oral communications in violation of R.C. 2933.52(A). Larabee moved to dismiss the indictment. The trial court granted the motion, finding that the indictment failed to state an offense under R.C. 2933.52(A). Thereafter, the state appealed to the court of appeals, urging that the trial court had erred in dismissing the indictment. However, the court of appeals dismissed the matter without addressing the merits of the state\u2019s appeal. Upon further appeal, this court remanded the cause to the court of appeals to address the merits whether Larabee had committed an indictable offense. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 632 N!E.2d at 513-514.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In <em>Larabee, </em>we did not discuss whether the matters alleged in the indictment constituted indictable offenses. However, both Larabee and the state of Ohio presented arguments before this court concerning that issue. Specifically, Lara-bee claimed that R.C. 2933.52 did not apply to his recording of the unscrambled cellular telephone radio transmissions. In a reply brief, the state made the following argument in response to Larabee\u2019s assertions:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">\u201cOhio Revised Code Sections 2933.51 through 2933.66 were passed as a package effective March 25, 1987, to set forth a procedure whereby wire and oral communications could be intercepted and the terms upon which it could be done. Much detail is used in how the warrant can be obtained (2933.56 and 2933.57) and civil and criminal penalties for violating the same (2933.65).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">\u201cAs previously set forth O.R.C. Section 2933.51 in defining oral communication defines it as \u2018any human speech that is used to communicate by one person to another person.\u2019 Obviously this would encompass a cellular telephone call since indeed it is human speech used to communicate between individuals. The Defendant [Larabee] did intercept conversations through the use of [an] interception device, to-wit his ICM AT 24 Hand Held Unit. Therefore by the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>definition of the statute, Defendant\u2019s conduct fits the statute. It is obvious that a telephone call from one individual to another, is indeed an oral communication within the definition set out by O.R.C. Section 2933.51(B). It is also obvious that conversations initiated from a radio telephone logically fall within the category or oral communication. * * * Conversations aminating <em>[sic, </em>emanating] from a radio telephone should logically be treated in the same way as an oral communication. * * * A radio receiver does indeed fit the definition of interception devise <em>[sic, </em>device] since it is an electronic devise [sic ] capable of interception of an oral communication when used for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\u201cThe purpose of the Ohio General Assembly in enacting O.R.C. Sections 2933.51 <em>et seq. </em>was to protect the privacy of certain communications. It is clear that those individuals using cellular telephones expect their message only to be accepted, heard, and communicated with the other party with whom the call is made. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">\u201cThe Trial Court specifically dwelled upon the fact that the Federal Law included a category of \u2018electronic communications\u2019 which specifically includes cellular telephone calls and Ohio Law does not. The Court incorrectly reasoned that this meant that electronic communications were not covered under Ohio Law. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Therefore, in <em>Larabee, </em>the state urged that the provisions of R.C. 2933.51 and 2933.52 clearly and unambiguously prohibit the intentional interception of cellular and \u201cradio\u201d telephone communications, that there exists no room for any other interpretation of Ohio law, and that people who speak on these types of phones enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy in their telephone communications. Conversely, in the case at bar, the state essentially urges that R.C. 2933.51 and 2933.52 do not mean what the statutes say, that this court should <em>interpret </em>Ohio law in.accordance with federal laws on the subject, and that it would be absurd to conclude that there exists a reasonable expectation of privacy in cordless telephone communications. Obviously, the state cannot have it both ways!</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">In the case at bar, the trial court clearly erred in failing to suppress the contents of the recorded telephone conversations. However, under the circumstances here, we find that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">The state did not use the recorded telephone conversations during its case-in-chief. Rather, the only time any recorded statement was used by the prosecution was during the cross-examination of appellant\u2019s father and sister. Specifically, appellant\u2019s father was questioned concerning various statements he had made on the cordless telephone. None of the recorded statements was particularly damning, especially when the statements were explained by him. Further, in our judgment, the recorded statements did not significantly affect the credibility of appellant\u2019s father. Appellant\u2019s sister was also questioned concerning statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>that she had made on the cordless telephone. While the cross-examination of appellant\u2019s sister may have had some impact on the jury\u2019s assessment of her credibility, we are convinced that the jury\u2019s ultimate findings were not adversely affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Hence, given the overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, we find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial would not have been different had the state been precluded from using the contents of the recorded telephone conversations during the cross-examination of appellant\u2019s father and sister. Thus, no reversible error occurred. See Crim.R. 52(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In this proposition, appellant also contends that the recorded telephone communications should have been excluded on the basis that only one party to any given conversation could be overheard and, thus, there existed a \u201cgreat possibility\u201d that the jury would misinterpret the sum and substance of the conversations. However, the appellant\u2019s father and sister were given the opportunity to explain their recorded statements and to describe the context in which the statements were made. Further, we have already determined that the use of the recorded telephone conversations during the cross-examination of appellant\u2019s father and sister did not taint the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">As a final matter, we note that Maria Crippen was permitted to testify as a rebuttal witness for the prosecution with respect to one cordless telephone conversation she had overheard shortly after appellant\u2019s arrest. According to Maria, appellant\u2019s sister was speaking with appellant and commented that appellant should consider plea bargaining. This statement was overheard by Maria before she began recording the Bidinosts\u2019 telephone communications at the urging of the police and prosecutor. In this regard, since the conversation was not recorded, the oral communication was not purposely intercepted in violation of law. Therefore, the contents of the conversation were properly admitted for purposes of impeaching the testimony of a defense witness, appellant\u2019s sister, who denied making the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Accordingly, we find no reversible error in the matters raised in appellant\u2019s third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b605-13\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
