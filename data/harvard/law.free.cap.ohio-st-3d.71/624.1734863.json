Therefore, the trial court determined- that the exclusion in Kollstedt\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy for expected or intended injuries did not apply. The evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s determination consisted of, <em>inter alia, </em>the deposition testimony of two expert witnesses, Drs. Fisher and Sarny. In his deposition, Dr. Fisher testified that Kollstedt suffered from degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer type and senile onset with delirium. Fisher stated that Kollstedt\u2019s mental derangement at the time of the shooting would have made it impossible for him \u201c * * * to carry on the sequence of events that would have led from the planful [sic] intent to actually executing a deed.\u201d According to Fisher, Kollstedt\u2019s mental state precluded Kollstedt from planning or premeditating an action in a purposeful manner. Similarly, Dr. Sarny concluded that Kollstedt\u2019s mental condition at the time of the shooting precluded Kollstedt from making a rational judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">On appeal, the court of appeals determined that the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s determination that Kollstedt could not have acted intentionally at the time of the shooting, since Kollstedt suffered from a derangement of intellect that deprived\u2019 him of the capacity to govern his conduct in accordance with reason. Therefore, the court of appeals, applying <em>Turner, </em>affirmed the judgment of the trial court that the intentional injury exclusion did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. We hold that a provision in a liability insurance policy which excludes coverage to an insured where the insured expected or intended to cause bodily injury or property damage does not apply under circumstances where the insured was mentally incapable of committing an intentional act. When disputed, the determination whether an insured lacked the mental capacity to commit an intentional act is a matter to be determined, in the first instance, by a trial court, and such determination is to be made by the trial court on the basis of the evidence. Such a determination will not be disturbed, absent an abuse of discretion. We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b767-9\">Moyer, C.J., Wright, Resnick, F.E.
