Smith claims that Judge O\u2019Connor ignored the mandate of the court of appeals by deciding to hold a new trial on all issues upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"ADX3\">Absent extraordinary circumstances, such as an intervening decision by the Supreme Court, an inferior court has no discretion to disregard the mandate of a superior court in a prior appeal in the same case. <em>Nolan v. Nolan </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410, syllabus; <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 344, 345, 639 N.E.2d 25, 26. A writ of mandamus is an appropriate' remedy to require a lower court to comply with an appellate court\u2019s mandate directed to that court. <em>State ex rel. Potain v. Mathews </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 29, 13 O.O.3d 17, 391 N.E.2d 343; <em>State ex rel. Schneider v. Brewer </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 203, 44 O.O. 170, 98 N.E.2d 2; see, also, <em>Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp. </em>(1978), 434 U.S. 425, 427-428, 98 S.Ct. 702, 703-704, 54 L.Ed.2d 659, 662-663. A writ of prohibition is an appropriate remedy to prevent a lower court from\u2019proceeding contrary to the mandate of a superior court. See <em>State ex rel. TRW, Inc. v. Jaffe </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 411, 604 N.E.2d 1376 (writ of prohibition issued to prevent new trial on issue of damages for fraud); see, also, <em>State ex rel. Potain, supra, </em>59 Ohio St.2d at 32, 13 O.O.3d at 19, 391 N.E.2d at 345 (\u201cThe Constitution does not grant to a court of common pleas jurisdiction to review a prior mandate of a court of appeals.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Smith claims entitlement to extraordinary relief in mandamus and prohibition based on cases that have held that \u201cApp.R. 12(D) and Civ.R. 42(B) together authorize a court of appeals to order a retrial of only those issues which resulted in prejudicial error.\u201d <em>Charles R. Combs Trucking, Inc. v. Internatl. Harvester Co. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 241, 12 OBR 322, 466 N.E.2d 883, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Mast v. Doctor's Hosp. N. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 539, 541, 75 O.O.2d 556, 557, 350 N.E.2d 429, 430. Smith asserts that the foregoing cases required the court of appeals to order retrial only on the issue of damages. However, we have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">\u201cWhile worded in strong terms, <em>the syllabus of Combs falls short of being mandatory, </em>and the rationale authorizing reviewing courts to order a limited remand implicitly recognizes the need for appellate courts to carefully exercise their discretion to determine the appropriate scope of remand.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Chrysler Corp. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 1, 5, 523 N.E.2d 489, 493. See, also, Whiteside, Ohio Appellate Practice (1994) 91, Section T 7.05(C) (\u201cWhen a case is remanded for retrial, Appellate Rule 12[D] in conjunction with Civil Rule 42[B] <em>permits </em>the court of appeals to allow error-free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>issues to stand, and limit retrial to those issues, claims, or defenses which in the original trial resulted in prejudicial error.\u201d [Emphasis added.]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The court of appeals was not <em>required </em>to order a limited retrial, and a review of its mandate and incorporated decision indicates, as that same court later determined, that it did not order a new trial solely on the issue of damages. Smith\u2019s own argument in her appellate brief in the initial appeal requested a \u201cnew trial on all issues or damages only.\u201d Under the invited-error doctrine, a party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error which she herself invited or induced the trial court to make. <em>State ex rel. Fowler v. Smith </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 357, 359, 626 N.E.2d 950, 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Since the court of appeals never ordered Judge O\u2019Connor to hold a new trial limited to the issue of damages on remand, Smith failed to establish a clear legal right to a limited trial or corresponding clear legal duty on the part of Judge O\u2019Connor to provide it. Additionally, Smith failed to establish that Judge O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision to hold a new trial on all the issues was in excess of or without jurisdiction. Finally, Smith possessed an adequate remedy by discretionary appeal of the appellate court\u2019s prior judgment, which reversed the judgment entered in favor of the hospital but failed to order a new trial limited to the damages issue. Although that appeal was not allowed, extraordinary writs may not be used as a substitute for an otherwise barred second appeal or to gain successive appellate reviews of the same issue. <em>State ex rel. LTV Steel Co. v. Gwin </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 245, 249, 594 N.E.2d 616, 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Accordingly, the court of appeals properly denied Smith\u2019s complaint for writs of mandamus and prohibition, and its judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b803-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
