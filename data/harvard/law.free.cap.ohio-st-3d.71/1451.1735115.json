On May 16, 1994, the record was filed in the Supreme- Court. It appears from the records of this court that appellant has not filed a merit brief in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b885-20\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that this cause be, and hereby is, dismissed <em>sua sponte, </em>effective January 25, 1995.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
