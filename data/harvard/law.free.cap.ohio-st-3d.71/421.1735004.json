William Sweeney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai4C\">R.C. 2323.57<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> mandates that, upon timely motion of a party, awards of future damages in excess of $200,000 be paid periodically rather than in a lump sum in medical malpractice claims. R.C. 1343.03(C),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ohio\u2019s prejudgment interest statute, provides for an award of interest to be granted in favor of successful tort plaintiffs, when the trial court finds that the defendant failed to act in good faith to achieve pretrial settlement of the dispute. We are called upon in this case to determine the constitutionality of each of these statutes. We affirm the findings of the lower courts that R.C. 1343.03(C) survives a constitutional challenge, while R.C. 2323.57 does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\n<em>Constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s Periodic Payment of Future Damages Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGlJ\">Both lower courts found that R.C. 2323.57 violates the Right to Jury Trial Clause of Section 5, Article I and the Due Process Clause of Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. For the reasons which follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cThe right of trial by jury shall be inviolate, except that, in civil cases, laws may be passed to authorize the rendering of a verdict by the concurrence of not less than three-fourths of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">It is well established that the right of trial by jury in this state is a fundamental and substantial right guaranteed by the Ohio Constitution. <em>Sorrell v. Thevenir </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 415, 421, 633 N.E.2d 504, 510; <em>Kneisley v. Lattimer-Stevens Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 354, 356, 533 N.E.2d 743, 746; and <em>Cleveland Ry. Co. v. Holliday </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 278, 284, 188 N.E. 1, 3. This court has held there is a fundamental constitutional right to a trial by jury in negligence actions. <em>Sorrell, supra, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 422, 633 N.E.2d at 510; <em>Kneisley, supra, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 357, 533 N.E.2d at 746. Included in that right is the right to have a jury determine all questions of fact, including the amount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled. <em>Sorrell, supra, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 422, 633 N.E.2d at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">R.C. 2323.57(C) requires a trial judge, upon timely motion of any party, to order that any future damages award which exceeds $200,000 be paid in periodic installments rather than in a lump sum upon entry of judgment. Moreover, R.C. 2323.57(E)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he total amount paid under this division and the periodic payments plan shall not exceed the amount of the judgment.\u201d R.C. 2323.57(F)(1) further mandates that, if a plaintiff dies prior to the receipt of all of the periodic payments, all payments for future medical expenses and for noneconomic loss, such as pain and suffering, loss of consortium, disfigurement, mental anguish and any other intangible loss, shall cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">In Ohio, a plaintiff is entitled to an award of damages to compensate him for losses which he is reasonably certain to incur in the future. <em>Pennsylvania Co. v. Files </em>(1901), 65 Ohio St. 403, 407, 62 N.E. 1047, 1047; <em>Roberts v. Mut. Mfg. &amp; Supply Co. </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 324, 16 OBR 355, 475 N.E.2d 797. Under the common law of Ohio, future damages must be reduced to present value, and a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction to that effect. <em>Maus v. New York, Chicago &amp; St. Louis RR. Co. </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 281, 59 O.O. 366, 135 N.E.2d 253, paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus in Ohio, a jury is to return a verdict not in an amount reflecting the actual damages it deems to be reasonably certain to occur in the future, but rather in a reduced amount representing the present value of those actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">It is evident that application of R.C. 2323.57 to a jury verdict does not merely mandate the <em>manner </em>in which a judgment shall be paid; rather, it requires the trial court to further reduce the jury\u2019s award of damages already once reduced to present value. Application of the statute quite simply results in a successful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>plaintiffs receiving less than the jury awarded, and deprives the most severely injured victims of the benefits of investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">That R.C. 2323.57 regulates more than merely the manner in which a judgment is paid and instead reduces the actual value of the verdict can be illustrated by comparing two hypothetical plaintiffs, both of whom receive future damages awards of $1,000,000. Assume the first plaintiff receives his entire judgment in a lump sum, but determines to use the proceeds to purchase an annuity. Assume the second plaintiff is subjected to application of R.C. 2323.57. Obviously the stream of income produced by investment in an annuity by the first plaintiff of the entire $1,000,000 will exceed the payout generated in the second case, where the entirety of the judgment (except the first $200,000) will be received in the future with no regard for the effect of inflation and no interest or other investment appreciation. This is assured by application of R.C. 2323.57(E)(2), which specifically provides that \u201c[t]he total [lump sum] amount paid under this division and the periodic payments plan shall not exceed the amount of the judgment.\u201d It is readily apparent that R.C. 2323.57 effectively reduces a jury\u2019s award without the consent of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">For the foregoing reason, we find that R.C. 2323.57(C) invades the jury\u2019s province to determine damages, and that the statute violates a plaintiffs right to trial by jury as guaranteed by Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Nor is R.C. 2323.57 consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Ohio Constitution. Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution guarantees that every person who suffers a legally compensable injury \u201cshall have remedy by due course of law.\u201d This provision is the equivalent of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Direct Plumbing Supply Co. v. Dayton </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 540, 544, 21 O.O. 422, 424, 38 N.E.2d 70, 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The trial court found R.C. 2323.57 to be \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary, and [to have] no reasonable relationship to any good which may have been perceived by the Legislature to benefit the public health and welfare.\u201d The court of appeals concurred that R.C. 2323.35 is unconstitutional based upon due process grounds. We agree with the lower courts that R.C. 2323.57 violates the Due Process Clause of the Ohio Constitution for the reasons set forth in <em>Sorrell, supra. </em>There is insufficient evidence of a relationship between tort reform legislation and the availability or affordability of medical malpractice insurance. <em>Id., </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 423, 633 N.E.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Therefore, we hold that R.C. 2323.57, which requires a trial court upon motion of a party to order that any future damages award in excess of $200,000 be paid in a series of periodic payments, is unconstitutional in that it violates the Right to Jury Trial Clause (Section 5, Article I) and the Due Process Clause of Ohio Constitution (Section 16, Article I).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>Constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s Prejudgment Interest Statute (R.C. 1313.03) \u25a0</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">This court recently analyzed Ohio\u2019s prejudgment interest statute at length in <em>Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 638, 635 N.E.2d 331, but we were not in that case called upon to consider the constitutionality of R.C. 1343.03. The defendants herein make essentially the same argument we rejected in <em>Kalain v. Smith </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 157, 160, 25 OBR 201, 203, 495 N.E.2d 572, 574, <em>ie., </em>that imposing a \u201cgood .faith effort to settle\u201d requirement forces a defendant to forgo the right of having a jury determine the existence of his liability in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">We reaffirm our holding in <em>Kalain </em>that \u201cR.C. 1343.03(C) does not infringe upon a party\u2019s right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 25 OBR at 203, 495 N.E.2d at 574. It is true that a defendant who chooses to try a case before a jury rather than settle it risks the possibility that he may ultimately be found liable for a larger total judgment if prejudgment interest is awarded. However, the potential application of R.C. 1343.03 in no way precludes a defendant from insisting on exercising his right to trial by jury nor does it \u201ccreate a financial barrier that prevents a * * * party from taking his case to a jury.\u201d <em>Kuenzer v. Teamsters Union Local 507 </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 201, 203, 20 O.O.3d 205, 207, 420 N.E.2d 1009, 1011, fn. 6. The defendant\u2019s right of access to a jury for determination of factual issues remains unimpaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">We similarly reject defendants\u2019 contention that R.C. 1343.03 imposes a penalty upon defendants for having exercised their right to a jury where prejudgment interest is awarded against them. In <em>Digital &amp; Analog Design Corp. v. N. Supply Co. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 657, 590 N.E.2d 737, we found such an award to be compensatory in nature rather than punitive. Writing for the majority, Justice Wright noted that the \u201cprejudgment interest statute is designed to compensate the aggrieved party for the delay encountered by the failure of the tortfeasor to negotiate in good faith,\u201d and \u201censures that just compensation to the tort victim is not eroded by the dilatory tactics of the tortfeasor. * * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660-661, 590 N.E.2d at 746. In such a case, the defendant \u201callow[s] the interest monies on the [defendant\u2019s monetary reserves] to accumulate to the benefit of the party required to pay and to the detriment of the party to whom the money is to be paid.\u201d <em>Dailey v. Nationwide Demolition Derby, Inc. </em>(1984), 18 Ohio App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>39, 41, 18 OBR 108, 110, 480 N.E.2d 110, 112. Where a defendant benefits monetarily as a result of failing to negotiate possible settlement in good faith, R.C. 1343.03 does not constitute a penalty, but, to the contrary, is wholly compensatory, and indeed equitable, in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Similarly, it is the jury\u2019s function to determine the amount of damages suffered by a plaintiff. Since determining the amount of prejudgment interest awards is entirely separate and distinct from determining the amount of damages suffered by the plaintiff, and does not involve questions of fact, R.C. 1343.03 does not violate the fundamental constitutional right to trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Defendant\u2019s contention that R.C. 1343.03 violates the Due Process Clause of the Ohio Constitution is unfounded. Prejudgment interest statutes have consistently been found to be constitutional by courts both in Ohio and elsewhere. See, <em>e.g., Hardiman v. Zep Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 222, 14 OBR 250, 470 N.E.2d 941; <em>Mills v. Dayton </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 208, 21 OBR 222, 486 N.E.2d 1209; <em>Edgerson v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. </em>(1985), 28 Ohio App.3d 24, 28 OBR 34, 501 N.E.2d 1211. See, generally, Annotation, Validity and Construction of State Statute or Rule Allowing or Changing Rate of Prejudgment Interest in Tort Actions (1985), 40 A.L.R.4th 147. While this is not dispositive of our inquiry, we do agree with the overwhelming weight of authority that prejudgment interest statutes are rationally related to the legitimate goals of encouraging prompt resolution of disputes, and ensuring prompt payment of compensation to parties injured by tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that R.C. 1343.03(C), which authorizes an award of prejudgment interest in a tort action against a defendant who failed to act in good faith to settle, does not violate either the Due Process Clause (Section 16, Article I) or the Right to Jury Trial Clause (Section 5, Article I) of the Ohio Constitution by imposing a penalty for exercise of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The defendants further contend that the trial court improperly applied the standards established in <em>Kalain </em>in awarding prejudgment interest to plaintiff. The defendants assert that prejudgment interest cannot be awarded if a motion for summary judgment or directed verdict could not have been appropriately granted in plaintiffs favor on the issue of liability. Defendants contend that in such circumstances reasonable minds could differ on the issue of liability, thereby necessitating the conclusion that the defendant had a good faith, objectively reasonable belief of nonliability and was thus not required to make a monetary settlement offer or counteroffer. The defendants base this argument on the last sentence of the syllabus in <em>Kalain, </em>which states: \u201cIf a party has a good faith, objectively reasonable belief .that he has no liability, he need not make a monetary settlement offer.\u201d <em>Id., </em>25 Ohio St.3d 157, 25 OBR 201, 495 N.E.2d 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>We decline to impose summary judgment or directed verdict analytical criteria on prejudgment interest proceedings. Existence of a good faith, objectively reasonable belief of nonliability does not excuse a defendant from the remaining <em>Kalain </em>obligations to (1) fully cooperate with discovery, (2) rationally evaluate risks and potential liability, and (3) refrain from unnecessary delaying maneuvers. <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. Moreover, the \u201cgood faith, objectively reasonable belief\u2019 language of <em>Kalain </em>must <em>be </em>\u201cstrictly construed so as to carry out the purposes of R.C. 1343.03.\u201d <em>Moskovitz, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 659, 635 N.E.2d at 348.' The purposes of R.C. 1343.03 would not be furthered by construing the evidence most favorably to the party opposing a motion for prejudgment interest as a trial court must do when ruling on a motion for directed verdict or summary judgment, or by limiting the examination of the defendant\u2019s conduct to the time of the trial or the evidence presented at trial. A defendant may well have fallen short of the good faith requirement of R.C. 1343.03, even where a trial court would have been justified in overruling a motion for summary judgment prior to trial or a motion for directed verdict made during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We have reviewed the record established in the prejudgment interest hearing held in the case at bar and find that the trial court was well within its discretion in ordering prejudgment interest pursuant to R.C. 1343.03. The trial court found that the defendants had stated a position of \u201cno offer and no settlement in such unmistakably rigid terms\u201d following presentation of plaintiffs initial settlement demand that plaintiffs presentation of any reduced demand would have been \u201ca vain act\u201d and that the defendants had thereby \u201ceffectively terminated all chance for good faith negotiation.\u201d The court concluded that the defendants had \u201cnot rationally evaluate[d] the essential risks of a plaintiffs verdict, and had failed to respond in good faith\u201d to a good faith offer from the plaintiff. A trial court does not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest when, as here, a defendant \u201cjust says no\u201d despite a plaintiffs presentation of credible medical evidence that the defendant physician fell short of the standard of professional care required of him, when it is clear that the plaintiff has suffered injuries, and when the causation of those injuries is arguably attributable to the defendant\u2019s conduct. We find the trial court\u2019s determinations on this issue wholly in accord with the purposes of R.C. 1343.03 and with the standards set forth in <em>Kalain </em>and <em>Moskovitz, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">\n<em>Alleged Evidentiary Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The defendants argue that a defense expert\u2019s testimony should not be deemed inadmissible merely because it is expressed in terms of possibilities. In the case at bar, the trial court sustained an objection to the testimony of defense expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Dr. Donald Fry that \u201cthere are a host of blood vessels that could be responsible\u201d for a leak of blood into plaintiffs stomach, advising the witness that \u201cpossibilities are not admissible.\u201d The defendants further argue that the trial court improperly precluded Dr. Fry from testifying that the plaintiffs bile duct injury was more likely to occur during gastrectomy surgery. Defendants suggest that this evidence tended to prove that plaintiffs bile duct leak may have been a result of surgery performed by Dr. Eckhauser after plaintiff was transferred to Cleveland Metro, and not as a result of the actions of defendants or of the automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The primary rule governing admissibility of expert testimony provides: \u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d Evid.R. 702. An analysis of an expert\u2019s testimony in terms of whether it expresses a degree of certainty in excess of fifty percent may not in every case be conclusive of the admissibility of the expert\u2019s opinion. Accord <em>Stinson v. England </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 451, 633 N.E.2d 532 (no error in allowing defense expert to testify, in effect, that the event she believed had caused plaintiffs injuries was more likely than the cause propounded by plaintiff). Similarly, the Rules of Evidence authorize exclusion of evidence, including expert testimony, when the court finds in a sound exercise of discretion that the probative value of the opinion is outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice or confusion of the issues (Evid.R. 403) or that the opinion is inadmissible pursuant to some other Rule of Evidence. The question whether any particular expert\u2019s testimony, standing alone, would satisfy the burden of proof required of a party is a separate and distinct issue which is decided according to criteria different from those used to determine admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Turning to the case at bar, we find that in answering the interrogatories propounded to it, this jury found that defendants failed to meet accepted standards of care based on defendant Damian\u2019s failure to timely order a cholangiogram and to transfer plaintiff to a hospital more capable of handling his injuries. The jury did not find professional negligence on the part of Dr. Damian in causing the bile duct leak. The court\u2019s refusal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to allow Dr. Fry to testify more extensively concerning other possible causes of that leak would not have affected the jury\u2019s ultimate findings of negligence. We find on this record that error in limiting Dr. Fry\u2019s expert testimony, if any, can only be considered harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Based on all of the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-6\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Once again, the majority has declared unconstitutional an Act of the General Assembly that is neither unconstitutional by any accepted standard of review nor bad public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Consistent with my views in Morris <em>v. Savoy </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 684, 576 N.E.2d 765, and <em>Sorrell v. Thevenir </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 415, 633 N.E.2d 504 (dissenting), I would hold that the periodic payment plan for future awards provided by R.C. 2323.57 violates neither a plaintiffs right to trial by jury nor his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">In determining the constitutionality of any statute, the analysis must begin with the well-established rule that all legislative enactments enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality. <em>Sorrell, supra, </em>at 418-419, 633 N.E.2d at 508, citing <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus. Therefore, the party challenging the statute has the burden of proving that it is unconstitutional, and if reasonable doubt exists, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the statute\u2019s validity. Moreover, it is not the function of this court to assess the wisdom or policy of a statute but, rather, to determine whether the General Assembly acted within its legislative power. <em>State ex rel. Bishop v. Mt. Orab Village Bd. of Edn. </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 427. 438. 22 O.O. 494. 498. 40 N.E.2d 913, 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The majority misconstrues the scope of Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. I agree with the majority that the right to a trial by jury includes a determination by the jury of all questions of fact, as well as the amount of compensatory damages to which the plaintiff is entitled. Once the jury has resolved the facts and assessed the damages, however, the constitutional right is satisfied. The inviolate right to trial by jury does not mean the award of <em>damages </em>is inviolate. Surely, if the rationale used by the majority to support its judgment is extended beyond this case, judges should no longer be authorized to enter judgments notwithstanding the verdict or order remittiturs of a jury\u2019s determination of damages. While a party has a constitutional right to have a jury assess damages for injury, the party has no right to have a jury dictate the legal process by which the jury award is satisfied. It is a startling new thought that the legislative branch does not have the constitutional authority to create that legal process. It is the province of the legislative branch to determine policy issues relating to the method by which jury awards are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">R.C. 2323.57 does nothing more than provide a remedy in the form of periodic payments of the award determined by the jury or by a court in a bench trial. R.C. 2323.57 does not infringe upon the right to a jury trial because the statute does not apply until after the jury has completed its assigned function in the judicial process. To hold otherwise runs contrary to our common law and Rules of Civil Procedure, which provide the trial court with plenary control over judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The majority also finds that R.C. 2323.57 violates the due process of law provision of Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Because no fundamental right or suspect class is involved, our standard for review of the statute should be a \u201crational basis\u201d test. We have held that under this test \u201c \u2018[a] legislative enactment will be deemed valid on due process grounds \u201c * * * [1] if it bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public and [2] if it is not unreasonable or arbitrary.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Morris, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 688-689, 576 N.E.2d at 769. Certainly, a statute designed to respond to the growing concerns regarding the continued delivery of health care to the citizens of Ohio at affordable costs survives such minimal scrutiny. R.C. 2323.57 is simply an economic regulation and is entitled to wide judicial deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Because no fundamental right of the plaintiff has been violated and periodic payment of future damages provided by R.C. 2323.57 is a rational exercise of the General Assembly\u2019s authority, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-8\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\">.
