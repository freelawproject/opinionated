He alternatively claims that permanency, if relevant, is unsubstantiated. For the reasons to follow, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">Temporary total disability compensation is not payable to a claimant whose condition has become permanent. <em>State ex rel. Ramirez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586. Claimant\u2019s initial proposition, therefore, lacks merit, since \u201cpermanency\u201d is always relevant to a temporary total disability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">We next examine the order for the presence of \u201csome evidence.\u201d Claimant assails the thirteen-year gap between Dr. Saunders\u2019 two reports. Dr. Saunders was not being asked to speculate as to the permanency of claimant\u2019s condition prior ever to having examined him. He was simply asked to clarify conclusions derived from his 1978 examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>We question, however, whether Dr. Saunders was using the term \u201cpermanen[cy]\u201d in the relevant <em>Ramirez </em>sense, <em>i.e., </em>reaching maximum medical improvement. R.C. 4123.56(A). As claimant accurately observes, a condition may be permanent, in that it cannot be completely resolved, yet it may also respond positively to treatment, making a declaration of \u201cpermanency\u201d as used in <em>Ramirez </em>premature. <em>State ex rel. Kaska v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 743, 591 N.E.2d 235; <em>State ex rel. Bing v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 424, 575 N.E.2d 177. \u201cPermanency,\u201d therefore, may bar temporary total disability compensation only where \u201cthere is a <em>clear </em>indication that the claimant\u2019s condition will not improve.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Kaska, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 746, 591 N.E.2d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Dr. Saunders\u2019 reference to \u201cpermanen[cy]\u201d does not rise to this level. Neither report by Dr. Saunders expressly addresses the potential, or lack thereof, for improvement over the relevant period. Read together, the reports do no more than discuss the severity of claimant\u2019s condition and recount the tests performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The lack of \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting denial of compensation does not, however, translate into \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting its award. <em>State ex rel. Lampkins v. Dayton Malleable, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 14, 542 N.E.2d 1105. In this case, the remaining evidence does not support payment of temporary total disability benefits. Even Dr. Pavlatos cannot substantiate a condition amenable to further improvement. Without elaborating, Dr. Pavlatos certified temporary total disability from May 1, 1980 to September 1, 1981 on the C85A form. His 1985 detailed narrative, however, chronicles a condition that has not improved since its onset. His narrative can only be viewed one of two ways \u2014 as equivocal or as a repudiation. Either way, the Pavlatos reports cannot be \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting temporary total disability. <em>State ex rel. Jennings v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 101, 1 OBR 135, 438 N.E.2d 420; <em>State ex rel. Paragon v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 72, 5 OBR 127, 448 N.E.2d 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-9\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
