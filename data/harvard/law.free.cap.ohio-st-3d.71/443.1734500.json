We conclude that such statements are punishable under the statute and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>In reversing Bailey\u2019s conviction, the court of appeals relied on our holdings in two cases: <em>Columbus v. Fisher </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 25, 7 O.O.3d 78, 372 N.E.2d 583, and <em>Dayton v. Rogers </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 162, 14 O.O.3d 403, 398 N.E.2d 781. Both cases applied statutes different from, but similar to, R.C. 2921.32(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In <em>Columbus v. Fisher, supra, </em>we addressed the issue of unsworn false oral statements for the first time. The defendant in <em>Fisher </em>gave a false name to a police officer and was convicted of violating a municipal ordinance identical to R.C. 2921.13(A)(3) that prohibited false statements made with the purpose of misleading a public official in performing official functions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The court traced the history of R.C. 2921.13(A) to Section 241.3 of the Model Penal Code. Originally presented to the American Law Institute in 1957 as Section 208.22 of Tentative Draft No. 6 of the Model Penal Code, Section 241.3 was adapted from Section 1001, Title 18, U.S.Code, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">\u201cWhoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully * * * makes <em>any </em>false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, * * * shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The <em>Fisher </em>court, however, preferred the reasoning of Section 241.3, which required that a false statement, to be punishable, must be in writing and must also derive from an intent to mislead.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">The Model Penal Code\u2019s restrictive view, adopted by the <em>Fisher </em>court, derives from a fear that a statute punishing oral misstatements might be used by law enforcement officers to pressure an individual into a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d: Tell the truth and go to jail, or tell a lie and go to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Believing the Ohio General Assembly shared a similar concern that R.C. 2921.13(A)(3) could be used in a coercive manner during criminal investigations, this court reasoned that R.C. 2921.13(A)(3) was not intended to criminalize unsworn false oral statements made in response to inquiries initiated by law enforcement officials. Therefore, R.C. 2921.13(A)(3), in general, and the term \u201cstatement,\u201d in particular, were given a limited judicial construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>In <em>Dayton v. Rogers, supra, </em>the issue of unsworn false oral statements was again presented to this court. This time, however, the defendant lied to a police officer by falsely confirming her companion\u2019s identity, and was charged, not with violating R.C. 2921.13(A), but with violating R.C. 2921.31(A), prohibiting the performance of any act that hampers or impedes a public official.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Relying on <em>Fisher, </em>the <em>Rogers </em>court held that because \u201cconduct such as appellant\u2019s is not punishable under R.C. 2921.13(A)(3), which specifically addresses the making of false statements to public officials, we are reasonably led to the determination here not to extend the meaning of R.C. 2921.31 beyond that intended by the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Rogers, supra, </em>at 164,14 O.O.3d at 404-405, 398 N.E.2d at 783. Further, the court reasoned that the defendant was under no legal duty to respond to the police officers\u2019 questions, and that her lie was no more obstructive to the police investigation than her silence would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">It is significant that when <em>Fisher </em>and <em>Rogers </em>were decided, the federal courts were unsettled as to the potential reach of the federal law. Moreover, there was a lack of persuasive authority from other states interpreting similar statutes from which this court could draw analogy. Over the last fifteen years, however, the law in this area has crystallized. Federal case law has firmly established that unsworn false oral statements made for the purpose of impeding an officer\u2019s investigation are punishable under the federal statute. <em>United States v. Rodgers </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 475, 104 S.Ct. 1942, 80 L.Ed.2d 492, and <em>United States v. Steele </em>(C.A.6, 1990), 896 F.2d 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">In <em>United States v. Rodgers, supra, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States reaffirmed the existence of \u201ca Valid legislative interest in protecting the integrity of [such] official inquiries\u2019 \u201d as \u201can interest clearly embraced in, and furthered by, the broad language of \u00a7 1001.\u201d 466 U.S. at 481-482, 104 S.Ct. at 1947, 80 L.Ed.2d at 499 (quoting <em>Bryson v. United States </em>[1969], 396 U.S. 64, 70, 90 S.Ct. 355, 359, 24 L.Ed.2d 264, 270). The <em>Rodgers </em>court addressed several of the policy arguments urged in support of a narrow construction of Section 1001. The court concluded that the apparent inconsistency in the severity of the penalty for making an unsworn false statement to a government official as compared to the lesser penalty for perjury did not express an intention of Congress to limit the violations covered by Section 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Second, the court rejected the argument that criminalizing false oral statements would have a deleterious effect on communications between citizens and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>law enforcement agencies. Noting that the law criminalizes the knowing and willful lying to law enforcement officers, the United States Supreme Court wisely refuted the perception that \u201cthe spectre of criminal prosecution\u201d would thwart \u201c \u2018the important social policy that is served by an open line of communication between the general public and law enforcement agencies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rodgers, </em>466 U.S. at 483, 104 S.Ct. at 1948, 80 L.Ed.2d at 500 (quoting <em>Friedman v. United States </em>[C.A.8, 1967], 374 F.2d 363, 369). The court confidently determined that \u201c \u2018individuals acting innocently and in good faith, will not be deterred from voluntarily giving information or making complaints\u2019 \u201d to government agencies. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Adler </em>[C.A.2, 1967], 380 F.2d 917, 922, certiorari denied [1967], 389 U.S. 1006, 88 S.Ct. 561, 19 L.Ed.2d 602).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><em>Rodgers </em>and its progeny make clear the strong governmental interest in facilitating law enforcement by discouraging individuals from knowingly giving false information to confound the justice system. The act of lying in the course of a police investigation can result in even greater harms than hindering officers in identifying suspects or solving crimes. False information that is grounded in accurate fact, as in <em>Fisher, </em>could lead to the arrest and possible conviction of an innocent person. The interests of the state in criminalizing these unsworn false oral statements outweigh an individual\u2019s interest in protecting a lie. Although the possibility of police wrongdoing does exist, it does not override the state\u2019s interest in promoting the honesty of its citizens and preventing the waste of limited police resources diverted by false information.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Furthermore, ample deterrents to police coercion are afforded by other means. Perhaps most significant is the constitutional protection of the privilege against self-incrimination. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect a person\u2019s right to remain silent in response to incriminating inquiries. This right effectively eliminates the alleged \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d that a suspect could face during a criminal investigation. The privilege, however, cannot be extended to include false oral statements made to mislead law enforcement officers. \u201cOur legal system provides methods for challenging the Government\u2019s right to ask questions \u2014 lying is not one of them. A citizen may decline to answer the question, or answer it honestly, but he cannot with impunity knowingly and willfully answer with a falsehood.\u201d <em>Bryson, supra, </em>396 U.S. at 72, 90 S.Ct. at 360, 24 L.Ed.2d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In addition, federal case law has created the protection of an \u201cexculpatory no\u201d exception. See <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rios </em>(C.A.5, 1994), 14 F.3d 1040, 1043, fn. 4, 5, and 6. But, see, <em>United States v. Steele </em>(C.A.6, 1991), 933 F.2d 1313, 1320, certiorari denied (1991), 502 U.S. 909,-112 S.Ct. 303, 116 L.Ed.2d 246. Under this exception, general negative and exculpatory responses made by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>subject of a criminal investigation in reply to questions directed to him by investigators is not a crime under federal law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">With the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the federal statute from which the statutes in <em>Fisher </em>and <em>Rogers </em>were derived, and mindful of the available protections, we review the conviction of the defendant herein for a violation of R.C. 2921.32(A)(5), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201c(A) No person, with purpose to hinder the discovery, apprehension, prosecution, conviction, or punishment of another for crime, or to assist another to benefit from the commission of a crime, shall do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\"><em>({ </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\"><em>\u201c(5) </em>Communicate false information to any person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">There can be no question that the words uttered by defendant to the officers as she blocked the entrance to her home constituted the communication of false information. A trier of fact could reasonably conclude from the evidence that defendant\u2019s purpose in making the false communication to the law enforcement officers was to hinder the discovery or apprehension of Marvin Woodfork.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The state has a legitimate interest in aiding the law enforcement process by discouraging individuals from purposely giving false information that impedes the operation of the justice system. Full and honest cooperation with public officials, especially the police, by citizens is vital to the effective operation of this system. <em>Columbus v. New </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 221, 1 OBR 244, 438 N.E.2d 1155. We hold, therefore, that the making of an unsworn false oral statement to a law enforcement officer with the purpose to hinder the officer\u2019s investigation of a crime is punishable conduct within the meaning of R.C. 2921.32(A)(5). Our holdings in <em>Columbus v. Fisher </em>and <em>Dayton v. Rogers </em>are hereby limited to the facts in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b588-12\">Douglas, F.E.

R.C. 2921.13 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-13\">\u201c(A) No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-14\">\u201c(3) The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in performing his official function.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\">.

I certainly agree with the result achieved by the court of appeals, as it tracks the reasoning announced in <em>Columbus v. Fisher </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 25, 7 O.O.3d 78, 372 N.E.2d 583, and <em>Dayton v. Rogers </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 162, 14 O.O.3d 403, 398 N.E.2d 781. Further, I believe the General Assembly never \u201cintended to make the utterance of unsworn oral misstatements, in response to inquiries initiated by law enforcement officials, punishable conduct.\u201d <em>Fisher, supra, </em>53 Ohio St.2d at 29, 7 O.O.3d at 80, 372 N.E.2d at 585. However, pursuant to well-established principles of statutory construction, I am not permitted to rely upon the \u201clegislative intent\u201d of R.C. 2921.32(A)(5)- to reach an interpretation inconsistent with that statute\u2019s clear and unambiguous language. <em>Slingluffv. Weaver </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 621, 64 N.E. 574, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cThe question is not what did the general assembly intend to enact, but what is the meaning of that which it did enact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 34, 36, 548 N.E.2d 929, 932 (stating that \u201c[t]he question regarding what the General Assembly intended to enact will not be entertained when the meaning of what was enacted is clear and plainly expressed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On its face, R.C. 2921.32(A)(5) clearly proscribes any person from communicating false information to any person with the purpose of hindering the discovery or apprehension of another for crime. Accordingly, I reluctantly concur in the majority opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b589-7\">A.W. Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
