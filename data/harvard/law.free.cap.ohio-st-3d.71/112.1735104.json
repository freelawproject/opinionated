For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">The commission found that Dr. Kaffen\u2019s July 2, 1991 report was the earliest credible evidence of permanent total disability and started benefits as of that date. Claimant contends that some of the earlier evidence before the commission was equally persuasive, warranting an earlier commencement date. Acceptance of claimant\u2019s argument necessitates abandonment of a fundamental precept \u2014 the commission is solely responsible for assessing evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">The fact remains, that, for whatever reason, her applications were not processed sooner. Perhaps the delay was due to claimant\u2019s relocation to Florida or perhaps to an administrative error. Regardless of the reason, the delay, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>regrettable, cannot compel payment of compensation over a period in which there is no evidence of permanent total disability. As the appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATs\">\u201cWhile the delays in this case do not reflect well upon the Industrial Commission, the order which sets forth the reason for the commencement date of the permanent total disability compensation is one of the most cogent orders which has come before the court in recent history.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The appellate court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Wright and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b254-8\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b254-9\">F.E.
