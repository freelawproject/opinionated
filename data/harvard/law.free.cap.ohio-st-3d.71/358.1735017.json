(136 Ohio Laws, Part 1, 1160-1161.) For \u201cgood cause shown\u201d claimant could later change that election. <em>(Id. </em>at 1160.) R.C. 4123.57(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">\u201cGood cause\u201d was first defined in <em>State ex rel. Fellers v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App.3d 247, 248, 9 OBR 421, 422, 459 N.E.2d 605, 606:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-17\">\u201c \u2018Good cause\u2019 is demonstrated when, at the time of making the first election, subsequently occurring circumstances were not foreseeable. If a person suffers what appears to be a minor injury, at the time of election, but the injury subsequently causes major problems to the relator\u2019s health and earning power, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>such a change of circumstances constitutes \u2018good cause,\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 4123.57, for a change of election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">That definition was approved in <em>State ex rel. Simpson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 162, 580 N.E.2d 779. <em>Simpson, </em>however, added that, along with foreseeability, \u201cgood cause\u201d required a showing of actual impaired earning capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 164, 580 N.E.2d at 781, fn. 1. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Combs v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 378, 381, 582 N.E.2d 990, 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We elaborated on this definition in <em>State ex rel. Long v. Mihm </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 527, 529, 597 N.E.2d 134, 136:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">\u201c \u2018To establish good cause, a claimant must prove (1) unforeseen changed circumstances subsequent to the initial election, and (2) actual impaired earning capacity.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\u201c \u2018Unforeseen changed circumstances\u2019 has two elements, with changed circumstances being a condition precedent to consideration of foreseeability. The term appears to be deliberately flexible in order to accommodate the many possible situations that could merit a change of election. In our limited encounters with \u2018good cause,\u2019 we have thus far provided three examples of unforeseen changed circumstances sufficient to justify an election change: (1) significant worsening of claimant\u2019s condition * * *; (2) unexpected transformation of a nonwork-preventive injury into a work-prohibitive one ***[;] and (3) recognition of additional conditions after election * * *.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Claimant cites <em>Long\u2019s </em>first example as justification for an election change. Claimant\u2019s position fails. Claimant\u2019s permanent partial disability did increase from twelve to forty percent. However, under similar circumstances in <em>State ex rel. Doughty v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 610, 612, 622 N.E.2d 1081, 1083, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">\u201cWe also do not find that claimant\u2019s increase in disability from twenty-one to thirty-nine percent, standing alone, demonstrates a \u2018significant worsening\u2019 of claimant\u2019s condition. Our holding is supported by <em>Simpson, supra, </em>in which a twenty-percent increase in disability, in and of itself, did not justify an election change. To define \u2018significant\u2019 in purely numerical terms is untenable because no two claimants, or the circumstances accompanying their change of election requests, are the same. A claimant with an already high percentage of disability may finally be forced from the work force by a small increase in disability. A different claimant, on the other hand, with a low percentage of disability may be virtually unaffected by such an increase. The significance of a disability increase, therefore, must be decided on a case-by-case basis, based on the totality of the attendant circumstances. In this case, absent nothing more than a sheer mathematical increase in percentage of disability, we decline to find that claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>has established that his condition has sufficiently changed so as to warrant further inquiry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Dr. Meyer attested to the significant <em>improvement </em>in claimant\u2019s condition after his 1989 operation. While it may not have returned claimant to his pre-injury state, the degree of post-operative recovery negates claimant\u2019s assertion that a significant worsening of his condition has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Claimant\u2019s reliance on <em>Fellers </em>and <em>Combs, supra, </em>is equally misplaced, as both cases had an added element that distinguishes them from this case. In addition to a substantial post-election disability percentage increase, the claimant in <em>Combs </em>was allowed several serious post-election \" conditions. The disability percentage increase in <em>Fellers, </em>on the other hand, was accompanied by a post-election inability to work. In this case, claimant\u2019s inability to return to work at Krogers was not injury-induced, which eliminates any \u201cgood cause\u201d parallels with <em>Fellers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Claimant puts considerable stock on his return to light work following surgery. Claimant, however, was performing light duty work not only before his surgery, but performed it at one time before his initial election as well. There is thus no work-related change that would substantiate claimant\u2019s allegation of \u201cgood cause.\u201d Having disposed of this issue, we need not consider the companion question of claimant\u2019s actual impaired earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Claimant also argues that the district hearing officer\u2019s order does not comply with <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721. This is incorrect. The order identifies Dr. Meyer\u2019s report as the evidence relied on establishing a lack of good cause. Since claimant alleged only one basis for good cause due to unforeseen changed circumstances\u2014 significant worsening of his condition \u2014 and since Dr. Meyer\u2019s report clearly indicates otherwise, the commission\u2019s evidentiary explanation is adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The appellate judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b501-11\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
