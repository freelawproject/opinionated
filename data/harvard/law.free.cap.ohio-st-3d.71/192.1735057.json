For the reasons to follow, we find that he can not.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-19\"><em>State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 42, 517 N.E.2d 533, denied temporary total disability compensation to a claimant in state prison. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Applying principles articulated earlier in <em>State ex rel. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 29 Ohio App.3d 145, 29 OBR 162, 504 N.E.2d 451, and <em>State ex rel. Ramirez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586, we concluded that in the case of incarceration, it was claimant\u2019s own actions, not the industrial injury, that precluded a return to the former position of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The holding in <em>Ashcraft </em>was introduced by the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cAt the outset, this court takes notice of the fact that effective August 22, 1986, the legislature amended R.C. 4123.54 to prohibit a claimant\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation or benefits while confined in a penal institution in this or any state for conviction of a violation of the criminal law of this or any other state. <em>Hence, the resolution of this matter will only concern workers\u2019 compensation applications filed before August 22, 1986.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Ashcraft, </em>34 Ohio St.3d at 43, 517 N.E.2d at 534.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The present claimant was injured in 1988. Relying on the language quoted above, claimant argues that <em>Ashcraft </em>is inapplicable, and that temporary total disability compensation is therefore payable. Claimant\u2019s assertion, however, fails upon closer review.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Claimant interprets <em>Ashcraft\u2019s </em>preamble too broadly. The introductory passage did not declare that the logic underlying <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Jones &amp; </em>Laughlin\u2014 on which <em>Ashcraft </em>was based \u2014 was invalid or confined to pre-1986 claims. It instead acknowledged its statutory codification. We need not rely on <em>Ashcraft </em>to find a prohibition against the award of temporary total disability compensation to federal inmates. We may do so based on <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>alone. Claimant ignores the most critical element of this issue \u2014 that the type of incarceration does not change the fact that incarceration changes the nature of employment abandonment from involuntary to voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The judgment of the appellate court is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-11\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
