The BTA also found: \u201c * * * it became unnecessary for the Tax Commissioner to focus on the method of financing * * * [and] the statute exempts all hospital facilities even when partially financed by health care revenue bonds.\u201d This latter finding is paramount because it is the sole issue challenged by the commissioner in his appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Appellant might have prevailed on the basis of our holdings in <em>Dublin School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 255, 631 N.E.2d 604, and <em>Judson Retirement Community v. Limbach </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 239, 638 N.E.2d 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">R.C. 140.08 exempts \u201call hospital facilities purchased, acquired, constructed, or owned by a public hospital agency, or financed in whole or in part by obligations issued by a public hospital agency * * *.\u201d The BTA was correct in deciding that Centerville was, by definition, a public hospital agency and that the first requirement for exemption was satisfied, because the property was \u201cowned by a public hospital agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Under <em>Dublin </em>it then became necessary to determine whether the property was used in whole or in part as hospital facilities, <em>i.e., </em>whether the applicant, as a public hospital agency which owned the subject property, qualified for the exemption on the basis that since part of the \u201ccampus\u201d was financed, the entire campus was exempt from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">In his brief, the commissioner emphasized the financial aspect of the improvements to Bethany Village, <em>i.e., </em>subjecting them to a mortgage. However, neither the notice of appeal nor the brief raised the issue of whether the disputed parts of the property were used as hospital facilities. Thus, we cannot now address that issue and, accordingly, the decision of the BTA must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">For the foregoing reasons the decision of the BTA is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b353-14\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
