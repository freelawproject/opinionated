Kim Wade, Asst. U.S. Atty., Dallas, Tex., for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1202-7\">Before RUBIN, POLITZ, and HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1202-8\">ALVIN B. RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">A federal statute makes criminal the transmission of wagers in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court held in <em>Martin v. United </em>States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that such transmission is proscribed whether or not wagering is forbidden by the law of the state where the bet is received. That decision determines the law of the circuit, so we affirm a conviction for receiving bets on baseball and football games by telephone from Texas to Massachusetts despite the lack of evidence or any charge that placing such bets in Massachusetts was a state criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">James V. McDonough, who received the thirteen bets charged, asserts correctly that Congress has left, and by virtue of our federal system must leave, to the states the enforcement of laws against gambling within the states. He also asserts, again correctly, that many federal anti-gambling laws, enacted in reliance on the powers given Congress by the Commerce Clause,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> forbid only gambling in violation of state law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These postulates, however, do not, support the conclusion that 18 U.S.C.', \u00a7 1084(a), which contains no such provi- \u2019 sion, should be read as if it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-18\">McDonough contends that a federal anti-gambling law punishing conduct that is not unlawful under state law yields \u201can unworkable result.\u201d As w\u00e9 observed in <em>Martin, </em>however, section 1084,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4dl\">was part of an omnibus crime bill that recognized the need for independent federal action to combat interstate gambling operations. Other sections prohibited interstate transportation of gambling paraphernalia, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1953, interstate transportation of gambling machines, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1171, and interstate travel in aid of racketeering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952. Moreover, this series of legislation does not stand alone, but appears as part of an independent federal policy aimed at those who would, in furtherance of any gambling activity, employ any means within direct federal control.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Act\">McDonough contends that this statement is incorrect because the Congressional purpose reflected by other provisions of the omnibus crime bill was to punish only conduct that in some way violated state law. Even were the argument correct, we would be bound by <em>Martin </em>as the law of the circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-19\">Were we free, however, to reconsider the question we would reach the same result, for it is commanded by the plain words of the statute and by its purpose as announced in the legislative history. The statute is clear and explicit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The legislative history sets forth a dual purpose \u2014 to assist the various states in enforcing their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>gambling laws <em>\u201cand </em>to aid in the suppression of organized gambling activities ...\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the discussion of Subsection (b) of the statute, which permits the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets from a state where betting on a particular event is legal to another state where such betting is legal, the House of Representatives Report specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1203-4\">Nothing in the exemption, however, will permit the transmission of bets and wagers ... from or to any State <em>whether betting is legal in that State or not. </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">For these reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1202-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084(a) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1202-12\">. 389 F.2d 895 (5th Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>391 U.S. 919, 88 S.Ct. 1808, 20 L.Ed.2d 656 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1202-13\">.
