The opinion reported at 832 F.2d 339 is withdrawn and the following is substituted. After conducting a <em>Spears </em>hearing, the district court dismissed the <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 1983 suit by Terry Ray James, exercising the authority granted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). For the reasons assigned, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-19\">The genesis of this case is an incident that allegedly occurred in 1984 when James made a request of his jailers that he said resulted in their physically assaulting him. The district court afforded James an opportunity to orally present the specifics of his case and to amplify upon his pleadings. The court then concluded that James \u201cdid not suffer a serious, debilitating or permanent injury\u201d and that his allegations pointed to an isolated incident and were \u201cat best, conclusory.\u201d The court concluded that the facts, \u201ceven when considered in the light most favorable to [James], do not demonstrate that the officers\u2019 conduct violated any rights secured by the Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-20\">The claim of one seeking <em>in forma pauperis </em>status must cross the threshold of litigation worthiness. <em>Cay v. Estelle, </em>789 F.2d 318 (5th Cir.1986). In deter mining whether a case should be allowed to proceed IFP or be dismissed as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), we have formulated a three-pronged test: (1) does the complaint have a realistic chance for success; (2) does it present an arguably sound basis in fact and law; and (3) can the complainant prove any set of facts that would warrant relief? <em>See Green v. McKaskle, </em>788 F.2d 1116, 1120 (5th Cir.1986); <em>see also Anderson v. Coughlin, </em>700 F.2d 37, 43 (2d Cir.1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-21\">Not all applications of force in penal settings rise to the level of constitutional violations. The eighth amendment proscribes the use of cruel and unusual punishment, not merely punishment. The permissive level of force in the pursuit of prison security is governed by the standard announced in <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>312, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986), which inquires \u201c \u2018whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>475 U.S. at 320-21, 106 S.Ct. at 1085, 89 L.Ed. at 261 <em>(quoting Johnson v. Glick, </em>481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. John v. Johnson, </em>414 U.S. 1033, 94 S.Ct. 462, 38 L.Ed.2d 324 (1973). Moreover, in excessive force cases involving prison inmates, \u201cthe Due Process Clause affords ... no greater protection than does the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.\u201d <em>Whitley, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The district court\u2019s finding that the complaint related to an isolated incident of non-remarkable proportions places the matter squarely within the reach of Whitley; there was nothing to indicate that the force was used \u201cmaliciously or sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The district court did not err in dismissing the claim under \u00a7 1915(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-17\">. There has been some consideration whether the \u00a7 1915(d) dismissal should be equated with a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal. In <em>Bienvenu v. Beauregard Parish Police Jury, </em>705 F.2d 1457 (5th Cir.1983), we stated that although the court has wider discretion to dismiss u claim under \u00a7 1915(d) than under Rule 12, the standard for determining legal sufficiency of a complaint is the same under either. In <em>Cay v. Estelle, </em>789 F.2d 318, 326 (5th Cir.1986), we again considered the matter but doubted the appropriateness of equating the standard for 12(b)(6) dismissal with frivolousness. The <em>Cay </em>panel looked to the illumination of <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>700 F.2d 37 (2d Cir.1983). Of importance is the distinction that the \u00a7 1915(d) concept of frivolousness is not limited to a failure to state a claim. Rather, it embraces cases beyond credulity or possessed of little promise of success on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
