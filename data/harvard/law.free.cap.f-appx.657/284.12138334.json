Whitlock (\u2018Whitlock\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b307-22\">Whitlock was a truck driver employed by Lazer Spot, Inc. (\u201cLazer Spot\u201d), in Monroe, Louisiana from November 2012 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>until October 4, 2013. Lazer Spot terminated Whitlock\u2019s employment, stating that he had driven away from a loading dock while the light was red. Whitlock, who is African American, filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which issued a right-to-sue letter on March 10, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">On June 8, 2015, Whitlock, represented by counsel, filed a complaint in district court, alleging claims of racial discrimination and hostile work environment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. <em>See </em>42 \u25a0 U.S. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>Lazer Spot filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that Whitlock\u2019s conclu-sory allegations failed to state a claim. The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to grant the motion to dismiss. The district court accepted the recommendation and granted the motion to dismiss, opining that Whitlock\u2019s factual allegations failed to state a claim as a matter of law either for discriminatory discharge or a hostile work environment. Whitlock now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, \u201caccepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Stokes v. Gann, </em>498 F.3d 483, 484 (5th Cir. 2007). However, \u201c[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclu-sory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation omitted). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). A \u201cclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949 (citing <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). \u201cDetermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will ... be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">III. DISMISSAL FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Whitlock contends that the district court erred in granting the motion to dismiss his complaint for failure to state a claim. Rule 12(b)(6). In his complaint, Whitlock alleged a claim of racial discrimination. Our precedent is clear that Whit-lock \u201cneed not make out a prima facie case of discrimination in order to survive a rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\u201d <em>Raj v. La. State Univ., </em>714 F.3d 322, 331 (5th Cir, 2013) (citing <em>Swier-kiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 510-12, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002)). The ultimate question in a Title VII discrimination case is \u201c \u2018whether a defendant took the adverse employment action against a plaintiff <em>because of </em>her protected status.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kanida v. Gulf Coast Med. Personnel LP, </em>363 F.3d 568, 576 (5th Cir. 2004)). Accordingly, we must determine whether Whitlock\u2019s complaint sufficiently alleged that Lazer Spot terminated him because he is African American.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Whitlock\u2019s complaint alleged that Lazer Spot terminated his employment because he \u201cpulled away from a loading dock while the light was red.\u201d Whitlock also alleged that the purported reason for termination was \u201cuntrue and just a cover-up for the racial discrimination. White employees who commit infractions more serious than the one [Whitlock] is accused [of] committing are not terminated.\u201d Further, Whit-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>lock\u2019s complaint alleged that he \u201cwas punished for infractions that white employees were not punished for. The discrimination within the workplace createfd] a hostile work environment that was difficult for [him] to endure. [Lazer Spot\u2019s] actions caused stress related problems. A white employee was allowed to ride around in a pickup truck without doing his job duties but given credit for the work done by African-American employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">These conclusory allegations do not contain sufficient content to allow us to draw the inference that Lazer Spot is liable for terminating Whitlock\u2019s employment because of his race. The complaint fails to specify the white employees\u2019 work violations. It also fails to allege the white employees\u2019 jobs at Lazer Spot. Because the complaint does not have facial plausibility with respect to the discriminatory, discharge claim, the district court did not err in granting the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The district court also ruled that Whitlock\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim for a hostile work environment. \u201cIn determining whether a workplace constitutes a hostile work environment, courts must consider the following circumstances: \u2018the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ramsey v. Henderson, </em>286 F.3d 264, 268 (5th Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>Walker v. Thompson, </em>214 F.3d 615, 625 (5th Cir. 2000)). Further, to constitute a. hostile work environment claim, the \u201cunlawful employment practice must have occurred \u2018over a series of days or perhaps years and, in direct contrast to discrete acts, a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mack v. John L. Wortham &amp; Son, L.P., </em>541 Fed.Appx. 348, 356-57 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 115, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed,2d 106 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Here, as set forth previously, the complaint alleged that Whitlock \u201cwas punished for infractions that white employees were not punished for. The discrimination within the workplace create[d] a hostile work environment that was difficult for [him] to endure. The defendant\u2019s actions caused stress related problems. A white employee was allowed to ride around in a pickup truck without doing his job duties but given credit for the work done by African-American employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Whitlock\u2019s complaint wholly fails to allege facts that demonstrate that he was repeatedly subjected to harassment that was linked to his race. We agree with the district court that the complaint fails to state a claim with respect to a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">For the above reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
