The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all claims. Coons appeals, arguing that the County is liable for maintaining a policy or custom that caused his unlawful detention, and that Peek is individually liable because he was not entitled to either qualified immunity under federal law or official immunity under state law. After careful review, we affirm the judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">On June 11, 2004, Coons pled guilty to theft by taking in Georgia state court. He was sentenced to a total term of ten years of probation, with the \u201cfirst 5 years to be served on work release until restitution is paid\u201d and the remainder of the sentence to be served on probation.- If Coons paid restitution before five years passed, he would be relieved of his work-release obligation at that time. Otherwise he would have to stay in work release for the full five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">The work-release program is basically part-time incarceration. The program allows inmates to maintain regular employment outside of custody while serving their non-working time in custody. Failure to abide by the terms and conditions of the program, including failure to return to custody at the designated time, may result in termination from the program and transfer to full-time incarceration. Georgia law also makes it a felony for a person, having been convicted of a felony, to fail to return to custody after having been released on the condition that he or she will return. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-10-52(a)(5), (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">On April 14, 2005, Gwinnett County Superior Court Judge Ronnie Batchelor issued an order releasing Coons from work release for two days so that he could attend his grandmother\u2019s funeral. Coons failed to return by the deadline set in Judge Batchelor\u2019s order, however, leading the state to charge Coons with escape, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-10-52. Judge Batchelor issued a warrant for Coons\u2019s arrest on April 25, 2005, but Coons was not arrested until February 2012, nearly seven years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">In April 2012 the state petitioned to revoke Coons\u2019s probation based on his escape. At a probation-revocation hearing, Judge Batchelor partially revoked Coons\u2019s probation and ordered him to serve ten months in custody, with credit for time served since his arrest and \u201c2 for 1 credit.\u201d With these credits, Coons\u2019s ten-month revocation sentence was set to expire on July 14, 2012. Judge Batchelor further ordered, \u201cUpon his release, [Coons] is to comply with all the remaining conditions of his probated sentence, including the restitution.\u201d In Coons\u2019s view, Judge Batchelor intended that he be released on July 14, 2012, to serve the remainder of his sentence on regular probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">However, on July 13, 2012, one day before the end of his revocation sentence, Coons was transferred back to the custody of the work-release program and served with, a disciplinary report charging him with escape. That same day, the escape charge was investigated, and, after a disciplinary hearing, a disciplinary hearing officer found Coons guilty of escape and recommended that he be removed from the work-release program\u2014and incarcerated full-time\u2014for the remainder of his sentence. Per Gwinnett County Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) policies, the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>ommendation of the disciplinary hearing officer was submitted to Defendant Peek, Warden of the DOC at the time, who was authorized to approve, disapprove, or modify the disciplinary hearing officer\u2019s findings and recommendations. On July 16, 2012, Peek approved the recommendation to remove Coons from the work release program and to incarcerate him full-time.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Coons remained incarcerated from July 13, 2012, until his release on May 17, 2013. During that time, Coons wrote Peek on numerous occasions explaining that' he was supposed to be released on July 14, 2012, to continue with probation. Coons also filed two <em>pro se </em>motions to modify his sentence, in November and December 2012, respectively, which Judge Batchelor denied. Coons eventually obtained legal counsel, who filed a motion to modify the terms of the probation revocation sentence on May 10, 2013. On May 17, 2013, Judge Batche-lor granted the motion and ordered Coons released from custody. Coons served the remainder of his ten-year sentence, which ended in June 2014, on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In July 2014, Coons filed this lawsuit against Peek and Gwinnett County. Invoking 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1986, and Georgia state law, Coons alleged that the defendants violated his rights to due process, to be free from forced servitude, and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The defendants removed the complaint to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and later moved for summary judgment. Peek asserted that he was shielded from the individual-capacity federal claims by the doctrine of qualified immunity and from the individual-capacity state claims by the Georgia doctrine of official immunity. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all claims. Coons now brings this appeal, challenging the disposition of his \u00a7 1983 claims against Gwinnett County and his \u00a7 1983 and state claims against Peek in his individual capacity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standards that governed the district court. <em>Bradley v. Franklin Collection Serv., Inc., </em>739 F.3d 606, 608 (11th Cir. 2014). We consider the record and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Coons, the non-moving party. <em>See id. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the mov-ant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). We may affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on any adequate ground supported by the record, even if it is not one on which the district court relied. <em>Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, </em>707 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">Coons\u2019s essential contention is that he was unlawfully detained for a longer period than authorized by the \u201cplain wording of multiple judicial orders.\u201d More precisely, he asserts that he was entitled to be released the date his revocation sentence ended on July 14, 2012, ten months before his actual release in May 2013. According to Coons, the work-release portion of his sentence expired after five years (in 2009), because he was sentenced to' serve only the \u201cfirst\u201d five years on work release, and those years had passed because his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>tence had not tolled despite his escape.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, Coons claims, work release was not one of the \u201cremaining conditions of his probated sentence\u201d with which he needed to comply \u201cupon release\u201d from his revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Given the differing standards applicable to Coons\u2019s federal and state claims, we separate our discussion into two parts. First, we conclude that summary judgment was appropriate on Coons\u2019s federal claims: Gwinnett County did not have a policy or custom that could subject it to \u00a7 1983 liability; and Peek is entitled to qualified immunity. Second, we hold that Peek is entitled to official immunity under Georgia law because his actions were discretionary in nature and there is no evidence he acted with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">A <em>Jp2 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 Claims against Gwinnett County</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Coons contends that Gwinnett County is liable for his allegedly unlawful detention because it had a policy or custom of holding inmates longer than judicially authorized. To hold a local government liable under \u00a7 1983, the plaintiff must identify a \u201cpolicy\u201d or \u201ccustom\u201d that caused the alleged constitutional violations. <em>McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283, 1290 (11th Cir. 2004). For a plaintiff to demonstrate such a policy or custom, \u201cit is generally necessary to show a persistent and wide-spread practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cProof of a single incident of unconstitutional activity is not sufficient to impose liability against a municipality,\u201d \u201ceven when the incident involves several employees of the municipality.\u201d <em>Craig v. Floyd Cty., Ga., </em>643 F.3d 1306, 1310-11 (11th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Here, Coons has not shown that the alleged constitutional violations arose out of a policy or custom. For example, he has not produced evidence of another inmate in Gwinnett County detained beyond the date authorized by a court order. The only evidence on which Coons relies is his own experience. But this isolated incident is insufficient to impose liability on Gwin-nett County. <em>See id. </em>at 1312 (\u201cCraig relies on his own experience, which is, at most, proof of a single incident of unconstitutional activity ... [that] is not sufficient to impose liability under \u00a7 1983.\u201d (alteration adopted; citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>McDowell, </em>392 F.3d at 1290-91. Consequently, the district court properly granted summary judgment to Gwinnett County.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">\n<em>B. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 Claims against Peek</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">Peek invoked the defense of qualified immunity for the federal claims against him in his individual capacity, and the district court found that he was entitled to it. Qualified immunity protects government officials engaged in discretionary functions and sued in their individual capacities unless they violate \u201cclearly established federal statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Keating </em>v. <em>City of Miami, </em>598 F.3d 753, 762 (11th Cir. 2010) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">To raise the defense of qualified immunity, the official must first show that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority. <em>Maddox v. Stephens, </em>727 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>1109, 1120 (11th Cir. 2013). We have \u201cinterpreted the term \u2018discretionary authority\u2019 to include all actions of a governmental official that (1) Vere undertaken pursuant to the performance of his duties,\u2019 and (2) were \u2018within the scope of his authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jordan v. Doe, </em>38 F.3d 1559, 1566 (11th Cir. 1994) (quoting <em>Rich v. Dollar, </em>841 F.2d 1558, 1564 (11th Cir. 1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Coons contends that Peek could not have been acting within the scope of his authority because Peek had no authority over Coons as of July 14, 2012, at the latest, the date Coons\u2019s revocation sentence ended and two days before Peek revoked his work-release status. However, \u201c[t]he inquiry is not whether it was within the defendant\u2019s authority to commit the allegedly illegal act. Framed that way, the inquiry is no more than an \u2018untenable\u2019 tautology.\u201d <em>Harbert Int'l, Inc. v. James, </em>157 F.3d 1271, 1282 (11th Cir. 1998). Instead, we ask \u201cwhether the act complained of, if done for a proper purpose, would be within, or reasonably related to, the outer perimeter of an official\u2019s discretionary duties. The scope of immunity should be determined by the relation of the [injury] complained of to the duties entrusted to the officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Here, Peek has met his burden of showing that he was acting with the scope of his discretionary authority. As Warden of the DOC, Peek was authorized to approve, reject, or modify the recommendations of disciplinary hearing officers. Furthermore, he was authorized by statute to revoke work-release status \u201cfor any reason for which work release status would otherwise be revoked,\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-l(g)(2), such as escape from custody. Thus, Peek had the authority to revoke work release for escape and to transfer an inmate to full-time incarceration. Accordingly, Peek\u2019s actions were \u201ccarried out in the performance of his normal job duties and were within the authority delegated to him by his employer.\u201d <em>See Rich, </em>841 F.2d at 1564.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">So the burden shifts to Coons to show that Peek is not entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Maddox, </em>727 F.3d at 1120. To meet that burden, Coons must demonstrate both that Peek violated a constitutional right and that the right was \u201cclearly established ... in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition[,]\u201d at the time of the alleged violation. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). We may decide these issues in either order, but the plaintiff must make both showings to survive a qualified-immunity defense. <em>Maddox, </em>727 F.3d at 1120-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">With regard to the constitutional violations at issue, this Circuit recognizes that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees to individuals the right to be free from excessive continued detention after a jail or prison ceases to have a legal right to detain the individual. <em>See Cannon v. Macon Cty., </em>1 F.3d 1558, 1562-63 (11th Cir. 1993); <em>Douthit v. Jones, </em>619 F.2d 527, 532 (5th Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Coons also alleged that his continued detention violated the Eighth and Thirteenth Amendments, but he has identified no precedent recognizing these theories of alleged constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">In any case, we conclude that, even if constitutional violations occurred, Coons has not shown that Peek violated clearly established law in the specific context of this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe touchstone of qualified im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>munity is notice[,]\u201d or fair warning. <em>Moore v. Pederson, </em>806 F.3d 1036, 1046 (11th Cir. 2015). A constitutional right is not clearly established, and an official is entitled to qualified immunity, unless \u201ca reasonable official would understand that his conduct violates that right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]his inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.\u201d <em>Coffin v. Brandan, </em>642 F.3d 999, 1013 (11th Cir. 2011) <em>(en banc) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Here, Coons has not shown that Peek violated clearly established law because a reasonable official would not have understood, in the specific context of this case, that continuing to detain Coons violated his constitutional rights. In practical \u2022terms, Coons has made no showing that he was clearly entitled to be released on July 14, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">As an initial matter, Coons has not identified any materially similar precedent on point that would have alerted Peek that his actions were unlawful. Instead, Coons relies on the wording of his original sentence and of Judge Batchelor\u2019s revocation order, which together, he asserts, clearly establish his right to be released to regular probation on July 14, 2012. We cannot agree, even with the benefit of hindsight.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The relevant judicial orders are ambiguous as to whether work release remained a condition of Coons\u2019s probated sentence following July 14, 2012. The judge who imposed Coons\u2019s original sentence appears to have placed- a five-year limit on Coons\u2019s work release and may have intended for Coons to serve the \u201cfirst\u201d five years on work release, but the sentence also contemplates that Coons would \u201ccomplete\u201d five years or pay restitution, not simply pass the time in some way. The original sentence simply does not account for the possibility that Coons would escape but the sentence would not be tolled. Nor do Judge Batchelor\u2019s actions at the probation-revocation hearing clarify matters. Judge Batchelor ordered Coons to comply with \u201call remaining conditions of his probated sentence\u201d upon his release fi\u2019om the revocation sentence, but work release was not discussed at the probation-revocation hearing, so there is little to indicate whether Judge Batchelor thought that work release was such a remaining condition or intended Coons to return to work release.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Faced with judicial orders that provide little guidance, and with no precedent on point, a reasonable official would not have known that Coons was not subject to work release and that revoking his work-release status based on his prior escape was unlawful. <em>See Moore, </em>806 F.3d at 1046. When Coons was transferred back to the work release program in July 2012, he had not complied with the conditions of his original sentence: He had not completed five years in the work-release program or paid restitution in full. Instead, he spent ten months in the work-release program before escaping for the next seven years. In light of these facts, it would have been reasonable for an official in Peek\u2019s place to conclude that work release was a \u201cremaining condition\u201d of his probated sentence with which Coons needed to comply. And if Coons was subject to work release, revocation of his work-release status was warranted for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>having escaped over seven years earlier. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-l(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Although Coons, after his work-status had been revoked, protested to Peek that he was entitled to be released earlier, Coons\u2019s protests were based on an interpretation of the same orders we have analyzed above and found ambiguous with respect to Coons\u2019s work-release obligation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, Coons\u2019s protests do not call into question the reasonableness of Peek\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In short, Peek is entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable official could \u201chave believed his or her conduct to be lawful in light of clearly established law and the information possessed by the official at the time the conduct occurred.\u201d <em>See Hardin v. Hayes, </em>957 F.2d 845, 848 (11th Cir. 1992). Coons has not identified any precedent or evidence that would have put Peek on notice that what he was doing violated Coons\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Moore, </em>806 F.3d at 1046. Therefore, the district court properly granted summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 claims against Peek in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">\n<em>C. State Law Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Finally, Coons argues that the district court erred in granting official immunity to Peek on the state-law claims against him. Under the doctrine of official immunity, state officers and employees are \u201cimmune from individual liability for discretionary acts undertaken in the course of their duties and performed without willfulness, malice, or corruption.\u201d <em>Reed v. DeKalb Cty., </em>264 Ga.App. 83, 589 S.E.2d 584, 587 (2003). So, absent actual malice, county officials are entitled to official immunity for negligently performed discretionary acts within the scope of their authority, but they may be held personally liable for negligently performed ministerial acts. <em>Roper v. Greenway, </em>294 Ga. 112, 751 S.E.2d 351, 352 (2013); <em>Parrish v. Akins, </em>233 Ga.App. 442, 504 S.E.2d 276, 278-79 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"APf\">Under Georgia law, \u201c[a] discretionary act ... calls for the exercise of personal deliberation and judgment, which in turn entails examining the facts, reaching reasoned conclusions, and <em>acting on them in a way not specifically directed.\u201d Roper, </em>751 S.E.2d at 354 (quotation. marks omitted; emphasis in original). A ministerial act, by contrast, is one done in the execution of a simple, specific duty. <em>Id. </em>at 353. \u201cA ministerial duty may be established by evidence such as a written policy, an unwritten policy, a supervisor\u2019s specific directive, or a statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Regardless of the source of the duty, however, the procedures or instructions establishing the duty must be \u201cclear, definite, and certain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWithout evidence of a policy establishing a specific duty,\u201d a defendant\u2019s actions cannot be considered to be in breach of a ministerial duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">Coons argues that official immunity does not apply because releasing him pursuant to a court order was a ministerial duty. But Coons has not shown that Peek had a \u201cclear, definite, and certain\u201d duty to release him on the date Coons asserts. As was have explained more fully above with regard to qualified immunity, whether Coons was subject to work release upon the end of his revocation sentence was ambiguous, and the decision to revoke Coons\u2019s work-release status was one corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>mitted to Peek\u2019s discretion and judgment. Thus, Coons has not shown that Peek breached a ministerial duty. <em>See id. </em>Nor does the record contain any evidence that Peek acted with actual malice or intent to injure. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">In sum, Peek is shielded from Coons\u2019s state-law claims by the doctrine of official immunity, and the district court properly granted summary judgment on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of th\u00e9 district court in favor of the defendants is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\">. Coons has abandoned his other claims, including claims under \u00a7\u00a7 1985 and 1986, state claims against Gwinnett County, claims against Peek in his official capacity, and any claims against unnamed John Does, by failing to raise them in his appellate brief. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680-82 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">. .The defendants agree that Coons\u2019s sentence did not toll for the seven-year period he was outside of custody after his escape. Had Coons's sentence tolled, the period he was outside of custody would not have counted towards satisfying his ten-year sentence. While the relevant statute authorizes tolling of a probated sentence in the event of escape, the steps necessary to toll a sentence were not taken in this case. See O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-8-36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\">. This Court adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions prior to October 1, 1981. <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en <em>banc).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b881-15\">. Our analysis of these claims differs from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>that of the district court, though we do not mean to imply that the district court was incorrect. <em>See Feliciano, </em>707 F.3d at 1252.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\">. Judge Batchelor has submitted an affidavit for this case stating that it was not his intention to relieve Coons from his work-release obligations. The fact that Judge Batchelor denied Coons\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motions in November and December 2012 supports that statement, though the judge\u2019s l\u00e1ter grant of Coons's counseled motion does not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b883-9\">. Nor would further investigation necessarily have clarified matters. The defendants submitted evidence showing that a classification officer with the DOC attempted to obtain clarification from Judge Batchelor regarding the terms of his order on July 17, 2012, and that, after speaking with Judge Batchelor's secretary, who spoke with the judge, the classification officer determined that Coons was still subject to work release.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
