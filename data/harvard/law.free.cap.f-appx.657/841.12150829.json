Saleem argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in failing to sua sponte reject his guilty plea as unknowing or involuntary. He argues that he pleaded guilty only because his counsel told him that he would be sentenced to less than 10-years imprisonment, and he did not know that his maximum possible sentence was greater than ten years. Upon careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">When a defendant does not object to the plea proceedings or move to withdraw his plea before the district court, we review for plain error the district court\u2019s compliance with the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. United States v. Rodriguez, 751 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir. 2014). \u201cTo establish plain error, a defendant must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). The defendant must also show a reasonable probability that he would not have entered the guilty plea but for the district court\u2019s error. Id. at 1252. \u201c[Wjhere the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d United States v. Lejarde-Rada, 319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">A guilty plea must \u201cbe made knowingly and voluntarily to satisfy the requirements of due process.\u201d United States v. Moriarty, 429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). In accepting a guilty plea, the district court must comply with three \u201ccore principles\u201d of Rule 11 to \u201censur[e] that a defendant (1) enters his guilty plea free from coercion, (2) understands the nature of the charges, and (3) understands the consequences of his plea.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). To do this, the district court \u201cmust inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands\u201d a number of things, including \u201cany maximum possible penalty,\u201d \u201cany mandatory minimum penalty,\u201d and \u201cthe [sentencing] court\u2019s obligation to calculate the applicable sentencing-guideline range and to consider that range, possible departures under the Sentencing Guidelines, and other sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>Under Rule 11, it is the district court\u2019s \u201cobligation and responsibility to conduct .a searching inquiry into the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s guilty plea.\u201d United States v. Siegel, 102 F.3d 477, 481 (11th Cir. 1996). In conducting this inquiry, there is a strong presumption that sworn statements made to the district court during a plea colloquy are true. United States v. Medlock, 12 F.3d 185, 187 (11th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">Saleem fails to show that the district court plainly erred in finding that his guilty plea was made knowingly arid voluntarily. The express terms of the plea agreement stated that the first two .counts carried \u201ca maximum sentence for each count of not more than 10 years\u2019 imprisonment,\u201d and the final count contained \u201ca maximum sentence of not more than 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d The agreement further stated that \u201c[t]he Court may, although it is not required to, impose the sentence for these charges consecutively.\u201d Saleem initialed the page of the plea agreement on which those maximum sentences appeared, and signed the final page of the agreement in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Saleem also verified under oath at his plea hearing that he understood the statutory m\u00e1ximums involved in his case and entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily. The district court asked during the plea colloquy whether Saleem had read the entire plea agreement, discussed it with his attorney, and felt \u201cconfident and comfortable that [he was] familiar with all the terms and representations contained in [it].\u201d Saleem responded in the affirmative. Saleem also verified that he had not been forced or coerced to plead guilty, and that he had entered into the agreement voluntarily and freely.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Saleem further verified that he understood the maximum sentence for each count of his plea after the district court had the government read those m\u00e1ximums aloud during the proceedings. He also confirmed that he understood that the sentences for each could be imposed consecutively at the court\u2019s discretion. The district court told Saleem that he \u201ccould, in theory, be exposed to as much as 40 years imprisonment. Do you understand that?\u201d Sa-leem responded, \u201c[y]es, Your Honor.\u201d The district, court also confirmed with Saleem that if the ultimate sentence based on the Sentencing Guidelines was higher than he anticipated, he would not be able to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">The district court found that Saleem\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary based on these statements at the plea hearing. There is a strong presumption that Saleem made these statements truthfully. See Medlock, 12 F.3d at 187. The district court\u2019s thorough inquiry, spanning more than twenty pages of hearing transcript, is further evidence that its inquiry into the voluntariness of Saleem\u2019s guilty plea was sufficiently searching.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Saleem identifies nothing in the record suggesting that the district court was aware of any conflicting representations made to him by his counsel as to his likely sentence or statutory m\u00e1ximums. Saleem also has not pointed to any particular rule, statute or case from the Supreme Court or this Court directly establishing that the district court erred or that the plea must be set aside in the circumstances of his case. See Lejarde-Rada, 319 F.3d at 1291. The district court sufficiently complied with its Rule 11 obligations and did not err, let alone plainly err, in determining that Saleem\u2019s guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
