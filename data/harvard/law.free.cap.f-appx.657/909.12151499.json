Bussey died following officers\u2019 attempts to restrain him pursuant to a Baker Act order.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">Bussey\u2019s personal representative, Plaintiff-Appellant J. Pearl Bussey-Morice, brought this case, asserting that Defendants-Appellees Officers Patrick Kennedy, Timothy Herberner, Timothy Hewatt, Iv-ette Gomez, Don Williams, Robert Owens, and Matthew Leverich violated Bussey\u2019s clearly established constitutional rights and that the City of Rockledge committed a battery upon Bussey resulting in wrongful death when Defendant Officers attempted to restrain Bussey. While the loss of Bussey\u2019s life is deeply regrettable, on this record, we cannot find that Defendant Officers violated Bussey\u2019s clearly established rights. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to these Defendants on qualified-immunity grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">As for Bussey-Morice\u2019s battery claim, we conclude that, in responding to the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, she waived the argument she makes before us and instead asserted the contrary position. Because Bussey-Morice may not raise a new argument for the first time on appeal, and because the district court did not err in dismissing Bussey-Morice\u2019s battery claim in view of what Bussey-Morice contended below, we affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on Bussey-Morice\u2019s battery claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-17\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b930-18\">We have previously discussed many of the underlying facts of this case in our prior opinion arising out of this incident. <em>See Bussey-Morice v. Gomez, </em>587 Fed.Appx. 621 (11th Cir. 2014) <em>[\u201cBussey </em>I\u201d]. But because <em>Bussey I </em>was not directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>concerned with Officer Kennedy\u2019s conduct, our opinion did not include all of the facts relevant to Kennedy\u2019s role. For this reason, we add to our prior recitation those facts concerning Kennedy and the other officers\u2019 reactions to his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Upon Kennedy\u2019s arrival at the scene, Bussey was handcuffed, lying on his stomach, and. continuing to struggle against multiple officers attempting to restrain him. Bussey was \u201ckicking violently\u201d and preventing officers from gaining control over his body. Kennedy joined the other officers by grabbing Bussey\u2019s feet and moving up Bussey\u2019s body in order to gain control of his upper torso and head. While Kennedy used his hand to control Bussey\u2019s head, Bussey began turning his head to spit. In response, Kennedy \u201ctried to use a pressure point technique\u201d in an attempt to elicit Bussey\u2019s compliance. Kennedy then used his knee to apply additional pressure to Bussey\u2019s head in order \u201cto keep him from biting somebody....\u201d Soon after that, Kennedy acquired a pillowcase from hospital staff and used it to cover Bussey\u2019s head. According to Kennedy, he checked numerous times to make sure the pillowcase was not restricting Bussey\u2019s ability to breathe. Once Bussey was injected with a sedative and anti-psychosis medication, Bussey\u2019s resistance began to diminish, and the officers were able to move him onto a gurney and strap him in. At some point, after Bussey was strapped into the gurney, he stopped breathing and passed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">II.Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Bussey-Morice brought suit on behalf of Bussey\u2019s estate, suing the City of Rock-ledge as well as the officers involved in the incident. Bussey-Morice\u2019s claims included a Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim against the officers and state-law claims against the City of Rockledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">After discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the City of Rockledge and all of the officers, except Officer Gomez and Sergeant Hewatt. We reversed the district court\u2019s decision denying summary judgment in favor of Gomez and Hewatt. Now, Bussey-Morice appeals three other findings made by the district court: first, that Officer Kennedy deserved qualified immunity despite the nature of the physical force he used against Bussey; second, that Officers Herberner, Williams, Owens, Gomez, Hewatt, and Leverich deserved qualified immunity despite their failure to intervene between Kennedy and Bussey; and third, that the City of Rockledge deserved sovereign immunity from Bussey-Morice\u2019s battery and wrongful-death claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">III.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s award of qualified immunity on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Sheth v. Webster, </em>145 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir. 1998). We similarly review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s award of sovereign immunity on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Seminole Tribe v. Florida, </em>11 F.3d 1016, 1021 (11th Cir. 1994); <em>Plancher v. UCF Ath. Ass\u2019n, Inc.,m </em>So.3d 724, 725 n.3 (Fla. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">Summary judgment should be granted when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). When reviewing summary judgments, we consider the record and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party\u2014here, Bussey-Morice. <em>Shiver v. Chertoff, </em>549 F.3d 1342, 1343 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted); <em>Hoyt v. Cooks, </em>672 F.3d 972, 977 (11th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">IV.Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">A. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">As we noted in <em>Bussey I, </em>the qualified-immunity defense aims at striking a bal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>anee between \u201cthe need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.\u201d <em>Pearson v. California </em>(2009). Qualified immunity protects government officials engaged in discretionary duties from being sued unless they violate \u201cclearly established federal statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Keating v. City of Miami, </em>598 F.3d 758, 762 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The purpose of .qualified immunity \u201cis to allow government officials to carry out their discretionary duties without the fear of personal liability or harassing litigation.\u201d <em>Durruthy v. Pastor, </em>351 F.3d 1080, 1087 (11th Cir. 2003). Qualified immunity protects from litigation \u201call but the plainly incompetent or one who is knowingly violating the federal law.\u201d <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1194 (11th Cir. 2002). As a result, qualified immunity \u201cliberates government agents from the need to constantly err on the side of caution by protecting them both from liability and the other burdens of litigation.... \u201d <em>Holmes v, Ku-cynda, </em>321 F.3d 1069, 1077 (11th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). But qualified immunity does not protect an official who \u201cknew or reasonably should have known that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of the [plaintiff].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 815, 102 S.Ct. at 2736) (internal quotation marks &amp; alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Under the qualified-immunity doctrine, a public official must first show that he was acting within the scope of his or her discretionary authority at the time of the challenged conduct. <em>Maddox v. Stephens, </em>727 F.3d 1109, 1120 (11th Cir. 2013). Here, Kennedy and the rest of the officers undis-putedly established this fact, as they were acting within the scope of their discretionary authority as police officers for the City of Rockledge when they encountered Bus-sey.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">The burden then shifts to Bussey-Mor-ice to demonstrate that qualified immunity is not appropriate. <em>See id. </em>In order to do this, Bussey-Morice must show that, when viewed in the light most favorable to her, the facts demonstrate that Kennedy and the other officers violated Bussey\u2019s constitutional right and that that right was \u201cclearly established ... in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition[,]\u201d at the time of the incident. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). We may decide these issues in either order, but, to survive a qualified-immunity defense, Bussey-Morice must satisfy both showings. <em>Maddox, </em>727 F.3d at 1120-21 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Here, we find that the alleged illegality of Kennedy\u2019s actions and the other officers\u2019 inactions were not clearly established at the time of the incident. So we do not decide whether a constitutional violation took place. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">As we have explained, the touchstone of qualified immunity is notice. <em>Holmes, </em>321 F.3d at 1078. The violation of a constitutional right is clearly established if every reasonable official would understand that his conduct violates that right. See <em>Oliver v. Fiorino, </em>586 F.3d 898, 907 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Our circuit uses two methods to determine whether a reasonable official would understand that his conduct violates a constitutional right. <em>Fils v. City of Aventura, </em>647 F.3d 1272, 1291 (11th Cir. 2011). In the first, \u201c[w]e have held that decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and the highest court of the pertinent state (here, the Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>Florida) can clearly establish the law.\u201d <em>McClish v. Nugent, </em>483 F.3d 1231, 1237 (11th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Under this method, \u201c[ejxact factual identity .with a previously decided case is not required, but the unlawfulness of the conduct must be apparent from the pre-existing law.\u201d <em>See Coffin v. Brandan, </em>642 F.3d 999, 1013 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The second method involves evaluating the officer\u2019s conduct and deciding whether the officer\u2019s \u201cconduct \u2018lies so obviously at the very core of what the Fourth Amendment prohibits that the unlawfulness of the conduct was readily apparent to [the officer], notwithstanding the law of fact-specific case law \u201d on point. <em>Fils, </em>647 F.3d at 1291 (alteration in original) (citation omitted). Under this method, despite an absence of case law holding the specific conduct unlawful, a \u201cgeneral constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question.\u201d <em>Coffin, </em>642 F.3d at 1014-16; see <em>Fils, </em>647 F.3d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">The obvious-clarity method recognizes that although concrete facts are typically necessary to provide an officer with notice of \u201cthe hazy border between excessive and acceptable force,\u201d when an officer\u2019s conduct is \u201cso outrageous that it clearly goes \u2018so far beyond\u2019 these borders, qualified immunity will not protect him even in the absence of case law.\u201d <em>Fils, </em>647 F.3d at 1291-92 (citing <em>Reese v. Herbert, 527 </em>F.3d 1253, 1274 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>Priester v. City of Riviera Beach, Fla., </em>208 F.3d 919, 926-27 (11th Cir. 2000)). This standard, which offers a narrow exception to the general rule that only case law and specific factual scenarios can clearly establish a constitutional violation, <em>Priester, </em>208 F.3d at 927, is a difficult one to meet. <em>See Hoyt, </em>672 F.3d at 977 (\u201c[I]f case law, in factual terms, has not staked out a bright line, qualified immunity almost always protects the defendant.\u201d) (quoting <em>Priester, </em>208 F.3d at 926).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">\n<em>1. Kennedy\u2019s conduct did not violate a clearly established right.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Bussey-Moriee, we conclude that, under either method, it was not clearly. established at the time of the incident that Kennedy\u2019s conduct, and thus, the other officers\u2019 failure to intervene, violated Bussey\u2019s right to be free from excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">First, we agree with the district court that no decision from the United States Supreme Court, this Court, or the Florida Supreme Court - has clearly established that use of pressure-point techniques, use of an officer\u2019s knee to hold an individual\u2019s head in place, or placing a pillowcase over an individual\u2019s head, constitutes excessive force under circumstances sufficiently similar to this case. While Bussey-Moriee cites a number of cases in support of her argument to the contrary, none of these cases contain the necessary factual prox.imity that is required to satisfy the analogue test for whether a right is clearly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">Bussey-Morice relies heavily on <em>Skrtich v. Thornton, </em>280 F.3d 1295 (11th Cir. 2002), as support for her claim that Kennedy\u2019s conduct constitutes an established constitutional violation. In <em>Skrtich, </em>we concluded that the police conduct at issue was unlawful because it consisted of violent force (kicking and punching) used for the sole purpose of inflicting pain as punishment for past disobedience. But <em>Skrtich </em>is distinguishable in important respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">In <em>Skrtich, </em>the officers first disabled Skrtich with electric shock. <em>Id. </em>at 1299. Skrtich fell to the ground and offered no physical resistance. <em>Id. </em>Yet the officers kicked him repeatedly in the back, ribs, and side, and one officer punched him. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>at 1299-1300. When Skrtich fell, three times the officers lifted him onto his knees and continued beating him. <em>Id. </em>at 1300. One officer watched and did nothing to stop the beating. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, though the officers in Bussey\u2019s case attempted to restrain Bussey by tasing him, the tasing had no effect. Bussey continued to resist violently. Unlike the officers in <em>Skrtich, </em>who allegedly beat Skrtich to punish him and not to restrain him in accordance with the law, Officer Kennedy placed his knee on Bussey\u2019s head and pulled a pillowcase over Bussey to gain control of Bussey in a dangerous situation, when Bussey was spitting and physically resisting efforts to restrain him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While Bussey-Morice argues that Kennedy\u2019s actions were \u201c[w]ith-out cause or reason,\u201d we find that no reasonable reading of the record supports this conclusion. By all accounts, each of Kennedy\u2019s actions were aimed at the goal of bringing Bussey under control in a dangerous situation, not punishing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Nor do any of the other cases on which Bussey-Morice relies regarding the <em>established </em>unlawfulness of Kennedy\u2019s conduct bear enough factual similarity for us to find for Bussey-Morice under the first test. Consequently, Bussey-Morice had to demonstrate that this case presents one of those rare circumstances in which, as a matter of obvious clarity, Kennedy\u2019s conduct violated the Fourth Amendment. We find that she cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Prevailing under this second test requires Bussey-Morice to show \u201cthat every reasonable officer in [Kennedy\u2019s] position would inevitably conclude that the force was unlawful.\u201d <em>Post v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>7 F.3d 1552, 1559 (11th Cir. 1993). But Bussey-Morice has failed to establish this.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Bussey-Morice asserts that Kennedy\u2019s actions were so \u201cunwarranted, unnecessary, excessive, and gratuitous\u201d that the unlawfulness of his conduct must have been \u201creadily apparent\u201d to him. Based on the complaint in this action, Bussey-Mor-ice appears to rest her conclusion on the assumption that Kennedy acted in \u201cbad faith,\u201d \u201cwith malicious purpose,\u201d or \u201cin a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human right, safety, or property.\u201d Bussey-Morice points to no evidence of record to support the notion that Kennedy\u2019s actions were malicious and obviously in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Kennedy\u2019s force increased gradually and in proportion to the degree of resistance exercised by Bussey. Bussey had been resisting restraint from the moment Kennedy arrived at the hospital. After Kennedy unsuccessfully attempted to secure Bus-sey\u2019s legs, Kennedy tried to restrain Bus-sey\u2019s head with his hand. As Bussey began to spit, Kennedy employed the pressure-point technique\u2014 a method he learned during police training. Because the pressure-point technique was unsuccessful, Kennedy pressed his knee into Bussey\u2019s head\u2014another method he learned during police training. Finally, because Bussey continued to spit, Kennedy used the pillow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>case to cover Bussey\u2019s head\u2014yet another method he was taught in training.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">In light of the fact that so many of Kennedy\u2019s actions were both measured to the degree of resistance exhibited and authorized as acceptable methods of police practice, we cannot find, that as a matter of obvious clarity, Kennedy violated Bus-sey\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">\n<em>2. The other officers\u2019 failure to inter- ' vene did not violate Bussey\u2019s dearly established constitutional right</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">In the absence of excessive force, no duty to intervene exists. <em>Crenshaw v. Lister, </em>556 F.3d 1283, 1294 (11th Cir. 2009). Similarly, when an officer's force does not violate a clearly established right, other officers\u2019 failure to intervene does not violate a clearly established right. Because Kennedy\u2019s conduct did not violate one of Bussey\u2019s clearly established rights, we must find that the other officers\u2019 failure to intervene likewise did not violate one of Bussey\u2019s clearly established rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">B. Sovereign Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">The district court granted the City of Rockledge\u2019s motion for summary judgment on sovereign immunity grounds. The district court reasoned that because (1) Florida law protects cities with sovereign immunity when suits against their employees allege \u201cbad faith\u201d or \u201cmalicious\u201d conduct, and (2) because Bussey-Morice all\u00e9ged \u201cmalicious\u201d conduct against the City of Rockledge police officers, the City was entitled to sovereign immunity. For the reasons below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">Florida Statute \u00a7 768.28(9)(a) provides Florida municipalities sovereign immunity fi\u2019om liability arising out of instances where one of its\u2019 \u201cofficer[s], employee[s], or agent[s] acted in bad faith or with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.28(9)(a); <em>Keck v. Eminisor, </em>104 So.3d 359, 366 (Fla. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">It is undisputed that in multiple parts of Bussey-Morice\u2019s complaint, she charges the Rockledge police officers -with \u201cevil motive or intent and/or reckless or callous indifference\u201d with respect to Bussey\u2019s life. Recognizing \u00a7 768.28(9)(a)\u2019s protection, the City of Rockledge raised this statute\u2019s sovereign-immunity defense in its Second Motion for Summary Judgment. In response to the City\u2019s motion, Bussey-Mor-ice made no attempt to argue that \u00a7 768.28(9)(a) was inapplicable to her wrongful-death claim against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">We note that Bussey-Morice\u2019s complaint offers support for her argument that her claim against the City of Rockledge was <em>intended </em>as an alternative and inconsistent claim containing no allegation of \u201cevil motive\u201d or callous indifference\u201d with respect to the City\u2019s officers. But Bussey-Morice did not make this argument in her response to the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In fact, Bussey-Morice did just the opposite. She specifically described the officers as having acted \u201cmaliciously\u201d\u2014a category of conduct that when alleged, automatically implicates sovereign immunity under \u00a7 768.28(9)(a). <em>Fletcher v. City of Miami, </em>567 F.Supp.2d 1389, 1394 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (citing <em>Willis v. Dade Cty. Sch. Bd., </em>411 So.2d 245, 246 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">Bussey-Morice had a responsibility to raise her alternative-and-inconsistent-claims argument in her response to the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See Johnson v. Bd. of Regents, </em>263 F.3d 1234, 1264 (11th Cir. 2001). That she did not do. As a result, we do not consider the argument for the first time on appeal. As we have explained, a party \u201ccannot readily complain about the entry of a summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>judgment order that did not consider an argument they chose not to develop for the district court at the time of the summary judgment motions.\u201d <em>Id,; see also Case v. Eslinger, </em>555 F.3d 1317, 1329 (11th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Even if it is true that Bussey-Morice raised her alternative and inconsistent defense in her complaint, this court has expressly concluded that \u201ca party may not rely on his pleadings to avoid judgment against him.\u201d <em>Resolution Tr. Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., </em>43 F.3d 587, 590 (11th Cir. 1995). <em>See Case, 555 </em>F.3d 1317, 1329. <em>See Hutton v. Strickland, </em>919 F.2d 1531, 1533 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Because Bussey-Morice failed to properly raise her alternative-and-inconsistent-claims theory below, she may not raise it now, for the first time on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1335 (11th Cir. 2004)\u2014especial-ly since she argued a position entirely inconsistent with the one she now advocates: that the officers acted bad faith, malicious purpose, or wanton and willful disregard with respect to her battery claim. We therefore must AFFIRM<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">For the reasons we have discussed, we affirm the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment to Defendant Officers on the basis of qualified immunity, as well as the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the City of Rockledge on the basis of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-6\">. In her opening brief, Bussey-Morice tells a somewhat different story. Specifically, Bus-sey-Morice characterizes Kennedy as having \"smash[ed]\u201d Bussey's head into the ground with the entirety of his bodyweight and having \"suffocate[ed]\u201d Bussey with the pillowcase. But this characterization is simply unsupported by the record. While we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Bussey-Mor-ice, these inferences are not reasonable in light of the record. And Bussey-Morice has pointed to no witness testimony or other evidence that supports the conclusions that Kennedy smashed Bussey's head into the hospital floor or Kennedy suffocated Bussey with the pillowcase. Notably, no medical expert in this case, including Bussey-Morice\u2019s own expert, found any indication of head trauma or suffocation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b936-10\">.
