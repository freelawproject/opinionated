(\u201cPepper\u201d) seeks review of a final order of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d). The Secretary of the Commission issued Pepper a citation for a serious \u201cgeneral duty clause\u201d violation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (\u201cOSHA\u201d), codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-678. The Commission subsequently affirmed the citation in a final order. After review of the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">This case concerns a fatal accident that occurred on October 29, 2013, at a highway construction worksite supervised by Pepper. The parties largely agree on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Pepper is a general construction contractor located in Tampa, Florida. Pepper\u2019s business, at least in part, consists of conducting milling operations on roads, which involves removing existing road surface material with a milling machine and then adding new road base and asphalt layers. The milling operation is performed using a convoy of vehicles moving in tandem, which consists of a milling machine and a series of dump trucks. As the milling machine moves forward removing the existing asphalt layer, a chute extending forward from the front of the machine deposits milling debris into a dump truck in front of the machine using a conveyor. Once the dump truck is filled, it leaves the vehicle convoy to dump the milled material, and another dump truck backs up to take its place in front of the milling machine. Dump trucks continuously cycle through, alternatingly filling and dumping their loads, which allows the milling process to proceed without interruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">On October 29, 2013, Pepper\u2019s milling team consisted of three of Pepper\u2019s own employees as well as several employees supplied by two subcontractors, Turtle Southeast Milling and Jason\u2019s Hauling. The Pepper employees included foreman Terry Infinger, operator Robert Bacon, and decedent Alex Diaz. Jason\u2019s Hauling provided several dump trucks, two of which were driven by Yonnesly Carm\u00e9nate and Alejandro Perez, both independent contractors of Jason\u2019s Hauling.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">That day, the milling operation\u2019s work focused on the eastside of Dale Mabry Highway, which runs north to south. The operation started around 7:30 am on <em>a-</em>portion of Dale Mabry Highway located south of Tampa Bay Boulevard, which runs east to west. Later that morning, as the convoy progressed northward on Dale Ma-bry Highway, it crossed Tampa Bay Boulevard to continue work on the road extending northward.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">After crossing Tampa Bay Boulevard, the convoy temporarily ceased operations to allow the milling machine foreman, Turtle Southeast employee David Hollister, to reset the milling machine. Around the same time, foreman Infinger and decedent Diaz walked ahead of the convoy to the location of a Verizon pole marker along the roadside of Dale Mabry Highway. The previous week, the milling machine had clipped a telecommunications box overgrown with grass located next to a similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Verizon pole marker. This time foreman Infinger wanted to check whether there was another such box and, if so, fully expose it so that it would be visible to the milling machine operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Sure enough, foreman Infinger found a partially exposed telecommunications box next to the Verizon pole and began uncovering the front edge of the box using a shovel. Foreman Infinger showed decedent Diaz how to properly expose the box, and then Infinger told Diaz to finish uncovering it. Foreman Infinger anticipated that it would only take about three to four minutes for decedent Diaz to finish exposing the box. Infinger left Diaz to complete the task and walked back to the milling machine. Diaz was wearing a hard hat and a safety vest. Foreman Infinger did not tell any of the dump truck drivers that Diaz was up ahead of the convoy working on the telecommunications box.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Sometime after the milling convoy had crossed Tampa Bay Boulevard and after decedent Diaz began exposing the box, the milling operation resumed. The milling convoy was moving at its usual pace of 10 feet per minute or under three miles per hour. At this point, Carm\u00e9nate of Jason\u2019s Hauling was driving the dump truck positioned directly in front of the milling machine, and Perez of Jason\u2019s Hauling was positioned directly in front of Carmenate\u2019s dump truck waiting to take Carmenate\u2019s place in the convoy.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">A couple of minutes after the milling convoy resumed, it had only moved about 10 to 15 feet when Carm\u00e9nate honked his horn because he noticed that his dump truck was too close to Perez\u2019s dump truck. Perez had not been paying attention, and upon hearing Carmenate\u2019s honk, Perez sped forward down the road and struck decedent Diaz, who was still standing by the telecommunications box. From where Perez responded to Carmenate\u2019s honk, Perez\u2019s truck sped forward a distance of 83 to 88 feet before he struck Diaz.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Diaz subsequently died as a result of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">On November 18, 2013, the Commission began an investigation into the incident after being notified of Diaz\u2019s death. Compliance Specialist Gerardo Ortiz (\u201cInvestigator Ortiz\u201d) headed up that investigation. On April 24, 2014, upon the conclusion of the investigation, the 'Secretary of the Commission issued Pepper a citation for a serious \u201cgeneral duty clause\u201d violation under section 5(a)(1) of OSHA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1). The citation alleged that \u201cemployees were exposed to the hazard of being struck by vehicular traffic inside a work zone,\u201d and as a result, Pepper committed a workplace violation because it \u201cdid not furnish employment and a place of employment which were free from recognized hazards that were causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">According to Investigator Ortiz\u2019s report, the absence of \u201cInternal Traffic Control Plans\u201d and \u201ca flagger to clear out of the path of dump trucks before the truck started to move forward\u201d were contributing factors to the October 29, 2013, accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">After the Secretary of the Commission issued a citation to Pepper on April 24, 2014, Pepper filed a Notice of Contest on April 30, 2014. Thereafter, on June 19, 2014, the Secretary of the Commission filed a complaint against Pepper before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>A hearing was held before Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) John Gatto on January 27-28, 2015. At the hearing, numerous employees from Pepper\u2019s October 29, 2013, worksite testified, as well as Investigator Ortiz. Among other things, Investigator Ortiz testified that decedent Diaz \u201cwas in the path of the machinery and the machine operator had not been notified of the presence and the milling ... should have been told to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">ALJ Gatto issued a 22-page order on November 2, 2015, in which he affirmed the citation. While ALJ Gatto found some of Investigator Ortiz\u2019s testimony to be not credible, he determined that Ortiz\u2019s testimony \u201cregarding the existence of a struck-by hazard and the inadequacy of Pepper\u2019s internal traffic control plan\u201d to be plausible, consistent, and corroborated with credible evidence in the record, and he afforded it \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d The ALJ concluded that a hazard had existed on Pepper\u2019s worksite on the day of the accident. While it discredited the Secretary\u2019s theory that decedent Diaz had been standing in Perez\u2019s blind spot at the time of the accident, ALJ Gatto nevertheless found that the citation sufficiently put Pepper on notice of the alleged struck-by hazard, and ALJ Gatto explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8c\">[Tjhere is no dispute that the decedent was assigned to work near the Verizon pole that served as a marker for the telecommunications box, which was in the path of the milling operation. This in and of itself presented the potential for harm. The struck-by hazard was a preventable consequence of a work operation over which Pepper can reasonably be expected to exercise control. Therefore, the Secretary has established the existence of a struck-by hazard..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">On November 24, 2015, Pepper filed a Petition for Discretionary Review with the Commission. The matter was not directed for review by the Commission, and the ALJ\u2019s decision became a final order of the Commission on December 7, 2015. Pepper\u2019s petition for review to this Court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">We afford Commission decisions \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d on review. Quinlan v. Sec\u2019y, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 812 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir. 2016). The Commission\u2019s fact-findings must be upheld \u201cif supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Quinlan, 812 F.3d at 837 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe Commission\u2019s conclusions of law, meanwhile, must be upheld as long as they are riot \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with ... law.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)). The Commission and its ALJs must follow the law of the circuit to which the case would most likely be appealed. ComTran Group, Inc, v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 722 F.3d 1304, 1307 (11th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">An employer commits a general duty clause violation when he fails to \u201cfurnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are,causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">To prove an employer\u2019s \u201cserious violation of OSHA\u2019s general duty clause,\u201d the Secretary must establish that \u201c(1) the employer failed to render its work place free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>of a hazard; (2) the hazard was recognized; ... (3) the hazard caused or was likely to cause death or serious physical harm\u201d and \u201c(4) the hazard [was] preventable .\u201d Ga. Elec. Co. v. Marshall, 595 F.2d 309, 320-21 (5th Cir. 1979) (quotation marks and internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">This case concerns only the first element, the existence of a hazard in the workplace. Pepper points us to Commission authority that a \u201chazard\u201d consists of conditions or practices deemed unsafe over which an employer can reasonably be expected to exercise control. Morrison-Knudsen Co./Yonkers Contracting Co., A Joint Venture, 16 BNA OSHC 1105, 1121 (No. 88-572, 1993) (citing Pelron Corp., 12 BNA OSHC 1833, 1835-36 (No. 82-388, 1986)). Furthermore, for purposes of proving \u201cemployee exposure to a hazard,\u201d the Secretary must establish that \u201cit is reasonably predictable, either by operational necessity or otherwise (including inadvertence), that employees have been, are, or will be in the zone of danger.\u201d D.T. Constr. Co., 19 BNA OSHC 1305, 1308 (No. 99-0147, 2000) (ALJ). Additionally, Pepper highlights Commission authority that the Secretary can prove employee exposure to a hazard by showing either an employee\u2019s actual exposure to a hazard in a zone of danger or that it was reasonably predictable that an employee would have access to a hazard in a zone of danger. Nuprecon LP, 23 BNA OSHC 1817, 1818-19 (No. 08-1307, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">On appeal, Pepper primarily challenges the Commission\u2019s determination that a hazard existed on its worksite. Pepper argues that- the Secretary cannot prove a general duty clause violation without proving the existence of a \u201cstruck-by\u201d hazard and contends that the Secretary\u2019s evidence before the ALJ proving such a hazard was insufficient. Furthermore, Pepper argues that certain of the ALJ\u2019s fact-findings were inconsistent with its conclusion that the Secretary proved decedent Diaz was exposed to a struck-by hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Our review of the Commission\u2019s final, thorough 22-page order confirms that there was no reversible error in its decision. The ALJ\u2019s order explained, \u201c[Tjhere is no dispute that the decedent was assigned to work near the Verizon pole that served as a marker for the telecommunications box, which was in the path of the milling operation. This in and of itself presented the potential for harm.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s order concluded that the Secretary had established the existence of a hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">The ALJ\u2019s hazard conclusion was supported by the testimony of numerous Pepper-worksite employees\u2014including foreman Infinger, operator Bacon, dump truck driver Carm\u00e9nate, and the milling machine foreman\u2014most of whom the ALJ found to be credible, straightforward, and trustworthy witnesses. In sum, their testimony established three critical facts: (1) Pepper left decedent Diaz to perform a task while standing in the path of the milling convoy without any supervisory protocol to account for his whereabouts as the milling convoy prepared to start again; (2) Pepper permitted the milling convoy to begin operating again while Diaz was still working and standing in the convoy\u2019s path; and (3) Pepper did not inform any of the dump truck drivers that Diaz was located in their path. We have no difficulty concluding the ALJ\u2019s evidentiary findings as to his hazard determination were \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">Pepper argues that, in reaching his hazard determination, the ALJ failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>consider such things as \u201cthe significance of Alex Diaz\u2019s distance from the hazard, the time anticipated for him to complete his task, or the slow pace of the convoy.\u201d Pepper maintains that Diaz was neither actually exposed to a struck-by hazard at the moment Carm\u00e9nate honked his horn, given Diaz\u2019s distance from the slow-moving convoy, nor was it reasonably predictable that Diaz would be exposed to such a hazard, given that Pepper could not reasonably anticipate or control Perez\u2019s sudden careless behavior. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s hazard conclusion was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Pepper\u2019s arguments fail. For sure, it may not always be true that where a contractor positions an employee 83 feet in front of and in the path of a milling convoy, a hazard necessarily exists. But, as discussed above, here such additional facts were shown as (1) Pepper\u2019s lack of supervisory protocol to account for Diaz\u2019s whereabouts at the time the milling operation resumed, (2) Pepper\u2019s authorizing the milling operations to resume, and (3) Pepper\u2019s failure to inform the truck drivers of Diaz\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The ALJ could reasonably determine that the facts of this case showed- that Pepper\u2019s placement of Diaz in the path of a milling convoy led by dump trucks capable of moving at a high rate of speed actually exposed Diaz to a hazard in a zone of danger or, at the least, made it reasonably predictable that he would imminently be exposed to such a hazard in a zone of danger. See Nuprecon, 23 BNA OSHC at 1818-19. That is especially true where Pepper\u2019s inadvertence in resuming the operation while Diaz was in his assigned work location is what put Diaz at risk, as Diaz was left in the path of a moving convoy. See D.T. Constr., 19 BNA OSHC at 1308. Furthermore, Pepper could reasonably be expected to exercise control over its worksite, including the path of the milling convoy. See Morrison-Knudsen, 16 BNA OSHC at 1121. In light of the Commission authority Pepper itself highlights, we cannot say the Commission\u2019s hazard determination was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Given the \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d we afford Commission decisions on review, we affirm.
