The sole issue in this case is whether the property of one such utility includes the properties of an out-of-state affiliate. The problem to be resolved is the test for determining the scope of the valuation unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Plaintiff Southern Pacific Transportation Company (Southern Pacific) is a railroad operating in Oregon and seven other states. The St. Louis &amp; Southwestern Railroad (Cotton-belt) is a midwestern railroad affiliated with and almost wholly owned by Southern Pacific. The Tax Court held that the Southern Pacific unit does not include the Cottonbelt. We hold that the Cottonbelt properties are included in Southern Pacific\u2019s property, and accordingly reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Southern Pacific is a Delaware corporation wholly owned by a holding company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is a class I railroad subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USC \u00a7 10501(a) (1980 supp), and operates in Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana. It has three main lines: a north-south route from Portland to Southern California, an east-west route from San Francisco to Ogden, Utah, and an east-west route from Los Angeles to Texas and Louisiana. At the termini of these routes, it connects with other lines, including the Cottonbelt in Texas and Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The Cottonbelt is also a class I railroad, operating in Tennessee, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. In 1930, the two lines agreed to coordinate their service. Southern Pacific began acquiring Cottonbelt\u2019s stock, acquired stock control in the early 1950\u2019s, and by 1978 had acquired 99.7 percent ownership. The principal officers and almost all the directors of Cottonbelt are officers or employees of Southern Pacific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>selected by and reporting to Southern Pacific. These ties of coordination, ownership, and control benefit both lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Ninety percent of Southern Pacific\u2019s operations are as originator and terminator of railroad traffic, while over half of Cottonbelt\u2019s traffic is as a \u201cbridge\u201d or intermediate for other carriers. Because terminal and switching activities are relatively unprofitable, Southern Pacific is less profitable in terms of its size than is Cottonbelt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, Cottonbelt\u2019s capitalized income is greater in proportion to other measures of its size and value.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">From 1972 to 1979, the Department of Revenue (Department) included Cottonbelt in the unit for valuing Southern Pacific\u2019s property. This was unchallenged for the years before 1976. The present action began when Southern Pacific filed four essentially identical complaints seeking reduction of its ad valorem tax assessments for the years 1976, 1977,1978 and 1979. The complaint is within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court. ORS 308.595(3). The Tax Court consolidated the complaints for trial and they are consolidated here. The complaints challenge (1) the valuation unit, (2) the valuation method, and (3) the proper allocation to Oregon of a portion of the total value. The parties stipulated that five small unprofitable railroads operating in California, wholly owned by Southern Pacific, would be included in Southern Pacific\u2019s valuation unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">With minor exceptions, the Tax Court found for plaintiff Southern Pacific on all three questions. The Cottonbelt was excluded from the valuation unit. The Tax Court\u2019s method for valuation assigned no weight to costs, 67 percent weight to capitalized income, and 33 percent weight to stock and debt. The allocation formula assigned 40 percent weight to property investment, 45 percent weight to ton-miles of revenue freight, and 15 percent weight to tonnage originating or terminating within the state. The Department appeals the valuation unit but not the method for valuation or for allocation. Southern Pacific did not cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The Tax Court agreed with plaintiff that Cottonbelt should be excluded from the Southern Pacific unit because the two lines are separate in the following ways:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">(1) <em>Accounting and reporting: </em>separate ledgers, internal books, payroll, inventory, budget records and external audit; separate Interstate Commerce Commission reports and tariffs and Securities and Exchange Commission filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">(2) <em>Corporate structure: </em>separate corporate forms and separate shareholder reports and meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">(3) <em>Marketing: </em>separate solicitation, advertising and competition for traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">(4) <em>Financing: </em>separate rating and marketing of long-term debt and equipment trust obligations; separate handling of cash through lock boxes, bank accounts and liquid investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">(5) <em>Management: </em>separate day-to-day purchase (or lease) and repair of equipment, including budgeting, financing, ordering and billing.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">(6) <em>Operations: </em>separate operating rules and engineering design.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">(7) <em>Labor: </em>separate operating crews, retirement programs, and seniority under union rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">(8) <em>Taxation: </em>separate corporate and franchise taxation by other states; separate property taxation in the states where both operate and in nearly all states where one operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">(9) <em>Economic interdependence and geography: </em>the Oregon operations of Southern Pacific are only remotely connected to the Cottonbelt through a roundabout southerly route.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-15\">In its appeal, the Department observes that the two lines are integrated in the following ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>(la) <em>Accounting and reporting: </em>integrated billing for repairs and management services; integrated managerial accounting decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">(2a) <em>Corporate Structure: </em>integrated financial headquarters; stock control relation of parent to subsidiary; overlap of top officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">(3a) <em>Marketing: </em>integrated advertising decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">(4a) <em>Financing: </em>integrated policy decisions about budget, finance, forecasting and investment; integrated insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">(5a) <em>Management: </em>integrated top management services, including legal, capital-investment and managerial personnel decisions by Southern Pacific or its holding company; overlap of top managers.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">(6a) <em>Operations: </em>integrated executive supervision and inspection of mechanical operations; integrated research.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">(7a) <em>Labor: </em>integrated stock-ownership plan, training and education for employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">(8a) <em>Taxation: </em>integrated property taxation in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">(9a) <em>Economic interdependence and geography: </em>extensive contractual coordination; physical connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">Neither party substantially disputes these historical facts of separation and integration. Both parties also note the extent of operational interconnection in the industry generally. The nation\u2019s railroads interchange cars, materials, and running repairs, maintain joint inspections and facilities, permit one carrier\u2019s locomotives to run through the lines of another, use standardized equipment and central computer monitoring of traffic, and support industry-wide research.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">II. THE CENTRAL ASSESSMENT STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">This case is governed by a statute, ORS 308.505 to 308.665, which imposes standards and procedures for assessing the ad valorem property tax of designated public utilities. We have said that this statute is \u201cintended to be a complete and comprehensive scheme of taxation,\u201d <em>State v. Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., </em>64 Or 421, 432, 130 P 983, 985 (1913), although it may be more accurately described as a scheme of assessment for taxation. It has not changed markedly since first enacted by Oregon Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>1909, chapter 218 (1909 Act). It provides for assessment of property, not income or franchises. <em>Portland v. Portland Railway, Light &amp; Power Co., </em>80 Or 271, 294, 156 P 1058 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">This statute authorizes the Department to assess property when two conditions are met: the property has a situs in this state, and it is used in certain designated utility businesses, including railroading. ORS 308.515(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>The statute requires these utilities to be centrally assessed, <em>i.e., </em>assessed by the Department rather than by the counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The basic allocation rule is that all property of such a company is assessed \u201cto the property user,\u201d ORS 308.517(1). Property is subject to the assessment only if put to one of the designated uses; an included corporation is excluded to the extent that it actively engages in a business \u201cnot incidental\u201d to that designated, ORS 308.515(4). If property has an \u201cintegrated use\u201d in more than one business, it is to be \u201cclassified by the department as being within or without the definition of property * * * according to the primary use,\u201d ORS 308.510(5).\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>As used in this statute, the term \u201cproperty having situs in this state\u201d is defined in ORS 308.505 (3) ,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the term \u201cproperty\u201d is defined in ORS 308.510(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The definition of the term \u201cproperty\u201d applies to the entire statutory scheme, and therefore applies to the definition of \u201cproperty having situs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>this state,\u201d which defines a class of real and personal \u201cproperty\u201d having a certain location. The natural reading of this pair of definitions is that \u201cproperty\u201d is the entire pie of which \u201cproperty having a situs in this state\u201d is a slice, so that \u201cproperty\u201d is equivalent to \u201cproperty irrespective of situs.\u201d This reading was even more natural when these provisions were first enacted, since they were consecutive sections of the 1909 Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>For purposes of this property assessment scheme, ORS 308.510(1) defines a company\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d broadly to include \u201call property, real and personal, tangible and intangible, used or held by a company as owner, occupant, lessee, or otherwise, for or in use in the performance or maintenance of\u2019 its designated business. The definition of property includes all real property and \u201cgoods or chattels,\u201d but starting in 1977 has excluded \u201cintangible * * * claims on other property\u201d such as shares of stock in corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">ORS 308.555 permits unit valuation of property, whereby the Department \u201cmay value the entire property, both within and without the State of Oregon, as a unit.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>valuation assesses the going-concern value of a multi-state operation, and its constitutionality has long been established.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If \u201cthe entire property\u201d is valued as a unit, then the allocation of a portion of that entire value to Oregon must be \u201cjust\u201d and in \u201cfair proportion.\u201d ORS 308.555; <em>see also </em>ORS 308.550(2). This statutory limit on the range of permissible allocation is vague, but codifies the limit imposed by the commerce and due process clauses of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The definition of the term \u201cproperty\u201d in ORS 308.510(1) applies to the term \u201centire property\u201d in the unit rule, ORS 308.555. The adjective \u201centire\u201d appears to be synonymous with the phrase that follows, \u201cboth within and without the state of Oregon,\u201d so that \u201centire\u201d simply emphasizes that property is included in the valuation unit irrespective of situs. The unit rule does not tax out-of-state property; rather, it assesses the increment of going-concern value that out-of-state property adds to taxable in-state property.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The user of property is a \u201ccorporation\u201d or \u201ccompany,\u201d expansively defined to include any of various forms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>organization engaged in a designated business, ORS 308.505(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A parent corporation together with a subsidiary can be a \u201ccorporation\u201d or \u201ccompany\u201d within this definition. If the unit rule is applied here, then the Southern Pacific/Cotton-belt combination is treated as a single \u201ccompany\u201d or \u201ccorporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Numerous provisions make clear that the legal form in which the company uses or holds the property is largely irrelevant to whether it is the company\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d within the ambit of the statute. \u201cProperty\u201d may be \u201cused or held * * * as owner, occupant, lessee, or otherwise,\u201d ORS 308.510(1), and \u201cproperty having a situs in this state\u201d may be \u201cowned, leased, used, operated or occupied,\u201d ORS 308.505(3). The assessment applies to \u201call property owned, leased, rented, chartered or otherwise held for or used by [the property user] in performing a [designated] business,\u201d ORS 308.517(1). Railroad property includes land \u201cused or held and claimed exclusively as right of way,\u201d ORS 308.510(2), and includes property \u201csituated within its station ground reservations or rights of way,\u201d ORS 308.510(4) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The company reports the length of the routes both within and without the state, including those it \u201ccontrols or uses as owner, lessee or otherwise,\u201d ORS 308.525(11). When the unit rule is applied to a company which \u201cowns, leases, operates over or uses rail, * * * operational routes or property within and without this state,\u201d the allocation to Oregon may be according to a mileage ratio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201c* * * [T]he proportion which the number of miles of rail * * * or operational routes in Oregon, controlled or used by the company, as owner, lessee, or otherwise, bears to the entire mileage of rail * * * or operational routes controlled or used by the company, as owner, lessee, or otherwise.\u201d ORS 308.550(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>If, as here, the mileage ratio would not allocate \u201cfairly,\u201d then \u201cthe department may use any other reasonable method,\u201d ORS 308.550(2),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but the language of the mileage formula nevertheless indicates the broad sweep of property subject to allocation under a unit valuation. The unit rule itself refers to \u201cproperty\u201d without specifying the mode of possession, but the statute has already defined the unrestricted term \u201cproperty\u201d to embrace forms more various than simple ownership.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">The final stage of central assessment is apportionment of the value of property having a situs in this state to the several counties. ORS 308.525(12), 308.565, 308.635, 308.645. The counties may levy and collect taxes based on the Department\u2019s central assessment. ORS 308.635(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">III. APPLICATION OF THE STATUTE TO THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">This case turns on whether the Cottonbelt railroad operations are Southern Pacific\u2019s \u201cproperty,\u201d as that term is defined in ORS 308.510(1) and used in the rest of the statutory scheme. By thus focusing the issue, we must exclude as irrelevant many of the criteria considered by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Composition of the unit for purposes of income and franchise taxation has at best limited significance in this property tax case. Even as to property assessment, the decision of another state to assess the two lines as a unit or separately can be authority in this court only to the extent that the other state\u2019s test for composition of the unit is the same as Oregon\u2019s. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Since a combined unit might result in a flow of tax revenues away from states where Cottonbelt operates, taxing authorities in those states have no incentive to assess the combined unit even if their property tax laws might permit them to do so. Of the five states other than Oregon where only Southern Pacific operates, California assesses the lines as a unit while the others do not. Since of all the states in which Southern Pacific operates, Oregon\u2019s position as a western terminal is closest to California\u2019s, this might seem to be some precedent for assessingthe combined unit. However, neither the record nor the briefs reveal the reasons or legal basis for any other state\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus the assessment decisions of other states do not help us interpret our own statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Separate accounting, separate regulatory reporting, and separate incorporation do not reveal the property relation between two companies, because a company that is controlled by another might maintain its own independent books, reports, and corporate form. These reports are material but not conclusive evidence of valuation. ORS 308.545. Although the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission \u201cshall indicate the value of the property of each common carrier as a whole and separately identify the value of its property in each State * * * in which the property is located,\u201d 49 USC \u00a7 10781(b) (1980 supp), regulatory reporting has purposes not relevant to characterizingproperty for this scheme of ad valorem taxation. <em>See, United States v. Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad Co., </em>273 US 299, 310, 47 S Ct 413, 71 L Ed 651 (1927); <em>Portland Gen. Elec. Co. v. Dept. of Rev., </em>7 OTR 33, 40 (1977). The statute is clear that the form of property use is immaterial. While the separate accounting and reporting makes combined valuation more difficult, convenience of assessment is not the test of what falls in \u201cthe entire property,\u201d ORS 308.555.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">An integrated enterprise can market separate financial obligations of its components, as Southern Pacific itself does for its equipment. For the same reason, separation of marketing, purchase and repair, operations, and labor show nothing about the property relation between two companies, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>these separations could be drawn by delineating two divisions of a single company.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Nor is economic or geographic remoteness the test for the scope of the unit. If two lines are only remotely connected, then there maybe little going-concern value to capture, but that will be reflected by a suitable valuation methodology. The Tax Court said that the Oregon operation must be so \u201cclosely related\u201d to that of the out-of-state operations that it would be \u201cdirectly affected\u201d by, say, an out-of-state casualty. But proximity is not the test for the boundaries of the unit. The properties of Southern Pacific in Texas and Louisiana are as remote as the Cottonbelt properties there, but no one contests that all Southern Pacific\u2019s properties, however distant, are equally part of the unit. The physical connection of these two lines is irrelevant, since two railroads could compose a single unit though separated by a gap.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">On the other hand, because the relevant test is the company\u2019s \u201cproperty,\u201d the Department\u2019s suggested test of \u201coperational integration\u201d is too broad as an interpretation of this statute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Operational integration is a matter of degree, while the statute requires an all-or-nothing assessment, ORS 308.510(5). Companies do not by mere contractual coordination acquire the right to control each other\u2019s operations. When Cottonbelt and Southern Pacific first began to coordinate their operations in 1930, the Cottonbelt properties did not thereby become Southern Pacific\u2019s property. Similarly, integration of marketing, financing, executive services, operations, and labor do not alone show that a company is the property of another, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>because independent companies could provide each other with any or all of these services. Moreover, even a considerable degree of operational integration shows nothing about the property connection between two companies in an industry so pervasively interconnected as railroading.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The proper test of what this statutory scheme includes depends on concepts of <em>property, </em>\u201creal and personal, tangible and intangible, used or held * * * as owner, occupant, lessee, or otherwise.\u201d ORS 308.510(1). The term \u201cotherwise\u201d broadens the definition of property but, construed by the <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule, stays within this familiar arena. These concepts of property are more definite than the wavering tests of operational and economic integration. What shows a property connection between corporations is the right to control the operations of the other company. While overlap of officers is neither necessary nor sufficient to show that one company is the property of another, it is evidence of at least possessory control. Here, Southern Pacific did exert executive control on Cottonbelt\u2019s marketing, financing, management, operations and labor, and did so as owner of Cottonbelt.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Southern Pacific owns 99.7 percent of Cottonbelt. While the continued existence of a few minority stockholders does impose fiduciary duties and require separation of records, the almost total ownership gives Southern Pacific total control. Some decades ago when its stock holdings were much smaller, there would have been a problem in determining whether Southern Pacific had acquired effective control, but that line has long been crossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Cottonbelt\u2019s railroad operations were \u201cused or held by [Southern Pacific] as owner, occupant, lessee, or otherwise.\u201d It is equally clear that Southern Pacific used or held Cottonbelt\u2019s operations \u201cin the performance or maintenance of\u2019 its designated business of railroading. ORS 308.510(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The parties agree that Cottonbelt is not excluded from the 1977 amended definition of \u201cproperty\u201d as \u201cintangible property that represent^] claims on other property including * * * all shares of stock in corporations,\u201d ORS 308.510(1).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>exclusion of \u201cshares of stock\u201d applies only to investment securities, not to a controlling stock interest in a corporation doing designated railroad business. Because of the appraisal methods used here, the value of the Southern.Pacific/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Cottonbelt unit would be the same if one corporation owned all the Southern Pacific and Cottonbelt assets directly.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Thus, the properties of the subsidiary corporation, Cottonbelt, are \u201cproperty\u201d of the parent, Southern Pacific, and the two may be valued as a unit within the constraints of fairness. Where one railroad has stock control, common officers, and effective control of a separately incorporated carrier, combined valuation is recommended by modern appraisal practices<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and is permitted by the federal constitution.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We have noted that any allocation which satisfies the statutory requirement of fairness thereby satisfies the federal constitution. Plaintiff argues that the larger valuation unit would result in a massive shift of revenues to Oregon that would distort the allocation unfairly and hence unconstitutionally.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The direction that revenues would be shifted is irrelevant; our reasoning would have to be the same if the values were reversed. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the massiveness of the shift is some cause for concern, given that Cottonbelt is much smaller and less valuable than Southern Pacific by every measure except income. <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Such disproportion suggests that the allocation formula, applied to the combined unit, may yield \u201ca grossly distorted result,\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co., supra </em>note 11, 390 US at 326, 329. The allocation formula must reflect \u201cthe peculiarities of a given enterprise,\u201d <em>Id., 390 US </em>at 325. Even if a combined unit for valuation is proper, the allocation formula must fairly reflect the contribution of each state\u2019s component in order to satisfy the federal constitution. In this appeal \u2014 unlik <em>e Burlington Northern v. Dept. of Rev., </em>291 Or 729, 635 P2d 347 (1981), and <em>Pacific Power &amp; Light Co. v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>286 Or 529, 596 P2d 912 (1979) \u2014 the valuation and allocation formulae are not before us.

The significance of assessment \u201cunder this act\u201d was that assessment of this kind of property was centralized. The definitional exclusions contrast property \u201csubject to assessment * * * by the [state] board\u201d with property \u201cliable to assessment * * * by the several county assessors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The entire act, including the unit rule itself, distinguishes the geographic dimension from the dimension of connection with designated business centrally assessed. In the unit rule, ORS 308.555, the phrase \u201cassessable by it [the Department]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>contrasts with \u201cassessable by them [the county assessors],\u201d so the term \u201cassessable\u201d refers to the locus of assessing authority, not the locus of the property. <em>See also </em>ORS 308.517(5):</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u201cAll property not assessed by the Department of Revenue shall be assessed in accordance with law by the assessor of the county in which such property is situated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Thus, the term \u201cassessable\u201d and its cognates identify <em>who, </em>the state or the county, will assess various properties, based on the <em>kind of use </em>to which the property is put. Central assessment does not depend on <em>where </em>the property is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that the phrase \u201csubject to assessment\u201d was deleted in 1957 by an act whose purpose was to clarify the division of assessment responsibility between state and local agencies. Or Laws 1957, ch 711, \u00a7 2. The proponent of the 1957 bill described it as \u201ca clarification of the law as to what property is to be assessed by the commission and what property is to be assessed by the local assessor.\u201d Minutes, Senate Taxation Comm., May 1,1957, p 1. He \u201csummarised <em>fsicj </em>the bill. It came about because of question as to who should appraise certain property - county assessor or commission - in regard to utility property. This bill clarifies the question.\u201d Minutes, Senate Taxation Comm., April 30,1957, p 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Although we reject plaintiffs reading of the statute, we are grateful to counsel for collecting its history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b92-13\"> ORS 308.555 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">\u201cThe department, for the purpose of arriving at the true cash value of the property assessable by it, may value the entire property, both within and without the State of Oregon, as a unit.

The report also suggests unity of use as the test for determining whether the properties of a subsidiary rail corporation should be combined for valuation with the properties of the parent r\u00e1il corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 21. However that same report endorses a test of functionally related property within the boundaries of ownership, where ownership is broadly defined to include a parent corporation and its subsidiaries. <em>Id. </em>at 3 n. 1. The recommendations of the report do not attempt to take account of the statutory definitions and schemes of the various states.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\"> The phrase in ORS 308.510(1), quoted in full at note 7, <em>supra, </em>was added by Or Laws 1977, ch 602, \u00a7 2, as part of an act which expanded the definition of intangible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>personal property to include information-storage media as property subject to assessment generally, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1, codified at ORS 307.020(1).

ORS 307.020(4). The central assessment statute has its own standard for dividing real from personal property, ORS 308.510(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">According to a representative of the Department who was a proponent of the 1977 act, it simply ratified what had been the Department\u2019s practice in central assessment \u201calmost since day one.\u201d Tape of Senate Revenue and School Finance Committee hearing, June 7, 1977, tape 31, side 2 at 221; tape of House Revenue and School Finance Committee hearing, June 28, 1977, tape 37, side 1 at 605.

The examples of intangibles excluded by the amended definition are claims that are held merely for their money equivalent and could be exchanged without affecting the business of the company. A minority stock interest held for investment would be excluded because it is held merely as evidence of indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Here, the stock of Cottonbelt was not interchangeable with the stock of any other corporation with similar fiscal character. Rather, Southern Pacific holds Cottonbelt\u2019s stock in order to gain a right to control and use Cottonbelt\u2019s \u201clands and buildings, rights of way, roadbed, * * * vehicles, cars, rolling stock, tracks, * * * inventories, tools, equipment, machinery, franchises and special franchises, work in progress and all [its] other goods or chattels,\u201d ORS 308.510(1). Southern Pacific\u2019s controlling interest in this connecting railroad is \u201cused or held * * * for or in use in the performance or maintenance of\u2019 its own railroad business, ORS 308.510(1), and is \u201cincidental\u201d to its business, ORS 308.515(4). Southern Pacific stipulated that five California affiliates are properly within its valuation unit, and while a stipulation is not an admission, it was Southern Pacific who initiated this extension of its valuation unit, which suggests that including affiliated corporations in the unit is legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">In the context of income taxation, we have not found the existence of a separate corporate shell to be a barrier to unified assessment of integrated affiliates. <em>Coca Cola Co. v. Dept. of Rev., </em>271 Or 517, 526-29, 533 P2d 788 (1975); <em>Zale-Salem, Inc. v. Tax Com., </em>237 Or 261, 391 P2d 601 (1964). If corporate boundaries marked the boundaries of the valuation unit, then the unit rule could be subverted by separate incorporation of each state\u2019s operations. Accordingly, here we assess the property of the subsidiary as property of the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">None of Cottonbelt\u2019s railroad property has a situs in this state. Our holding is not meant to imply the position of double taxation where two affiliated corporations have utility property with a situs in this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b100-5\"> No increment of value is attributable to Southern Pacific\u2019s investment stock. Income from intangible evidences of indebtedness are separately stated in ICC accounts and are not included in the income, stock, and debt measures of value used here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u201cWhile control over the operation of one railroad by another does not preclude separate appraisal of each carrier, the existence of such control sometimes creates a situation where separate appraisal is undesirable. Very often ownership of a controlling interest in railroad <em>A </em>is worth something more to <em>B </em>than the simple right to share in the distribution of A\u2019s earnings. <em>B </em>may do business with <em>A </em>that would be lost if control passed into other hands, or if not lost, continued on terms less favorable than those secured by virtue of control. <em>B's </em>earnings may, therefore, be higher and <em>A\u2019s </em>perhaps would be less than they would be if the control relationship did not exist. Use of either the income capitalization method of valuation or the stock and debt method might thus result in a higher valuation for <em>B </em>and a lower one for <em>A </em>than that which would exist if <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>were completely separate railroad entities. Where the assessor finds this to be the case, with evidence of a serious distortion of values, a combination of railroads <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>into a single appraisal unit might offer a satisfactory solution.\u201d Committee on Unit Valuation, <em>supra </em>n 16, at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 created a board to establish cost accounting principles for railroads. 49 USC \u00a7 11161 to 11168 (1980 supp).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\"> <em>Southern Railway Co. v.
