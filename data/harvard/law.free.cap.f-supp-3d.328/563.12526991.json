MAURICE HICKS, JR., CHIEF JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court are two motions: (1) Migues Deloach Company, LLC's (\"Deloach\") \"Motion for Summary Judgment\" (Record Document 151) and (2) J &amp; J Maintenance, Inc.'s (\"J &amp; J\") \"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\" (Record Document 155), each seeking a determination of whether Deloach is liable to J &amp; J for attorney's fees and costs incurred by J &amp; J in defense of the underlying claims against it in this matter, as well as attorney's fees and costs incurred in pursuit of reimbursement of those fees against Deloach. For the reasons contained herein, Deloach's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and J &amp; J's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter arises out of an accident which occurred on January 24, 2012, wherein Jonathan West (\"West\"), an employee of Deloach, was electrocuted while transporting construction materials at a remodeling project at a dental clinic in Fort Polk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 31-4. On the day of the accident, West was working with his supervisor, Mark Hale (\"Hale\"), installing metal finish work on the soffit of the clinic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 155-4 at 41. Although instructed not to do so, West used a manlift, boomed it away from the building, and caught the power line.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 157-3 at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   J &amp; J was the general contractor of the remodeling project, and Deloach, West's employer, was operating pursuant to a Subcontract Agreement (the \"Subcontract\") under which Deloach was due to supply the earthwork foundation, steel supports, and other items for the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 137-1. The Subcontract contained the following provisions, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   10.(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, subcontractor (Deloach) shall unconditionally indemnify, defend (with counsel selected by contractor (J &amp; J) ) and hold harmless owner, contractor, architect and/or engineer and their subconsultants and all of their affiliates, parents, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, successors and assigns (all of which are hereinafter collectively referred to as \"indemnitites\"), from and against all claims, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees and expenses of dispute resolution (collectively, \"indemnified claims\") arising out of or resulting from the performance of subcontractor's work, acts or omissions of subcontractor, negligence, breach of contract and/or breach of warranty by subcontractor, even though such damages are caused in part by the negligence (whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of the contractor of any other indemnitee ... Nothwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnification obligation shall be limited to the extent that the subcontractor's indemnification of the indemnitee for the indemnitee's own negligence is specifically prohibited by applicable laws for a particular type of project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   20. In the event Contractor (J &amp; J) employs an attorney to enforce any of the provisions hereof, or to protect its interest in any matter arising under this Agreement, or to collect damages for breach of this Agreement, or to prosecute or defend any suit resulting from this Agreement, or to recover on the surety bond given by Subcontractor under this Agreement, Subcontractor (Deloach) and his surety, jointly and severally, agree to pay Contractor all costs, charges, expenses and attorneys' fees expended or incurred therein ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the accident, Louisiana United Business Association Casualty Insurance Company (\"LUBACI\") paid workers' compensation death benefits to West's heirs. LUBACI then filed suit to recoup those benefits, asserting it was entitled to reimbursement because the accident was caused by the negligence of several defendants, including J &amp; J, Entergy Louisiana, LLC (\"Entergy\"), and Volvo Construction Equipment Rents, Inc. (\"Volvo\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 31-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 26, 2012, J &amp; J filed its first Third-Party Demand against Deloach alleging that J &amp; J and Deloach entered into a subcontract to perform several aspects of the remodeling project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 151-1. J &amp; J alleged under the Subcontract that Deloach agreed to\n   defend and indemnify J &amp; J against any damages arising out of the performance of Deloach's work.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . Deloach filed an Exception of Prematurity regarding these defense and indemnity claims, which was sustained by the 30th Judicial District Court, Vernon Parish, on September 3, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 137. Additionally, J &amp; J was named as a cross-defendant on a related claim in Entergy's cross-claim filed on March 26, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 151-2. Subsequent to this cross-claim, J &amp; J filed a First Supplemental and Amending Third-Party Demand against Deloach, asserting that Deloach was liable for defense and indemnification against Entergy's claims as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 151-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After J &amp; J filed an Exception of No Right of Action asserting Louisiana's workers' compensation immunity under La. R.S. 23:1032 (\"LWCA immunity\"), the claims presented by LUBACI against J &amp; J were dismissed in a Consent Judgment signed on February 24, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 155-6. On May 27, 2015, this case was removed to this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 1. On May 19, 2017, J &amp; J filed its Cross-Claim and Renewed Third-Party Demand against Deloach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 137. Entergy's Cross-Claim against J &amp; J was dismissed via a settlement agreement procured by Deloach on November 13, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the only remaining claim at issue in this matter is J &amp; J's claims against Deloach for the costs of defense, including attorneys' fees incurred in defending against claims brought by LUBACI and Entergy, as well as attorneys' fees and costs incurred in prosecuting this claim against Deloach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 19, 2017, Deloach filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on J &amp; J's cross-claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 151. J &amp; J filed its opposition on December 29, 2017, to which Deloach replied on January 5, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Documents 157 and 158. The Court allowed J &amp; J to file a sur-reply, which it did so on January 17, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 164. In addition to its opposition, J &amp; J filed its own Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on December 29, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 155. Deloach opposed the motion on January 12, 2018, and J &amp; J replied on January 18, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 160 and 161. Deloach also filed a sur-reply on January 22, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 169. The issues have been briefed extensively by the parties; therefore, the matter is ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rule 56 of the F.R.C.P. governs summary judgment. This rule provides that the court \"shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" F.R.C.P. 56(a). Also, \"a party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the motion by citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including ... affidavits ... or showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\" F.R.C.P. 56(c)(1)(A) and (B). \"If a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may ... grant summary judgment.\" F.R.C.P. 56(e)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In a summary judgment motion, \"a party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings ...

A non-movant, however, cannot meet the burden of proving that a genuine issue of material fact exists by providing only \"some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, by conclusory allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a scintilla of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1848605\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/1069/#p1075\">\n    37 F.3d at 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Additionally, in deciding a summary judgment motion, courts \"resolve factual controversies in favor of the nonmoving party, but only when there is an actual controversy, that is when both parties have submitted evidence of contradictory facts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1848605\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/1069/#p1075\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Courts \"do not, however, in the absence of any proof, assume that the nonmoving party could or would prove the necessary facts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1848605\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/1069/#p1075\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Timeliness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Deloach argues J &amp; J's motion for partial summary judgment is untimely; therefore, the Court should dismiss it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 160 at 4. Conversely, J &amp; J argues its motion is a motion for \"partial summary judgment\" and is beyond the scope of the dispositive motion deadline as set forth in the Court's Scheduling Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 161. J &amp; J's argument is incorrect. First, a \"dispositive motion\" includes a motion that, if granted, would result in the determination of a particular claim on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tripoli Rocketry Ass'n, Inc. v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3928810\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/698/168/#p173\">\n    698 F.Supp.2d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (D.D.C. 2010). J &amp; J's labeling of its motion as one for \"partial summary judgment\" does not defeat what the motion seeks-a determination of whether Deloach is liable for the costs of defense, including attorneys' fees incurred in defending against claims of LUBACI and Entergy, as well as attorneys' fees and costs incurred in J &amp; J's prosecution of this claim against Deloach. Additionally, courts have traditionally treated motions for \"partial summary judgment\" as dispositive motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geiserman v. MacDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11647677\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/893/787/#p790\">\n    893 F.2d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 790 (5th Cir. 1990) ;\n   <em>\n    Arnold v.

JLM Advanced Tech. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205854235\">\n    2016 WL 5854235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *2 (W.D.

Pike Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202378361\">\n    2017 WL 2378361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *2 (S.D. Miss. 2017). Accordingly, J &amp; J's \"motion for partial summary judgment\" is considered a dispositive motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Per the Court's Scheduling Order, all dispositive motions were due ninety (90) days before trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 136 at 1. With a trial date of March 19, 2018, this made all dispositive motions due on December 19, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 135. J &amp; J filed its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on December 29, 2017, ten (10) days after the deadline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 155. Therefore, J &amp; J's motion is considered untimely. However, under the circumstances in the instant matter, the Court does not believe dismissal would be proper. J &amp; J's motion seeks a ruling on the same legal question posed in\n   Deloach's motion-whether Deloach is liable for the costs of defense incurred in defending and prosecuting claims arising from the subcontract-and there are no facts in dispute between the parties. While J &amp; J's motion was filed late, the Court finds that considering the motion will not unduly prejudice Deloach and will allow the Court to render judgment on a purely legal question without requiring this issue to go to trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pratt Paper (LA), LLC v. JLM Advanced Tech. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205854235\">\n    2016 WL 5854235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *2 (W.D.

Interpretation of the Subcontract's Indemnity Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, Deloach argues that the Subcontract limits reimbursement of defense costs to situations of negligence or breach committed only by Deloach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 151-6 at 6-7. Conversely, J &amp; J asserts Deloach's indemnification obligations are triggered not just by its own negligence, but also by any claims \"arising out of or resulting from the performance of [Deloach's] work.\" Record Document 157 at 4. In its Reply, Deloach argues that J &amp; J has not shown the \"connexity\" between the accident and the work to trigger the indemnity provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 158 at 3-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under Louisiana law, the language in an indemnity agreement dictates the obligations of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bollinger Marine Fabricators, LLC v.

However, Deloach's argument as to how West was attempting to perform part of Deloach's work,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the use of a manlift as opposed to carrying up soffit panels up a ladder,\n   does not change the fact that he was doing Deloach's work. Additionally, Deloach fails to cite any legal authority to support its position. Deloach's citation to\n   <em>\n    Spencer v. Chevron Corporation\n   </em>\n   , 216-0174 (La.

In that case, employees of a subcontractor were injured while sleeping near the work site rather than while they were actually performing the subcontractor's work.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187845\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/202/1055/#p1056\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to the facts of the instant matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Subcontract expressly provides that Deloach's indemnification obligations is triggered not just by its own negligence, but also by any claims \"arising out of or resulting from the performance of [Deloach's] work.\" The Court finds sufficient connexity between West's accident and Deloach's work. Therefore, the indemnity provision is triggered and J &amp; J would be entitled to entitled to indemnity from Deloach for J &amp; J's costs of defense and expenses if the Court need not adjudicate fault on behalf of J &amp; J, discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Deloach argues without such a determination, J &amp; J cannot gain reimbursement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 160 at 4. Pertaining to J &amp; J's fault regarding LUBACI's negligence claims, J &amp; J argues it is not premature for the Court to make such a finding, pointing out the state court has dismissed, via consent judgment, LUBACI's claims against J &amp; J as barred by LWCA immunity, and such immunity \"extinguishes any factually possible cause of action and, therefore, forecloses any possible finding of negligence\" against J &amp; J. Record Document 155-1 at 15. Thus, J &amp; J argues this Court has not, and will not, reach the issue of its own negligence and, therefore, J &amp; J's claims for indemnity against Deloach are not invalidated by La. R.S. 9:2780.1. As for J &amp; J's fault as it relates to Entergy's claim, J &amp; J suggests the Court's denial of Entergy's motion for summary judgment \"reveals that, as a matter of law, J &amp; J was not 'negligent' or at fault.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187845\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/202/1055/#p1056\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187845\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/202/1055/#p1056\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Deloach takes the position that because J &amp; J has not been found to be free from fault or negligence regarding either LUBACI or Entergy's claims, as required by La.

Under the statute, any agreement whereby Deloach provided defense or indemnity against loss or damage resulting from the negligence of J &amp; J is null, void, and unenforceable. Although courts have not addressed La.

R.S. 9:2780.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit has interpreted this provision of the LOIA as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    After trial on the merits\n   </em>\n   , if the indemnitee is found free from fault, the Act does not prohibit the indemnitee from recovering its cost of defense.

After a thorough review of the cited cases and the arguments presented by each party, the Court agrees with J &amp; J and follows the reasoning of Judge Doherty in\n   <em>\n    Hefren\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hefren\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff filed suit against Murphy Exploration &amp; Production Company, USA (\"Murphy\") and McDermott, Inc.

The Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Melancon\n   </em>\n   reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   In the case at bar, the Melancons alleged that the negligence and/or legal fault of the indemnitee, Amoco, caused Mr. Melancon's injuries. However, the Louisiana Supreme Court has held after certification from this Court that under the Louisiana Oilfield Indemnity Act \"[t]he allegations of the plaintiff's suit against the indemnitee are irrelevant to the indemnitor's obligation to pay. Rather it is the terms of the indemnity agreement which govern the obligations of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Meloy v.

For that reason Amoco is entitled to indemnity from Beraud for the costs of its defense.\n   </em>\n   Provision 10 of the Amoco-Beraud contract so provides, and the Louisiana Oilfield Indemnity Act does not apply absent a finding of negligence or fault against Amoco.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10551378\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/834/1238/\">\n    834 F.2d at 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Next, Judge Doherty addressed the second line of cases, beginning with\n   <em>\n    Tanksley v.

In\n   <em>\n    Tanksley\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held an oil company that settled with the plaintiff was barred by the LOIA from pursuing the contractor for indemnity because the oil company, by choosing to settle with the plaintiff, voluntarily foreclosed determination of its negligence or fault. In so ruling, the Fifth Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    The essential difference between the factual scenario in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Melancon\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    and that here presented relates to the legal availability of a determination of the negligence or fault of the indemnitee.\n   </em>\n   Once the court decided that Melancon was an Amoco borrowed employee, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Act proscribed any judicial inquiry into Amoco's fault or negligence. Thus, as a matter of law, there could never be a \"trial on the merits\" to determine whether Amoco was \"free from fault and thus outside the scope of the [Louisiana Oilfield Indemnity] Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Meloy v.

In that setting, we concluded that the Oilfield Indemnity Act did not annul the indemnity provision and that Amoco was entitled to recover its costs of defense of the tort suit brought by Melancon, and the costs it incurred in pressing its indemnification demands.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10551378\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/834/1238/\">\n    834 F.2d at 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    In the case at bar, a trial on the merits to determine Chevron's fault or negligence was not only legally possible, it was imminent and was foreclosed only by the compromise settlement with Tanksley.\n   </em>\n   The parties undoubtedly reached this settlement after a careful weighing of all relevant factors and risks. For reasons it deemed sufficient, Chevron opted to forego a trial at which it would either have been found liable or exonerated. The appeal of the certainty of settlement overrode the contending appeal of the uncertainty of trial. As a consequence, because of Chevron's choice, there will be no trial on the merits of Tanksley's claims to determine whether Chevron was \"free from fault and thus outside the scope of the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Absent such a finding, or a legal bar\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    preventing the finding, as in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Melancon\n    </em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    we must conclude that the Oilfield Indemnity Act nullifies, in this instance, the indemnity agreement between Chevron and SEE.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Tanksley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783388\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/515/\">\n    848 F.2d at 517-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Judge Doherty noted the rejection of\n   <em>\n    Tanksley\n   </em>\n   by two of the five Louisiana appellate courts in\n   <em>\n    Ridings v.

However, Deloach does not address Judge Doherty's analysis, nor that of the Fifth Circuit in its opinion affirming her decision. In fact, Judge Doherty specifically distinguished\n   <em>\n    Ridings\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   -cases that involved settlement of claims-from cases involving legal bars, as is the case here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hefren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326514\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/34/651/\">\n    34 F.Supp.3d at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Deloach next argues that\n   <em>\n    Melancon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hefren\n   </em>\n   are inapposite because this matter involves the application of LWCA immunity and Louisiana law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 160 at 6. However, the immunities provided by the LHWCA and LWCA are virtually the same. The LHWCA is a federal workers' compensation scheme designed to provide exclusive remedies for longshoremen and harbor workers that are injured in the course of employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20902\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) - (3). The compensation is designed to be paid regardless of fault, and employers are liable exclusively for compensation under Section 904 of the LHWCA and all other liability for injury is precluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20904\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 905(a). The LWCA provides the exclusive remedy for an employee injured by the negligent acts of his or her co-employees or employer when those injuries arise out of and in the course of employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 23:1031 and 23:1032. Deloach's argument is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Lastly, Deloach argues J &amp; J's fault must be determined pursuant to La. Civ. Code art. 2323.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 160 at 6. This argument is also unavailing. Deloach's position would be more persuasive if LUBACI's (the original plaintiff) negligence claims against the other defendants (Entergy and Volvo) were still pending. However, all of LUBACI's claims have been dismissed without an adjudication of fault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Documents 15-4 (J &amp; J); 43 (Volvo); 93 (Entergy). Given the facts of this matter and following Fifth Circuit jurisprudence, the Court does not find it appropriate to determine J &amp; J's fault after the only claims of negligence alleged against it were dismissed because of a legal bar-LWCA immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hefren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326514\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/34/651/\">\n    34 F.Supp.3d at 660, n.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the dismissal of the only party asserting negligence claims prevented \"any possible finding of negligence against McDermott\"). Accordingly, The Court will follow\n   <em>\n    Hefren\n   </em>\n   in its analysis of J &amp; J's fault regarding both LUBACI's negligence claim and Entergy's cross-claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    i. LUBACI's Negligence Claims Against J &amp; J\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Here, LUBACI's claims never reached the issue of J &amp; J's negligence because LUBACI's claims against J &amp; J were dismissed pursuant to LWCA immunity. Thus, as a matter of law, there could never be a \"trial on the merits\" to determine whether J &amp; J was \"free from fault\" and thus outside the scope of La. R.S. 9:2780.1. The LWCA's legal bar is nearly identical to the LHWCA's bar in\n   <em>\n    Melancon\n   </em>\n   , discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, as with the legal bar of the LHWCA in\n   <em>\n    Melancon\n   </em>\n   and the legal bar of peremption in\n   <em>\n    Hefren\n   </em>\n   , the Court could not have reached the issue of negligence here. Accordingly, the Court's failure to find J &amp; J free from fault does not bar J &amp; J's right to indemnity as it pertains to J &amp; J's claims against Deloach for the costs of defense, including attorneys' fees, incurred in defending against claims of LUBACI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Entergy's Cross-Claims Against J &amp; J\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   J &amp; J's claims against Deloach for the costs of defense incurred in defending against claims of Entergy do not enjoy a smiliar fate. Entergy's claims were not dismissed pursuant to a legal bar, but rather a settlement agreement. Accordingly, the Court finds\n   <em>\n    Tanksley\n   </em>\n   applicable in this instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, because J &amp; J\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   settled Entergy's claims without a determination of fault, it is precluded by La. R.S. 9:2780.1 from seeking indemnity from its indemnitor, Deloach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   J &amp; J argues that a determination of its freedom of fault was determined by the Court when it denied Entergy's motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 155-1 at 15. J &amp; J concedes that the Court's ruling was merely a denial of a motion for summary judgment by Entergy and not an affirmative grant of summary judgment; however, it suggests a \"cursory review\" of the Court's ruling \"reveals that, as a matter of law, J &amp; J was not negligent or at fault with respect to the OPLSA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In its ruling, the Court stated, \"Entergy fails to show how J &amp; J fell short of its OPLSA obligation....\" Record Document 146 at 4-5. However, this argument is unavailing because the recognition that Entergy had failed to establish J &amp; J's fault for purposes of Entergy's motion is not tantamount to the Court finding that J &amp; J had no responsibility for the accident in question. When the Court denied Entergy's motion for summary judgment, it simply found that Entergy failed to carry its burden to show it was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. As the Court stated in its ruling, \"As Entergy fails to demonstrate an OPLSA violation by J &amp; J, it has not shown that it is entitled to summary judgment on its claim for indemnity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 5. The Court did not address any allocation of fault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because J &amp; J, through Deloach, settled Entergy's cross-claims without a determination of fault (as opposed to a legal bar-LWCA immunity in this case-preventing such a determination), J &amp; J is precluded from seeking indemnity for its costs incurred in defending against Entergy's cross-claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BJ Servs. Co., USA v.
