This Initial Petition stated that the term of Deo's intended employment would be three years, from October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2012, the maximum amount of time permitted by the regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It also stated that Deo had a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Dublin City University, in Ireland. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US510.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 9, 2009, USCIS issued a Request for Evidence (\"RFE\") with respect to NGT's Initial Petition, seeking additional information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US525-28.) As it appeared that NGT was \"engaged in the business of consulting, employment staffing, or job placement,\" USCIS stated that it required clarification of NGT's \"employer-employee relationship with the beneficiary,\" as well as evidence from the \"end-client\" sufficient to establish that \"a specialty occupation exist[ed] for the beneficiary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US527.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In return, NGT submitted a letter dated July 18, 2009, clarifying that the beneficiary would be \"developing SAP solutions package for Packaging Industries\" and that this work was being done \"in conjunction\" with NGT's client/partner, SAP America, Inc. (\"SAP\"), rather than for a client. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US529.) NGT further clarified that the work was being completed \"in-house\" and not at \"the client location,\" and provided the name and contact information for the internal project manager overseeing the work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US529-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 27, 2009, USCIS approved NGT's Initial Petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US491.) On November 22, 2009, however, Deo entered the United States as a B-2 visitor, instead of proceeding to apply for her H-1B visa at the U.S. Consulate in Amsterdam, as originally planned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US14, US728.) On March 1, 2010, NGT submitted an amended petition to USCIS for an H1-B visa on Deo's behalf (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at US1098-127 (\"Amended\n   Petition,\" referenced in the Record by petition receipt number WAC1010250458) ), and, on or about June 9, 2010, NGT submitted a second amended petition (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at US697-706 (\"Second Amended Petition,\" referenced in the Record by petition receipt number WAC1020250476) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 2, 2010, USCIS issued an RFE with respect to the Second Amended Petition, requesting the following: (1) an itinerary of employment for the beneficiary,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) information sufficient to establish, by a preponderance of evidence, that NGT had a valid employer-employee relationship with Deo, such that it possessed the right to control and direct her work; and (3) evidence demonstrating that NGT had sufficient specialty occupation work immediately available for the beneficiary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US787-92.) Each request was accompanied by a non-exhaustive list of sample evidence that could address the request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The second and third requests specifically listed, as the type of evidence that could constitute an appropriate response: \"Copy of signed Employment Agreement between [NGT] and the beneficiary detailing the terms and conditions of employment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 10, 2010, NGT responded to the RFE with additional evidence, including an itinerary and signed employment agreement between NGT and Deo, dated May 21, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US800-05, US819.) The itinerary listed Deo's title as \"Research Engineer (Programmer)\" and stated that she would \"develop computational models to optimize the extraction process ... of active bio-molecules from their natural resources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US801, US806.) The itinerary listed Deo's dates of employment as May 24, 2010 to September 28, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In reference to Deo's duties while employed by NGT, the employment agreement stated: \"Employee shall report to such offices or locations as assigned by Employer, and shall be available to work as needed and directed by the management of NGT or the management of the Client location where she is reporting....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US813.) Also in response to the RFE, NGT stated that \"the minimum requirement for entry into the position [of programmer] is attainment of a Bachelor's degree in Engineering or Technology (or its equivalent), plus 1-2 years of experience.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US801.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 26, 2010, having found NGT's evidence to be insufficient, USCIS issued a Notice of Intent to Revoke (\"NOIR\") its approval of the Initial Petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US238.) USCIS found that \"the statement of facts contained in the [Second Amended Petition] was not true and correct,\" because (1) \"it [did] not appear that the petitioner [was] the entity that [would] be providing such [specialty occupation] duties to the beneficiary,\" and (2) \"a query of public record information discovered that on March 18, 2010, [NGT] had filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy,\" thus calling into question NGT's ability to pay Deo the required wage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US240-42.) On this second point, USCIS noted that NGT had previously provided USCIS with its 2008 U.S. Corporate Tax Return showing that its gross sales were $5.2 million, and it had not notified the agency of its subsequent bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) USCIS asserted in the NOIR that, for these reasons, NGT had violated H-1B requirements, and further noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [without] valid contracts between the petitioner and the actual end-client firm ultimately involved with the beneficiary's computer related duties, the evidence\n   does not establish the work to be completed; that the duties to be performed are those of a computer programmer position, and, thus, a specialty occupation position; and that the work will be available for the beneficiary when he [sic] enters the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US243-44.) The NOIR afforded NGT 30 days to submit further evidence in response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US238.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   NGT responded to the NOIR by a letter from its counsel, dated October 18, 2010 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at US256),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   explaining that, although \"the term 'consultant' \" had been used in reference to Deo and NGT \"does supply expertise to third parties, the employment relationship [in question] remains completely and solely between [NGT] and [Deo]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.14.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at US260). NGT's counsel reiterated that NGT was \"\n   <em>\n    not providing the beneficiary as a consultant to SAP America, Inc.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US257 (emphasis in original).) The letter further noted that, due to delays caused by the beneficiary and time spent awaiting adjudication of its H-1B petition, the initial project that NGT had intended for Deo, entitled \"Professional Industry Knowledge for Packaging Application Consulting\" (the \"PIK PAC\"), had been largely completed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US259-60, US536.) Thus, the letter stated that NGT intended to employ Deo mainly as a \"high skilled programmer ... to develop [a] computational model for the prediction of the extractability of active bio-molecules from their natural resources for Next Generation Technology SCRD (Specialty Chemicals Research and Development)\" (\"NGT/SCRD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US334.) The letter further indicated that NGT also anticipated needing Deo's help implementing the already-developed SAP PIK PAC and modifying \"the solution as per the customers' need.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) NGT's counsel noted that the SAP PIK PAC project had arisen from a partnership agreement between NGT and SAP America, and explained that \"the two corporations [were] in a partnership arrangement to create a new software package to be marketed to a particular industry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US257 (emphasis omitted).) NGT also submitted a letter from its bankruptcy attorney, dated October 20, 2010, indicating that the company intended to reorganize, rather than liquidate, through Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and that it was \"continuing to operate fully ... under the supervision of the SDNY Bankruptcy Court and the United States Trustee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US311-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On November 30, 2010, USCIS issued a Notice of Revocation (\"NOR\") of its approval of NGT's Initial Petition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.14.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at US232-37.) In reviewing the evidence submitted by NGT in response to the August 2010 RFE and the September 2010 NOIR, USCIS found that NGT had failed to demonstrate that there would be specialty occupation work available for Deo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US234.) USCIS noted that NGT's partnership agreement with SAP America (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.14.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at US266-310) was signed and commenced after Deo's proposed employment start date (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at US235). USCIS explained that \"the fact that [NGT] may at some time in the future be fully qualified [to provide specialty occupation work] [did] not exempt [NGT] from being eligible at the time of the filing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US236.) Given\n   that NGT had stated that SAP America was its partner and not its end client, and on the apparent assumption that not all of Deo's work was intended to be performed for the partnership, USCIS also found that there was insufficient evidence from the actual end client concerning Deo's proposed duties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US235.) On this point, USCIS wrote that, as \"the very nature of [NGT's] consulting business indicated that[,] eventually, [Deo] would be outsourced to client sites to implement specific projects and/or assist clients with other technical issues,\" the evidence provided that pertained to only one project could not \"be deemed representative of [Deo's] entire schedule while in the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US237.) Regarding NGT's Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, USCIS explained that, while the letter from bankruptcy counsel and Notice of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy produced by NGT noted NGT's \"attempts to enter new contracts\" and its commitment of \"over $400,000 in marketing funds for the year 2009 in order to grow its SAP practice,\" those submissions \"fail[ed] to address the actual in-house project\" at issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US236.) Further, USCIS stated that NGT had provided no documentation or evidence from the Bankruptcy Court regarding NGT's ability to reorganize or liquidate pursuant to a plan; rather, NGT had provided \"[m]ere assertions of counsel,\" which were not evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on this reasoning, USCIS revoked its approval of NCT's Initial Petition and denied its Second Amended Petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US237, US697.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 16, 2010, NGT filed an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Office (\"AAO\"), challenging the revocation by USCIS of its approval of the Initial Petition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.14.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at US116.) By cover letter, NGT also asked for an additional 30 days to submit a supporting brief, and requested that, upon receipt of the brief, the agency consider the submission \"as a Motion to Reopen/Reconsider before forwarding to the AAO for adjudication.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US117.) On January 11, 2011, NGT submitted a brief and additional evidence in support of its appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.14.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at US125.) The brief clarified that, contrary to USCIS's findings, NGT's role in developing the SAP PIK PAC solution for its partner SAP was NGT's \"contribution\" to the entities' partnership rather than a \"contradict[ion] of the partnership arrangement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US127.) NGT also noted that USCIS had chosen to ignore evidence of NGT's prior agreements with SAP that were entered into prior to the petition filing date, and to focus exclusively on the fact that the formal agreement between NGT and SAP, which was produced to the Government as evidence that Deo was not being employed as a consultant, was entered into after the filing date of the petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US128.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition, NGT argued that, to the extent USCIS' decision was based on NGT's Chapter 11 filing, the decision was erroneous because it presumed, without justification, that NGT would not be able to continue to function during and after bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US129.) As evidence of its ability to employ Deo and to pay her the wage described in its petitions, NGT produced a letter from an \"angel investor\" committing to invest $200,000 in NGT, and an investment agreement by which Donald J Dymond committed to invest $90,000 in NGT. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US80-81.) These documents showed that the funds from both investors were specifically allocated for implementation of the SAP PIK PAC project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) NGT also submitted an industry/peer review of the anticipated SAP PIK PAC solution from Jim Shaw (\"Shaw\"), an industry peer with \"almost 35 years of professional management experience.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US169.) Shaw's letter stated that, after carefully reviewing and vetting NGT's project with his \"industry colleagues,\" he had concluded that the SAP PIK PAC was an\n   \"exciting software solution that will receive strong support within the packaging industry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US169-70.) In a subsequent letter dated September 5, 2012, in which NGT asked the AAO to expedite its decision, NGT further informed the AAO that NGT had recently received a $200,000 National Science Foundation grant for Deo's second planned project, by which she would develop a computational model for the prediction of the extractability of active bio-molecules from their natural resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US175-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On November 3, 2012, the AAO dismissed NGT's appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US29-38.) The AAO found that NGT had failed to prove that the proposed position qualified as a \"specialty occupation\" and that NGT had paid Deo the required wage, and had failed to establish that a \"credible offer of H-1B caliber employment existed at the time of filing and for the duration of the beneficiary's requested stay.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US32, US37.) The notice of the dismissal of the appeal informed NGT that it could file a motion to reconsider or a motion to reopen, if it \"believe[d] [that] the AAO inappropriately applied the law in reaching its decision,\" or if NGT had \"additional information\" that it wished to have considered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US29.) On November 25, 2012, NGT filed a motion to reconsider the AAO's decision denying its appeal of USCIS's revocation of approval of the Initial Petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US55.) In that motion, NGT argued that it had been \"presented, time after time, with arguments that appear[ed] after [NGT] [had] adequately responded to requests for evidence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) NGT complained that \"[t]his situation of 'moving targets' [made] it extremely difficult for [NGT] to meaningfully present evidence and respond to [USCIS] and AAO concerns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In its motion, NGT stressed that it had ample in-house opportunities for the beneficiary with no end-client involvement, further described the complexities of Deo's proposed roles and responsibilities, argued that a bachelor's degree was, \"in fact, the normal requirement in the industry [for Deo's position] according to all sources,\" and noted that, because \"the beneficiary was not ever able to work for the petitioner\" due to the revocation of Initial Petition, \"failure to pay [Deo] was never a possibility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US60-1, US67, US74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On July 2, 2014, USCIS sent NGT a Notice of Derogatory Information (\"NDI\"), which gave NGT an opportunity to respond to potential bases for the agency's adverse decision of which NGT was previously unaware. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US23-27.) NGT responded to the NDI on July 31, 2014.

As a preliminary matter, the AAO found that NGT had \"sufficiently addressed the issues raised\" in the NDI, such that those issues need \"not be discussed further.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US4 n. 1.) The AAO also concluded that \"[i]n light of the evidence of record,\" the AAO was \"persuaded by counsel that the SAP/Petitioner agreements [did] not establish that the beneficiary would be working as an employee of SAP.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US9.) Nonetheless, the AAO found that the revocation of approval for the Initial Petition and denial of the Second Amended Petition were proper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US3-10.) It stated that NGT had failed to make the following showings: (1) that H-1B caliber work existed for Deo at the time of filing or that a work itinerary existed for her; (2) that Deo would be employed as a programmer for the duration of her employment; (3) that the proposed position qualified as a specialty occupation; and (4) that NGT did, in fact, pay Deo the required wage in compliance with its obligations.

Somehow, based on this and on a document that NGT submitted to USCIS that indicated 11 percent of computer programmer positions required some college or no degree and six percent required only a high school diploma (R. at US107), the Government argues that \"the record demonstrates that USCIS properly determined that computer programmers are not normally required to have a bachelor's degree\" (Def.

In this instance, where the Record demonstrates that NGT is a consulting firm and that Deo would be working on software for clients (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. at US123)-two factors listed by the agency itself as weighing in favor of its already \"general\" view that a programmer position qualifies as a specialty occupation-USCIS's determination to the contrary about the position at issue in this case would appear to lack \"reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20352309\">\n    2012 WL 352309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The second relevant portion of the Occupational Handbook relates to whether to whether a bachelor's degree or higher\n   <em>\n    in the specific specialty\n   </em>\n   is required for a programmer job. On this point, the AAO found that the Occupational Handbook \"does not state [that] a U.S. bachelor's or higher degree in a specific specialty or its equivalent ... [is] a normal minimum requirement ... for entry into the occupation of computer programmer.\" (R. at US37.) This, however, does not represent a fair reading of the Occupational Handbook. While noting that \"some employers hire\n   workers with an associate's degree\" for computer programmer positions, the Occupational Handbook goes on to state that \"[m]ost computer programmers have a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related subject.\" Occupational Handbook (\"Computer Programmers/How to Become a Computer Programmer\"). Thus, if the proposed position qualifies as a computer programmer position, then the Occupational Handbook arguably demonstrates that a bachelor's degree or higher in a specific specialty is \"normal[ly]\" the minimum requirement for entry into the position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(4)(iii)(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that USCIS disregarded \"pertinent evidence\" in the Record and failed to \"articulate[ ] a satisfactory explanation for its action\" in declining to find that the programmer position being offered for Deo by NGT was a \"specialty occupation,\" within the meaning of the INA and applicable regulations, and that USCIS's decision in this regard was therefore arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    Noroozi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824255\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/905/535/#p541\">\n    905 F.Supp.2d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Evidence That NGT and Deo Would Be in a Valid Employer-Employee Relationship\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Only a \"United States employer\" that has \"an employer-employee relationship [with the beneficiary], as indicated by the fact that it may hire, pay, fire, supervise, or otherwise control the work of [the beneficiary],\" can file an H-1B petition on the beneficiary's behalf. 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(2)(i)(A) ; 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(4)(ii)(2).

The factors are used to establish whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, the employer has submitted evidence sufficient to establish that it has the right to control the beneficiary's work. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Neufeld Factors are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (1) Does the petitioner supervise the beneficiary and is such supervision off-site or on-site?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (2) If the supervision is off-site, how does the petitioner maintain such supervision, i.e. weekly calls, reporting back to main office routinely, or site visits by the petitioner?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (3) Does the petitioner have the right to control the work of the beneficiary on a day-today basis if such control is required?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (4) Does the petitioner provide the tools or instrumentalities needed for the beneficiary to perform the duties of employment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (5) Does the petitioner hire, pay, and have the ability to fire the beneficiary?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (6) Does the petitioner evaluate the work-product of the beneficiary, i.e. progress/performance reviews?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (7) Does the petitioner claim the beneficiary for tax purposes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (8) Does the petitioner provide the beneficiary any type of employee benefits?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (9) Does the beneficiary use proprietary information of the petitioner in order to perform the duties of employment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (10) Does the beneficiary produce an end-product that is directly linked to the petitioner's line of business?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (11) Does the petitioner have the ability to control the manner and means in which the work of the beneficiary is accomplished?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (Neufeld Memorandum, at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In this case, much of USCIS's apparent concern regarding the NGT petitions centered on whether Deo was, in fact, to be employed by NGT. That concern was not unfounded. Deo's employment agreement with NGT states that she \"shall report to such offices or locations as assigned by Employer, and shall be available to work as needed and directed by the management of NGT or the management\n   <em>\n    of the Client location where she is reporting.\n   </em>\n   \" (R. at US326 (emphasis added).) The possibility that Deo could have been placed at a third-party worksite supports an inference that NGT would not have had the power to \"hire, pay, fire, supervise, or otherwise control\" her work. 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(4)(ii)(2). Indeed, USCIS has found that such third-party \"placements are likely to require close review in order to determine if the required relationship exists.\" (Neufeld Memorandum at 2.) Accordingly, USCIS reasonably requested additional information sufficient to establish that NGT would have the right to control Deo's work for the duration of her employment term. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. at US250 (requesting, in the NOIR, \"valid contracts between the petitioner and the actual end-client firm ultimately involved with the beneficiary's computer related duties\").) Ultimately, one of the stated grounds upon which USCIS revoked the Initial Petition was that NGT had purportedly failed to provide \"a comprehensive description of the beneficiary's proposed duties from an authorized representative of the petitioner's client or clients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US235.) Similarly, the AAO denied NGT's appeal, in part, because NGT supposedly failed \"to specifically establish the nature of the beneficiary's employment throughout the course of the requested validity period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As NGT noted in its responses to USCIS, however, it actually did provide the requested information. For example, NGT provided an employment itinerary for the PIK PAC project, which stated that the project was being \"developed in-house,\" and that Deo would report to an internal NGT manager, \"Mr. Anil Pattnaik,\" for the duration of the project, which was expected to be completed \"on or about February 2012.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US531-32.) In a response to the NOIR, NGT's counsel also represented that NGT would not be \"providing the beneficiary as a consultant to SAP America, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at US257 (emphasis omitted) ), but rather that Deo would \"work solely for [NGT] to complete this work\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). NGT additionally provided an \"Itinerary of Services\" for the project Deo would complete for NGT/SCRD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US143.) That itinerary states that Deo would work on that project in-house and \"communicate with the end-client via internet connection.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It also lists Deo's duties, dates of employment on the specific project, and contact information for the NGT employee who would serve as Deo's employer/supervisor for the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) NGT further clarified, in support of its appeal to the AAO, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [NGT] (and not the end-client) can hire or fire the beneficiary and control the nature of her work. [NGT], and not the end-client, supervise[s] the beneficiary's work. The beneficiary reports to a supervisor\n   in [NGT's] organization, and not to someone in the end-client's organization ... the beneficiary, through internet connection, has access to the end-client's computer system and data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US147.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Based on this evidence, many, if not all, of the Neufeld Factors seem to have weighed in NGT's favor. As to the first factor, NGT informed USCIS that it was intending to supervise Deo, with supervision on-site (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at US531); this renders the second factor (the nature of supervision, if off-site) inapplicable. As to the third factor, NGT represented that, because the Project was to be completed in-house, NGT would have the exclusive right to control Deo's work on a day to day basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US147.) As to the fourth factor, NGT indicated that it would \"provide and maintain such facilities, equipment, supplies, and personnel as it deem[ed] necessary\" for the performance of Deo's duties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US328.) As to the fifth factor, NGT informed USCIS that it would have the ability to hire, pay, and fire Deo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US326-27.) As to the sixth factor, NGT stated that it would conduct a review of Deo's performance on a monthly basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US148.) As to the seventh factor, NGT stated that it was planning to issue Deo a W-2 at the end of each year, and would claim her as an employee for tax purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US147.) As to the eighth factor, NGT stated that it would provide Deo with employee benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US147, US165-66.) As to the ninth factor, it is likely, based on the terms of NGT's agreement with SAP, that Deo would use NGT's proprietary information in order to perform the duties of employment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at US167.) As to the 10th factor, NGT represented that the beneficiary would produce an end-product that would be directly linked to the petitioner's line of business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US537-38.) Finally, as to the 11th factor, NGT indicated that it would have the ability to control the manner and means in which the work of the beneficiary would be accomplished. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US147.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Based on this, it does not appear from the Record that USCIS gathered all necessary evidence, or considered \"all relevant factors,\" in analyzing NGT's proposed employer-employee relationship with Deo.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Audubon Soc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11886186\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/132/7/#p14\">\n    132 F.3d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Evidence That NGT Could Pay Deo the Established Wage\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   An employer's H1-B petition may be denied if the employer \"has substantially failed\" to demonstrate that it will pay the nonimmigrant employee the prevailing wage.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(4)(i)(B)(5) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20212\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (n)(1).

As the agency either failed to consider, or inexplicably discounted, a significant amount of evidence on the Record regarding NGT's financial condition, the Court cannot find that USCIS's rejection of NGT's petitions on this ground was \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the [R]ecord when considered as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Glara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20352309\">\n    2012 WL 352309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Overall, USCIS's explanations of its actions are insufficient to enable the Court to determine if the agency simply failed to consider the evidence submitted by NGT that would have favored approval of its petitions, or if the agency in fact considered that evidence and, for some reason, discounted it. As USCIS did not squarely address much of NGT's evidence, or specify what additional evidence NGT could have produced to support its petitions, this Court cannot fully evaluate the agency's actions. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate for the Court to remand this matter to USCIS for reconsideration and/or a more complete explanation of (a) the revocation of its approval of NGT's Initial Petition, and (b) the denial of NGT's Second Amended Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v.

USCIS, however, did not deprive Plaintiffs of adequate notice and an opportunity to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   First, the agency's RFEs were \"communicated by regular or electronic mail\" and specified the type of additional evidence required by the agency.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(8)(iv) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. at US525-28, 787-92.

The information provided by USCIS was \"sufficient to give [NGT and Deo, on whose behalf the petitions had been submitted] adequate notice and sufficient information to respond.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Second, the content of the NOIR was in compliance with the applicable regulations. When USCIS issues an NOIR, the Notice must \"contain a detailed statement of the grounds for the revocation and the time period allowed for the petitioner's rebuttal,\" which is 30 days.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(11)(iii)(B). In this instance, USCIS supplied a statement of the grounds for the intended revocation and duly notified NGT of its 30-day reply window to respond. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. at US238-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Third, at other stages in the process of its consideration of NGT's petitions, USCIS consistently offered NGT opportunities to submit additional evidence in response\n   to concerns raised by the agency. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at US232-37 (NOR discussing grounds of revocation and informing NGT that it could appeal the decision);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at US23-7 (NDI notifying NGT of derogatory information of which it was unaware, which could be used as a basis for revocation by USCIS under 8 C.F.R. 103.2(b)(16)(i) );\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at US3-10, US29-38 (AAO decisions denying NGT's appeals and informing NGT of basis for denial and that it could file a motion for reconsideration or a motion to reopen in compliance with 8 C.F.R. 103.2(b)(8)(iv) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiffs, though, contend that their due-process rights were violated by the fact that, in their view, the Government's notices and decisions \"continue[d] to raise new issues to which Plaintiffs had previously responded ... and were unaware were under scrutiny.\" (Pl. Reply Mem., at 27.) The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not shown such a due-process violation. Although the NOIR and ultimate revocation could have been more clear, it is still evident that each raised the same reasons why USCIS had determined the petitions to be insufficient. Specifically, each indicated that NGT had not provided sufficient evidence to establish that it, and it alone, would be responsible for managing Deo's work. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. at US121, US242.) Regardless of whether this was true or whether the evidence submitted by NGT was adequately addressed by USCIS (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Discussion above), USCIS apparently drew the conclusion that another employer/client would likely be managing Deo's work, obligating that employer/client to provide a description of the services required. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) USCIS also raised, in the NOIR, the issue of whether NGT's bankruptcy would preclude it from paying Deo the prevailing wage, and then cited the same issue as a basis for its decision in its ultimate Notice of Revocation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US242.) The fact that, as discussed above, USCIS may have disregarded evidence supplied by NGT that would have supported a contrary determination does not support a conclusion that Plaintiffs were deprived of proper notice and opportunity to respond.\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.
