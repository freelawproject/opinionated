ECF No. 1. The amended complaint contains ten counts, alleging violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (INA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and various constitutional provisions including Article 1 section 9 (Bill of Attainder) as well as amendments 1 (free exercise), 5 (equal protection, due process) and 6 (confrontation clause). The amended complaint names 9 official capacity defendants who are the directors of various executive departments and agencies including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of State (DOS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), National Counterterrorist Center (NCTC), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). The amended complaint also names unidentified agents of the FBI, TSC, and CBP. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October 19, 2017. ECF No. 20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 30, 2018 the Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss in part. ECF No. 35. Pursuant to the doctrine of consular non-reviewability (the decisions of the Executive Branch in reviewing visa applications are generally not subject to judicial review), the Court dismissed all aspects of the amended complaint that challenged the inadmissibility determination and denial of Latif's visa. The Court also dismissed counts 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 in their entirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6). Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because the parties had not briefed several outstanding issues, the Court directed supplemental briefing to address the following: 1) whether Plaintiffs have standing to challenge Amiri and Latif's alleged inclusion on the TECS database and the TSDB and to seek an explanation for the designation, 2) whether Plaintiff Latif, as an unadmitted non-resident alien, has a\n   right to assert a constitutional or statutory challenge to his alleged inclusion on the TECS database and TSDB and seek an explanation for the designation, 3) whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief under counts 3, 4, 8 and 10, and 4) whether Plaintiffs were required to exhaust the administrative remedies furnished by the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) prior to initiating this case. Because Plaintiffs do not have standing, this opinion will primarily address the first issue. To the extent Plaintiff Latif might have standing if he pursued different relief, the exhaustion doctrine would apply. Thus, the exhaustion doctrine will be addressed briefly as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides for dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

In\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff was an alien who was in the United States on a student visa when she was detained and prevented from boarding a plane at the San Francisco airport.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She filed suit against numerous federal agencies seeking a permanent injunction directing the government to remove her name from the No-Fly list.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addressing whether she had standing to challenge her inclusion on the list, the court noted that \"the government mischaracterizes Ibrahim's injury by focusing solely on her inability to return to the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/\">\n    at 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further explained that Ibrahim suffered distinct injuries due to her presence on the No-Fly list: \"The no Fly-List prevents her from boarding any U.S. carrier whether or not a flight departs from or lands in the United States. It also prevents her from flying over U.S. airspace. These injuries are unrelated to her lack of a visa.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court also noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Even if Ibrahim's injury were limited to her inability to enter the United States, she would still have standing. Ibrahim does not challenge the revocation of her visa, as decisions of consular officers to deny a visa are immune from judicial review. But it is a reasonable inference that removal of her name from government watchlists would make a grant of a visa more likely. If Ibrahim's name were removed from the TSDB, and thereby removed from the Consular Lookout and Support System, the State Department would be likely to grant her a visa, given that it has relied on her alleged connection to terrorism as the basis for revoking her visa and denying her application for a new one. Though Ibrahim's future ability to obtain a visa is uncertain and we would be powerless to review a denial, plaintiff need not demonstrate that there is a guarantee that their injuries will be redressed by a favorable decision ... Plaintiffs must show only that a favorable decision is\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   to redress their injuries, not that a favorable decision\n   <em>\n    will inevitably\n   </em>\n   redress their injuries ... As the district court correctly observed, while obtaining a visa may stand as a potential obstacle to her entry into the United states, it does not completely foreclose redressibility. Ibrahim is not required to solve all roadblocks simultaneously and is entitled to tackle one roadblock at a time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   More recently, the Sixth Circuit has addressed the issue of whether an individual has standing to challenge his or her designation on a terrorist watchlist. In\n   <em>\n    Shearson\n   </em>\n   , the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detained the plaintiff, a U.S. Citizen, and her daughter as they drove into the U.S. from Canada.\n   <em>\n    Shearson v.

The vehicle was searched and the plaintiff and her daughter were ultimately allowed to enter the U.S. The plaintiff filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for documents related to her detention, and she ultimately obtained documents revealing that CBP detained and searched her because \"when Customs entered her name into its system, her name returned 'an Armed and Dangerous' designation in the Customs' terrorist database.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070942\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/588/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070942\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/588/#p589\">\n    at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff sought prospective declaratory and injunctive relief claiming that her inclusion on a terrorist watchlist violated the Procedural Due Process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiff argued \"not only that the government wrongly detained her in 2006, but also that, by remaining on the list, the government is \"constrain[ing] her right to travel freely internationally, to be treated like others situated similarly to her, and has subjected her to the stigma that attends placement on a government watchlist.\" \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070942\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/588/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070942\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/588/#p589\">\n    at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Def. Supp. Br. at 7-13, ECF No. 36. For these same reasons, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim because they\n   have identified no constitutional right that has been invaded. Plaintiffs respond that they have indeed alleged injuries independent from the denial of Latif's visa, including travel impediments, reputational injury, as well as Latif's inability to enter the U.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The remaining counts from the amended complaint are counts 3, 4, 8, and 10, insofar as they allege that Plaintiffs Amiri and Latif are wrongfully listed in TECS and the TSDB (and not insofar as they challenge the denial of Latif's visa). Count 3 alleges that Defendants violated the Fifth Amendment Procedural Due Process clause because Defendants failed to provide Plaintiffs a pre-deprivation notice and an opportunity to contest the designations. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 82, 84-85. Count 4 alleges that Defendants violated the Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by infringing on Plaintiffs' right to international travel. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that \"they are unable to travel internationally because of the TECS designation placed on Amiri and Latif ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. Count 10 also alleges that Defendants violated the Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because Plaintiff Latif \"has suffered a 'change in legal status'-he is legally barred from travelling to or from the United States, which he would do had he not been subjected to the inadmissibility and TECS designation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 135. Count 8 alleges that Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because \"Defendants' actions in preventing Plaintiffs' travel into the United States were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff Amiri lacks standing to challenge her alleged inclusion on the TECS database and TSDB and to seek an explanation for the designation because she has alleged no concrete injury connected to her inclusion on these lists that is actual or imminent, and that is likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling. She alleges that she is \"unable to travel internationally because of the TECS designation\" yet identifies no instance in which she has ever unsuccessfully attempted to travel as a result of the TECS designation. Plaintiff Amiri's allegations are distinguishable from the allegations of the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim\n   </em>\n   , whose designation on the No-Fly list prevented her from boarding any U.S. Carrier, whether or not the flight departed from or landed in the U.S., and also prevented her from flying over U.S. airspace.\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/\">\n    669 F.3d at 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff Amiri, by contrast, alleges no such travel impediments. The court in\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim\n   </em>\n   also noted that \"[e]ven if Ibrahim's injury were limited to her inability to enter the United States,\" this is a distinct injury from the denial of her visa, and is sufficient to support standing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Amiri, by contrast, has not alleged that she is prevented from entering the United States.

That constitutionally protected interest must also have been\n   <em>\n    invaded\n   </em>\n   in order for a plaintiff to have suffered an injury. As discussed above, being listed on the No-Fly list results in unique travel impediments such as the inability to fly over U.S. Airspace and the inability to board a U.S. Carrier.

Latif might then be able to address the conduct in question, which might alleviate the government's suspicions concerning his connection to terrorist activity. The government might then remove him from the databases, after which he might be able to obtain a visa. This is far too speculative a scenario to support article III standing, particularly given what is known about the TECS system and the TSDB (the database that the TECS system draws information from). \"In contrast to TIDE\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (operated by\n   NCTC), the TSDB (operated by TSC) does not include 'derogatory intelligence information.'

In\n   <em>\n    Shearson\n   </em>\n   , the court held that a citizen alleging her name erroneously appeared in TECS, resulting in her being detained at a port of entry, was required to exhaust her administrative remedies by submitting a claim via the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) prior to bringing a Fifth Amendment Procedural Due Process claim against the DHS and the CBP.\n   <em>\n    Shearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070942\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/588/#p589\">\n    725 F.3d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff had argued that TRIP was \"an inadequate administrative procedure because it was created to solve the problems of air travelers who have been misidentified as being on the terrorist watchlist,\" and was not a process \"for resolving the problems of individuals actually on the watchlist or of land travelers.\"\n   <em>\n    Shearson\n   </em>\n   at 594 (6th Cir. 2013). Furthermore, the District Court's dismissal of the action for failure to exhaust occurred approximately five years after the incident in which plaintiff was detained by the CBP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Shearson v.

Thus, one could question what value the TRIP program could provide to the plaintiff at that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nevertheless, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the dismissal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   While there are deficiencies in the Redress Program process, we agree with the district court that Shearson should be required to exhaust her administrative procedures by submitting a traveler inquiry form through the Redress Program before she can proceed with this case. There is very little guidance in any Circuit considering administrative exhaustion as it pertains to the Redress Program and there is no case law in this Circuit. However, when considering the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine, making Shearson submit a Traveler Redress inquiry is reasonable to promote judicial efficiency and allow the agencies involved an opportunity to resolve problems with their procedures.... Additionally, forcing Shearson to advance her claims through the Program will promote judicial efficiency, despite the Redress Program's shortcomings. There are thousands of people on the government's terrorist watchlists, and there are thousands more people each year whom the government misidentifies as being on the lists. The Redress Program procedures help force an internal review of the data and may lead to the removal of a person's name from the terrorist database. While the Redress Program's determination letters do not provide a direct answer for travelers about whether the terrorist watchlist has included or continues to include them, the Redress Program review process creates a record that may be reviewed by a judge\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    camera.\n   </em>\n   This record will help a court better determine the issues, determine whether a plaintiff has standing, and whether the plaintiff's claim is moot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070942\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/588/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Making it easier for plaintiffs to bypass the Redress Program will burden the courts when many cases can be easily resolved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Shearson v.

Here, Plaintiff Latif alleges he was detained by the CBP due to his TECS record, which he contends is based on unsubstantiated information. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44, 69. Plaintiffs ask the Court to direct Defendants to produce records for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. This relief could potentially be obtained via the DHS TRIP process, which Plaintiff Latif has not availed himself of. Indeed, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Scherfen\n   </em>\n   invoked the DHS TRIP process, requesting removal from the TSDB, and the documents produced through that administrative process were reviewed\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   by the Court.\n   <em>\n    Scherfen v.
