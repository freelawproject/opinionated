Fleming, John Clinton, Margaret Harris, Larry Standley, Pam Derbyshire, Jay Karahan, Analia Wilkerson, Dan Spjut, Diane Bull, Robin Brown, Don Smyth, and Jean Hughes (Jean Spradling)-are appealing this court's Amended Preliminary Injunction Order issued on June 29, 2018. (Docket Entry No. 434). That Order, (Docket Entry No. 427), was issued with a Memorandum and Opinion, (Docket Entry No. 426), setting out the court's reasons for the rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The fourteen County Judges now ask the court to stay enforcement of Sections (7), (8), (9), and (16) of the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order during the appeal. (Docket Entry No. 435 at 5). Alternatively, the fourteen County Judges ask the court to stay Sections (7), (8), (9), and (16) pending a ruling on the stay application by the Fifth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Harris County and the five Hearing Officers do not oppose the relief sought by the fourteen County Judges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at n.1.

The court agreed, and ordered the plaintiffs to accelerate their response, which they did. (Docket Entry Nos. 438, 446).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case presents difficult issues and a complex combination of lofty jurisprudential and constitutional questions with intensely practical concerns. The issues, questions, and concerns have been ably presented, thoroughly examined and analyzed by this court, and reviewed twice on appeal, with one opinion. The fourteen County Judges have not made a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their current appeal. The plaintiffs, in contrast, have shown that the harm to them from staying Sections (7), (8), (9), and (16) of the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order would be far greater than the harm to the defendants if the stay is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the motion and response, the record, and the applicable law, the court denies the motion to stay.

(Docket Entry No. 435\n   at 8). The County Judges argue that Section (7) \"strips Harris County magistrates of their discretion to consider whether the bail schedule's presumption holds in individual cases covered by Section (7).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Tarter v.

First, the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order does not create or impose a right to release from pretrial detention. Rather, it prohibits detention solely on the basis of wealth. This is not a distinction without a difference. A system detaining all misdemeanor arrestees until a hearing and individual assessment before a magistrate within 48 hours of arrest would not violate the Equal Protection Clause. But a system allowing the release of only misdemeanor arrestees who can pay a prescheduled or other secured bail amount, and detaining those who cannot, without a hearing or individual hearing, violates equal protection.\n   <em>\n    ODonnell v. Harris County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517208\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/147/#p163\">\n    892 F.3d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163 (5th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order does not limit, and has no bearing on, the Harris County magistrates' discretion to determine whether a presumption of release applies to those who fall within Section (7). Section (7) requires the release of a narrowly defined group of qualifying misdemeanor arrestees. Harris County's bail rules, not this court, have defined that group. But even as to this limited group, at the hearing and individual assessment, the magistrate is fully empowered to exercise the discretion needed to decide whether detention is required to provide sufficient sureties. That term is defined to include \"both the misdemeanor arrestee's interest in pretrial freedom and the County's interest in reasonably assuring appearance at hearings and trial and the absence of new criminal activity.\" (Docket Entry No. 427 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section (7) states: \"The County may require misdemeanor arrestees who are released on unsecured personal bonds under this Section to return for a hearing and individual assessment under Section (6), within 48 hours of arrest or at a later time, but the County cannot detain those arrestees until a hearing and individual assessment have been held in accordance with Section (6).\" (Docket Entry No. 427 at 5). Misdemeanor arrestees who fall within Section (7) are released precisely because a magistrate has not yet determined whether, and on what terms, release is appropriate, based on a hearing and individual assessment. As the court clarified, the Sheriff is authorized to issue unsecured bonds under Sections (7) and (8). (Docket Entry No. 443 at 1-2). At the point of the hearing and individual assessment, the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order does not require the continued release of those who were detained because of their indigence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The County Judges are correct that\n   <em>\n    Tarter\n   </em>\n   held that\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   bars injunctions against bail in excess of what misdemeanor arrestees can afford, which \"would require a federal court to reevaluate de novo each challenged bail decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1218116\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/1010/\">\n    646 F.2d at 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because the amount of bail prescribed for each criminal defendant depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of his case, the setting of bail requires ad hoc decisions committed to the discretion of judges.\"). But the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order does not address bail-amount-decisions. Rather, it enjoins the County from using a preset bail schedule to detain misdemeanor arrestees who cannot pay, while releasing those who can, solely on the basis of poverty, without considering each misdemeanor arrestee's \"peculiar facts and circumstances,\" and without providing each misdemeanor arrestee with the constitutionally required procedural protections. The bail-amount\n   determinations are squarely kept within the discretion of the court, judge, magistrate, or officer taking the bail. TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE \u00a7 17.15. The bail decision is made only for indigent misdemeanor arrestees who would be promptly released from detention if they had the means to pay, and only until a hearing and individual assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The injunction does not require the federal court to evaluate individual bail decisions. Rather, it requires Harris County to ensure that bail is not being used systematically to detain misdemeanor arrestees on the basis of wealth.\n   <em>\n    ODonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517208\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/147/#p163\">\n    892 F.3d at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The injunction sought by ODonnell seeks to impose 'nondiscretionary procedural safeguard[s],' which will not require federal intrusion into pre-trial decisions on a case-by-case basis.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tarter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1218116\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/1010/\">\n    646 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1013-14 ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The County Judges argue that the plaintiffs fail to overcome\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   's presumption of abstention because the plaintiffs could have brought their claims in state court. (Docket Entry No. 435 at 10-11). The defendants are incorrect. This court held, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, that the relief the plaintiffs seek-\"the improvement of pretrial procedures and practice\" and \"the adequacy of the state court review of bail-setting procedures\"-is \"not properly reviewed by criminal proceedings in state court.\"\n   <em>\n    ODonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517208\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/147/#p163\">\n    892 F.3d at 156-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \"[t]he injunction [is] not directed at...state prosecutions,\" but instead at the legality of a pretrial bail system that detains misdemeanor arrestees who would be released if they were able to pay a secured bail amount, state criminal court is not an adequate venue in which the plaintiffs can raise their constitutional challenges.\n   <em>\n    Gerstein v.

The County Judges do not cite cases to support that argument, and the record does not support their alarmist description. The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order does not prevent setting secured bail if it is necessary to provide sufficient sureties, including the County's interest in reasonably assuring appearance at hearings and trial and the misdemeanor arrestee's interest in pretrial liberty. To the extent that the County Judges are concerned that misdemeanor arrestees may fail to appear at a hearing or individual assessment, that concern is mitigated by the fact that unsecured bonds routinely have nonfinancial conditions attached to encourage attendance at hearings and trial. (Docket Entry No. 443 at 1). For those misdemeanor arrestees with no money or assets, the threat of bond forfeiture and a judgment for the full bond amount provide little by way of meaningful incentive. The fact that there is an ongoing dispute between the parties on the efficacy of unsecured bonds to secure reappearance does not make it more likely that the County Judges will succeed on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The County Judges rely on\n   <em>\n    O'Shea v.

The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order, relying on the Fifth Circuit's equal protection analysis, cures the equal protection violations that may arise in those scenarios by ordering that misdemeanor arrestees may not be detained without procedural protections, simply because of their poverty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order does not create an entitlement to release, which would extend beyond the Fifth Circuit's suggested relief and would\n   likely be overbroad.\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326091\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/207/#p211\">\n    826 F.3d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If Harris County detained all misdemeanor arrestees before or after a hearing and individual assessment held within 48 hours, the County would not violate equal protection, and misdemeanor arrestees would not have a claim for release on an unsecured bond under the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order.

Under the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order, the County can set bail for any misdemeanor arrestee, but only if it does so in a nondiscriminatory way.

That is true, but the relief is not based on substantive due process. For the reasons discussed at length above, the Order does not create or impose a substantive right to pretrial release on personal bond. The Order requires procedures to cure the County's equal protection violations. Release under the Order is not an entitlement because the County has the discretion to determine whether a misdemeanor arrestee should be detained after being provided with the constitutionally required procedural protections. No misdemeanor arrestee has an absolute right to be released after a hearing and individual assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The County Judges correctly note that the Fifth Circuit recognized the \"lack of individualized assessment and mechanical application of the secured bail schedule\" as the underlying equal protection violation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. The relief ordered in the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order is warranted by the lack of individual assessment. The County cannot mechanically apply secured bail before a hearing and individual assessment on a preset, across-the-board basis and detain those misdemeanor arrestees who cannot pay. The equal protection violation identified by the Fifth Circuit is the same violation that the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The County Judges argue that\n   <em>\n    Pugh v.

(Docket Entry No. 435 at 18-19). That is correct. The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order does not create an entitlement to release before a hearing and individual assessment. Under the Order, the County is free to detain misdemeanor arrestees until a hearing and individual assessment 48 hours after arrest. But the County cannot detain some misdemeanor arrestees and release others based solely on who can pay the preset bail amount and who cannot. The cases the County Judges cite do not permit discriminatory detention within 48 hours after arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The County Judges argue that the court's Section (7) equal protection analysis \"would necessarily justify the release of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   arrestees....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. It would not. The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order does not eliminate secured money bonds. Release under Section (7) applies only to the limited number of qualified misdemeanor arrestees who are already deemed releasable by the County-not this court-but who are not released because they are unable to post the preset amount. Misdemeanor arrestees who fall within one of the presumptively releasable categories are given the opportunity to be released. Limiting that opportunity to misdemeanor arrestees who can afford to pay a secured preset bail amount discriminates on the basis of wealth. The equal protection analysis does not apply to misdemeanor arrestees who are not given the opportunity to pay a secured preset bail amount because they are charged with an offense that requires detention for all misdemeanor arrestees until a hearing and individual assessment. Those misdemeanor arrestees do not suffer from wealth-based discrimination because their detention is based on the crime charged, not solely on their ability to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The County Judges make several additional arguments that Section (7) is not justified under the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.

Misdemeanor arrestees released under personal bonds and secured bonds alike are liable for their bond amounts. Arrestees released on a secured money bond must pay some amount as a condition of release, but they do not forfeit the amount paid as long as they appear at their hearings and trial dates. Arrestees released on a personal bond are subject to the same financial liability if they fail to appear. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry No. 316-2). The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order provides equal opportunity for these indigent misdemeanor arrestees within the category of arrestees that the County has presumed releasable and has provided the opportunity to be released by paying a secured preset bail amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    f.

That is true. The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order does not require the release of all misdemeanor arrestees who have not received a hearing and individual assessment within 48 hours of arrest. As in\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   , which made exceptions for certain emergency situations, the Order recognizes a mental-illness or intellectual-disability exception in Section (11) and a medical-condition exception in Section (12).\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216695\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/44/\">\n    500 U.S. at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216695\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/44/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But continued detention is permissible only under limited circumstances. The existence of exceptions does not swallow the general rule that, in the absence of exceptions, misdemeanor arrestees must be released within 48 hours of arrest if they have not received a hearing and individual assessment. The Fifth Circuit's suggestion that \"[a] pattern of delays might warrant further relief\" is consistent with the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order's allowance for justified delays and intolerance of unjustifiable delays.\n   <em>\n    ODonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517208\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/147/#p163\">\n    892 F.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order prevents continued, unlawful detention, in furtherance of the Circuit's intention to end \"the endemic problem of misdemeanor arrestees being detained until case disposition and pleading\n   guilty to secure faster release from pretrial detention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517208\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/147/#p163\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The fourteen County Judges have not shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits.

The Movants' Arguments For Irreparable Injury And The Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Though traditionally two separate factors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chafin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407358\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/165/\">\n    133 S.Ct. at 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the parties' briefs combine the movants'-harm-absent-a-stay factor and the public-interest factor. (Docket Entry Nos. 435 at 23-24, 446 at 17-20). The fourteen County Judges make three arguments. First, they argue that Sections (7), (8), (9), and (16) \"threaten public safety and the orderly administration of justice,\" citing a statistic on the bond-forfeiture rate. (Docket Entry No. 435 at 23 (\"Since the preliminary injunction has taken effect, 44.65% of arrestees released on unsecured bonds pursuant to the preliminary injunction have had bonds forfeited for failure to appear, compared to only 9.85% of arrestees who provided a secured money bond.\") ). Second, the County Judges assert that the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order enjoins the enforcement of state law and harms the public interest, because \"[w]hen a statute is enjoined, the State necessarily suffers the irreparable harm of denying the public interest in the enforcement of its laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407358\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/165/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health Servs. v.

Third, the County Judges argue that their interest and the public interest are indistinguishable, because when \"the [government] is the appealing party, its interest and harm merges with that of the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719120\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/406/#p419\">\n    734 F.3d at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither of these arguments is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This court found, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, that \"[s]ecured money bail in Harris County does not meaningfully add to assuring misdemeanor defendants' appearance at hearings or absence of new criminal activity during pretrial release.\" (Docket Entry No. 302 at 109-10);\n   <em>\n    ODonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517208\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/147/#p163\">\n    892 F.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming this court's factual findings). The probative value of the bond-forfeiture rate is vigorously disputed by the plaintiffs and not supported by the existing record. (Docket Entry No. 446 at 18 (\"[B]ond-forfeiture rates do not reveal useful information about nonappearance, let alone information useful for comparing between different bonds.\"). The County Judges and other defendants will have an opportunity to contest the factual findings at the merits trial set for early December 2018.

(Docket Entry No. 435 at 23-24). None is correct. The Order does not create an automatic right to release and does not override the County Judges' and Hearing Officers' discretion to determine whether bond should be secured or unsecured. Under the Order, the Hearing Officers and County Judges retain discretion to determine whether to set a secured bond or unsecured bond, after a hearing and individual assessment. The Sheriff, in contrast, is authorized to release qualified misdemeanor arrestees on unsecured bonds, but doing so does not require the discretionary assessment that is routinely and exclusively exercised by magistrates under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. The Order does not prohibit the\n   setting of bail as long as constitutionally required procedures are provided, and the Order does not create a right to affordable bail. The County can set bail in excess of what a misdemeanor arrestee can afford, but only after a hearing and individual assessment. Finally, Texas law does not prohibit the Sheriff from releasing qualified misdemeanor arrestees on unsecured bonds. Article 17.03 provides that \"a magistrate may, in the magistrate's discretion, release the defendant on personal bond without sureties or other security.\" TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC . art. 17.03. It does not grant the exclusive authority to release a misdemeanor arrestee on a personal bond to a magistrate, nor does it govern the release of misdemeanor arrestees on personal bond in nondiscretionary situations. The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order does not improperly enjoin the enforcement of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The County Judges' argument that their interest merges with the public interest was addressed by the court in its first order denying stay. (Docket Entry No. 327 at 16-17). The court held that treating the defendants' interest as identical to that of the public was unwarranted because \" 'the government' in this case is not a singular entity pursuing a consistent policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. The same is true today. One defendant, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, is opposed to a stay. (Docket Entry No. 435 at 5 n.1). Another defendant, Judge Michael Fields, a nonappealing County Judge, is opposed to a stay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the time the fourteen County Judges moved for a stay, a third defendant, Judge Darrell Jordan, a nonappealing County Judge, had not identified his position on the stay motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on Judge Jordan's positions on other aspects of this litigation, and the fact that he objected to the defendants' motion to stay the original Preliminary Injunction Order, the court infers that he opposes a stay as well. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry Nos. 313, 401-1, 402, 409, 450). Additionally, \"[i]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson Women's Health Org. v. Currier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149247\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/448/\">\n    760 F.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458 n.9 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing\n   <em>\n    Awad v. Ziriax\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5712101\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/1111/#p1132\">\n    670 F.3d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132 (10th Cir. 2012). Because the government defendants themselves disagree on identifying the interests implicated and harms caused by the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order, and because the ordered relief prevents the violation of misdemeanor arrestees' constitutional rights, this factor strongly weighs against a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Substantial Injury To The Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The \"grant of a stay of a preliminary injunction pending appeal [would] almost always be logically inconsistent with a prior finding of irreparable harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. DeBuono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720119\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/227/#p235\">\n    175 F.3d 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235 (2d Cir. 1999). The fourteen County Judges argue that the individual assessment alone would fully cure the constitutional violations. It would not. The individual assessment by itself does not adequately protect against the constitutional violations identified. The requested stay would lift the safeguards needed to prevent the continued operation of a bail system that discriminates on the basis of wealth, subjecting members of the plaintiff class to unconstitutional detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As the court found in its April 28, 2017 Memorandum and Opinion: \"Pretrial detention of misdemeanor defendants, for even a few days, increases the chance of conviction and of nonappearance or new criminal activity during release. Cumulative disadvantages mount for already impoverished misdemeanor defendants who cannot show up to work, maintain their housing arrangements, or help their families because they are detained.\" (Docket Entry No. 302 at 174-75) (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   A stay pending the appeal, or even a stay pending a stay-application ruling in the Fifth Circuit, would substantially injure the plaintiffs. This factor strongly weighs against a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The fourteen County Judges have not met their burden of making a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal. The County Judges will not suffer irreparable harm absent a stay, but the plaintiffs will suffer substantially if Sections (7), (8), (9), and (16) of the Amended Preliminary Injunction Order are stayed. The defendants have operated under the original Preliminary Injunction Order for more than a year without suffering irreparable harm. The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order will not affect that calculus because it is more narrowly tailored than the original Preliminary Injunction Order. In contrast, every additional day of unlawful detention causes significant harm to the plaintiffs. The public interest is furthered by preventing that harm. The balance of the equities heavily weighs against a stay, and that is the court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The fourteen County Judge's motion to stay, (Docket Entry No. 435), is denied. The amended scheduling and docket control order, (Docket Entry No. 423), controls the summary judgment motions and merits trial deadlines. The Amended Preliminary Injunction Order, (Docket Entry No. 427), takes effect on\n   <strong>\n    Monday, July 30, 2018\n   </strong>\n   . The current preliminary injunction order, (Docket Entry No. 304), remains in effect until then.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The plaintiffs note that they will argue in their summary judgment reply brief that the defendants' \"failure to raise the\n    <em>\n     Preiser\n    </em>\n    defense ... waives the argument for the entire case ....\" (Docket Entry No. 446 at 10). The court does not need to address the waiver issue at this time because the argument fails on its merits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
