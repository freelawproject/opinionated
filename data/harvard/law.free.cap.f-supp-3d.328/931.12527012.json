CONLEY, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As a group, transgender individuals have been subjected to harassment and discrimination in virtually every aspect of their lives, including in housing, employment, education, and health care. Their own families, acquaintances and larger communities can be sources of harassment. For some transgender individuals, though certainly not all, the dissonance between their gender identity and their natally assigned sex can manifest itself in the form of \"gender dysphoria,\" a serious medical condition recognized by both sides' experts and the larger medical community as a whole. Plaintiffs Cody Flack and Sara Ann Makenzie both have long-term gender dysphoria for which they have received previous treatments covered by Wisconsin Medicaid, including hormone therapy. However, Wisconsin Medicaid categorically denies coverage for medically-prescribed \"[t]ranssexual surgery\" and related drugs. Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 DHS 107.03(23)-(24). Plaintiffs filed suit challenging this exclusion under the Equal Protection Clause and the Affordable Care Act, and seek to preliminarily enjoin defendants from enforcing this exclusion against their requests for insurance coverage (dkt. # 40). The court held oral argument on plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on July 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As discussed below, plaintiffs have established a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on the merits of their ACA claim, as well as more than a negligible chance of prevailing on the merits of their equal protection claim. Moreover, the immediate consequence for both individuals is the effective denial of medical procedures that: (1) meet the prevailing standard of care;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) are specifically prescribed by their treatment providers to avoid further psychological harm caused by gender dysphoria. Accordingly, despite defendants' repeated assertions to the contrary, plaintiffs have established a material risk of irreparable harm and a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. The court will, therefore, grant plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Gender Dysphoria\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Every person has a \"gender identity.\" For most people, their gender identity\n   matches the natal sex assigned at birth. For transgender individuals, however, that is not true: their gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Specifically, a transgender woman's birth-assigned sex is male, but she has a female gender identity; a transgender man's birth-assigned sex is female, but he has a male gender identity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition, which if left untreated or inadequately treated can cause adverse symptoms. The DSM-5 contains the psychiatric consensus as to the definition, diagnostic criteria and features for gender dysphoria.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Gender dysphoria\n   </em>\n   refers to the distress that may accompany the incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and one's assigned gender. Although not all individuals will experience distress as a result of such incongruence, many are distressed if the desired physical interventions by means of hormones and/or surgery are not available. The current term is more descriptive than the previous DSM-IV term\n   <em>\n    gender identity disorder\n   </em>\n   and focuses on dysphoria as the clinical problem, not identity per se.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (DSM-5 Excerpt (dkt. # 21-1) 5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is worth emphasizing that not every transgender person has gender dysphoria. Adults with gender dysphoria\"often\" have \"a desire to be rid of primary and/or secondary sex characteristics and/or a strong desire to acquire some primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Untreated, gender dysphoria can result in psychological distress: \"preoccupation with cross-gender wishes often interferes with daily activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Impairment-such as the development of substance abuse, anxiety and depression-is also a possible \"consequence of gender dysphoria.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Finally, gender dysphoria\"is associated with high levels of stigmatization, discrimination, and victimization, leading to negative self-concept, increased rates of mental disorder comorbidity, school dropout, and economic marginalization, including unemployment, with attendant social and mental health risks....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Gender dysphoria can be alleviated through living consistently with one's gender identity, including being treated by others accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, \"appropriate individualized medical care as part of their gender transitions\" can mitigate or prevent\n   symptoms of gender dysphoria. (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6 16.) In 2011, the World Professional Association of Transgender Health published the seventh version of\n   <em>\n    Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People\n   </em>\n   (the \"WPATH Standards of Care\"), which identifies psychotherapy, hormone therapy and various surgical procedures as treatment possibilities for gender dysphoria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before gender-confirming surgery, those with gender dysphoria\"are at increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicides.\" (DSM-5 Excerpt (dkt. # 21-1) 8.) Defendant contends that even after surgery, gender dysphoria may still result in suicide, self-harm, or serious psychological distress. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mayer Dep. (dkt. # 55-3) 54:18-20.) The parties agree that gender-confirming surgical procedures are not necessary to alleviate gender dysphoria for all transgender people. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that surgery is the only effective treatment for many transgender people and that gender-confirming surgical procedures are \"safe and effective treatments.\" (Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 20) \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) Defendants respond that \"[t]here is inadequate evidence to conclude that surgical treatments are of proven medical value or usefulness for treating gender dysphoria.\" (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Wisconsin Medicaid\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Medicaid is a joint federal-state program to provide medical assistance to eligible low-income individuals; it was established in 1965 under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Through Medicaid, the federal government generally reimburses a substantial portion of a state's expenditures to provide medical services to people whose resources and incomes are insufficient to afford necessary medical services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Like all its sister states, Wisconsin participates in Medicaid. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (\"DHS\") is the state agency charged with administering the Wisconsin Medicaid Program consistent with state and federal requirements. DHS receives federal funding for the program, including reimbursement of over half of the state's Medicaid expenditures from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Defendant Linda Seemeyer is the DHS Secretary and she is responsible for implementing the Medicaid Act consistent with federal requirements. Wisconsin Medicaid provides coverage for \"[p]hysician services,\" including \"any medically necessary diagnostic, preventative, therapeutic, rehabilitative or palliative services ... within the scope of the practice of medicine and surgery\" that are \"in conformity with generally accepted good medical practice\" and provided by a physician or under one's direct supervision, unless otherwise excluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 DHS 107.06(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 107.08(1)(a)-(b) (providing coverage for hospital inpatient and outpatient services that \"are medically necessary\" and provided under a doctor's direction). Wisconsin Medicaid has a budget of approximately $9.7 billion to provide for its roughly 1.2 million enrollees. Approximately 5,000 of those enrollees are transgender, and some\n   subset of this population suffers from gender dysphoria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to the requirements of federal law, defendants' administration of Wisconsin Medicaid is governed by Wisconsin Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49.43 -.65 and Wisconsin Administrative Code \u00a7\u00a7 DHS 101.01 -.36. Included in the governing regulations is the \"Challenged Exclusion,\" \u00a7 107.03(23)-(24), at issue in this case. The Challenged Exclusion provides that \"The following services are not covered under MA: ... (23) Drugs, including hormone therapy, associated with transsexual surgery or medically unnecessary alteration of sexual anatomy or characteristics; [and] (24) Transsexual surgery.\" Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 DHS 107.03(23)-(24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Challenged Exclusion was adopted in 1996 and has remained in effect since February 1, 1997.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the time of its adoption, DHS found these services were \"medically unnecessary.\" (Clearinghouse Rule 96-154 (dkt. # 21-12) 2, 3.) Other coverage exclusions created by the 1996 amendments included \"non-medical food,\" \"ear lobe repair,\" \"tattoo removal,\" and \"services related to surrogate parenting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The parties disagree about whether potential cost savings motivated these exclusions (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6 45), although the fiscal estimate noted that \"[t]he rule changes are expected to result in nominal savings for state government\" (Fiscal Estimate (dkt. # 21-14) 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   DHS's website includes the following notice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   For people who need medical interventions such as hormones or surgery, these might be covered under private insurance plans. Currently, Wisconsin BadgerCare, BadgerCare Plus, Medicaid, and State of Wisconsin employee health insurance (ETF) do not cover gender reassignment surgery or drugs related to gender reassignment or hormone replacement. Please contact your health insurance company to learn more details about what services are covered by your insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    LGBT Health-Transgender Persons\n   </em>\n   , Wis. Dept. Health Servs. (Dec. 13, 2017), https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/lgbthealth/transgender.htm. Plaintiffs contend that \"Wisconsin Medicaid covers the same services when medically necessary to treat conditions other than gender dysphoria,\" and defendants agree that \"Medicaid may cover services as medically necessary when not excluded by law, and that such services may also be addressed by the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998,\" but again challenge the \"value or usefulness\" of surgery to treat gender dysphoria, and specifically dispute the medical necessity of surgery for the named plaintiffs. (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Medical Needs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Cody Flack\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Cody Flack is an adult resident of Green Bay who suffers from gender dysphoria and identifies as male.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   He is unable to work because of cerebral palsy and other disabilities for which he receives Supplemental Security Income and Wisconsin Medicaid. At birth, Cody was assigned the sex of female and subsequently raised as a girl. He became aware of his male gender\n   identity when he was about four or five years old. As a teenager, Cody began his gender transition by seeing a gender therapist, adopting the traditionally male name Cody, and presenting as a man. However, he was unable to complete his transition for several years because he lacked financial resources, was without emotional support, and feared isolation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After relocating to Wisconsin in 2012, Cody found the wherewithal to resume his gender transition as he felt his gender identity was more supported, and he increasingly lived and presented as a man. He cut his hair, wore men's clothing, and exclusively went by Cody. He also legally changed his name to Cody Jason Flack to align with his male gender identity and obtained a Wisconsin state identification card, identifying him as male. His Medicaid enrollment now matches his gender identity as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the past several years, Cody has been receiving therapy and other medical care, both to treat his gender dysphoria and to aid his gender transition. Since 2015, Cody has been seeing psychotherapist Daniel Bergman for his gender dysphoria and other mental health conditions. Since August 2016, Cody has also been receiving testosterone hormone therapy under the supervision of an endocrinologist, Dr. Amy DeGueme. This hormone therapy has caused Cody to develop facial and body hair, a more masculine appearance, and a deeper voice. In October 2016, Cody had his uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries and cervix removed through a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. This procedure was paid for by Wisconsin Medicaid to treat dysmenhorrhea (lower abdominal or pelvic pain during menstruation) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (a severe form of premenstrual syndrome ). Plaintiffs contend that Cody's \"surgery also helped significantly reduce his gender dysphoria by better aligning his body with his male identity,\" although defendants dispute this and argue that there is inadequate evidence to determine that surgical treatments have \"medical value\" or are \"useful[ ]\" in treating Cody's gender dysphoria. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Despite these changes, Cody still has female-appearing breasts. Plaintiffs and their experts, as well as Cody's treating physicians, contend this causes him severe gender dysphoria, while defendants and their experts question generally whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude further surgical procedures are medically valuable or useful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) At minimum, it appears undisputed that Cody's breasts cause him significant, personal distress, as they are a marker of the female sex often contributing to his being perceived as female. Cody is particularly ashamed of his breasts when in public and routinely avoids social situations as a result. In an effort to conceal his breasts, Cody has engaged in \"binding,\" which flattens or reduces their appearance, but has difficulty binding his breasts himself due to his disabilities and finds the technique extremely painful. Binding has caused him sores, skin irritation and respiratory distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Since early 2017, therefore, Cody has sought a double mastectomy and male chest reconstruction. He consulted with Dr. Clifford King, a plastic surgeon, whose specialty is transition-related surgeries. Cody provided King with letters of support from his primary care physician, his therapist, his endocrinologist, and the surgeon who performed his hysterectomy. These four letters each detailed that Cody has gender dysphoria, and he met the criteria for surgery. After determining that Cody met the criteria for a male chest reconstruction under the WPATH Standards of\n   Care, Dr. King sought prior authorization on July 18, 2017, from DHS for Wisconsin Medicaid coverage for the procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 2, 2017, DHS denied Dr. King's prior authorization request without reviewing the medical necessity of his requested surgery as \"a non-covered service\" and a \"not covered benefit\" based on the Challenged Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 2, 2017 Letter (dkt. # 21-18) 2 (capitalization altered);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Not. Appeal Rights (dkt. # 21-19) 3 (\"The service requested is not a covered benefit. The request does not meet one or more of the criteria found in Wisconsin Administrative Code.\" (capitalization altered) ); Sept. 25, 2017 Letter (dkt. # 21-22) 2 (explaining that Flack's \"request was denied by DMS as Wis. Admin. Code DHS 107.03(24) specifically lists 'transsexual surgery' as a non-covered service under medical assistance\" while recognizing that \"[t]he medical necessity of the services requested was not taken into account\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Cody Flack appealed DHS's denial. During his appeal, DHS noted that \"gender dysphoria... is an accepted medical indication for the surgical treatment requested.\" (Sept. 25, 2017 Letter (dkt. # 21-22) 2.) Nevertheless, an administrative law judge dismissed the appeal on November 21, 2017, on the basis that \"the Wisconsin Administrative Code specifically defines transsexual surgery as not covered by [medical assistance].\" (ALJ Decision (dkt. # 21-20) 3.) Even so, the ALJ also noted that \"the proposed surgery presumably would favorably address [Flack's] gender dysphoria.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cody's formal reconsideration request was denied by DHS on December 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because Cody is unable to pay for the surgery himself, he reports being profoundly depressed and feeling hopeless and distressed by his chest. While not acting on any such impulses, Cody has considered performing the chest reconstruction himself and contemplated suicide. Plaintiffs further claim that Cody's gender dysphoria has worsened greatly since being denied coverage for the surgery. Defendants purport to dispute these claims because \"[t]here is no\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   mental status examination in Flack's medical records\" and without it \"there is an insufficient basis for any clinician to conclude that Flack faces an imminent risk of suicide or other self-harm.\" (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6 81 (emphasis added).) Plaintiffs' retained expert, Stephanie L. Budge, PhD, LP, disagrees, having reviewed Cody Flack's treatment records and concluded that his treating therapist \"routinely assessed his mental status during Mr. Flack's weekly therapy sessions.\" (Budge Supp. Decl. (dkt. # 60) \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants further contend that the recent outpatient notes by Cody's treating physician \"primarily focus on issues unrelated to gender reassignment surgery\" and \"do not indicate that he is so destabilized such that a substantial risk of imminent self-harm exists,\" arguing that Cody's \"self-reports are insufficient ... to conclude that a serious risk of self-harm exists, let alone that receiving the surgical procedures he seeks will eliminate that risk.\" (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6 81.) Defendants add that Cody has been transitioning for years, which \"further indicat[es that] he does not present a substantial risk of self-harm in the near term.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Budge disagrees with these assessments as well. (Budge Supp. Decl. (dkt. # 60) \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.) She contends that\n   \"self-reports regarding suicidality and self-harm should be taken seriously\" because Cody has a history of them, and \"self-injurious thoughts and behaviors are risk factors for future suicidal ideation, attempts, and death from suicide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) The parties likewise disagree whether there is a substantial risk of harm to Cody's health and wellbeing, including worsening anxiety, depression, and thoughts of self-harm and suicide, without the chest reconstruction surgery. (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Sara Ann Makenzie\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Sara Ann Makenzie is an adult resident of Baraboo and lifelong resident of Wisconsin. She also suffers from gender dysphoria after being assigned the male sex at birth and subsequently raised as a boy. Like Cody, Sara Ann has also been found to be disabled and receives Supplemental Security Income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   She has been eligible and enrolled in Wisconsin Medicaid for many years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Despite being assigned the male sex at birth, Sara Ann first identified as female as a child, and she has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria for most of her life. She has legally changed her name to Sara Ann Makenzie, uses feminine pronouns, and wears women's clothing to conform with her female gender identity. Her birth certificate, passport, driver's license and Medicaid enrollment all reflect her name and female identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Sara Ann began seeking treatment for gender dysphoria in approximately 2012. She has been on hormone therapy since 2013, which has helped lessen her gender dysphoria. In 2014, she consulted with Dr. Trisha Schimek, her then primary care physician, about genital reconstruction surgery. Dr. Schimek informed her that Wisconsin Medicaid would not cover the surgery. She then sought a breast augmentation surgery because she was often misgendered due to her undeveloped chest. Having been told that Wisconsin Medicaid would not cover that cost either, Sara Ann took out a $5,000 loan from her bank to pay for the procedure, which was performed by Dr. Venkat Rao at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin, in August 2016. Since the procedure, she is less often mistaken for a man and less often mistreated for having masculine features. Plaintiffs contend that the procedure \"has been an effective treatment for [her] gender dysphoria\"; defendants dispute this, arguing that \"there is inadequate evidence to conclude that surgical treatments are of proven medical value or usefulness for treating Makenzie's gender dysphoria.\" (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6 103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Sara Ann Makenzie reports great distress upon seeing her male-appearing genitalia, which negatively affects her occupational functioning, sexuality and social life. She finds showering or seeing her body in a mirror painful; she lives in constant fear that someone will be able to see her male genitals through her clothing; and she is concerned that she may be attacked or mistreated by someone who recognizes her as transgender. Accordingly, she tries to minimize the appearance of her genitals by wearing multiple pairs of underwear at a time and engaging in \"tucking,\" which is uncomfortable and very painful. She also does not have sex with her fianc\u00e9e, which adds to her depression and anxiety. Sara Ann's treating physicians have recommended that she have surgery to create\n   female-appearing external genitalia, specifically a bilateral orchiectomy and vaginoplasty. The parties dispute whether these surgical procedures \"are of proven medical value or usefulness for treating gender dysphoria.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As her current primary care physician, Dr. Beth Potter referred Sara Ann to a plastic surgeon at UW Health in February 2018, for possible genital reconstruction surgery. Dr. Katherine Gast specializes in treating transgender individuals, and she informed Sara Ann of her eligibility for genital reconstruction after submitting two letters of support from mental health providers. However, she also advised that Wisconsin Medicaid would not pay for the procedure. While Sara Ann was prepared to obtain and submit the requisite letters, she was greatly distressed that Medicaid would not pay for the surgery because she could not afford it otherwise so she did not request the letters at that time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Makenzie Supp. Decl. (dkt. # 61) \u00b6 3.) Sara Ann has thoughts of removing her genitals on her own and of committing suicide. As a result, plaintiffs contend that her gender dysphoria has worsened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Her psychotherapist, Jessica Bellard, notes that Sara Ann \"continues to report symptoms of anxiety, depression, anger, and distress in response to the stressors of transitioning prior to completing gender reassignment surgery\" and that she \"has expressed a persistent desire for surgery since our original meeting.\" (Ballard Letter (dkt. # 67) 1.) Sara Ann's independent evaluating therapist, Chelsea O'Neal Karcher, opined that \"Sara's hope that the surgery will help lessen symptoms of anxiety and depression, increase happiness, help to increase her confidence, and align her body more fully with her identity\" were \"realistic expectations for the procedure\" and that she \"has met all the eligibility and readiness criteria outline[d] in the [WPATH Standards of Care].\" (Karcher Letter (dkt. # 61-2) 2.) Her former primary care physician opined that \"genital reconstruction is a\n   <em>\n    medically necessary\n   </em>\n   treatment for Ms. Makenzie's gender dysphoria as it would treat the excessive mental distress that she experiences every day because she lives with genitals that do not match her gender.\" (Schimek Decl. (dkt. # 31) \u00b6 9 (emphasis added).) At oral argument, the parties agreed that: (1) her surgeon had not yet sought prior authorization for this surgery; and (2) before that request could be considered by DHS, it would need to be considered by her third-party HMO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Because Sara Ann Makenzie's medical records lack a current mental status examination, defendants contend that \"there is insufficient basis for any clinician to conclude that Makenzie faces an imminent risk of suicide or other self-harm\"; indeed, defendants point to a June 14, 2018, letter, which describes her psychiatric symptoms as \"appear[ing] ... quite stable\" and records her denying \"current or recent history of self-harming behaviors and/or suicidal thoughts.\" (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6 104.) Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Budge, again disagrees about the importance of locating a formal mental status exam, because \"changes in mental status would be charted by the provider\" recording \"any changes in mental status from week to week.\" (Budge Supp. Decl. (dkt. # 60) \u00b6 5.) Likewise, Dr. Budge explains that \"[p]sychological stability does not indicate that one does not currently experience significant distress, nor does it indicate that one will not experience continuing or worsening distress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As with Cody Flack, defendants assert that \"Makenzie's own self-reports are an insufficient basis to conclude that a serious risk of self-harm exists, let alone that receiving the surgical procedures she seeks\n   will reduce or eliminate that risk,\" in part because she has been transitioning for several years and lacks any evidence of prior self-harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' PFOF (dkt. # 54) \u00b6 104.)

They contend that allowing them to obtain their surgeries is necessary to protect their well-being and health because they \"are at high risk of worsening mental health, exacerbated gender dysphoria, self-harm and stigma\"-\"none of which has an adequate remedy at law.\" (Pls.' Br. (dkt. # 19) 23, 27.) More specifically, Cody Flack explained that his noticeable breasts, which he painfully attempts to bind, cause him to \"experience severe gender dysphoria\" and to think about self-harm and suicide. (Flack Decl. (dkt. # 22) \u00b6 15.) Moreover, Cody reports that his gender dysphoria and depression have \"become even worse\" after coverage for his chest reconstruction surgery was denied;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   he testified to \"often think[ing] about removing [the breasts him]self\" and about committing suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Importantly, Cody Flack's treating doctors agree. His psychotherapist, Dr. Daniel Bergman: (1) opines that \"the chest reconstruction surgeries [Flack] is seeking\n   <em>\n    are medically necessary\n   </em>\n   treatments for gender dysphoria\"; (2) reports that following the denial of coverage, Cody \"became very depressed and started having suicidal thoughts\" and \"\n   <em>\n    the denial\n   </em>\n   is continuing to have a substantial negative impact on his mental and emotional well-being\"; (3) predicts that without access to surgery \"in the\n   <em>\n    near future\n   </em>\n   ,\" Cody \"would be at risk of suicidality and self-harm\"; and (4) opines that \"continued denial of this necessary surgery could lead to possible suicidality and an extended inpatient hospitalization.\" (Bergman Decl. (dkt. # 28) \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11, 13 (emphasis added).) In contrast, Dr. Bergman expects surgery \"would\n   <em>\n    significantly improve\n   </em>\n   [Flack's] gender dysphoria and alleviate his symptoms of severe depression and anxiety,\" allowing him to \"move forward with his life.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14 (emphasis added).) Likewise, Cody Flack's endocrinologist, Dr. Amy Degueme, opined that: (1) he \"meets and exceeds\" the WPATH Standard of Care criteria for chest reconstruction, which could diminish his gender dysphoria symptoms; (2) chest reconstruction \"is a\n   <em>\n    medically necessary\n   </em>\n   treatment for gender dysphoria as it would treat the excessive mental distress that he experiences every day because of his chest\"; and (3) continued denial of surgery \"could lead to increased depression, anxiety, and thoughts of suicide or self-harm, arising from and related to [Flack's] gender dysphoria.\" (Degueme Decl. (dkt. # 29) \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10, 13 (emphasis added).) Finally, Dr. Clifford King, Cody Flack's consulting surgeon, also concluded that he \"met the criteria for obtaining chest reconstruction under the WPATH Standards of Care,\" and further declares that he is \"prepared to schedule and perform the chest reconstruction surgeries on Mr. Flack if DHS approves a prior authorization for Wisconsin Medicaid coverage.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (King Decl. (dkt. # 30) \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As to Sara Ann Makenzie, she testified that her chest reconstruction in August 2016 \"helped minimize [her] gender dysphoria,\" and reduced the incidents of harassment and misgendering she experienced. (Makenzie Decl. (dkt. # 23) \u00b6 22.) Yet, she still \"experience[s] profound distress\" because of her penis and the fear that others will notice it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) After being told that Wisconsin Medicaid would not pay for the genital reconstruction, she frequently \"thought about killing [her]self\" and \"considered cutting off [her] genitals [her]self.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) She testified that being unable to get the surgery \"has made [her] gender dysphoria worse,\" and has led her to \"engage[ ] in some self-harming behaviors, including cutting in [her] genital area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   And again, Sara Ann Makenzie's treating doctors agree. First, her consulting surgeon, Dr. Katherine Gast, \"determined that once Ms. Makenzie provided two letters of support from her treating medical providers, ... Ms. Makenzie would be eligible\n   for the surgical procedures,\" a bilateral orchiectomy and vaginoplasty. (Gast Decl. (dkt. # 32) \u00b6 3.) Second, as discussed above, her treating therapist and an independent evaluating therapist also support this treatment. (Ballard Letter (dkt. # 67) 1; Karcher Letter (dkt. # 61-2) 2.) Third, her former primary care physician, Dr. Trisha Schimek opined that \"genital reconstruction is a\n   <em>\n    medically necessary\n   </em>\n   treatment for Ms. Makenzie's gender dysphoria as it would treat the excessive mental distress that she experiences every day because she lives with genitals that do not match her gender,\" and further opined that Sara Ann Makenzie meets the WPATH Standards of Care criteria for genital reconstructive surgery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Schimek Decl. (dkt. # 31) \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 (emphasis added).) Fourth, her current primary care physician, Dr. Beth Potter, concurs that \"once Ms. Makenzie provided letters of support from two mental health providers, [she] would meet the [WPATH Standard of Care].\" (Potter Decl. (dkt. # 33) \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, these plaintiffs have advanced more than enough evidence to establish that they face a possibility of irreparable harm at this point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bontrager v. Ind. Family and Soc. Servs. Admin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3622633\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/604/#p611\">\n    697 F.3d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 611 (7th Cir. 2012) (affirming grant of preliminary injunction enjoining monetary cap limiting Medicaid coverage of dental procedures finding that plaintiffs \"will likely suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted, as they would be denied medically necessary care\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' principal response to all this evidence is that \"there is no proven medical benefit to the procedures for which Plaintiffs seek Medicaid coverage, and so Plaintiffs here will not face irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction.\" (Opp'n (dkt. # 53) 15.) Defendants point to their expert reports for support.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Lawrence Mayer opines that \"[m]edical and surgical treatments have not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for gender dysphoria.\" (Mayer Rpt. (dkt. # 55-1) 4.) More specifically, he opines based on a survey of published reports that there is only \"minimal\" evidence that these treatments are effective, safe and optimal, and further that \"[t]here is even less evidence that [medical and surgical interventions] would be cost effective compared to social and psychological interventions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Even Dr. Mayer acknowledges, however, that gender dysphoria\"is a serious medical condition that deserves to be treated\" and that such treatment \"must be borne of medical necessity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) He agrees that \"reducing or eliminating\" the very real distress associated with this condition is the \"[o]ptimality consideration[ ]\" for treating gender dysphoria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   As outlined above, plaintiffs have the support of their treating physicians-to say nothing of their retained experts-who confirm that the surgeries they seek (1) are medically necessary and (2) will reduce their distress and gender dysphoria. Perhaps Dr. Mayer's opinions will prevail on the\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   efficacy of surgical interventions for gender dysphoria, although the apparent endorsement in DSM-5 and by the larger medical community would appear to make this a decidedly uphill battle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, Dr. Mayer lays at most the foundation for defendants' general policy, while the only question at this point is whether Cody Flack and Sara Ann Makenzie have a medical need for these surgeries such that denial will be detrimental to\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   health. On the current record, the answer clearly is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Chester Schmidt opines that \"there is an insufficient clinical basis to conclude that either Flack or Makenzie will suffer imminent, irreparable harm if they do not receive gender reassignment surgery prior to the conclusion of this case.\" (Schmidt Decl. (dkt. # 56) \u00b6 8.) Dr. Schmidt's opinion is based on what he describes as: (1) a lack of current mental status examinations for plaintiffs, creating \"an insufficient basis for any clinician to conclude that either Flack or Makenzie faces an imminent risk of suicide or other self-harm\"; (2) the insufficiency of plaintiffs' self-reports \"to conclude that a serious risk of self-harm exists, let alone that receiving the surgical procedures ... will\n   reduce or eliminate that risk\"; (3) Cody Flack's outpatient notes \"do not indicate that he is so destabilized such that a substantial risk of imminent self-harm exists\"; and (4) Flack's transition has been ongoing for several years, without any evidence of prior self-harm, indicating no substantial short-term risk of self-harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-13.) While at least focused on the medical needs of the individual plaintiffs now before the court, Schmidt's opinion fundamentally misses the mark. Initially, as plaintiffs point out, he was misinformed as to the relevant standard. (Reply (dkt. # 62) 3-4.) Plaintiffs were not required to prove \"a substantial risk of imminent self-harm,\" but rather to show a likelihood of irreparable injury. Moreover, his opinion that a clinician could not conclude that these plaintiffs need these surgeries because of missing mental status reports misreads the record since both plaintiffs have opinions from their treatment providers supporting the proposed surgical interventions. Regardless, Dr. Schmidt's 10,000-foot review of the medical record and criticisms of the course of treatment proposed by plaintiffs' doctors, without offering a viable option to relieve their ongoing gender dysphoria, pales in comparison with the informed opinions of plaintiffs' treating physicians. To discount the opinions of plaintiffs' treating physicians as to the need for surgery to relieve plaintiffs' suffering at the preliminary injunction stage on the current, limited record would be tantamount to this court playing doctor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, plaintiffs have established that they are at risk of irreparable harm, and this factor weighs strongly in favor of injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to whether plaintiffs would have an adequate remedy at law, the Seventh Circuit already held in\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   that serious, ongoing impact on plaintiffs' health \"demonstrate[s] that any award would be 'seriously deficient as compared to the harm suffered.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    858 F.3d at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Foodcomm Int'l v.

Br. (dkt. # 19) 29-33; Opp'n (dkt. # 53) 39-45.) Facially, the answer would appear to be \"yes,\" but because the Challenged Exclusion discriminates against coverage for \"transsexual surgery,\" defendants argue that this no longer involves sex discrimination. Even though \"sex\" would seem to encompass \"trans\n   <em>\n    sex\n   </em>\n   ual,\" defendants would distinguish between \"gender identity\"-what plaintiffs would define as an \"internal sense of one's sex,\" which is innate-from one's \"sex\"-which is, according to defendants, \"assigned at birth, refer[ring] to one's biological status as either male or female, and is associated primarily with physical attributes such as chromosomes, hormone prevalence, and external and internal anatomy,\" and is \"immutable.\" (Defs.'

Moreover, as plaintiffs' expert Dr. Loren Schechter explains, \"[w]hen performing gender confirming surgery, surgeons use many of the same procedures that they use to treat other medical conditions.\" (Schechter Decl. (dkt. # 27) \u00b6 38.) For example, if a natal female were born without a vagina, she could have surgery to create one, which would be covered by Wisconsin Medicaid if deemed medically necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, a natal male suffering from gender dysphoria would be denied the same medically necessary procedure because of her sex. Likewise, if a natal male were in a car accident and required a phalloplasty, that surgery would be covered if deemed medically necessary.

This is what the Challenged Exclusion does as well: it creates a different rule governing the medical treatment of transgender people. Specifically, Wisconsin Medicaid covers medically necessary treatment for other health conditions, yet the Challenged Exclusion expressly\n   <em>\n    singles out and bars\n   </em>\n   a medically necessary treatment solely for transgender people suffering from gender dysphoria. In fact, by excluding \"transsexual surgery\" from coverage, the Challenged Exclusion directly singles out a Medicaid claimant's transgender status as the basis for denying medical treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 DHS 107.03(23)-(24). As defendants conceded at the preliminary injunction hearing, this means that if breast reduction surgery were deemed medically necessary due to back, neck or shoulder pain, a natal female's surgery would be covered by Wisconsin Medicaid. However, if breast reduction surgery were deemed medically necessary due to gender dysphoria, a natal female's surgery would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be covered under the Challenged Exclusion.

Perhaps defendants' least persuasive, though most creative, argument is that \u00a7 1557 cannot be read to cover transgender status without violating the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution because \"Wisconsin could have had no idea that this interpretation would someday prevail when it chose to accept federal Medicaid funding.\" (Opp'n (dkt. # 53) 43-44.) Nonsense. By the time that the Affordable Care Act was enacted, federal courts had already interpreted prohibitions on sex discrimination to cover adverse treatment of transgender people, and the Supreme Court had already recognized that \"statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    858 F.3d at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Oncale v.

Instead, as in other areas of health care covered by Wisconsin Medicaid, individuals should be allowed to decide in consultation with their treatment providers what treatment is best and then ultimately whether to pursue it.

As to whether the transgender population in Wisconsin is a suspect or quasi-suspect class, plaintiffs' proffered evidence is equally strong. Greater than a quarter of adult transgender Wisconsinites live in poverty, which is greater than twice the overall national poverty rate. One in five is unemployed. Nearly 60% of Wisconsin's transgender people \"have recently experienced mistreatment by law enforcement officers who perceived or knew them to be transgender.\" (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.'

Further, visibly nonconforming transgender individuals suffer worse health outcomes and more discrimination than transgender individuals whose appearance aligns with their gender identity. Gender-confirming medical care may decrease mistreatment caused by being visibly gender-nonconforming. Likewise, transgender people unable to afford (or otherwise unable to access) gender-confirming surgical procedures are more at-risk for discrimination and other harms. In short, other than certain races, one would be hard-pressed to identify a class of people more discriminated against historically or otherwise more deserving of the application of heightened scrutiny when singled out for adverse treatment, than transgender people.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

As addressed above, defendants' concern about protecting the public health by limiting Wisconsin Medicaid to \"medically necessary purposes\" (Fiscal Estimate (dkt. # 21-14) 3) is misplaced here, given the\n   substantial likelihood that this interest would be served, rather than hindered, by covering plaintiffs' recommended surgical procedures. As to the latter concern, the court readily acknowledges the state's ongoing interest in reasonably reducing medical expenditures where appropriate, but as defendants also acknowledged the Challenged Exclusion is \"expected to result in\n   <em>\n    nominal\n   </em>\n   savings for state government.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (emphasis added).) Likewise at oral argument, defendants could not identify any other exclusions from coverage under Wisconsin Medicaid that were based on a balancing of cost versus medical efficacy, except those enacted along with the Challenged Exclusion. Moreover, those exclusions-such as \"non-medical food\" and \"non-emergency intestinal bypass or gastric stapling\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )-are simply of a different character.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, while defendants suggest that removing the Challenged Exclusion would cost the state approximately $2.1 million (Opp'n (dkt. # 53) 11), at this point the only relevant cost is for the treatment of Cody Flack and Sara Ann Makenzie-two of the 1.2 million Wisconsin Medicaid enrollees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the irreparable harm these plaintiffs face without injunctive relief substantially outweighs the harm the state will suffer by preliminarily enjoining the application of the Challenged Exclusion to their individual prior authorization requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bontrager\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3622633\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/604/#p611\">\n    697 F.3d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Even if the state were required to cover such procedures for a few additional claimants who meet the same high burden as plaintiffs of proving a medical need during the pendency of this case, the cost of these additional payments would be equally outweighed by the likelihood of reducing those claimants' suffering and of fulfilling the public interest in providing medically necessary procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court recognizes that granting preliminary relief alters the status quo, if barely so, given the present uncertainty about the requirement of coverage under federal regulation,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2092\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .4\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v.

Tex. 2016), which weighs in favor of the state. However, defendants acknowledge that the balancing of equities weighs in favor of the plaintiffs should the court find that plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits and a risk of irreparable harm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n (dkt. # 53) 47 n.9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having so found, therefore, the court also has little difficulty finding that the equities and the public interest favor entry of a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing the Challenged Exclusion to deny the named plaintiffs medically necessary surgery in furtherance of treating their gender dysphoria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

(dkt. # 19) 49.) Defendants failed to address this request in their brief and at oral argument confirmed that they are not seeking a bond. Moreover, while Rule 65(c) states that a \"court may issue a preliminary injunction ... only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), a bond is not always necessary. \"Under appropriate circumstances bond may be excused, notwithstanding the literal language of Rule 65(c).

As demonstrated by their inability to work, receipt of Supplemental Security Income, and enrollment in Wisconsin Medicaid, plaintiffs are plainly indigent. Accordingly, the court will not require plaintiffs to post a bond. Nor, for all the reasons already set forth above, will the court stay enforcement of this preliminary injunction given the plaintiffs' already-long wait to receive medically necessary surgery for gender dysphoria, particularly since the time required for DHS's authorization review of plaintiffs' requests for coverage should provide sufficient time for defendants to seek a stay from the Seventh Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   1) Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction (dkt. # 18) is GRANTED.

First, it assumes that the transgender population-or more specifically, the subset of the transgender population with gender dysphoria -has the same prevalence across groups. Second, as plaintiffs suggest, \"Medicaid reimbursement rates are much lower than the payment rates in standard insurance plans\" so \"current Medicaid rates for Plaintiffs' surgeries for the treatment of other diagnoses are a more appropriate benchmark.\" (Reply (dkt. # 62) 8.) Defendants have since recognized that utilization rates among different insured populations may be different, as well as that the federal government would reimburse approximately half the cost through Medicaid and Medicaid reimbursement rates are different from private insurance costs. (Defs.' Status Rpt. (dkt. # 65) 5-6.) Defendants contend that plaintiffs' proposed reimbursement rates \"significantly underestimate\" the total cost because of related non-physician fees. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6 n.1.) Regardless, the court will give defendants another opportunity to submit realistic evidence as to the likely, near-term financial cost of enjoining the Challenged Exclusion more generally with particular reference to the actual costs and claims experienced quarterly or yearly by those 18 states and the District of Columbia covering \"transsexual surgeries.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Defendants submitted the expert report of David V.
