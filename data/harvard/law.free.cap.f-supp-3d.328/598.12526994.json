Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action arises from a contractual dispute between Mexican manufacturers of ceramic tile products and their Texas-based\n   distributor. On January 8, 2016, Plaintiffs Servicios Comerciales Lamosa, S.A. de C.V. (\"Lamosa Commercial Services\") and Revestimentos Porcelanite, S.A. de C.V. (\"Porcelanite\") (sometimes collectively, \"Plaintiffs\")-manufacturers of flooring products, headquartered in Mexico City, Mexico-brought this action against Mundo Tile, Ltd., MT Trading LLC, MT Group Real Estate LLC, and Mauricio de la Rosa (\"Mr. De la Rosa\") (sometimes collectively, \"Mundo Tile\" or \"Defendants\"). Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite seek recovery of approximately $3 million in damages from Mundo Tile for breach of contract claims arising from promissory notes Mundo Tile executed in their favor but has not paid. They also seek to recover against Mr. De la Rosa individually for breach of contract, alleging he failed to make payments under the terms of a guaranty agreement. In addition to their respective breach of contract claims, Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite seek to foreclose on real property Mundo Tile pledged in satisfaction of its then-existing and future indebtedness. They also seek attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mundo Tile contests Lamosa Commercial Services's and Porcelanite's entitlement to recover under the promissory notes and Mr. De la Rosa's guaranty agreement, or to foreclose on real property, asserting affirmative defenses of fraud, fraudulent inducement, offset, and waiver. Mundo Tile has also filed counterclaims against Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite for breach of contract, fraud and fraudulent inducement, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite move for summary judgment on their respective affirmative breach of contract claims and on Mundo Tile's affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite also move to exclude Mr. De la Rosa's testimony concerning Mundo Tile's lost profits and, asserting waiver, move to strike Mundo Tile's demand for a jury trial. The court now sets forth the facts in accordance with the standard in Section II(A) of this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Porcelanite and Mundo Tile Enter into Distributorship Agreement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Porcelanite manufactures ceramic tile products in Mexico and ships its products throughout the United States via a network of distributors. Mundo Tile owns and operates ceramic tile and flooring stores in Texas. Mr. De la Rosa is the founder and owner of Mundo Tile. Prior to forming Mundo Tile in 2003, Mr. De la Rosa was employed by several subsidiaries of Grupo Carso, including ConduMex Group and Porcelanite, from approximately 1989 through 2003, and was involved in the purchase, logistics, and manufacturing of Porcelanite-brand tile in the United States and Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the late 1990s, Porcelanite-brand tile did not have a strong presence in the United States and was more popular in Central and South America. In the early 2000s, to boost its presence in the United States, Porcelanite began using United States-based distributors to sell its tiles in states with large Hispanic populations, including in California and Arizona, and in El Paso, Texas. In late 2002, Mr. De la Rosa spoke with Porcelanite's Chief Executive\n   Officer, Antonio Gomez, as well as the chairman of Grupo Carso, Alejandro Aboumrad, about plans to return to the United States to open a tile store. They encouraged him and told him to confer with Felix Aguirre (\"Mr. Aguirre\"), Porcelanite's Exports Director, about his plans to open a Porcelanite-brand tile distributorship in the United States. In or around 2003, Mr. Aguirre gave Mr. De la Rosa permission to open an exclusive Porcelanite distributorship for the cities of Dallas/Fort Worth, San Antonio, Houston/Galveston, Waco, Austin, and Laredo. This agreement was not in writing. Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite dispute the existence of an exclusive distributorship agreement with Mr. De la Rosa, although they concede that Porcelanite and Mundo Tile entered into a distributorship agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2003, Mr. De la Rosa quit his job, moved from Mexico City, Mexico, to Dallas, Texas, and opened his first Mundo Tile store in Dallas, Texas, designed as a Porcelanite-brand tile distributor. Other stores followed. During the first years, with the exception of a wall tile from a Spanish manufacturer, Mundo Tile sold only Porcelanite products. When new customers or potential distributors would approach Porcelanite about purchasing Porcelanite-brand tile or opening a distributorship, Porcelanite would reject the request, sending the customers to Mundo Tile and explaining that Porcelanite already had a distributor, and that Mundo Tile was the only place to buy Porcelanite-brand tile in Texas. Porcelanite was now exporting massive amounts of tile to the United States, and a vast majority of its Texas exports was being sold by Mundo Tile. By 2007, Mundo Tile was approaching or exceeding $10 million in annual revenue, expanding its operations in Texas, and had been granted exclusive rights to sell Porcelanite-brand tiles in Oklahoma and Colorado. In exchange for exclusive rights, Mundo Tile underwrote significant advertising on behalf of Porcelanite and passed on the opportunity to diversify its offerings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Grupo Lamosa Acquires Porcelanite in November 2007\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In or around November 2007, Porcelanite was acquired by a competitor, Grupo Lamosa, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Grupo Lamosa\"), a Mexican-based manufacturer of less expensive tiles and floor coverings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Grupo Lamosa used two separate subsidiary entities for its multiple brands, Lamosa Commercial Services, formed in December 2007, responsible for selling Lamosa-brand tiles, and Porcelanite, responsible for selling Porcelanite-brand tiles. For some time thereafter, Mundo Tile's account representatives and accounting contacts remained the same as prior to Grupo Lamosa's acquisition of Porcelanite. After the acquisition, however, Mundo Tile began to receive isolated reports of Porcelanite-brand tile being sold by Mundo Tile's competitors. When Mr. De la Rosa confronted his Grupo Lamosa contacts about these sales, he was reassured that the sales were isolated mistakes and that the exclusive distributorship agreement remained intact. In 2009, Mr. Aguirre left his position as United States Exports Director for Grupo Lamosa and was replaced by Hector Welsh (\"Mr. Welsh\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Other Retailers in Texas Begin Selling Porcelanite-Brand Tile.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 2009, Mr. De la Rosa attended an annual industry conference in Chicago, at which Grupo Lamosa was displaying its Porcelanite tile line. Mr. De la Rosa discovered that Grupo Lamosa was displaying Mundo Tile's best-selling Hispanic tiles. He questioned Grupo Lamosa's President of Ceramics, Sergio Narvaez (\"Mr. Narvaez\"), and Mr. Welsh about the display, reminding them that these products were exclusive to Mundo Tile in Texas. Mr. Narvaez and Mr. Welsh assured Mr. De la Rosa that they would not allow any Texas-based retailers to purchase the tiles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At about this time, Grupo Lamosa started delaying orders placed by Mundo Tile, questioning its price list. As a result, customers were abandoning Mundo Tile, as it was increasingly unable to satisfy orders or replenish its inventory. Thereafter, reports of Porcelanite products available for sale became more frequent, and other retailers in Texas sold the tiles at a lower price than Mundo Tile. Mundo Tile's network of contractors stopped buying from Mundo Tile, their trust fractured by the availability of Porcelanite-brand tiles at other retailers, and for prices significantly cheaper than at Mundo Tile. Mundo Tile's revenue dropped significantly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2010, one of Mundo Tile's sub-distributors (Materiales El Valle) complained to Mr. De la Rosa that one of its competitors (Rodriguez Home Center) was selling Porcelanite-brand tile. When Mr. De la Rosa confronted Grupo Lamosa, Export Manager Leonor Cardenas (\"Ms. Cardenas\") apologized, as did Mr. Welsh. Mr. Welsh and Ms. Cardenas agreed to pull the products from Rodriguez Home Center and also offered, as a concession, to eliminate freight charges for Porcelanite orders placed by Mundo Tile on behalf of Materiales El Valle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2011, Mr. Welsh called Mr. De la Rosa after hearing that Mundo Tile was considering suing Grupo Lamosa, seeking his assurance that this was not the case. Mr. De la Rosa acknowledged that he probably had grounds to sue Grupo Lamosa but took the position that no suit would be necessary if Grupo Lamosa would cure its violations and abide by the exclusivity agreement. Mr. Welsh agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Grupo Lamosa Suspends Mundo Tile's Account.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2012, after Mundo Tile had trouble making its payments on inventory invoices, Grupo Lamosa's finance department suspended Mundo Tile's credit line and informed Mundo Tile that it needed to agree to new terms or lower its balance. Mundo Tile's revenue had dipped below $6.5 million, and it was operating at a loss for the first time. Grupo Lamosa was refusing to fill orders and demanding that Mundo Tile turn over its real estate assets to Grupo Lamosa to cover its outstanding credit. Mundo Tile needed help and its credit account with Grupo Lamosa to satisfy its customers' orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Mundo Tile Enters into 2012 Loan Agreements.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 27, 2012, Mr. De la Rosa sent an e-mail message to Mr. Welsh requesting a meeting to discuss Grupo Lamosa's sales of its tiles to Mundo Tile's competitors and other commercial matters. On February 24, 2012, Mr. De la Rosa flew to Grupo Lamosa's headquarters in Monterrey, Mexico, and met with Mr. Welsh and Mr. Narvaez. After Mr. De la Rosa raised Grupo Lamosa's breach of the exclusivity agreement and explained how Grupo Lamosa's failure to honor the exclusivity agreement destroyed his revenues and client base and decimated his business, Mr. Welsh promised to remove all\n   unapproved Porcelanite-brand tiles from Mundo Tile's competitors and informed him that to stay in business and continue to receive inventory from Grupo Lamosa, Mundo Tile, and Mr. De la Rosa, personally, would have to sign promissory notes, credit agreements, and a guaranty agreement in the amount of Mundo Tile's outstanding credit balance. In addition, Mundo Tile would have to pledge its real estate assets as security.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   App. in Supp. of Defs.' Resp. to Porcelanite's Mot. for Summ. J. 7 (De la Rosa Decl. \u00b6 21) (Doc. 109). In reliance on these promises of continued exclusivity, Mundo Tile agreed to the deal and signed the Loan Agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Grupo Lamosa failed to keep these promises and did not enforce the exclusive distributorship for Mundo Tile, instead expanding its Texas presence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On July 24, 2012, Mr. De la Rosa, Mundo Tile, Ltd. and MT Trading LLC executed the following promissory notes: a negotiable promissory note in the original principal amount of $289,813 in favor of Lamosa Commercial Services and a revolving promissory note in the original principal amount of $340,000 in favor of Lamosa Commercial Services (sometimes collectively, the \"2012 Lamosa Promissory Notes\"); and a negotiable promissory note in the original principal amount of $1,233,871 in favor of Porcelanite (the \"2012 Porcelanite Promissory Note\"). These notes were secured by two separate deeds of trust to real property, respectively made in favor of Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite. On July 24, 2012, Mr. De la Rosa also executed a Guaranty Agreement in which he personally guaranteed all indebtedness and financial commitments of himself, Mundo Tile, Ltd. and MT Trading LLC, then-existing or thereafter incurred, including without limitation the 2012 Porcelanite Promissory Note and the negotiable promissory note in the original principal amount of $289,813 in favor of Lamosa Commercial Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Mundo Tile Enters into 2014 Loan Agreements.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 9, 2013, Mr. De la Rosa was first notified by one of his employees that Lowe's was carrying one of Mundo Tile's best-selling Hispanic-oriented Porcelanite tiles, Umbria Caf\u00e9. Porcelanite had renamed the product for Lowe's as Marble Brown. Lowe's was selling the Marble Brown for $0.95 per square foot, whereas Mundo Tile was selling the Umbria Caf\u00e9 for $1.49 per square foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mundo Tile remained unprofitable and unable to recover its customer base. On May 30, 2014, Mr. De la Rosa, Mundo Tile, Ltd., MT Trading LLC, and MT Group Real Estate LLC executed an additional promissory note in the principal amount of $250,000 in favor of Lamosa Commercial Services (the \"2014 Lamosa Promissory Note\") and an additional promissory note in the original principal amount of $225,000 in favor of Porcelanite (the \"2014 Porcelanite Promissory Note\"). The court will at times refer to these various loan documents, as well as those executed in 2012,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , collectively, as the \"Loan Agreements.\" As in 2012, Mundo Tile agreed to sign the 2014 Loan Agreements based on Messrs. Welsh's and Narvaez's representations regarding removal of Porcelanite-brand products from Floor &amp; Decor and Lowe's, and continuing promises of exclusivity in Texas. App. in Supp. of Defs.' Resp. to Porcelanite's Mot. for Summ. J. 8 (De la Rosa Decl. \u00b6 24) (Doc. 109). Grupo Lamosa failed to keep these promises by, among other things, not removing the offending products from Lowe's (and actually expanding their Lowe's offerings), and allowing Mundo Tile's competitor, Rodriguez Home Center, to open new stores in the Rio Grande Valley offering Porcelanite-brand tile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite File this Lawsuit After Mundo Tile Defaults Under the Loan Agreements.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mundo Tile failed to pay when due and defaulted on the payment and other obligations under the Loan Agreements. On January 8, 2016, Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite filed this lawsuit against Mundo Tile for breach of contract in connection with its default under the terms of the Loan Agreements and against Mr. De la Rosa, individually, for his failure to abide by the terms of Guaranty Agreement. They contend that, as of January 5, 2016, the total amounts due and owing were as follows: $795,212 to Lamosa Commercial Services under the 2012 Lamosa Promissory Notes, comprised of $623,264 in past due payments plus $171,948 in accrued finance charges; $1,629,147 to Porcelanite under the 2012 Porcelanite Promissory Note, comprised of $1,180,294 in past due payments plus $448,853 in accrued finance charges; $283,838 to Lamosa Commercial Services under the 2014 Lamosa Promissory Note, comprised of $225,000 in past due payments plus $58,838 in accrued finance charges; and $283,838 to Porcelanite under the 2014 Porcelanite Promissory Note, comprised of $225,000 in past due payments plus $58,838 in accrued finance charges. In addition, Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite seek foreclosure upon the real property under the two deeds of trust securing unpaid amounts due and owing them by Mundo Tile. They also seek prejudgment and postjudgment interest, as well as reasonable and necessary attorney's fees pursuant to the terms of the above-referenced loan documents as well as Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 38.001(8), and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mundo Tile contests Lamosa Commercial Services's and Porcelanite's entitlement\n   to recover under the Loan Agreements, asserting affirmative defenses of fraud, fraudulent inducement, offset, and waiver. Mundo Tile has also filed counterclaims for breach of contract to act as an exclusive distributor, fraud and fraudulent inducement, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment. Mundo Tile seeks actual and exemplary damages, prejudgment and postjudgment interest, reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, and costs, and requests a jury trial. In response to Mundo Tile's counterclaims, Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite assert affirmative defenses of unclean hands, release based on disclaimers of reliance, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, laches, and waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite have moved for summary judgment on their respective affirmative breach of contract claims and on Mundo Tiles's affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite also seek to prevent Mr. De la Rosa from testifying at trial with respect to Mundo Tile's lost profits, and move to strike Mundo Tile's request for a jury trial. The court first addresses Lamosa Commercial Services's and Porcelanite's respective motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite also move for summary judgment on Mundo Tile's affirmative defenses, and Porcelanite additionally moves for summary judgment on Mundo Tile's counterclaims. In its Amended Answer, Mundo Tile concedes it entered into the Loan Agreements, and that the debts have matured and are due and owing. Am. Ans. (Doc. 31). Mundo Tile, however, raises affirmative defenses of fraud and fraudulent inducement, estoppel, and waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Viewing all summary judgment evidence in the light most favorable to Mundo Tile, however, the court concludes that genuine disputes of material fact preclude entry of summary judgment on Mundo Tile's affirmative defenses in favor of Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite. Otherwise stated, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party (Mundo Tile), Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite have not met their burden of pointing the court to the absence of evidence of at least one essential element of each defense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 325,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Fontenot v.

Specifically, there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding: whether Porcelanite had an agreement with Mundo Tile that it would have exclusive distributorship rights to Porcelanite-brand tiles; whether Porcelanite and Lamosa Commercial Services fraudulently induced Mundo Tile into signing the Loan Agreements by continuing to promise that Mundo Tile would be the exclusive distributor of Porcelanite-brand tiles in the relevant geographical areas in Texas; whether Porcelanite and Lamosa Commercial Services failed to disclose the sale of tile to other distributors in Texas or actively concealed these facts; and whether Porcelanite and Lamosa Commercial Services waived their respective rights to enforce the Loan Agreements, or are estopped from enforcing\n   the Loan Agreements, by engaging in inconsistent conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In short, as genuine disputes of material fact remain for trial on Mundo Tile's affirmative defenses, the court will deny Porcelanite's and Lamosa Commercial Services's respective motions for summary judgment on Mundo Tile's affirmative defenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As questions of fact remain fro the jury with respect to Mundo Tile's affirmative defenses to their affirmative breach of contract claims, even though Mundo Tile concedes that it defaulted on the Loan Agreements, the court also denies Porcelanite's and Lamosa Commercial Services's respective motions for summary judgment on their breach of contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    2.

In support of its motion for summary judgment on Mundo Tile's counterclaims, Porcelanite argues that these counterclaims fail for three reasons: (1) the counterclaims are precluded because they depend upon an alleged exclusive distributorship agreement barred by the statute of frauds; (2) Mundo Tile may not recover because it intentionally and in writing both released and waived its counterclaims; and (3) to the extent that a counterclaim was not released or waived, Mundo Tile is time-barred from pursuing that claim. Viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to Mundo Tile, and under applicable law, the court agrees with Mundo Tile that summary judgment on its counterclaims in Porcelanite's favor is not warranted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    a.

The court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The statute of frauds requires a writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202.201\">\n    Tex.

Mundo Tile counters that, consistent with Texas law, the release was insufficient both with respect to Mundo Tile's counterclaims and Mundo Tile's fraudulent inducement defense releases.

Although Porcelanite recognizes this principle of law, it contends there is no evidence in this case of false representations made by Porcelanite representatives to Mundo Tile in connection with the Loan Transactions.

In addition, the court concludes that the release language upon which Porcelanite relies,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , falls well short of the standards set forth in\n   <em>\n    Italian Cowboy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Forest Oil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ; and\n   <em>\n    Schlumberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In addition, the releases relied upon by Porcelanite do not mention Mundo Tile's claims for Porcelanite's violation of the exclusive distributorship agreement.

The court agrees with Mundo Tile that the subject matter of the release is the issuance of credit in connection with the notes, not the nature of the tile distribution relationship between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, the court will deny Porcelanite's motion for summary judgment on Mundo Tile's counterclaims insofar as it argues that Mundo Tile may not recover because it released any existing claims against Porcelanite\n   when it signed the Loan Agreements and waived its right to claim that it was fraudulently induced into signing the release in the Loan Agreements. Porcelanite has failed to meet its burden of proof of establishing this defense as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    c. Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Porcelanite argues that Mundo Tile's counterclaims are time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations. Even if Mundo Tile's claims were brought after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the court determines that its counterclaims were revived by the Texas revival statute set forth in section 16.069 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Section 16.069 provides that if a counterclaim or cross claim is filed not later than thirty days after the date on which the party's answer is due and \"arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the basis of an action,\" the claim is not barred by limitations \"even though as a separate action it would be barred by limitation on the date the party's answer is required.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.069.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because Porcelanite's claims result from inducements made by Porcelanite relating to the exclusive distributorship agreement, the court concludes that Mundo Tile's claims in the present case arise out of the same facts and circumstances that are the basis of Porcelanite's suit. Further, Porcelanite does not argue to the contrary. Consistent with this court's previous ruling,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yumilicious Franchise, L.L.C. v.

In addition, as the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense for which Porcelanite has the burden, Porcelanite must show the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact and establish each element of its statute of limitations defense as a matter of law. Porcelanite has failed to meet its burden and the court, therefore, will deny its motion for summary judgment as to Mundo Tile's counterclaims on statute of limitations grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Further, although Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite are correct that Mundo Tile could have looked for better financing elsewhere if it did not agree with the contractual terms, this is not enough to overcome the undisputed evidence that last-minute changes were made to some of the documents at the time of closing, depriving Mundo Tile of any real opportunity to negotiate contractual terms. For these reasons, the court concludes that this first factor weighs against enforcing the jury waivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Mundo Tile presents the Declaration of Mr. De la Rosa in which he states that Mundo Tile's business relied almost exclusively on the sale of Porcelanite-brand tiles, making it\n   <em>\n    entirely dependent\n   </em>\n   on a continued supply of those tiles to remain in operation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. in Supp. of Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' Mot. to Strike Jury Demand 2 (De la Rosa Decl. \u00b6 2) (Doc. 114). Further, with respect to Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite's suggestion that certain of the jury waiver provisions were bilateral, indicating equal bargaining power and negotiability, the court has reviewed the jury waivers and determines that the majority were unilateral, binding only on Mundo Tile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

This disparity was further enhanced by Mundo Tile's lack of legal representation in the face of Lamosa Commercial Services's and Porcelanite's representation by the sophisticated law firm of Jackson Walker. For these reasons, the court concludes that this third factor weighs against enforcing the jury waivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    4. Business Acumen and Professional Experience\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite argue that this fourth factor weighs in their favor because Mr. De la Rosa was \"a business professional with nearly 20 years of experience in the tile industry and conducted millions of dollars' worth of business before executing the Loan Agreements.\" Pls.'

Although he may not have had experience with loan and security agreements, Mr. De la Rosa stated in his Declaration that he disagreed with the \"Waiver of Jury Trial\" provision in the 2012 Loan Agreements, and attempted to negotiate this provision, but counsel at Jackson Walker refused to negotiate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. in Supp. of Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' Mot. to Strike Jury Demand 3 (De la Rosa Decl. \u00b6 3) (Doc. 114). As an experienced businessperson who had entered into contracts before, Mr. De la Rosa can be presumed to understand the importance of reading contracts before signing them and, based on unequivocal statements in his Declaration, apparently understood the import of the jury waiver provisions he signed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zavala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205604766\">\n    2015 WL 5604766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"A party has sufficient business acumen if [he is] able to understand\n   the import of a jury waiver provision.\") (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203887235\">\n    2017 WL 3887235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (\"An understanding of the clear and unambiguous language of the jury waiver requires no extraordinary level of sophistication.\") (citation omitted). For these reasons, the court concludes this fourth factor weighs in favor of enforcing the waivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Having considered these factors, as well as the facts and surrounding circumstances, the court\n   <strong>\n    concludes\n   </strong>\n   , on balance, that Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that Mundo Tile's jury trial waiver in the Loan Agreements was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. Although the jury waivers are conspicuous, and consideration of Mr. De la Rosa's business acumen favors enforcing the jury waivers, the record shows Mundo Tile did not have an opportunity to negotiate the contractual language and, to the extent it attempted negotiation, it was rebuffed. Further, the jury waiver in the majority of the Loan Agreements is unilateral, suggesting that either there was disparity in the bargaining power of the parties or the parties lacked an opportunity to negotiate the terms of the jury waiver. The unilateral nature of the majority of the Loan Agreements, evidence of Mundo Tile's lack of opportunity to negotiate or actual negotiation, lack of legal representation, and the disparate bargaining power between the parties caused by, among other things, the nearly complete dependence of Mundo Tile on Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite to supply it with Porcelanite-brand tiles, demonstrate that Mundo Tile did not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently enter into the jury waivers. Accordingly, the jury waivers are not enforceable as a matter of law, and the court\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Jury Demand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   For the reasons herein stated, the court\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff Revestimientos Porcelanite, S.A. de C.V.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 90);\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff Servicios Comerciales Lamosa, S.A. de C.V.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 93);\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion to Exclude the Opinion Testimony of Defendant Mauricio De la Rosa (Doc. 96); and\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Jury Demand (Doc. 98).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The claims and counterclaims remaining for trial are: Lamosa Commercial Services's and Porcelanite's respective claims for breach of contract and for foreclosure on the real property pledged in the deeds of trust; and Mundo Tiles's counterclaims for breach of contract, fraud and fraudulent inducement, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment. Also remaining for trial are Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite's affirmative defenses of unclean hands, release based on disclaimers of reliance, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, laches, and waiver; and Mundo Tile's affirmative defenses of fraud, fraudulent inducement, offset of damages, and waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In light of the court's opinion on the pending motions and the necessarily fact-intensive nature of the remaining claims, counterclaims, and affirmative defenses, the court encourages the parties to consider settlement of this matter. The docket sheet reflects that the parties attempted unsuccessfully to resolve this matter by way of mediation on August 16, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 25), which is more than two years ago. Now that the parties have the benefit of the court's ruling, the court believes that a second mediation is in order. In that\n   vein, the court\n   <strong>\n    directs\n   </strong>\n   the parties to select a mediator and mediate this case by\n   <strong>\n    October 29, 2018\n   </strong>\n   , before a mediator of the parties' choosing. Alternatively, if the parties desire a United States Magistrate Judge to conduct the mediation or settlement conference, they are to notify the court in writing by\n   <strong>\n    September 7,\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    2018.\n   </strong>\n   If the parties agree to use a Magistrate Judge, the court will enter the appropriate order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    It is so ordered\n   </strong>\n   this 30th day of August, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Although these four motions were originally filed by Plaintiffs on April 17, 2017, the court denied the motions without prejudice on March 29, 2018, after concluding, sua sponte, that Plaintiffs' jurisdictional allegations pertaining to the citizenship of the parties were deficient.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mem. Op. &amp; Order (Doc. 75). On April 10, 2018, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint (Doc. 87) affirmatively setting forth the citizenship of each party. On April 12, 2018, the court issued an order confirming that the amended pleading cured the pleading deficiencies previously noted and directed the parties to refile their motions, legal briefs, and evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Order (Doc. 76).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The court's recitation of the facts is taken from the uncontested evidence contained in the summary judgment record provided by the parties, or evidence to which the court has overruled a party's objection.

After being informed by counsel for Grupo Lamosa, Lamosa Commercial Services, and Porcelanite that it would be equally secured with a judgment against Lamosa Commercial Services and Porcelanite as it would against Grupo Lamosa, Mundo Tile later dismissed without prejudice its third-party complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Counter-Pls.'

The court\n    <strong>\n     overrules\n    </strong>\n    this objection. The court has scrutinized Mr. De la Rosa's statements in his Declaration and his prior sworn deposition testimony, and finds that his statements in his Declaration are not clearly inconsistent with his previous sworn deposition testimony.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     S.W.S.

Tex. 2011) (Under the \"sham affidavit\" doctrine, a \"nonmovant cannot defeat a motion for summary judgment by submitting an affidavit [that] contradicts, without explanation, his previous testimony.\") (citations omitted). Specifically, after reviewing Mr. De la Rosa's deposition testimony concerning the numerous meetings he had with Grupo Lamosa's principals over the years and, in particular, 2012, the court concludes the deposition testimony is unclear, perhaps due to a language barrier, and, at best, shows some confusion on the part of Mr. De la Rosa as to what was said during various meetings held in 2012. For example, Mr. De la Rosa was asked: \"Okay. Is it your testimony that at the meeting on February 24, 2012, there was no mention of your needing to enter into the loan documents that were ultimately executed in July?\" He responded: \"No. That's not my knowledge, no.\" Porcelanite's Summ. J. App. (De la Rosa Dep. Tr. 149:8 - 151:16). This testimony, and the remainder of the deposition testimony, is ambiguous, and the court is unable to conclude that Mr. De la Rosa's statements in his Declaration are clearly inconsistent with his deposition testimony. Accordingly, the court declines to strike Mr. De La Rosa's statements in his Declaration under the \"sham affidavit\" doctrine.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Although agreeing with Porcelanite's motion for summary judgment and incorporating many portions by reference, Lamosa Commercial Services filed its own summary judgment motion, contending that because the false representations about which Mundo Tile complains relate to an exclusivity agreement between Mundo Tile and Porcelanite, it should not be held accountable for such representations. As Mundo Tile correctly notes, however, whether Lamosa Commercial Services was a party to the underlying agreement is immaterial; its liability, if any, is based on whether it made false representations, including promises by its principals of continued exclusive rights to products manufactured by its sister company, Porcelanite, in exchange for Mundo Tile entering into the Loan Agreements. Further, to the extent Lamosa Commercial Services contends that none of the fraudulent representations is attributable to it, the summary judgment record is to the contrary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.'
