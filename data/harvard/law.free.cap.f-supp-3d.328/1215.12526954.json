The Court held a hearing on June 28, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether Plaintiff Daniel Ormrod's demand that, if Defendant KOB-TV, LLC (\"KOB 4\") did not remove an allegedly defamatory news article from its website, then Ormrod would sue gave rise to a contractual obligation not to sue KOB 4; and (ii) whether the same demand also gave rise -- under the promissory estoppel doctrine -- to an enforceable promise not to sue KOB 4. The Court concludes that: (i) Ormrod's demand did not create a contract, so he did not incur a contractual obligation not to sue KOB 4; and (ii) Ormrod's demand was not a promise, so no legally enforceable promise not to sue exists. Accordingly, the Court will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court draws its facts from KOB-TV, LLC's Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 1-29, at 8-13, filed April 30, 2018 (Doc. 66)(\"Counterclaim\").

Specifically, KOB 4 received a police report describing \"the alleged completed commission of felony child abuse by Ormrod.\" Counterclaim \u00b6 7, at 9. Allegedly, Ormrod grabbed a student's arm, leaving multiple bruises.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim \u00b6 8, at 9. KOB 4 published an online news article saying that Ormrod had been charged with felony child abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9, at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At approximately 3:56 p.m., Ormrod's attorney, Sam Bregman, called KOB 4, and said that he represented Ormrod and that Ormrod had not been charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim \u00b6 12, at 10. Bregman said that if KOB 4 did not remove the article, he would sue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim \u00b6 12, at 10. After confirming with an Albuquerque Public Schools employee that Ormrod had not been charged, KOB 4 \"at approximately 4:02 PM ... updated the article to remove the 'charged' language, and at approximately 4:08 PM ... removed Ormrod's name from the article.\" Counterclaim \u00b6 14, at 11. KOB 4 also added an editor's note stating \" '[t]he name of the teacher being investigated has been removed as he does not currently face charges. APS has since clarified that there is only an investigation at this point. A letter home to parents named the teacher involved.' \" Counterclaim \u00b6 14, at 11 (quoting Article at 3, filed April 30, 2018 (Doc. 666) ). Ormrod subsequently sued KOB 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim \u00b6 15, at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ormrod alleges a single count of defamation against KOB 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint for Defamation \u00b6\u00b6 22-30, at 3-4, filed March 20, 2018 (Doc. 42). KOB 4 later filed two counterclaims against Ormrod, alleging one count of promissory estoppel and one count of breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 16-29, at 11-13.

Ormrod first argues that KOB 4 \"does not state that Plaintiff explicitly stated he would not file a lawsuit even if the defamatory story was taken down.\" Motion at 3. According to Ormrod, \"[i]t is not uncommon for an attorney, representing a client, to make a demand upon an opposing party to cease and desist from a certain action. The demand described under the auspices of [KOB 4's] counterclaim is insufficient to establish a contract.\" Motion at 3. He also contends that KOB 4 has not stated a claim for breach of contract, \"because it does not state there was any sufficient consideration to establish a contract or the specificity required under\n   <em>\n    Hansen v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995-NMSC-044\">\n    1995-NMSC-044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1558836\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/120/203/\">\n    120 N.M. 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1558836\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/120/203/\">\n    900 P.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Motion at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ormrod then asserts that KOB 4 has not pled facts sufficient to satisfy promissory estoppel's elements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3-4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Eavenson v.

Finally, Ormrod contends that the Counterclaim \"fails to state whether the individual who spoke to Plaintiff's counsel possessed the legal authority to enter into a settlement and release agreement on its behalf.\" Motion at 4. Ormrod concludes that the Court should grant the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   KOB 4 responds to the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KOB-TV, LLC's Response to Plaintiff Daniel Ormrod's Motion to Dismiss Defendant KOB-TV, LLC's Counterclaim for Promissory Estoppel and Breach of Contract, filed June 4, 2018 (Doc. 81)(\"Response\"). KOB 4 first contends that it has sufficiently pled a claim for breach of a unilateral contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5. According to KOB 4, a unilateral contract exists between itself and Ormrod, because Ormrod made an offer not to sue KOB 4 in exchange for KOB 4 removing from its website the news article, and KOB 4 accepted Ormrod's offer by removing the relevant language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 6. KOB 4 adds that \"an agreement to forebear suit is sufficient consideration in a unilateral contract.\" Response at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   KOB 4 next argues that Ormrod breached the parties' alleged contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 10. According to KOB 4, \"despite accepting Ormrod's offer by removing the 'charged' language, Ormrod has proceeded to sue KOB-TV, causing KOB-TV unnecessary harm.\" Response at 11. According to KOB 4, \"Ormrod had a duty not to sue KOB-TV. However, Ormrod breached his contractual obligation by filing his lawsuit against KOB-TV.\" Response at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   KOB 4 then contends that Ormrod's breach of the parties' alleged contract caused KOB 4 damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 11. According to KOB 4, \"but for Ormrod filing his suit against KOB-TV, KOB-TV would not be damaged.\" Response at 11. Further, according to KOB 4, \"as a result of Ormrod's breach, KOB-TV has suffered damages, including but not limited to, the attorneys' fees and costs of defending against the suit by Ormrod.\" Response at 12. KOB 4 concludes that it has properly pled a breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Turning to its promissory estoppel claim, KOB 4 asserts that it has properly pled all of that claim's elements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 12. First, KOB 4 avers that Ormrod made a promise inducing an action by promising not to sue if KOB 4 removed language from its news article. See Response at 14. According to KOB 4, \"induced by that promise, KOB-TV took the action of removing the language ... from the news article.\" Response at 15. Second, KOB 4 contends that it reasonably relied on Ormrod's promise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 16. According to KOB 4, it \"took the action of removing the language based on the promise by Ormrod and ... the action was in direct response to Ormrod's promise not to sue if the language was removed.\" Response at 16. Third, KOB 4 contends that it substantially changed its position by updating its news article and removing the \"charged\" language. Response at 17. Fourth, KOB 4 avers that it \"has sufficiently pleaded foreseeability, noting that Mr. Bregman, on behalf of Ormrod, made a promise to induce KOB-TV to take a certain action.\" Response at 17. Finally, KOB 4 contends that \"the [e]nforcement of the promise is necessary to prevent injustice to KOB-TV, including its expense of its continued defense of Ormrod's lawsuit.\" Response at 18. KOB 4 concludes that the Court should deny the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ormrod replies to the Response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Reply in Support of his Motion to Dismiss Defendant KOB-TV, LLC's Counterclaim for Promissory Estoppel and Breach of Contract, filed June 21, 2018 (Doc. 88)(\"Reply\"). Ormrod first contends that \"the language plead by KOB in its Counterclaim falls short of creating a contract.\" Reply at 1. According to Ormrod,\n   \"there is simply no legal precedent to support KOB's contention where a potentially defamed individual calls a newsroom complaining about an error in a story, convinces the news media entity to remove the story, then somehow claim[s] an unwritten contract was created to forego litigation.\" Reply at 2. Ormrod continues that \"there is nothing in the words plead[ed] in the counterclaim which explicitly state take down the false story and my client will not sue you if you do.\" Reply at 3. According to Ormrod, KOB's characterization of his statement as a \" 'promise not to sue' is simply self-serving commentary on the actual statement which KOB claims created the contract.\" Reply at 3 (quoting Counterclaim \u00b6 13, at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ormrod next avers that KOB 4's promissory estoppel claim should fail, because \"KOB does not plead anything in its counterclaim to substantiate a change in position.\" Reply at 5. According to Ormrod, \"all [KOB 4] appeared to do was remove the false claim that Plaintiff was charged with a felony. The story was not removed and [KOB 4] does not claim with any substance to have suffered a change in position by simply correcting a story.\" Reply at 5. Ormrod concludes that the Court should dismiss KOB 4's counterclaims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court held a hearing on June 28, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Motion Hearing at 1:6-9 (taken June 28, 2018)(\"Tr.\")(Court).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ormrod first argued that the language \"[r]emove from [KOB.com] within 10 minutes the article containing the statement that Ormrod had been charged or Ormrod would sue KOB-TV\" does not create a contract. Tr. at 3:18-25 (Bregman). According to Ormrod, \"I promised to them that I would sue them unless they did something. I didn't promise that I would never sue them.\" Tr. at 3:25-4:3 (Bregman). Ormrod continued that \"[n]owhere did they allege that I said ... I promise not to sue you if you do this.\" Tr. at 4:13-15 (Bregman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   KOB 4 responded that Ormrod's words created a unilateral contract, because \"[t]he language is important, it isn't take this down and I will sue you. It's take this down or I will sue you,\" Tr. at 9:6-8 (Rogers), and \"what you're hearing now is, well, let's transform that ['or'] into an 'and,' \" Tr. at 10:12-13 (Rogers). Ormrod replied that \"there is no way that you can say positively to someone do something or I'm going to sue you and then say that that is somehow a promise that that same person would never sue that person. That is just contrary to what ... makes logical sense.\" Tr. at 19:22-20:2 (Bregman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Turning to promissory estoppel, Ormrod averred that essentially the same analysis applies regarding whether he made a promise not to sue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 23:17-21 (Bregman). The Court then asked KOB 4 about promissory estoppel's fifth element, requiring a promise's enforcement to prevent injustice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 24:18-20 (Court). The Court stated: \"I'm not seeing the injustice to channel 4. If anything, it mitigated damages here by getting ... the demand from an attorney and then acting on it.\" Tr. at 25:10-13 (Court). KOB 4 responded that \"I believe that the injustice, the Court can take judicial notice of the expense and the aggravation and the damage\n   to everyone involved here. A proceeding that's going to be expensive.\" Tr. at 27:5-8 (Rogers). At the hearing's conclusion, the Court stated that it was inclined to grant the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 35:8-9 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LAW REGARDING RULE(12)(b)(6)\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) authorizes a court to dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

KOB 4 paraphrases Ormrod's demand as a conditional statement -- specifically \"if you remove the article, then I will not sue you\" -- but the correct way to paraphrase Ormrod's demand as a conditional statement is \"if you don't remove the article, then I will sue you,\" which is not logically equivalent to KOB 4's phrasing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   KOB 4's paraphrasing of Ormrod's demand represents an incorrect contrapositive of Ormrod's actual words. Logicians write conditional statements like \"if A, then B\" as A?B. \"List of valid argument forms,\" Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_valid_argument_forms (last viewed July 13, 2018). In this case, \"A\" refers to removing the article, and \"B\" refers to Ormrod suing KOB 4. \"The contrapositive of any true proposition is also true.\" Mathwords.com, http://www.mathwords.com/c/contrapositive.htm (last viewed July 13, 2018). Creating a contrapositive requires \"switching the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and negating both,\" Mathwords.com, http://www.mathwords.com/c/contrapositive.htm (last viewed July 13, 2018), which means changing on which side of the arrow the letters A and B are, and then negating both letters. The correct paraphrasing of Ormrod's demand as a conditional statement is \"if you don't remove the article, then I will sue you,\" or ~A?B. The correct contrapositive of\n   Ormrod's statement is thus \"if I do not sue you, then you removed the article,\" or ~B?A, and not \"if you remove the article, then I will not sue you,\" or A ? ~B, as KOB 4 alleges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Indeed, an important distinction exists between saying \"if you remove the article, then I will not sue you\" -- the incorrect contrapositive -- and saying \"if I don't sue, then you removed the article\" -- the correct contrapositive. The first statement says that a sufficient condition of not suing is removing the article. The second statement says only that a necessary condition of not suing is removing the article. To illustrate, one could say that, if the Houston Astros won the World Series, then they also won the American League Pennant. Winning the American League Pennant, however, is only a necessary condition of the Astros winning the World Series. Winning the American League Pennant is not sufficient. For the Astros to win the World Series, there are other necessary conditions, including winning four games in the World Series.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For these reasons, Ormrod's statement that, if KOB 4 did not remove the article, then he would sue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim \u00b6 12, at 10, is not equivalent to saying that Ormrod \"made a promise not to sue KOB-TV if KOB-TV took down from KOB.com within ten minutes of his telephone call the article containing the statement that Ormrod had been charged,\" Counterclaim \u00b6 13, at 10-11.

In short, a state supreme court case that a federal court\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    predicts that the state court would overrule is likely to be very old, neglected in subsequent state court cases -- perhaps because it is in a dusty corner of the common law which does not get much attention or have much application -- and clearly wrong.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The Supreme Court of the United States has addressed what the federal courts may use when there is not a decision on point from the state's highest court:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    The highest state court is the final authority on state law, but it is still the duty of the federal courts, where the state law supplies the rule of decision, to ascertain and apply that law even though it has not been expounded by the highest court of the State.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit case law, ignoring changes a state's law has undergone in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to be at least uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit -- or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves -- would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point -- regardless whether it accurately reflects state law -- at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long as federal district judges must follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit case law against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening case law directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end, and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination -- the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants -- if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion -- have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' decisions are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. Accordingly, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind state law developments -- developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states. The Tenth Circuit used to follow this rationale in applying a clearly erroneous standard of review to district judge decisions of state law with no controlling state Supreme Court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weiss v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560510\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/518/#p525\">\n     787 F.2d 518\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 525 (10th Cir. 1986) ;\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

Since the mid-1980s, however, the Tenth Circuit has abandoned that rationale and applied a de novo standard of review to district judge decisions applying state law with no governing state supreme court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

The Court regrets the Tenth Circuit's retreat from the clearly erroneous standard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court thinks the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding -- what the state law was on the day the opinion was published -- but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the Constitution of the United States of America possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based only on state court cases available to and considered by the Tenth Circuit, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    . Its holdings are descriptive, not prescriptive -- interpretive, not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court thinks the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions --\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law -- in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    's purpose is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    's \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

This formulation may not be the most precise if the goal is to ensure identical outcomes in state and federal court -- the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, United States District Judge, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that state circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Laboratories v.

This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the Restatements of Law, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, and personnel changes on the court -- considerations that would not necessarily inform a federal court's analysis of federal law -- may validly come into play. The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when a United States Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time -- forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the state jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous) -- federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases -- even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law -- alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree.
