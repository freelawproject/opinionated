Plaintiff-Relators Albert Bruno and Alex Strahan filed oppositions, (Docs. 45 and 48), and Defendants filed replies. (Docs. 51 and 52). For the following reasons, the\n   <strong>\n    Motions to Dismiss (Doc. 35 and 39)\n   </strong>\n   are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff-Relators, two former employees of a large medical laboratory called MedComp Laboratory Sciences, L.L.C. and MedComp Sciences, L.L.C (\"MedComp\") allege that Defendants conspired to defraud the United States out of millions of dollars arising from fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 2). Relators allege that Defendants offered physicians ownership interests in labs called Physician Owned Labs (\"POL\"), which existed in name only, and they received payments from the labs in proportion to the number of urine specimens the physicians sent to a different lab called Quantum for urine testing covered by private insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Relators also allege that the scheme incentivized the same doctors to send their urine specimens covered by Medicare and Medicaid to another lab called MedComp.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Relators allege that the scheme began in early 2013, when Brad Schaeffer, the owner of MedComp, called a companywide meeting for Quantum and MedComp to present the POL model.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23, 60. Schaeffer allegedly instructed MedComp's sales representatives to promote the POL model to doctors to induce them to send urine specimens covered by private insurance to Quantum and urine specimens covered by Medicare and Medicaid to MedComp.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60. Relators allege that Brad Schaeffer, Lisa Janani, and Javid Janani formed entities called Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Sigma as POLs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62. Relators, however, allege that these labs existed in name only and did not physically exist, and were not licensed labs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Relators allege that when participating physicians referred specimens to the POLs, the POLs would bill Quantum for urine tests, and then Quantum would pay the POLs for the tests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74. The revenue paid to the physicians was proportionate to the amount of specimens they sent to Quantum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MedComp allegedly only allowed physicians who were willing to send specimens to Quantum to buy shares in the POLs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. Relators also allege that Schaeffer instructed MedComp's sales representatives to encourage the physicians to send their Medicare and Medicaid specimens to MedComp because Quantum and MedComp, through the POLs, were providing the physicians with a financial incentive to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. As of December of 2014, all physicians who sent specimens to Quantum for private insurance reimbursements also sent specimens covered by Medicare and Medcaid to MedComp.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In early 2014, Relator Albert Bruno, a Medcomp sales manager, allegedly presented a subscription agreement for a POL to a physician, but after the physician's attorney concluded that the POL model was not legal, the physician did not invest in the POL.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93. Relator Bruno then raised the legality of the POL program to Brad Schaeffer, an owner of MedComp because Bruno was concerned the program violated statues prohibiting self-referral schemes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94. Rather than responding to Bruno's concerns, Schaeffer allegedly labeled Bruno a \"trouble maker\" who needed to be controlled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95. As of December 2014, about sixty-one doctors in seven states had ownership interests in the POLs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107. Relators also allege that the POL model encouraged doctors to act based on financial gain and not patients' best interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In total, Relators claim that between April 2013 and November 2014, over 15,000 urine specimens were sent to Quantum from doctors participating in the POL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118. According to Relators, between April 2012 and January 2016, private insurance companies paid Quantum $12 million for urine tests and from April 2013 through December 2014 MedComp has been paid $46 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119-120. Relators further claim that between April 2013 and January 2016, Medicare and Medicaid paid MedComp $18 million for specimens originating from doctors participating in the POL scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Relators claim that Defendants violated the False Claims Act (\"FCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)-(C) by presenting false claims to the United States, making false records, and conspiring to violate the FCA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203729\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203729\">\n    at \u00b6 122-140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants therefore contend that Relators fail to satisfy Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, however, has held that under Rule 9(b) a relator \"does not necessarily need [to plead] the exact dollar amounts, billing numbers, or dates to prove to a preponderance that fraudulent bills were actually submitted\" because this \"level of proof [is] not demanded to win at trial[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Grubbs v.

Relators claim that Defendants made false and fraudulent claims by falsely certifying that their claims did not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law. (Doc. 1 at\n   \u00b6 127). As the Court already discussed, falsely certifying compliance with the Stark Law or the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a \"false claim\" under the FCA.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Stark Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court will begin with the Stark Law. \"The Stark Law was enacted to address overutilization of services by physicians who stood to profit from referring patients to facilities or entities in which they had a financial interest.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to an entity for certain \"designated health services\" if the referring physician has a nonexempt \"financial relationship\" with such entity. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395nn(a). Clinical laboratory services, like urine tests, are \"designated health services.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395nn(h)(6)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A physician has a \"financial relationship\" with an entity if the physician has \"an ownership or investment interest in the entity\" or a \"compensation arrangement\" with the entity. \u00a7 1395nn(a)(2). A \"compensation arrangement\" includes \"any arrangement involving any remuneration between a physician\" and an entity. \u00a7 1395nn(h)(1)(A). And \"remuneration\" \"includes any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind.\" \u00a7 1395nn(h)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants argue that Relators fail to allege a Stark Law violation because Relators do not allege that the physicians who invested in the POLs had a financial relationship with a lab to which they were referring Medicare and Medicaid patients-namely MedComp. (Doc. 35-1 at p. 12-13). Rather, Defendants argue that because Quantum only sought reimbursement from private insurers, Defendants did not violate the Stark Laws. (Docs. 35-1 at p. 13 and 39-1 at p. 10). Relators argue that there is a financial relationship between the POLs and MedComp because POL physicians were encouraged to send their Medicare and Medicaid specimens to MedComp because of the financial benefits available to them for sending specimens to Quantum. (Doc. 45 at p. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court concludes that Relators adequately allege an indirect compensation arrangement between physicians who invested in the POLs and MedComp, which submitted Medicare claims. The Stark Law implementing regulations are particularly helpful in defining indirect compensation arrangements. They provide that a financial relationship constitutes a prohibited \"indirect compensation arrangement,\" if (1) \"there exists an unbroken chain of any number ... of persons or entities that have financial relationships ... between them,\" (2) \"[t]he referring physician ... receives aggregate compensation ... that varies with, or takes into account, the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician for the entity furnishing\" the designated health services, and (3) the entity has knowledge that the compensation so varies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.354\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Drakeford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752432\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/394/#p397\">\n    675 F.3d at 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, there is an unbroken chain of persons with financial relationships because Relators allege that the POLs were formed by entities owned by Defendants Brad Schaeffer, Javid Janani, and Lisa Janani. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 62). Relators also allege that Brad Schaeffer owned MedComp, Javid Janani owned MedComp, and Lisa Janani owned Quantum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-25. Second, Relators allege that the referring physicians received compensation based on the volume of referrals because physicians were paid in proportion to the number of\n   urine specimens they sent to Quantum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74. Third, Relators allege that the entity furnishing the designated health services-Quantum-had knowledge of the compensation scheme. Relators allege that MedComp's sales directors told Bruno not to disclose that MedComp linked referred specimens to payouts because it was illegal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98. Relators have thus alleged a Stark Law violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Anti-Kickback Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court next turns to the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   knowingly and willfully offer[ing] or pay[ing] any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person ... to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing ... of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2)(A). In other words, it \"prohibits offering money or other things of value to entice another party to provide a good or service that would be paid for by a federal health care program.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

The statute has been broadly interpreted to cover any arrangement where one purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for the referral of services or to induce future referrals.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendants argue that Relators anti-kickback allegations are conclusory and fail to meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard because Relators do not allege that any specific physician who purchased an interest in a POL referred urine samples to MedComp and received compensation. (Doc. 35-1 at p. 11 and 39-1 at p. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Pleading fraud with particularity, generally requires a plaintiff to allege the \"who, what, when, where, and how\" of the fraud.\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

For FCA claims, however, the Fifth Circuit has \"explained that Rule 9(b) is 'context specific and flexible,' and noted that a plaintiff may sufficiently state a claim with particularity 'without including all the details of any single court-articulated standard-it depends on the elements of the claim in hand.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=519%20Fed.%20Appx.%20890\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642790\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/180/#p189\">\n    565 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   189-90 ). Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Nunnally\n   </em>\n   , in which the Fifth Circuit held that the relator had not sufficiently plead an FCA claim because he failed to allege the content of the financial arrangements at issue, the inducements, improper referrals, the identity of any physicians, or the time period of the scheme beyond alleging that it occurred from 1993 to the present.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 894. As a result, the Court held that the complaint was sweeping and conclusory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, unlike\n   <em>\n    Nunnally\n   </em>\n   , Relators allege fraud with particularity. First, Relators allege the content of the financial arrangement, the inducements, and the improper referrals with detail by alleging how the investments in the POLs operated, the cost of the investment, and the way that physicians were compensated in proportion to referrals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 at \u00b6 62-83). And although Relators do not allege the participating physicians by name, they sufficiently allege the identity of the physicians by claiming that about sixty-one physicians or physician groups from Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Illinois, Arizona, Alabama, and Georgia had an ownership interest in the POLs. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 107). Relators also allege the time-period of the alleged scheme by alleging that it began in early 2013, that the POLs were formed in 2013 and 2014, and that since April 2013 MedComp had been paid about $18 million for testing specimens covered\n   by Medicare and Medicaid for specimens originating from physicians participating in the POLs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60, 62, 121. Relators complaint is far from conclusory, and it meets Rule 9(b)'s pleading standard for the Anti-Kickback Statute claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants also argue that although Relators allege that physicians received payouts from the POLs based on their referrals to Quantum for private insurance patients, Relators fail to allege that Quantum provided physicians a financial incentive to refer Medicare and Medicaid specimens to MedComp. (Doc. 39-1 at p. 14 and 35-1 at p. 11). The Court disagrees. It is not dispositive that Quantum processed private insurance and MedComp processed Medicaid and Medicaid. Compensation for private insurance referrals may constitute a payment to induce referrals of federal health care program business if there is a nexus between the kickbacks for private insurance and Medicare or Medicaid business. Neither party cites any case that addresses this issue, nor is the Court aware of any. However, the Court is persuaded that carving-out referrals of federal health care programs can violate the Anti-Kickback Statute by disguising remuneration for federal health care program referrals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (\"OIG\") has interpreted the Anti-Kickback Statute in advisory opinions to mean that carving out federal health care business from commercial referrals may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OIG Advisory Op.

No. 13-03. Even though these new laboratories would not provide services to Medicare and Medicaid patients, OIG concluded that the arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute because the parent laboratory processed Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. OIG reasoned that the arrangement may \"increase the likelihood that physicians will order services from the Parent Laboratory for Federal health care program beneficiaries ... for reasons of convenience, to demonstrate commitment to the Parent Laboratory and potentially secure more favorable pricing on private pay services, or simply because the Physician Groups fail to make a distinction between the Parent Laboratory and the laboratories operated with support from the Parent Laboratory-owned Management Company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, the Court finds that it is reasonable to infer that the POL scheme will likewise increase the chances that physicians refer urine specimens to MedComp, which takes Medicare and Medicaid even though physicians only receive payments proportionate to Quantum referrals for\n   private insurance. MedComp and Quantum share similar owners with the POLs, and most importantly, Relators allege that Brad Schaeffer instructed MedComp's sales representatives to offer the POL model to physicians. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 65). As a result, it is plausible that physicians view MedComp and Quantum as related entities, and physicians will send urine specimens to MedComp because they receive remunerations for referrals to Quantum. The Anti-Kickback Statute \"prohibits offering money or other things of value to entice another party to provide a good or service that would be paid for by a federal health care program.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

The Court disagrees. First, Relators have alleged sufficient facts from which the Court can infer that the Defendants agreed to commit fraud under the FCA.

R.S. 37:1745(A)(2) (defining a health care provider as \"a person, partnership, or corporation licensed by the state to provide health care or professional services ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, Relators do not allege that any of the Defendants are licensed by Louisiana to provide health care or professional services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1). Indeed, Relators allege that Defendants Alpha Labs, Beta Labs, Gamma Labs, and Sigma Labs are Louisiana limited liability companies \"but they are not licensed laboratories[.]\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 22).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204685001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And Relators Complaint is silent about whether any other Defendant is a licensed health care provider in Louisiana. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1). Relators Louisiana's Anti-Kickback Statute claim is therefore dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The Motions to Dismiss are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Relators Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law, and Louisiana Anti-Kickback claims, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Relators False Claims Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the\n   <strong>\n    Motions for Oral Argument (Docs. 36 and 40)\n   </strong>\n   are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Liability also requires materiality.\n    <em>\n     U.S. ex rel.
