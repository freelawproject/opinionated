INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is Plaintiffs Hana Durasevic and Doka Durasevic's complaint against their insurance company, Grange Insurance Company of Michigan. Plaintiffs bring the present action alleging that Defendant is liable for insurance coverage for damage to their home. Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment asserting Defendant's liability to provide them coverage. Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment asserting that this Court should dismiss the entire action. For the reasons stated below, this Court will grant Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and deny Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action arises from a dispute about insurance coverage for fire damage to Plaintiffs' home. On September 29, 2015, Plaintiffs submitted a claim to Defendant for fire damage to their house. Dkt. No. 25, pg. 4 (Pg. ID 310). Defendant issued $619,029.98 to Plaintiffs to cover expenses from the fire damage, paying money for coverage identified as\n   Dwelling, Contents, Additional Living Expenses, Dwelling Expenses, and Contents Expenses. Dkt. No. 25-2, pg. 2 (Pg. ID 341). Defendant paid for Plaintiffs' temporary housing after the September 29, 2015 fire. Dkt. No. 25, pg. 8 (Pg. ID 314).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 29, 2016, a second fire occurred at Plaintiffs' original home, where the first fire occurred. Dkt. No. 25-2, pg. 2 (Pg. ID 341). At the time of the second fire, Plaintiffs still lived in temporary housing. Dkt. No. 25, pg. 8 (Pg. ID 314). Defendant paid $30,548.14 for the April 29th fire, paying money for coverage identified as Additional Living Expenses and Dwelling Expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant retained Kevin G. Pike, a senior fire investigator, to investigate the origin of the second fire. Dkt. No. 25-3, pg. 2 (Pg. ID 344). Mr. Pike concluded that someone started the fire intentionally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pg. 21 (Pg. ID 363). Mr. Pike's investigation also found that there was no forced entry into the home. Dkt. No. 5-2, pg. 9 (Pg. ID 95). Defendant conducted an investigation and found that Niko Durasevic, Plaintiffs' son, was at the residence just a few hours before the fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Defendant concluded that it was more likely than not that Niko Durasevic intentionally started the April 29, 2016 fire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a part of Defendant's investigation, Defendant made repeated requests to Plaintiffs to produce financial records, phone records, and Facebook archives. Dkt. No. 5-2, pg. 8 (Pg. ID 94). Plaintiff failed to produce the requested documentation and information so Defendant could properly investigate the claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant also attempted to conduct examinations under oath (\"EUOs\") with Plaintiffs and their family members living with them as part of its investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Insured persons Niko and Samantha Durasevic failed to submit to EUOs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Insured persons Doka, Hana, and Viktor Durasevic submitted to EUOs, but failed to sign their EUO transcripts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 24, 2017, Defendant wrote Plaintiffs a letter stating why Plaintiffs' policy did not provide total coverage for their claim resulting from the April 29 fire. Dkt No. 5-2. The letter stated the following reasons for denying coverage: 1) Plaintiffs were vacant from the house for 60 days immediately preceding the fire; 2) some of the insured persons under the policy failed to provide sworn testimony at an EUO; 3) Plaintiffs failed to respond to repeated requests for documentation supporting the claim; 4) the evidence demonstrated that it was more likely than not that Niko Durasevic started the fire; and 5) Plaintiffs concealed Niko's involvement with the fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pgs. 7-9 (Pg. ID 93-95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 15, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the present action in the Macomb County Circuit Court. Dkt. No. 1-4. On June 26, 2017, Defendant removed the action to this Court. Dkt. No. 1. Plaintiffs then filed their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on April 26, 2018. Dkt. No. 24. In their Motion, Plaintiffs request that this Court strike several of Defendant's affirmative defenses and hold Defendant liable for coverage of the April 29, 2016 fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant responded to the Motion on May 17, 2018. Dkt. No. 29. Plaintiffs replied on May 25, 2018. Dkt. No. 31. On April 26, 2018, Defendant filed its Motion for Summary Judgment. Dkt. No. 25. Defendant asserts that this Court should dismiss the entire action because Plaintiffs\n   failed to comply with its policy conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs responded to the Motion on May 17, 2018. Dkt. No. 28. Defendant replied on May 31, 2018. Dkt. No. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs' and Defendant's Motions contain overlapping issues. This Court will address Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment first. The Court will then apply its conclusions to Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment to the extent they are applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant asserts three reasons why this Court should grant summary judgment in its favor. First, Plaintiffs' insurance policy excludes coverage for damage resulting from intentionally set fires if the dwelling was vacant for the 60 days immediately preceding the fire. Dkt. No. 25, pg. 2 (Pg. ID 308). Second, Plaintiffs' policy requires insured persons to provide sworn testimony at an EUO; Niko and Samantha Durasevic are insured persons who failed to submit to EUOs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, Plaintiffs' policy requires insured persons to cooperate with its investigation and produce documents, and Plaintiffs failed to produce requested documentation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Argument One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiffs' insurance policy excludes coverage for loss or damage resulting from intentionally set fires if the dwelling was vacant for the sixty days immediately preceding the fire. Dkt. No. 25, pg. 2 (Pg. ID 308). Plaintiff contends that their home was not vacant because the definition of vacant means that a dwelling is lacking both animate and inanimate objects. Dkt. No. 24, pg. 4 (Pg. ID 183). Plaintiffs' home was not empty of inanimate objects at the time of the second fire.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Alternatively, Plaintiff argues that Defendant is estopped from asserting the vacancy exclusion because Defendant was paying Plaintiffs to live elsewhere and knew that Plaintiffs were not living at their home at the time of the fire. Dkt. No. 28, pg. 2 (Pg. ID 426).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Vacancy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs' insurance policy with Defendant states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   B..... [W]e do not insure for loss ... caused directly or indirectly by any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Exclusion B.4. is removed and replaced with the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   4. Vandalism or malicious mischief, including intentionally set fires, if the dwelling has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days immediately preceding\n   the loss. A building under construction is not considered vacant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dkt. No. 5-1, pg. 21, 41 (Pg. ID 61, 81). Plaintiffs' policy also states that \"intentional acts\" means \"loss resulting from an action by or at the direction of any insured person committed with the intent to cause a loss, or where the results of such action are reasonably foreseeable and cause a loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pg. 20 (Pg. ID 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the first fire occurred at Plaintiffs' home on September 29, 2015, Defendant paid for Plaintiffs to reside in temporary housing. Dkt. No. 25, pg. 8 (Pg. ID 314). According to the EUO testimony of Mr. Durasevic, Plaintiffs have not lived in their original home since the first fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 25-4, pgs. 4-6 (Pg. ID 409-11). Additionally, Plaintiffs have not started any construction work on their original home since the first fire happened.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pg. 6 (Pg. ID 411). Defendant conducted an investigation after the April 29, 2016 fire. Dkt. No. 25-3, pg. 2 (Pg. ID 344). Defendant retained Kevin G. Pike, a senior fire investigator, to investigate the origin of the fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pike concluded that someone started the fire intentionally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pg. 21 (Pg. ID 363). Defendant conducted an investigation and also found that Niko Durasevic, Plaintiffs' son, was at the residence just a few hours before the fire. Dkt. No. 5-2, pg. 9 (Pg. ID 95). Therefore, Defendant concluded that it was more likely than not that Niko Durasevic intentionally started the April 29, 2016 fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on the aforementioned information, Defendant asserts that it is not required to provide coverage because the second fire was intentional and Plaintiffs' home was vacant for the sixty days immediately preceding the fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 25, pg. 8 (Pg. ID 314).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    McNeel v. Farm Bureau General Insurance Company of Michigan\n   </em>\n   for the definition of the word \"vacant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074951\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/289/76/\">\n    289 Mich.App. 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20205\">\n    795 N.W.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215 (2010). In\n   <em>\n    McNeel\n   </em>\n   , the insurance contract provision at issue stated that there was no coverage \"[w]hile a described building, whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant, is\n   <em>\n    vacant\n   </em>\n   beyond a period of sixty consecutive days or is\n   <em>\n    unoccupied\n   </em>\n   beyond a period of six consecutive months.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The contract did not define the term \"unoccupied.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20205\">\n    at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found that since the policy \"clearly separate[d] the terms 'vacant' and 'unoccupied' into different clauses with distinct time requirements,\" the words had different meanings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20205\">\n    at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [M]ost authorities have distinguished the terms \"vacant\" and \"unoccupied.\" The term \"vacant\" has been construed to mean empty, deprived of contents, and without inanimate objects. It implies entire abandonment, and non-occupancy for any purpose. On the other hand \"unoccupied\" has been held to mean without animate objects, and implies that no actual use is being made of the premises by anyone corporeally present or in possession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting 45 CJS, Insurance, \u00a7 1002, p. 467). Plaintiffs thus assert that the term \"vacant\" means that a building is void of both animate and inanimate objects. Dkt. No. 24, pg. 4 (Pg. ID 183). Plaintiffs' home contained inanimate objects at the time of the fire, including furniture, appliance, and other items of personal property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Plaintiffs argue that their home was not vacant under the policy and the vacancy exclusion does not apply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    McNeel\n   </em>\n   found that the terms \"vacant\" and \"unoccupied\" were different because the insurance policy provision used the terms in different clauses, which had distinct requirements. Thus, the terms clearly had different meanings. Here, the relevant provision of Plaintiffs' insurance policy does not include the terms\n   \"vacant\" and \"unoccupied\" together. Terms of a contract \"must be interpreted in the context of the contract in which they appear.\"\n   <em>\n    Vushaj v. Farm Bureau Gen. Ins. Co. of Mich.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068313\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/284/513/\">\n    284 Mich.App. 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20N.W.2d%20758\">\n    773 N.W.2d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760 (2009). Therefore, the definition of the term \"vacant\" in Plaintiffs' insurance policy should not be construed in the same manner as the\n   <em>\n    McNeel\n   </em>\n   court construed the term. The Michigan Court of Appeals has held that the term \"vacant\" means \"not routinely characterized by the presence of individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Vushaj v. Farm Bureau Gen. Ins. Co. of Mich.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068313\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/284/513/\">\n    284 Mich.App. 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20N.W.2d%20758\">\n    773 N.W.2d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760 (2009). When interpreting an insurance policy, the\n   <em>\n    Vushaj\n   </em>\n   court determined that \"[a]ny reading of the [insurance policy] results in the conclusion that the purpose of the provision in question is to protect the insurance company from the risk that accompanies insuring a house that does not have an occupant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20N.W.2d%20758\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Similarly, here, any reading of Plaintiffs' insurance provision results in the conclusion that the purpose of the vacancy exclusion is to protect Defendant from the risk of insuring a house without a human occupant. Therefore, this Court will construe the term \"vacant\" like the\n   <em>\n    Vushaj\n   </em>\n   court construed it, to mean \"not routinely characterized by the presence of individuals.\" As previously stated, Plaintiffs' home was devoid of human occupants for six months preceding the second fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 25-4, pgs. 4-6 (Pg. ID 409-11). Additionally, Plaintiffs have not started any construction work on their original home since the first fire happened.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pg. 6 (Pg. ID 411). Therefore, Plaintiffs' home was vacant under the terms of their insurance policy provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although Plaintiffs' house was vacant, the record presents a factual issue about whether the second fire was intentionally set. The vacancy exclusion states that Defendant does not cover loss for \"intentionally set fires, if the dwelling has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days immediately preceding the loss.\" Dkt. No. 5-1, pg. 21, 41 (Pg. ID 61, 81). Language in the policy on the prior page of the contract states that \"intentional acts\" means \"loss resulting from an action by or at the direction of any insured person committed with the intent to cause a loss, or where the results of such action are reasonably foreseeable and cause a loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pg. 20 (Pg. ID 60). The coverage position letter Defendant wrote to Plaintiff also defines an intentional act in the same manner. Dkt. No. 5-2, pg. 9 (Pg. ID 95). Therefore, an intentionally set fire is a fire that is set by an insured person with the intent to cause a loss of where the results of action will foreseeably cause a loss. The policy defines an insured person as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   a. you;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   b. your relatives residing in your household; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   c. any other person under the age of 21 residing in your household who is in your care or the care of a resident relative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Dkt. No. 5-1, pg. 10 (Pg. ID 50). It is not disputed that Niko Durasevic is an insured person under Plaintiffs' insurance policy because he is the son of the Plaintiffs and he resided in Plaintiffs' household. Defendant's investigation found that Niko Durasevic was at the residence just a few hours before the fire. Dkt. No. 5-2, pg. 9 (Pg. ID 95). The Senior Fire Investigator Mr. Pike also concluded that there was no evidence of forced entry prior to the fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Defendant concluded that it was more likely than not that Niko Durasevic intentionally started the April 29, 2016 fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Niko's presence a few hours before the fire presents only circumstantial evidence that he intentionally set the fire.

Dkt. No. 25, pg. 12 (Pg. ID 318). Plaintiff Doka Durasevic, along with Plaintiff's lawyer, agreed to provide Defendant with the requested tax information during his EUO. Dkt. No. 25-4, pg. 6 (Pg. ID 411). Plaintiffs also signed authorizations for release of\n   the requested information. Dkt. No. 24-8, pg. 2 (Pg. ID 306). However, Plaintiffs have not provided Defendant with the requested documents. Therefore, like this Court found in\n   <em>\n    Musleh\n   </em>\n   , this Court holds that Plaintiffs did not substantially comply with the insurance contract because they did not submit the requested documents to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In conclusion, this Court holds that questions of material fact exist concerning the applicability of the vacancy exclusion. However, this Court finds that Plaintiffs failed to substantially comply with the provisions of the insurance policy contract. Due to Plaintiffs' failure to comply, Defendants are not liable to provide coverage for the second fire. Consequently, this Court will grant Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment requests that this Court enter summary judgment as to liability in its favor. Dkt. No. 24, pg. 14 (Pg. ID 193). Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment also requests that this Court strike several of Defendant's affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%20193567\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs assert that this Court should dismiss Defendant's affirmative defenses 25-28 and 32-36.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%20193567\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court has granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant. Therefore, Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For the reasons discussed herein, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and deny Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    On October 25, 2016, Niko Durasevic was charged with second degree arson under M.C.L. \u00a7 750.73 in the 6th Judicial Circuit Court. Case number 2016-003873-FH. On September 28, 2016, the State dismissed this charge. The State also charged Mr. Durasevic with Felony Attempted Breaking and Entering Without Breaking With Intent under M.C.L. \u00a7 750.111(A). Niko pleaded guilty to Entering Without Breaking on September 28, 2017; the court sentenced him on November 15, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The State charged Niko Durasevic with second degree arson, but it later dismissed this charge. The Court also notes that Niko and Samantha Durasevic never submitted to EUOs, which could have provided Defendant with clear evidence that Niko started the fire. However, even if Niko and Samantha had submitted to EUOs, it is unclear whether their testimony would have proven that Niko started the fire intentionally. Therefore, this Court finds that questions of fact still preclude summary judgment on this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    At the motion hearing held on the parties' motions, Plaintiffs' attorney conceded that no case law besides\n    <em>\n     Gordon\n    </em>\n    holds that failure to submit to an EUO-if required by the insurance contract-does not preclude recovery.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
