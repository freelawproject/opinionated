PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action involves a long-running dispute between telecommunications carriers over access charges. Plaintiffs All American Telephone Company, Inc., Chase Com, and e-Pinnacle Communications, Inc. are competitive local exchange carriers-in lay terms, local telephone companies-operating in Utah and Nevada. Over a decade ago, Plaintiffs initiated an action against AT &amp; T to collect tariffed access charges. Plaintiffs also asserted claims under the Federal Communications Act of 1934 (the \"Communications Act\") for AT &amp; T's refusal to pay the tariffed rates and for\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   . In essence, Plaintiffs sought to recover unpaid access charges that AT &amp; T allegedly owed them for connecting long distance telephone calls carried by AT &amp; T in its capacity as an interexchange carrier. Unsurprisingly, AT &amp; T has a different perspective, counterclaiming that Plaintiffs violated the Communications Act by acting as \"sham\" carriers created as part of a scheme to artificially generate long distance call volume-and by extension, access charges that AT &amp; T posits it should not be required to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Similar disputes have found their way into federal courts nationwide. And like other judges, this Court saw fit to refer the key issues in this action to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the primary jurisdiction doctrine in recognition of the FCC's specialized expertise and the virtues of uniformity in telecommunications regulation. This action returned to this Court in 2017 following the FCC's issuance of two separate orders on liability and damages and the D.C. Circuit's resolution of an appeal of the FCC's order on damages. AT &amp; T now moves for summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Second Amended Complaint and granting relief on its counterclaims. For the reasons that follow, both of AT &amp; T's motions are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To assist in better understanding Plaintiffs' claims and AT &amp; T's counterclaims, a brief primer on access charges and telecommunications carriers precedes a description of the relevant facts and extensive procedural history of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Regulatory Framework\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The regulatory scheme that governs the fees that a carrier may recover from another carrier has been exhaustively detailed in myriad judicial opinions. This Opinion &amp; Order draws primarily from the Ninth Circuit's 2018 decision in\n   <em>\n    CallerID4u v. MCI Communications Services Inc.\n   </em>\n   and the D.C. Circuit's 2017 decision resolving Plaintiffs' appeal of the FCC's damages order issued pursuant to this Court's primary jurisdiction referral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When a long-distance call is placed, a local exchange carrier that operates in the caller's local service area (or \"telephone exchange area\") routes the call to an \"interexchange carrier\" (or \"IXC\" or \"interstate exchange carrier\").\n   <em>\n    All Am.

When the recipient's local exchange carrier completes the call, the interexchange carrier must pay an access charge to the local exchange carriers for the connection service-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the \"originating\" switched access service provided by the caller's local carrier and the \"terminating\" switched access service provided by the recipient's local carrier.\n   <em>\n    All American III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275204\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/81/#p84\">\n    867 F.3d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The rate that a local exchange carrier may charge for switched access service depends on how the carrier is classified.

Similarly, the discovery that Plaintiffs seek is not facially relevant to AT &amp; T's counterclaims under the Communications Act, which focus on\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs'\n   </em>\n   conduct. Further, Plaintiffs \"fail[ ] to explain with any specificity 'how the facts sought are reasonably expected to create a genuine issue of material fact' \" such that a reasonable jury could find in Plaintiffs' favor either on their state law claims or on AT &amp; T's counterclaims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alphonse Hotel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336662\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/146/#p151\">\n    828 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   152 (citing\n   <em>\n    Paddington Partners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530675\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/34/1132/#p1138\">\n    34 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1138 ).

Circuit that additional discovery could support such a theory.

Following judicial rejection of the FCC's deregulatory efforts as unauthorized by the statutory scheme, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, vesting the FCC with \"authority to forbear from enforcing \u00a7 203's tariff-filing requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    CallerID4u, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266592\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1048/#p1058\">\n    880 F.3d at 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FCC-while not imposing mandatory de-tariffing for CLECs, under which they would be prohibited from filing tariffs-adopted a mandatory de-tariffing policy, under which CLECs were \"subject to the tariff-filing requirement in \u00a7 203 unless they entered into negotiated agreements with IXCs.\"\n   <em>\n    CallerID4u, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266592\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1048/#p1058\">\n    880 F.3d at 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, they were subject to \u00a7 203 and the filed rate doctrine. And once Plaintiffs filed their tariffs, those tariffs provided the only means of compensation for any access services.

The D.C. Circuit's opinion in the\n   <em>\n    Farmers\n   </em>\n   proceedings is not to the contrary. In that case, the D.C.

In short, the fact that a CLEC's access services fall outside a filed tariff does not necessarily bring it outside the FCC's regulatory purview. Rather, CLECs may charge an interexchange carrier for access services\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   through a negotiated contract or a valid filed tariff. If a CLEC wishes to charge a higher rate than the benchmark or for services to non-paying end users, the FCC requires that it do so through a negotiated contract. The Second Circuit explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   The filed rate doctrine is motivated by two 'companion principles'-(1) preventing carriers from engaging in price discrimination as between ratepayers (the 'nondiscrimination strand') and (2) preserving the exclusive role of federal agencies in approving rates for telecommunications services that are 'reasonable' by keeping courts out of the rate-making process (the 'nonjusticiability strand'), a function that the federal regulatory agencies are more competent to perform.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Marcus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"257014\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/138/46/#p58\">\n    138 F.3d at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

As previously discussed, however, this line of reasoning lacks merit because the New York summary judgment standard is wholly inapplicable, the Federal Rules do not categorically bar such a motion, and the discovery requested in Plaintiffs' Rule 56(d) affidavit bears no apparent relation to the merits of AT &amp; T's counterclaims.
