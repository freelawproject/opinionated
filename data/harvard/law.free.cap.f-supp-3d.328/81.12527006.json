(\"Defendant\") pursuant to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"TCPA\"), and New York State common law, alleging that he received hundreds of harassing telephone calls from Defendant's representatives regarding an automobile loan obtained from Defendant. (Dkt. 1 at 3). Plaintiff, diagnosed with stage four cancer, contends that Defendant continuously contacted him by telephone to harass him about his debt, causing great emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5). Plaintiff died during the pendency of these proceedings. (Dkt. 28). As a result, Kathleen J. Majewski (\"Majewski\"), who has been appointed the Administratrix of Plaintiff's Estate, seeks to be substituted as party plaintiff in this action. (Dkt. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before this Court are Defendant's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 26), Plaintiff's motion to substitute (Dkt. 30), Plaintiffs motion for leave to file a supplemental response to Defendant's supplemental memorandum (Dkt. 47;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 40), Plaintiff's motion to seal (Dkt. 48), Plaintiff's motion for leave to cite additional authority (Dkt. 51), and Defendant's motion for leave to file supplemental authority (Dkt. 53). Because Plaintiff's TCPA claim did not abate upon his death, and for the additional reasons discussed below, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied, Plaintiff's motion to substitute is granted, Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a supplemental response is denied, Plaintiff's motion to seal is denied, Plaintiff's motion for leave to cite additional authority is granted, and Defendant's motion for leave to file supplemental authority is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 5, 2013, Plaintiff obtained an automobile loan from Defendant. (Dkt. 26-2 at \u00b6 1; Dkt. 29-1 at \u00b6 1). In October of 2014, Plaintiff was diagnosed with stage four esophageal cancer. (Dkt. 29-9 at 3-4:11-13). Plaintiff began chemotherapy a week after his diagnosis (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:13), and this treatment lasted until about June 2015 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:20). Plaintiff could no longer work while he received treatment, and he primarily relied upon social security disability insurance payments for income. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:14-16). Soon thereafter, Plaintiff fell behind on his loan payments and notified Defendant of his financial circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5:16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in January 2015, Plaintiff was informed that his cancer had spread to his brain, and he began receiving treatment for brain tumors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:21-22). During that same month, Plaintiff called Defendant to negotiate alternative payment terms, and informed Defendant that he had cancer and was undergoing \"chemotherapy and radiation treatment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7:23-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff received telephone calls several days a week regarding his debt. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    at 7:25-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Plaintiff testified that the frequent calls would \"really irritate\" him and made him \"feel even worse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:27). The calls made him \"emotionally stressed\" and caused him to \"cry[ ] more\" and to \"worry[ ] more.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff also testified that Defendant's representatives told him that \"if [he] fell behind, that they'd repossess the car.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:30). Plaintiff used the automobile to go to the \"hospital on a semi-daily, semi-weekly basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June 2015, Plaintiff filed a complaint with the New York State Office of the Attorney General (\"NYSOAG\"), claiming that he had received 24 calls within an 80-minute period on June 19, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:34;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-6 (NYSOAG complaint) ). From that point forward, the calls began to subside, and, on July 23, 2015, Defendant issued a letter to Plaintiff, apologizing for the number of calls that had been made by one of its representatives. (Dkt. 29-9 at 9:34-35;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-7 (Defendant's letter) ). Plaintiff testified that the calls ceased by July 2015. (Dkt. 29-9 at 16:88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing two legal issues. First, Defendant contends that the TCPA claim should be dismissed because it abated upon Plaintiff's death. (Dkt. 26-1 at 2-5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In making this argument, Defendant relies primarily upon the decision in\n   <em>\n    Hannabury v. Hilton Grand Vacations Co., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346666\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/768/\">\n    174 F.Supp.3d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.N.Y. 2016). The\n   <em>\n    Hannabury\n   </em>\n   court held that a consumer's private right-to-action under \u00a7 227(b)(3) and \u00a7 227(c)(5) of the TCPA is \"penal\" in nature, and thus, it extinguishes upon the party's death.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346666\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/768/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346666\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/768/\">\n    at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") claim must be dismissed because Plaintiff was not verbally abused or otherwise threatened by Defendant, and the only harassing conduct alleged consists of the telephone calls themselves. (Dkt. 26-1 at 5-7). In support, Defendant relies heavily upon the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Conboy v. AT &amp; T Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136679\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/242/\">\n    241 F.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2001), which held that \"numerous telephone calls from debt collectors\" did not constitute \"extreme and outrageous\" conduct where the plaintiffs were \"not physically threatened, verbally abused, or publicly humiliated in any manner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136679\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/242/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136679\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/242/\">\n    at 258-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff opposes Defendant's summary judgment motion, arguing that\n   <em>\n    Hannabury\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided, and that this Court should hold that the private right-to-action under the TCPA is primarily remedial in nature. (Dkt. 29 at 5-12). Plaintiff also argues that questions of fact preclude summary judgment on his IIED claim because the instant matter involves many more telephone calls than those observed in\n   <em>\n    Conboy\n   </em>\n   , and the fact that Defendant continued to make these calls after discovering that Plaintiff suffered from terminal cancer raises a question of fact as to whether the conduct was sufficiently \"outrageous.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant subsequently filed a motion seeking leave to file a supplemental memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 40). Defendant argues that the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Reyes v. Lincoln Auto. Fin. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276104\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/51/\">\n    861 F.3d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2017) requires that Plaintiff's TCPA claim be dismissed. (Dkt. 40-2 at 2-4). In\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that \"the TCPA does not permit a party who agrees to be contacted as part of a bargained-for exchange to unilaterally revoke that consent.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276104\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/51/\">\n    861 F.3d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant argues that Plaintiff consented to the receipt of the telephone calls at issue in this case, and that he never appropriately revoked that consent. (Dkt. 40-2 at 3-4). In opposition, Plaintiff argues that this Court should decline to follow\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   because it will likely be reversed\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   by the Second Circuit or be overturned by the Supreme Court. (Dkt. 42 at 2-3). Plaintiff also opposes the application of\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   at this point in the litigation because discovery has not yet concluded, and Plaintiff has not had the opportunity to acquire\n   information necessary to effectively confront this new argument. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental response to Defendant's supplemental memorandum. (Dkt. 47). Plaintiff argues that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to the instant matter because the nature of the credit applications involved in securing his automobile loan, as well as the terms of the retail installment contract, indicate that he did not consent to the calls at issue in this case as part of a bargained-for exchange. (Dkt. 47-1). Defendant opposes the motion for leave to file a supplemental response, arguing that Plaintiff did not raise any of these arguments in his initial opposition papers. (Dkt. 49 at 3-4). In addition, Defendant argues that the credit applications involved in this matter are considered contracts under New York State law and Second Circuit precedent, and that the retail installment contract did not contain an integration clause; thus,\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   remains applicable to this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5). Plaintiff has submitted reply papers opposing the arguments Defendant asserts in its response. (Dkt. 50). Plaintiff has also filed a motion to seal in connection with several documents submitted in support of his motion for leave to file a supplemental response. (Dkt. 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 15, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to cite additional authority, requesting that this Court review the Sixth Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Parchman v. SLM Corporation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517760\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/728/\">\n    896 F.3d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2018) in determining whether his TCPA claim abated upon his death. (Dkt. 51). Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that Plaintiff's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Parchman\n   </em>\n   is inapposite and futile. (Dkt. 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 16, 2018, Defendant filed a motion for leave to file supplemental authority, requesting that the Court consider the decisions in\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Navient Sols., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-CV-564 (RNC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203748155\">\n    2018 WL 3748155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. Aug. 7, 2018) and\n   <em>\n    Few v.

Ala. Aug. 9, 2018) in reviewing Defendant's arguments related to the application of\n   <em>\n    Reyes.\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 53). Plaintiff opposes Defendant's motion, arguing that the cases supplied by Defendant are irrelevant and do not provide any additional bases justifying the application of\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   to the facts of this matter. (Dkt. 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties dispute whether the TCPA claim extinguished upon Plaintiff's death. Defendant's first argument in its motion for summary judgment is that Plaintiff's TCPA cause of action extinguished upon Plaintiff's death, and that this claim should not be permitted to proceed upon the substitution of a new party plaintiff. (Dkt. 26-1 at 2-5). Because the Court cannot rule upon Majewski's motion to substitute in regards to the TCPA claim without also determining Defendant's first argument in its motion for summary judgment, the Court will address Defendant's motion for summary judgment before turning to Plaintiff's motion to substitute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment: The TCPA Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Thus, as did the court in\n   <em>\n    Hannabury\n   </em>\n   , this Court concludes that the second factor in determining whether a TCPA private action is \"penal\" or \"remedial\" weighs in favor of a \"remedial\" determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parchman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517760\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/728/\">\n    896 F.3d at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As to the second factor, recovery under the statute runs to the harmed individual and not the public, suggesting TCPA claims are remedial.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-9 at 7:25-26). In February 2015, Plaintiff began to receive about five to ten calls a day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:31). The telephone calls continued into the subsequent months, and it was only after Plaintiff filed a complaint with the NYSOAG on June 24, 2015, that the number of calls began to decline. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:34). Plaintiff confirmed that he filed his NYSAOG complaint because he had received 24 telephone calls within an 80-minute period on June 19, 2015.

Notably, Defendant's July 23, 2015, letter did not deny that Plaintiff received a multitude of calls on June 19, 2015, but instead, indicated Defendant's \"regret that [Plaintiff] was subjected to multiple calls by a[ ] ... representative.\" (Dkt. 29-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff has also submitted a log of telephone calls, purporting to demonstrate that he received at least 331 calls from Defendant between January 2015 and June 2015.

Although it is undisputed that Defendant's representatives did not threaten, humiliate, or otherwise verbally abuse Plaintiff during these phone calls, Defendant was on notice of Plaintiff's vulnerable condition-stage four esophageal cancer that had metastasized to his brain. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-9 at 6-7, 19:125). Despite Defendant's awareness of Plaintiff's medical condition, Defendant's representatives continued to call Plaintiff with persistent regularity. Plaintiff testified that he was told that if he could not make his payments, he would lose his automobile, which he relied upon to reach his cancer treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:17, 8:30). Plaintiff also testified that he found these calls to be harassing and emotionally disturbing, which only made his struggle with cancer that much more difficult.

As noted above, discovery did not reach a conclusion before Defendant moved for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 23 at 2; Dkt. 37). In contrast, it appears discovery was complete when the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   moved for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276104\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/51/\">\n    861 F.3d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Furthermore, Defendant makes its argument regarding\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   for the first time in a supplemental brief. (Dkt. 40-2).

In other words, before discovery was stayed, Plaintiff did not face the prospect of confronting binding Second Circuit precedent on the consent issue now raised by Defendant. Indeed, at least two district court have noted that the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   \"reflects a potential sea-change in the area of TCPA-litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    McBride v.
