Kiser, SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant Hargrave Military Academy's (\"Hargrave\") Motion for Summary Judgment. Hargrave contends that the charitable immunity doctrine shields it from liability against Plaintiff Miles Agbaje's (\"Plaintiff\") negligence claim. The matter was fully briefed by the parties, and I heard oral argument during a telephonic hearing on July 5, 2018. I have reviewed the pleadings, evidence of the parties, and arguments, and the matter is now ripe for disposition. For the reasons stated herein, I find that Hargrave was organized and does operate with a charitable purpose, and that Plaintiff was a beneficiary of Hargrave's charity at the time of his injury. Accordingly, Hargrave is entitled to the immunity afforded by the charitable immunity doctrine, and its motion for summary judgment will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hargrave is a military boarding school located in Chatham, Va. In December of\n   2013, Plaintiff, a Maryland resident, was a student at Hargrave and was a member of Hargrave's junior varsity basketball team. During practice on December 4, 2013, Coach Tom Messenger required Plaintiff to run a drill which required him to drive to the basket while Messenger stood in his path with a pad to simulate a defender. While driving past Messenger, Messenger hit Plaintiff with the pad and caused him to fall. Plaintiff injured his knee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Coach Walker took Plaintiff to the hospital, and he was diagnosed with a knee sprain. He was told to avoid military formations, drills, and basketball, and was further instructed to rest and ice his knee. Plaintiff left the hospital on crutches. During his recovery, Robert Spears,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a Teacher and Counselor (\"TAC\") Officer with duties that included overseeing barracks life and enforcing Hargrave's rules and policies, required Plaintiff to march and perform drills. As part of the drills, Plaintiff was required to crawl and bend his knee and carry a heavy rifle. Despite his complaints and swelling leg, Spears required Plaintiff to complete the drills as instructed. When Plaintiff complained that the drills were aggravating his knee injury, Hargrave's staff did not return Plaintiff to the hospital for follow-up care. Rather, he was seen and treated by Hargrave's team trainer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's parents picked him up for break on December 20, approximately two weeks after his injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon his return to Maryland, he was seen by an orthopedic surgeon on December 26 and diagnosed with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (\"ACL\"). Plaintiff underwent surgery on his knee on January 17, 2014, and followed up with post-operative care for approximately one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed suit in this Court on August 11, 2017, asserting a single count of negligence against Hargrave. He is ostensibly proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 23, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint [ECF No. 26], seeking to add a claim for gross negligence. That same day, Hargrave filed the present Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 28], arguing that the doctrine of charitable immunity applies and bars Plaintiff's action for simple negligence. On May 31, Plaintiff filed a Supplemental Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint [ECF No. 34], which sought to add both a claim of gross negligence and a claim of negligent hiring/retention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   I held a telephonic hearing on the Motions for Leave on June 16; Plaintiff did not participate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later that day, I entered an Order denying the Motions for Leave to File an Amended Complaint [ECF No. 48.] At that time, I stated that a \"Memorandum Opinion setting forth the basis for this decision will be forthcoming.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As to Hargrave's Motion for Summary Judgment, the matter was fully briefed by the parties and I heard oral argument on\n   the Motion by telephone on July 5, 2018. I have fully reviewed the briefs, argument, and evidence of the parties, and this Opinion sets for the reasoning for my decisions on both the Motions for Leave to Amend and the Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff, who is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , is entitled to a certain level of deference in his pleadings by virtue of his status as an unrepresented litigant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erickson v.

While the allegation of gross negligence does not change the nature of the case, the allegation regarding negligent retention of Spears does. A case of negligence concerns Hargrave's actions in responding to Plaintiff's injuries; a case of negligent retention focuses on Spears's employment history and Hargrave's decisions in dealing with him. The former focuses on Plaintiff, while the latter has nothing to do with him. Drastically expanding the focus at this late date is undoubtedly prejudicial to Hargrave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hargrave accurately paints a portrait of a Plaintiff who was disinterested in his own case until the last minute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. pgs. 2-4, June 1, 2018 [ECF No. 41].) He has failed to engage in meaningful discovery, and failed to coordinate with opposing counsel to schedule his own deposition. He routinely claims that mail was not sent to him, a claim he has made against the court clerk as well. Although he is\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , there is ample evidence to suggest that his father, an attorney, has been aiding Plaintiff throughout these proceedings. Plaintiff's failure to plan and pursue his case compounds the prejudice to Hargrave of a last-minute amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff's amendment is also sought in an effort to avoid summary judgment. As discussed more fully\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the doctrine of charitable immunity generally bars simple negligence actions in Virginia against a charity brought by a beneficiary of that charity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ola v. YMCA of S.

On the same day that Hargrave filed its Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff filed his first proposed amended complaint. Even though he is\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , the issue of charitable immunity was first raised in Hargrave's Answer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer, Aff. Defs. \u00b6 4, Oct. 27, 2017 [ECF No. 7].) Despite knowing\n   <em>\n    over six months ago\n   </em>\n   that charitable immunity was an issue in this case, Plaintiff waited until the eve of the close of discovery to propose a cause of action that was not barred by the charitable immunity doctrine. His last-minute claims, filed on the same day as Hargrave's Motion for Summary Judgment, were clearly an effort to salvage his case and avoid summary judgment.

First, he contends that Hargrave negligently retained Spears after learning of his \"abusive\" conduct towards students. Hargrave counters that there is no negligent retention claim before the Court. That is accurate, but Plaintiff's argument is still a valid one. A charity is only entitled to immunity if it exercised due care in the hiring and retention of its agents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey v. Lancaster Ruritan Rec. Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697439\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/221/\">\n    256 Va. 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20S.E.2d%20621\">\n    504 S.E.2d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 622 (1998) ;\n   <em>\n    Straley v.

Therefore, if Hargrave did not exercise due care in the retention of Spears, the charitable immunity doctrine will not shield Hargrave from liability, regardless of whether a separate negligent retention claim has been made against them under Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff has failed to offer sufficient evidence to show that Hargrave did not exercise due care in retaining Spears. Plaintiff proffers that, on four occasions prior to Plaintiff's injury, Spears made inappropriate comments to a student. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. pgs. 3-4, May 31, 2018 [ECF No. 36].) In September 2009, a cadet \"claimed Spears made an inappropriate comment. Spears received a counseling letter.\" In June 2011, a cadet \"claimed that Spears made [the cadet] feel 'talked down to'. Spears received a verbal counseling.\" In September of 2011, a cadet \"claimed Spears engaged in a verbal altercation with [the cadet]. Spears received a written warning and a 2-day suspension without pay that was suspended for a 45-day probationary period.\" And in the summer of 2012, \"A cadet claimed Spears made an inappropriate comment to the cadet. Spears received a Letter of Reprimand and [was] placed on probation for the remainder of the Contract year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Def.'s Responses to Interrogatories).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This evidence in insufficient to show a lack of due care in Spears's retention. First, and most fundamentally, Plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence about the facts of these encounters so that a determination can be made as to the appropriateness of Hargrave's responses. For certain infractions, a counseling letter would be an appropriate response from an employer and establish the requisite due care. For others, a counseling letter would be woefully insufficient. As to Spears's employment record, I am left to guess. The negative consequences of a lack of evidence have to be borne by Plaintiff, regardless of his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knowles v. S. C.D.C.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:09-1921-MBS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202990157\">\n    2010 WL 2990157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D.S.C. July 29, 2010) (noting\n   that the leniency afforded pro se parties \"does not mean that the court ... can assume the existence of a genuine issue of material fact where none exists\"). In the absence of evidence to show that Hargrave did not exercise due care in counseling and reprimanding Spears, Plaintiff's argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, nothing in Spears's background involved conduct sufficient to put Hargrave on notice that Spears could commit the type of harm alleged by Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   At its core, Plaintiff argues that Spears apparently minor infractions in the past show that Hargrave was negligent in retaining him. That argument is simply not supportable on the Record before me. Absent\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   showing that the infractions in the past were in any way related to the alleged misconduct here, I cannot conclude that Hargrave did not exercise due care in retaining Spears sufficient to strip it of the protections of charitable immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff's second argument is that, because Spears was negligent in his dealings with him, and because negligence is not part of Hargrave's charitable purpose, Hargrave was not acting in accordance with its charitable purpose, and thus is not entitled to immunity. This argument is nonsensical, as it would eviscerate the policy Virginia has chosen to adopt. If negligence, by itself, is sufficient to lift the charitable immunity bar\n   <em>\n    against claims of negligence\n   </em>\n   , the immunity would cease to exist. Spears's actions, even assuming they were negligent, are insufficient to show that Hargrave does not act in accordance with its charitable purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because Plaintiff is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   I will consider other evidence in the record that bears on whether Hargrave was acting in accordance with its charitable purpose.

As a student of Hargrave, Plaintiff was unquestionably a beneficiary of Hargrave's charitable purpose. In fact, the students of Hargrave are far and away its primary beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff counters that, because he paid full tuition, he was not a beneficiary. Even granting Plaintiff's contention that he did not receive any scholarship from Hargrave, payment of tuition does not prevent Plaintiff from being considered a beneficiary of Hargrave. The Fourth Circuit stated the issue this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   And it is equally clear both that the eleemosynary or charitable nature of an educational institution is not destroyed by the fact that it makes a charge for tuition, and that the payment of tuition by its students does not prevent their being considered beneficiaries of the charity.... In a very direct and practical sense, therefore, not only are such institutions engaged in a work of charity, but the pay[ing] student as well as others is a beneficiary thereof. And, apart from the fact that what such a student pays does not equal the cost of his education, he is a beneficiary of the charity for the reason that but for the charitable gifts made to the institution and the charitable work which it is carrying on, it would not exist to serve him. These principles are settled by the overwhelming weight of authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Ettlinger v.

Plaintiff refers to him occasionally as \"Robert\" and occasionally as \"William.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Plaintiff testified that he was on crutches for only half that time, despite his claim that his knee was worsening.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    n.8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    He also stated, in the Second Amended Complaint, that he was asserting a claim for \"premises liability,\" but no such count was included in his pleading.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    During a status conference on May 29, 2018, the parties agreed to the June 19 hearing date on Plaintiff's Motion for Leave. On June 15, Plaintiff alerted the Court that he would not be able to attend the hearing and that he waived oral argument on his motion. [ECF No. 46.] Hargrave did not consent to submitting the motion on brief (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pretrial Order \u00b6 5, Oct. 27, 2017 [ECF No. 9] ), so I held the hearing in Plaintiff's absence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Although I make this decision without regard to the arguments for and against summary judgment, I note that Plaintiff has failed to show that necessary evidence regarding Spears's past conduct has been obtained during discovery. Had the necessary information been obtained, the prejudice to Hargrave of the late amendment may have been abated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Plaintiff calls it \"wanton\" \"physical abuse\" and \"cruel punishment.\" His characterizations are not evidence, buy that also are far afield from \"talking down to\" a cadet.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Hargrave disputes this, and I have my own suspicions. Plaintiff's pleadings appear to have been crafted by or with the assistance of any attorney-most likely Plaintiff's father. As a result, Hargrave insists that Plaintiff is not entitled to the leniency typically afforded\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    parties.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Erickson v.

I see no reason to go that far, as Hargrave is entitled to summary judgment despite any leniency I am empowered to give Plaintiff at this stage. No leniency from this court can erase the legal and evidentiary shortcomings of his case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
