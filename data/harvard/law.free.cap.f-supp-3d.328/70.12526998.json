Comunale (\"Plaintiff\") filed this action in New York State Supreme Court on October 13, 2017, alleging damages resulting from the \"willful[ ] and reckless[ ]\" conduct of Defendants Home Depot, U.S.A., Inc. (\"Home Depot\") and Citibank, N.A. (\"Citibank\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (Dkt. 1-2). Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants disregarded evidence of fraudulent credit activity in his name, and have continued to demand payment for expenses accrued without his consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6). As a result, Plaintiff claims that he has \"suffered economic loss\" and that his \"credit has been damaged.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). On January 22, 2018, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), Defendants removed the action to this Court based upon diversity jurisdiction. (Dkt. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. 4). For the following reasons, Defendants' motion is granted, and Plaintiff's complaint is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about June 16, 2013, one or more persons applied for a credit account in Plaintiff's name at Home Depot without Plaintiff's knowledge or consent. (Dkt. 1-2 at \u00b6 4). Citibank services Home Depot's credit accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3). The unidentified individual or individuals used Plaintiff's Social Security Number and other personal information to establish the credit account in Plaintiff's name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, the unidentified party or parties also charged various items to the account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). Someone other than Plaintiff made installment payments to this account for about a year, at which time all such payments ceased. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sometime within or about the month of September 2014, Plaintiff's former wife showed Plaintiff a statement for the above account, which indicated that a balance of $6,541.25 was due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8). Plaintiff then contacted \"one or both\" Defendants to notify them that he had no knowledge of this account, that it was fraudulently established, and that the charges were incurred without his consent or knowledge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). Since September 2014, Plaintiff has provided additional information to \"one or both\" Defendants, allegedly demonstrating that the account was not established by him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). Plaintiff has also complied with all information requests solicited by either Home Depot or Citibank regarding a fraud investigation related to this credit account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nevertheless, \"one or both\" Defendants have repeatedly told Plaintiff that he owes\n   the entire balance due on the account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). Plaintiff alleges that in doing so, \"one or both Defendants have willfully and recklessly disregarded the evidence of fraud provided to Defendants by Plaintiff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Plaintiff further alleges that, since September 2014, \"one or both\" Defendants have repeatedly reported Plaintiff as delinquent to multiple credit reporting agencies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). Even after Plaintiff \"advised credit reporting agencies that the account had been fraudulently established in his name and that he was not responsible for any portion of the account,\" Defendants informed \"credit report agencies that in fact the account was Plaintiff's obligation,\" even though \"they knew or should have known that it was not.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). Defendants have also continued to request that Plaintiff pay the deficiencies on the account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that his credit has been damaged, and that he has suffered economic loss as a result of Defendants' actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Plaintiff claims that because Defendants have provisioned erroneous information to the credit reporting agencies, he has been unable to secure any credit, which has cost him various business opportunities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 26, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. 4). Plaintiff opposed Defendants' motion. (Dkt. 10). Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to specify a \"cognizable theory of liability,\" and therefore, he does not satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. 4-4 at 7-8);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). Defendants also assert that even if Plaintiff properly articulated common law claims against them, such claims are preempted by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FCRA\"). (Dkt. 4-4 at 9-10). Finally, Defendants argue that any credit reporting claims Plaintiff might have are time-barred by the FCRA's two-year statute of limitations. (Dkt. 4-4 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 10, 2018, the Court heard argument on Defendants' motion to dismiss. The Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raised the issue of its subject matter jurisdiction by informing the parties of an error in the notice of removal. The Court permitted Defendants to file supplemental papers to cure the defect. The Court otherwise reserved decision on Defendants' motion. On July 16, 2018, Defendants submitted a declaration in further support of their motion.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). Home Depot, on the other hand, is a corporation.
