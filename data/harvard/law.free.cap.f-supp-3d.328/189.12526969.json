(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On August 3, 2015, OneWest Bank N.A. changed its name to CIT Bank, N.A.-Plaintiff's current name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 17, 2017, Defendant obtained a mortgage loan from IndyMac Bank, F.S.B., a federally chartered savings bank, in the original principal amount of $468,000.00, as memorialized in a note executed by Defendant (the \"Note\"), (Aff. of Rebecca Marks in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Marks Aff.\") Ex. A (\"Note\") (Dkt.

B (\"Mortgage\") ). (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) On March 19, 2009, Plaintiff, as OneWest Bank, FSB, acquired substantially all assets and mortgage servicing rights of IndyMac Federal from the Federal Deposit\n   Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), including the Loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Specifically, substantially all of the assets of IndyMac Federal were transferred to Plaintiff pursuant to a Master Purchase Agreement, under which the FDIC, as its receiver, entered into a Loan Sale Agreement with Plaintiff that included Defendant's Loan. (Marks Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891957\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/584/412/#p418\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Exs.

(Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 5.) IndyMac indorsed the Note in blank. (Marks Aff. \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891957\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/584/412/#p418\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Additionally, two Allonges were affixed to the Note: (1) one by the FDIC \"as Receiver for IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB, successor to IndyMac Bank, F.S.B.,\" indorsing the Note specifically to OneWest Bank, FSB, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 7); and (2) one by OneWest Bank, FSB in blank, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). Plaintiff, through its counsel, obtained physical possession of the original indorsed Note beginning on January 13, 2017, and currently still holds the Note. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 1, 2013, certain terms of the Loan were modified pursuant to a Modification Agreement. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 7 (citing Marks Aff. Ex. F (\"Modification\") ).) Specifically, past due arrears were capitalized to create a new principal balance of $475,696.69, and the interest rate was reduced for different time periods through the new maturity date of July 1, 2053. (Modification 2-3.) However, Defendant defaulted on the Loan by failing to timely make the payment due June 1, 2016 and all payments due thereafter. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 8.) On August 11, 2016, Plaintiff mailed 90-day notices as required by New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law \u00a7 1304 to Defendant and Nwokocha at the Property, by certified mail and first class mail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Plaintiff filed proof of these mailings with the New York State Department of Financial Services on August 15, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) On August 12, 2016, pursuant to paragraphs 15 and 22 of the Mortgage, Plaintiff, through its servicing division, mailed notice of default dated August 10, 2016 to Defendant and Nwokocha at the Property by first class mail and certified mail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) However, Defendant failed to cure the default. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff therefore invoked its right to accelerate the Mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As of the date the Complaint was filed, an unpaid principal balance of $454,483.46, plus interest and fees, remained due and owing to Plaintiff on the Loan.

Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff filed the Complaint on February 6, 2017. (Compl.) After service was attempted three times, Defendant was served on March 4, 2017 by affixing a copy of the Complaint on the door of the Premises. (Dkt. No. 10.) On May 11, 2017, Defendant's counsel filed a notice of appearance on her behalf. (Dkt. No. 16.) Defendant filed an Answer, including her affirmative defenses and counterclaims, on May 25, 2017. (Answer.) Defendant also filed a Rule 26 disclosure on August 31, 2017. (Dkt. No. 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court held an initial conference on September 12, 2017 and adopted a case management and scheduling order. (Dkt. No. 28; Dkt. (entry for Sept. 12, 2017).) However, neither Party served any discovery requests; indeed, both Parties indicated they did not intend to conduct any discovery in this Action during a telephone status conference with Magistrate Judge Davison on November 3, 2017. (Dkt. No. 31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 33.) Therefore, on November 27, 2017, Plaintiff filed a pre-motion letter indicating the grounds on which it would move for summary judgment. (Letter from Courtney Colligan, Esq. to Court (Nov. 27, 2017) (Dkt. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   33).) Defendant filed a letter indicating she \"ha[d] no objection\" to Plaintiff's request for a pre-motion conference. (Letter from Allen A. Kolber, Esq. to Court (Dec. 11, 2017) (Dkt. No. 35).) The Court then set a briefing schedule. (Dkt. No. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff filed the instant Motion and accompanying papers on January 11, 2018.

Defendant filed a letter requesting an adjournment of the conference scheduled before the Court on January 31, 2018, (Letter from Allen A. Kolber, Esq. to Court (Jan. 24, 2018) (Dkt. No. 44) ), which the Court granted \"until the summary judgment motion is decided,\" (Dkt. No. 45).

Nor could she, in light of the undisputed evidence that Defendant is and remains the title holder to the Property and that Plaintiff has made no payments under the Loan since before June 1, 2016. (Marks Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 15, 20-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    b. Deceptive Practices Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant's third counterclaim is that Plaintiff violated the Deceptive Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Bus.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , by \"misrepresenting and omitting material facts.\" (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 18-23.) Specifically, Defendant alleges that Plaintiff did this by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   a. Misrepresenting to Defendant the nature of the documents [she] w[as] signing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   b. Failing to provide Defendant with a copy of any contract, bond, note or mortgage;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   c. Failing to provide Defendant with the requisite notices of cancellation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   d. Misrepresenting to Defendant that fees payable from the proceeds of the mortgage were bona fide and reasonable and necessary for the extension of credit; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   e. Failing to disclose to Defendant that the mortgage is negatively amortizing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Plaintiff argues that this claim is time-barred and is insufficiently pled. (Pl.'s Mem. 16-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The statute of limitations for Defendant's \u00a7 349 claim \"is three years from the date of accrual, which occurs when [Defendant] is injured by the deceptive act or practice that violated the statute, and is not dependent upon any date when discovery of the alleged deceptive practice is said to occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Med.

Nov. 25, 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendant argues that the alleged misrepresentations and omissions occurred at the time of the Loan origination, in July 2007. (Pl.'s Mem. 17.) While this is likely correct, Defendant's Answer provides no dates or specific details permitting the Court to infer that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the alleged acts occurred at the time the Note and Mortgage were signed. However, any \u00a7 349 claims based on actions more than three years from the date of the Answer, May 25, 2017, are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Even assuming some of Defendant's \u00a7 349 claims are not time-barred, they are inadequately pled. Section 349 provides a private right of action to \"any person who has been injured by reason of violation of\" the Act-that is, from \"[d]eceptive acts and practices.\" \u00a7 349(a), (h). However, the law \"requires, as a prerequisite to liability, that [Defendant] establish injury to the public generally as distinguished from injury to [Defendant] alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Tinlee Enterprises, Inc. v.
