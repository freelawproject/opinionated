U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. This order addresses the States' request for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Defendants in this matter are the United States, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") Kirstjen M. Nielsen, Commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") Kevin K. McAleenan, Deputy Director of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (\"ICE\") Thomas D. Homan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") L. Francis Cissna, and Chief of the United States Border Patrol Carla L. Provost.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the case was filed but before any substantive activity had taken place, twenty-two DACA recipients\n   intervened as Defendants. The State of New Jersey also requested and received permission to intervene as a Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, numerous other groups and entities have asked for and received this Court's permission to act as amicus curiae.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Plaintiff States have asked this Court to preliminarily enjoin the Government from issuing or renewing any DACA permits in the future. If this relief is granted, and ultimately if this relief becomes permanent, it could have the effect of terminating the DACA program-a result the Defendant-Intervenors vehemently oppose. The Plaintiff States also request a declaratory judgment that DACA is contrary to the standards of the APA, as well as the Take Care Clause of the United States Constitution, findings which, if upheld, would also require the termination of the DACA program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. What Is and Is Not Before the Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court is not faced with questions about a duly enacted statute or a duly enacted federal regulation or even an order by the President. DACA was a program instituted pursuant to the orders of then-Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano. Those instructions were set forth in a memorandum dated June 15, 2012, and remained in force without amendment until 2014 when her successor, Secretary Jeh Johnson, attempted to create a sister program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (\"DAPA\"). At that time, Secretary Johnson also attempted to put into place certain expansions of the DACA program (\"Expanded DACA\"). Both the implementation of the DAPA program and Expanded DACA were enjoined by this Court in 2015.\n   <em>\n    Texas v.

Texas\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598061\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2271/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598061\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2271/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (this litigation will be referred to as\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon remand, the parties asked this Court to postpone entering a scheduling order that would have otherwise governed the proceedings to a final conclusion on the merits. Throughout this time, the original 2012 DACA memorandum remained in force. Ultimately, the parties all agreed to dismiss the case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs' Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 15, 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a memorandum entitled\n   <em>\n    Rescission of November 20, 2014 Memorandum Providing for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (\"DAPA\").\n   </em>\n   On September 5, 2017, the Department released a memorandum entitled\n   <em>\n    Rescission of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children.\" Given these memoranda rescinding the DAPA program and phasing out the DACA and Expanded DACA programs, Plaintiffs file this stipulation of voluntary dismissal. See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) (allowing plaintiffs to dismiss an action, without court order, by filing a stipulation of dismissal by all parties who have appeared).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , [Doc No. 473] (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This stipulation of dismissal was signed by the attorneys for the plaintiffs (a group that included all of the Plaintiff States in\n   this case), the United States and the federal government defendants, and the putative DAPA recipients who had intervened. As is evident from its text, the stipulation was clearly based in part upon the Government \"phasing out the DACA and Expanded DACA programs.\" It is also clear that all parties agreed to the stipulation, which otherwise would have required court action. As per its very language, the stipulation was based upon Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), which requires the dismissal to be signed by counsel for all parties who have appeared in order to be effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While this Court has no way of knowing the decision-making process exercised by the parties in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , it seems that at least the Plaintiff States here seek the same result they thought they had achieved with the stipulation of dismissal. The Government has attempted to phase out DACA, as it represented to the Plaintiff States it would, but it is prevented from doing so by various orders of other courts around the nation that have enjoined or vacated the attempt to end the program. The Government is thus thrust into the position of a somewhat reluctant warrior- having to defend a program (in order to comply with court orders) that it had agreed to phase out in order to rid itself of the 2014 lawsuit that was pending in this Court. As stated earlier, the Defendant-Intervenors are DACA recipients who wish to prevent the abolition of this program and who have been joined in this effort by the State of New Jersey. They are clearly not reluctant warriors and are squarely pitted against the propositions argued by the Plaintiff States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. What Issues Are Before the Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thus, this Court is faced with only three primary issues involving the DACA program in the context of a request for a preliminary injunction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1) Did the creation of DACA, and its continued operation, violate the Take Care Clause of the Constitution?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2) Does the DACA program violate the substantive standards of the APA?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   3) Did the manner in which DACA was created violate the procedural requirements of the APA?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While these three primary issues have many elements and ancillary questions that will be addressed, the parties have raised many extraneous issues with their arguments, evidence, and pleadings that will not be discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. What Issues Are Not Before the Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Consequently, all other issues, including the following, are not before the Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   1) This Court is not commenting on or deciding the popularity of or the relative wisdom of Secretary Napolitano's decision to implement the DACA program or the DHS's decision to phase out the DACA program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   2) This order does not and should not be read to suggest or require the DHS or the Department of Justice to prosecute or initiate immigration or deportation proceedings against any individual or group of individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   3) This Court is not deciding whether the DACA recipients are ultimately beneficial or detrimental to the well-being of the States, nor is it deciding if they ultimately benefit or burden the States' economies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   4) This opinion does not address, nor should be read as a comment upon, the relative merits of immigration, legal or otherwise, except insofar as it must to decide whether the DACA program itself (and the manner in which it was instituted) is legal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   5) The DACA program was not created as an asylum program, and nothing\n   herein should be read as affecting the rules and laws governing asylum. While there seem to be differences of opinion as to what constitutes an \"amnesty\" program, nothing herein should be read as favoring or disfavoring the concept of asylum or amnesty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   6) The Court is not called upon to, nor will it, create or substitute its own notion of an immigration policy, as Courts are not the vehicles to enact the legislative policies that control immigration. That is the sole province of Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   7) This Court cannot and will not weigh or critique the attributes and qualities of any of the individual DACA recipients, including the Defendant-Intervenors herein. For purposes of this order concerning injunctive relief, the Court accepts as true the testimony and affidavits of the individual Defendant-Intervenors, assumes they are individuals of sound character, and relies\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   on the representations made by their counsel as to each one being a person of good repute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   8) Since the DACA program is one of non-enforcement of the laws enacted by Congress and since it is one allegedly predicated on the Executive Branch's historical right to exercise prosecutorial discretion, this Court may necessarily need to discuss certain aspects of law enforcement. Nevertheless, nothing herein should be interpreted as representing this Court's opinion either in favor of, or in opposition to, the means or methods of law enforcement being utilized by this or any prior administration. Further, nothing in this opinion should be read as ordering law-enforcement officials how to prioritize objectives, deploy individuals, or marshal their resources. It is not within this or any other court's purview to dictate to the Executive Branch what means or methods it should use to enforce the law-as long as the means and methods are legal and the Executive Branch is actually enforcing the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For many years, Congress has considered granting legal status to the so-called \"Dreamers\" (typically defined as aliens who came to or were brought to the United States as children). Nevertheless, for whatever reason, Congress has failed or refused to pass any such legislation. In June of 2012, the DHS adopted such a program by means of a memorandum issued by then-Secretary Janet Napolitano. Memorandum from Janet Napolitano,\n   <em>\n    Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals who Came to the United States as Children\n   </em>\n   (June 15, 2012) [Doc. No. 5, Ex. 1]. An illegal alien\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   applicant can qualify for the DACA program if he or she:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 came to the United States under the age of sixteen;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 has continuously resided in the United States for at least five years preceding [June 15, 2012] and is present in the United States on [June 15, 2012];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 is currently in school, has graduated from high school, has obtained a general education development certificate, or is an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, multiple misdemeanor offenses, or otherwise poses a threat to national security or public safety; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 is not above the age of thirty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553859\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/497/#p516\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead of just using its power of prosecutorial discretion not to enforce the national immigration laws as to these qualifying individuals, the DHS, as an integral part of the DACA program, went further and conferred \"lawful presence\" on them. Not only does DACA effectively exempt its recipients from prosecution and placement into immigration proceedings for a renewable two-year period, but it also makes the recipients eligible for numerous federal and state benefits, despite the INA's general rule that unlawfully present aliens are \"not eligible for any Federal public benefit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201611\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). For example, unlawfully present aliens would normally be barred from receiving Social Security retirement benefits, Social Security disability benefits, and health insurance under Part A of the Medicare program because these are federal public benefits. DACA, however, by making its recipients lawfully present, removes an otherwise insurmountable roadblock to their receipt of Social Security, Medicare, and other benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1611 (b)(2)-(4) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 148-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Additionally, DACA not only allows, but requires its recipients to apply for work authorization.

The Napolitano memorandum, however, specifically concluded by stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Over the years, more than 800,000 individuals have applied for and received \"lawful presence\" via DACA which, despite the Secretary's statement, is a form of status, as it prevents one from being put into removal proceedings and qualifies an individual for a variety of benefits or privileges under state and federal law. This status and its exact parameters have led to confusion even at the highest levels. For example, during the appeal of\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , the following exchange took place during the Supreme Court argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Chief Justice John Roberts: Lawfully present does not mean you're legally present?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Solicitor General Verrilli: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Justice Samuel Alito: How can you - how can it be lawful to work here but not lawful to be here?\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The DACA program started with approximately 152,431 approvals in 2012, 427,616 in 2013, and 238,899 in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In late November of 2014, then-Secretary of DHS, Jeh Johnson, attempted to expand the DACA program and implement a new lawful presence program entitled Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents or DAPA. Projections varied about the size of the population that would have been eligible under these proposed amendments, but most projections for Expanded DACA and the DAPA program estimated they would give an additional 4.3 million individuals lawful presence. Thus, the possible population of illegal aliens with lawful presence due to DACA, Expanded DACA, and DAPA would have been raised to just under 6 million (or more than 50% of the estimated 11.3 million illegal aliens in the country).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Twenty-six states, including all of the Plaintiff States in this case, filed the\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   lawsuit to stop the implementation of the DAPA program and the expansion of the DACA program. In\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , all parties agreed that DAPA would be run like DACA and that the Court could assume as much for purposes of considering the request for an injunction. After extensive briefing and a full hearing, this Court entered a preliminary injunction based upon the likelihood that the DAPA and Expanded DACA programs should have, at the very least, undergone the notice-and-comment procedures required by the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After the order issued, the Government explained all of its known law-enforcement objectives that to its mind undergirded the creation of the two deferred action programs. In a later hearing, this Court pointed out that the injunction did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   enjoin any of those functions. The injunction only prohibited the DHS from giving lawful status (and many other benefits) to millions whom Congress had categorized as illegal. The DHS then explained that the reason they wanted to award lawful presence was not to support any direct law-enforcement goal, but was instead to incentivize aliens to participate in the program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   After this Court ruled, the Government chose to appeal in lieu of beginning the notice-and-comment procedures. The Fifth Circuit affirmed this Court's ruling regarding DAPA and Expanded DACA and the procedural APA violation, but it went further and ruled that the programs also violated the substantive requirements of the APA. It stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The interpretation of those provisions that the Secretary advances would allow\n   him to grant lawful presence and work authorization to any illegal alien in the United States-an untenable position in light of the INA's intricate system of immigration classifications and employment eligibility. Even with \"special deference\" to the Secretary, the INA flatly does not permit the reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully present and thereby make them newly eligible for a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, if deferred action meant only nonprosecution, it would not necessarily result in lawful presence. Although prosecutorial discretion is broad, it is not 'unfettered.' Declining to prosecute does not transform presence deemed unlawful by Congress into lawful presence and confer eligibility for otherwise unavailable benefits based on that change. Regardless of whether the Secretary has the authority to offer lawful presence and employment authorization in exchange for participation in DAPA, his doing so is not shielded from judicial review as an act of prosecutorial discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   In summary, the states have established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their procedural claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Supreme Court not only undertook to review\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   on both APA grounds, but actually entered an order expanding the appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. In addition to the questions presented by the petition, the parties are directed to brief and argue the following question: \"Whether the Guidance violates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, Art. II \u00a7 3.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Ultimately, after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, which left the Supreme Court with only eight justices, the Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit with a one-sentence opinion, indicating that the eight remaining justices were deadlocked and that the judgment was affirmed by an equally divided Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   was returned to this Court for a trial on the merits but was ultimately dismissed with all parties signing the stipulation quoted above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As is evident, the Plaintiff States in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   dismissed that case with the understanding that DACA was to be dissolved. The Government's attempt to phase out the program has been blocked by two injunctions from district courts in California and New York. Those injunctions only applied to people already enrolled in the DACA program. In late April, however, a District of Columbia district court indicated that it intended to block the DHS's attempts to rescind any aspect of DACA, which would effectively require the Government to accept even new DACA applications.

The Other Recent DACA Decisions Do Not Suggest That This Court Should Refrain From Ruling.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Defendant-Intervenors moved for dismissal or alternatively asked this Court to defer ruling in this case based upon other ongoing cases that deal with the decision of the DHS to phase out DACA. Their primary argument was that those\n   courts were the first to address the program and that this Court should therefore defer to their rulings as a matter of comity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This Court denied the request for several reasons. First, this Court need not defer to the rulings in the four cases discussed below because those decisions involve the legality of the DACA rescission memorandum-an issue this Court does not address. Second, the argument's primary premise is incorrect. This Court was the first to address these issues-well before any of the courts in question. This can be seen quite clearly when one reviews the transcript of one of the very first hearings of the earliest case in question,\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal v. Trump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272941\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/279/401/\">\n    279 F.Supp.3d 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. 2018). As the following exchange indicates, the main thrust of the September 22, 2016 hearing was based upon this Court's injunction in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court: ...

Someone will take it up to the Second Circuit and guess what?\n   <em>\n    There might be a circuit split or the circuit will say they agree with the Fifth Circuit or we should give full faith and credit and comity, whatever you want to call it, to the actions of the Fifth Circuit in order to avoid placing the government in an untenable position.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   By that time there will be a new president and there will be a new Congress and it may be an issue in the political branches and we may not have anything to do here.

Maybe I can't, and we're going to find out if I should. That's all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   So I understand your problem.

First, it illustrates the point that those cases involved some of the same issues as those involved in\n   <em>\n    Texas I.\n   </em>\n   The first plaintiff in the first case was seeking an order to avoid this Court's injunction. Second, it illustrates that neither comity nor a nationwide injunction prevents a district court from hearing a case. Third, to a casual reader, the New York court's comments may seem off-hand, as the judge\n   was just getting into the case; however, the point the judge was making concerning circuit splits has gained more and more interest among commentators and courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Justice Clarence Thomas recently questioned the advisability of a district court entering a nationwide injunction.\n   <em>\n    Trump v.

This Court agrees with the overall tenor of both Justice Thomas's concurrence and Mr. Riley's thoughtful opinion piece. Moreover, several recent law review articles have addressed the pros and cons of nationwide injunctions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Samuel Bray,\n   <em>\n    Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20417\">\n    131 Harv.

L. Rev. 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Some of these authors have suggested that some of the advantages of nationwide injunctions are uniformity, judicial efficiency, and the ability of a court to award complete relief. They have also suggested that some of the disadvantages include a premature freezing of the law, the weakening of the certiorari process by preventing circuit splits, territorial clashes between courts, plaintiffs filing cases until they find a court that will rule in their favor, and forum shopping. Each of these reasons for and against such an injunction is not without some degree of merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Most of those same authors have suggested a variety of remedies such as: limiting relief to the physical limits of the court's jurisdiction, limiting relief to highly significant questions, limiting relief to issues involving questions of general applicability, limiting relief to the circuit in which each court sits, and giving the narrowest relief possible. All of these proposed solutions merit consideration as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The problem that a district court encounters is how to craft an order that gives the appropriate relief to the prevailing party, but also makes sense in an immigration context. Interestingly, after noting the recent concern over nationwide injunctions, the New York court eventually entered one. The court encountered some of the same problematic and practical factors this Court faced in\n   <em>\n    Texas I.\n   </em>\n   It wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Nevertheless, the court finds that a nationwide injunction is warranted in these cases. First, it is hard to conceive of how the court would craft a narrower injunction that would adequately protect Plaintiffs' interests. Plaintiffs include not only several individuals and a nonprofit organization, but also sixteen states and the District of Columbia. To protect the State Plaintiffs' interests, the court would presumably need to enjoin Defendants from rescinding the DACA program with respect to the State Plaintiffs' residents and employees, including the employees of any instrumentalities of the state, such as public hospitals, schools, and universities. Such an injunction would be unworkable, partly in light of the simple fact that people move from state to state and job to job, and would likely create administrative problems for Defendants. Furthermore, there is a strong federal interest in the uniformity of federal immigration law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 4 (empowering Congress to \"establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization\");\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 187-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court in New York could not envision any effective relief narrower than a nationwide injunction in part because it had sixteen states as plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   involved twenty-six states from eleven different circuits, so fashioning a circuit-based remedy was, for all practical purposes, impossible. These states ranged from North Dakota to Texas and from North Carolina to Nevada. Limiting an injunction to those twenty-six states or a geographic area was a virtual impossibility when an individual can freely travel. Such an injunction would have been ineffective. The DAPA and Expanded DACA programs would have gone into effect in less than half of the country. Could a DAPA recipient with lawful presence in New York travel to Texas, have an encounter with immigration officers in Texas, and be placed in immigration proceedings because there was an injunction forbidding its rollout in Texas? The court in\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   , like this one in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , clearly gave consideration to limiting the relief it awarded, and it too could not conceive of a narrower path to follow:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The court enjoins rescission of the DACA program on a universal or \"nationwide\" basis. Again, it does not do so lightly. As Defendants correctly note, equitable principles provide that the court should not enter an injunction that is broader than \"necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.\" (Defs.

Moreover, several academic commentators have insightfully observed various problems with the practice of granting nationwide injunctions against the Government, including that such injunctions thwart the development of law in different courts, encourage forum-shopping, and create the possibility that different courts will issue conflicting nationwide injunctions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   While not referenced in Justice Thomas's\n   <em>\n    Trump v. Hawaii\n   </em>\n   concurrence, the broad grant of standing articulated in\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v. EPA\n   </em>\n   and its progeny further complicates the national injunction issue, as does the imperative that immigration policy be uniform. Broad grants of standing for states, municipalities, and groups combine with the requirement that immigration policy be uniform, and together they create a perfect storm that results in remedies no one prefers-not judges, not lawyers, not lay people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The third reason this Court will not defer to the other courts is that it is not entering an order that is contrary to any of the quartet of orders discussed below. While this opinion certainly expresses views contrary to some of those expressed by the other courts, its ruling herein does not leave the parties facing conflicting injunctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, there are four decisions concerning the DACA phase out, and they did not reach the same result on the issues they addressed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Their results are inconsistent;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   consequently, a different result here certainly would not disrupt any sense of uniformity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   This Court has reviewed each of those opinions carefully and finds none to be controlling. While various aspects of each opinion are informative, none were decided by a court that is bound to follow Fifth Circuit precedent. Additionally, each court worked with records different from the record in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   and the record now before this Court. As one would expect given different records, each ultimate ruling could also be different.

The court explained its decision in its closing paragraph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, a few words about the nature of the relief being granted by this Court. The Court did not hold in its prior opinion, and it does not hold today, that DHS lacks the statutory or constitutional authority to rescind the DACA program. Rather, the Court simply holds that if DHS wishes to rescind the program-or to take any other action, for that matter-it must give a rational explanation for its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). A Conclusory assertion that a prior policy is illegal, accompanied by a hodgepodge of illogical or\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   policy assertions, simply will not do. The Court therefore reaffirms its conclusion that DACA's rescission was unlawful and must be set aside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   court also relied upon the OLC memorandum as authority to dispute the Attorney General's conclusion that DACA might also violate the Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   , at 471-72. The Government has appealed the D.C. court's order vacating the rescission of DACA. In its most recent ruling, the D.C. court stayed its earlier order in part and will not require the Government to accept new initial applications or applications for advance parole during the pendency of the appeal. It ordered that the DHS rescission decision as to current DACA recipients and renewals was vacated. Thus, its current orders effectively match the rulings in California and New York. [Doc. No. 313, Exs. 1-2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Overall, there is little to be gleaned from these prior DACA decisions that is applicable to the questions posed in this case. Three courts found the DHS rescission ineffective and enjoined or vacated it, and one found it legal and did not enjoin the rescission but did enjoin any use of DACA recipient information. Only the\n   <em>\n    Casa De Maryland\n   </em>\n   court seemed to give any credence to the fact that the original 2014 challenge to DAPA and Expanded DACA was only dismissed due to the DHS's decision to rescind DACA, which seems at least relevant to the DHS's claim that it considered the litigation risk prior to its decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   DAPA-an analogous program, promulgated by the analogous means-had been defeated less than a year prior. The litigation that stopped DAPA included expansions of DACA itself. The same plaintiffs who defeated DAPA threatened to challenge DACA imminently. The Attorney General of the United States-the nation's chief legal officer-provided legal advice that DACA was likewise unlawful and likely ill-fated against a legal challenge. All of this is in the Administrative Record-the remnants of the DAPA litigation, the threatened legal challenge, and the Attorney General's advisory letter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    Therefore, what did the Acting Secretary of DHS do? She opted for a six-month wind-down period instead of the chaotic possibility of an immediate termination, which would come at a time known only to the judge resolving a future challenge to the DACA program. This decision took control of a pell-mell situation and provided Congress-the branch of government charged with determining immigration policy-an opportunity to remedy it. Given the reasonable belief that DACA was unlawful, the decision to wind down DACA in an orderly manner was rational.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As stated above, it is important to note that these courts were primarily faced with the issue of the Government's rescission of DACA-not its creation and implementation. Second, one must note that none of these courts are bound by Fifth Circuit precedent. In fact, more than one judge referred to the dissent in the Fifth Circuit's opinion with approval. Obviously, being a court in the Fifth Circuit, this Court cannot adopt and follow a Fifth Circuit dissent. Third, some courts seem to assume that DACA's use of program-wide discretion was sufficient. For example, both of the courts in\n   <em>\n    Regents\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   took issue with the Fifth Circuit's\n   conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   that the APA requires the actual personnel reviewing DACA applications to be the individuals exercising discretion. Those courts felt that the agency exercised its discretion by setting out the criteria in the 2012 memorandum and that \"exercise\" was all that was necessary. In other words, a \"programmatic\" exercise of discretion would suffice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regents\n   </em>\n   , 279 F.Supp.3d at 1039 ;\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   , 279 F.Supp.3d at 424-25 (suggesting that discretion at the agency level, as opposed to the individual officer level, would suffice to exempt DACA from notice and comment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   This Court ruled differently for many reasons, but it will mention three. This approach is contrary to the very essence of prosecutorial discretion. Under that approach, the Secretary could have given lawful presence to every alien unlawfully in the country. Further, that procedure is contrary to the very OLC memorandum upon which those courts rely. That memorandum specifically recounted an oral warning the OLC gave the DHS regarding DACA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Before DACA was announced\n   </em>\n   , our Office was consulted about whether such a program would be legally permissible.\n   <em>\n    As we orally advised, our preliminary view was that such a program would be permissible, provided that immigration officials retained discretion to evaluate each application on an individualized basis.\n   </em>\n   We noted that immigration officials typically consider factors such as having been brought to the United States as a child in exercising their discretion to grant deferred action in individual cases.\n   <em>\n    We explained, however, that extending deferred action to individuals who satisfied these and other specified criteria on a class-wide basis would raise distinct questions not implicated by ad hoc grants of deferred action. We advised that it was critical\n   </em>\n   that, like past policies that made deferred action available to certain classes of aliens,\n   <em>\n    the DACA program require immigration officials to evaluate each application for deferred action on a case-by-case basis, rather than granting deferred action automatically to all applicants who satisfied the threshold eligibility criteria.\n    <footnotemark>\n     32\n    </footnotemark>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Thus, it advised that an exercise of program-wide discretion by the Secretary was problematic. The record in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   compelled this Court's finding that no individual discretion was being exercised by those actually evaluating applications. Consequently, the DHS could find no support from the OLC memorandum. Finally, given the benefits DAPA was to confer, and the binding programmatic protocols issued by the Secretary of the DHS, the conclusion that there must be compliance with the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA was unassailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   These decisions also gloss over the fact that the Fifth Circuit affirmed an injunction not just against DAPA, but also against Expanded DACA. Finally, all three courts that actually ruled against the DHS's decision to rescind DACA seemed to put heavy reliance on the OLC memorandum. That memorandum did not address the advice given concerning the legality of DACA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   except for the footnote\n   quoted above. What was more important for this Court, and no doubt for the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , was the fact that the OLC memorandum did not include an in-depth APA analysis. The decisions enjoining DAPA and Expanded DACA were based on those programs' failure to comply with the requirements of the APA, not on the other legal challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Perhaps the only common thread between all four of these decisions, at least as analyzed by this Court, was aptly expressed by the court in\n   <em>\n    Casa de Maryland\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   The result of this case is not one that this Court would choose if it were a member of a different branch of our government. An overwhelming percentage of Americans support protections for \"Dreamers,\" yet it is not the province of the judiciary to provide legislative or executive actions when those entrusted with those responsibilities fail to act. As Justice Gorsuch noted during his confirmation hearing, \"a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is probably a pretty bad judge, stretching for the policy results he prefers rather than those the law compels.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   This Court does not like the outcome of this case, but is constrained by its constitutionally limited role to the result that it has reached. Hopefully, the Congress and the President will finally get their job done.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Although the other courts reached different conclusions, given the tenor of their decisions, this Court feels safe assuming that each would agree with the hope for a legislative fix. Having found that there is no reason to defer to the decisions governing the DHS's rescission of DACA, this Court proceeds to address the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. This Case Unquestionably Presents a Case or Controversy.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Separate from the preliminary injunction motion, the Defendant-Intervenors have filed a motion to dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

That the Executive may welcome this order to pay the refund if it is accompanied by the constitutional ruling it wants does not eliminate the injury to the national Treasury if payment is made, or to the taxpayer if it is not. The judgment orders the United States to pay money that it would not disburse but for the court's order. The Government of the United States has a valid legal argument that it is injured even if the Executive disagrees with \u00a7 3 of DOMA, which results in Windsor's liability for the tax. Windsor's ongoing claim for funds that the United States refuses to pay thus establishes a controversy sufficient for Article III jurisdiction.

First, \"[t]he parties' dispute turns on the proper construction of a congressional statute,\" the APA, which authorizes challenges to \"final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, the disagreement in\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v.

EPA\n   </em>\n   's applicability:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In enacting the APA, Congress intended for those \"suffering legal wrong because of agency action\" to have judicial recourse, and the states fall well within that definition. The Clean Air Act's review provision is more specific than the APA's, but the latter is easily adequate to justify \"special solicitude\" here. The procedural right to challenge EPA decisions created by the Clean Air Act provided important support to Massachusetts because the\n   challenge Massachusetts sought to bring-a challenge to an agency's decision\n   <em>\n    not to act\n   </em>\n   -is traditionally the type for which it is most difficult to establish standing and a justiciable issue. Texas, by contrast, challenges DHS's affirmative decision to set guidelines for granting lawful presence to a broad class of illegal aliens. Because the states here challenge DHS's decision to act, rather than its decision to remain inactive, a procedural right similar to that created by the Clean Air Act is not necessary to support standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Fifth Circuit's analysis applies equally to Texas's procedural right to challenge DACA.

The majority opinion in the DAPA litigation focused on DAPA's \"imposing substantial pressure on [the plaintiff states] to change their laws, which provide for issuing driver's licenses to some aliens and subsidizing those licenses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Texas in this litigation has not asserted standing on the basis of driver's-license costs. Nevertheless, as explained more fully in this Court's\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   standing analysis, Texas has demonstrated a quasi-sovereign interest in the economic well-being of its citizens, which amply supports Texas's entitlement to special solicitude in the standing analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Alfred L.

The States accurately allege that the DACA program bypasses Congress's comprehensive immigration framework to grant unlawfully present individuals lawful presence and thereafter work authorizations. DACA recipients in turn may compete with legally present individuals for available jobs, which can result in DACA recipients being hired for jobs for which legally present individuals have applied and otherwise would have been hired. The States further argue that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H (\"ACA\"), exacerbates this problem. As explained in the Court's\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   analysis, businesses are not required to provide health insurance to DACA recipients like they are to legally present employees. This makes DACA recipients less costly to employ, incentivizing employers to hire DACA recipients over similarly qualified Texas residents. Taken together, these elements create a more competitive labor market in which it is more difficult for legal residents of Texas to obtain jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In its quasi-sovereign interest analysis in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit found that the States' interests also implicated the same sorts of sovereignty concerns as Massachusetts's interests did in\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v.

Under their theory, DACA injures the economic well-being of\n   their citizens because those citizens are forced to compete in distorted labor markets in which it is more difficult to obtain a job. This is true for two reasons. First, DACA recipients receive work authorization under the program, which Texas argues allows them to compete with a state's legal residents for jobs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum from Janet Napolitano,\n   <em>\n    Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals who Came to the United States as Children\n   </em>\n   (June 15, 2012) [Doc. No. 6, Ex. 1, at 5]; Decl. of Donald Deere [Doc. No. 7, Ex. 11, at 92] (\"[T]he addition of some 683,000 work-eligible individuals nationwide, with 112,000 of these in Texas ... make it more difficult for some U.S. citizens to find employment.\"). Second, Texas alleges DACA recipients actually have a competitive advantage over those citizens because they may cost less to employ. Under the ACA, employers with fifty or more employees are required to offer health insurance to each of their full-time employees, and employers who do not offer insurance incur a monetary penalty. The additional cost of providing coverage (or paying the penalty), however, does not apply when the employee is a DACA recipient. All else being equal, an employer wishing to minimize costs may rationally prefer to hire a DACA recipient as opposed to someone legally in the state because employing the DACA recipient costs less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Evidence in the preliminary injunction record supports this theory. For instance, in response to a question asking whether low-skilled DACA recipients \"would increase competition with other people who are citizens who are also competing for those low skilled jobs,\" Defendant-Intervenors' expert, Dr. Ike Brannon, replied that they would. Dep. of Ike Brannon [Doc. No. 289, Ex. 3, at 141]. Further, the record demonstrates that some DACA individuals have been selected over other candidates for highly competitive positions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In addition to the arguments brought forth by the parties, many businesses appearing as amici curiae in this case have indicated they would hire non-DACA employees if the DACA program ceased.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 221, Ex. 1, at 20] (\"[T]he Texas business community, including many\n   <em>\n    Amici\n   </em>\n   and their members, stand to suffer substantial and irreparable injury if DACA is enjoined because Texas businesses will ... incur additional costs to fill positions now occupied by Dreamers.\"); [Doc. No. 204, Ex. 1, at 18] (\"If this Court were to enjoin DACA and thereby permit Dreamers' work authorizations to expire, companies will face an estimated $6.3 billion in costs to replace Dreamers ....\"); [Doc. No. 192, Ex. 1, at 5] (explaining that New Jersey businesses would incur substantial costs related to hiring and training new workers if DACA were terminated). In other words, but for DACA, these businesses would need work-authorized individuals to meet their business needs, and they would have to hire applicants from a pool consisting of those legally in the United States. This market imbalance undoubtedly supports Texas's claim that an injury to the economic well-being of those legally in\n   Texas exists and the economic well-being of its residents is a quasi-sovereign interest sufficient to support standing.

[Doc. No. 118]. They argue that any order by this Court would not be able to redress the States' injuries because the Government is enjoined by other court orders from ending the DACA program and this Court's order could not relieve the Government of its obligation to comply with the other courts' injunctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The Court is unpersuaded that other courts' injunctions deprive this Court of jurisdiction for at least four reasons. First, those courts were not asked to determine the lawfulness of DACA; rather, they were asked to determine the lawfulness of its\n   rescission. Second, as a general matter, redressability does not turn on the likelihood that a defendant will comply with a court's injunction. In fact, courts typically assume as much, and with good reason: were that not the rule, a defendant could thwart a court's jurisdiction simply by announcing the intention to not follow the court's order. Courts properly do not engage in this inquiry and instead determine whether an injunction would redress the plaintiff's injury,\n   <em>\n    assuming\n   </em>\n   the defendant complies with the injunction. Third, the injunctions do not bar this Court from awarding declaratory relief vacating the 2012 DACA memorandum. Finally, the States seek relief from some injuries that are wholly outside the activity enjoined by other courts. The States have asked this Court to enjoin both DACA renewals\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   new DACA applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' First Am. Compl. [Doc. No. 104, at 73]. As of the date of this opinion, the California, New York, and D.C. courts' injunctions/vacatur only require the Government to process DACA renewals, leaving the Government free to decide whether to accept new DACA applications. Thus, were this Court to enjoin the Government from processing new DACA applications, that relief would certainly redress some of the States' injuries, without implicating any of the Defendant-Intervenors' concerns related to conflicting injunctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The Defendant-Intervenors argue that any injunction granted by this Court would not \"unquestionably\" redress the States' harm because the order of \"another court would continue to stand between Plaintiffs and their desired outcome.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17]; [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303866\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/86/591/\">\n    86 F.Supp.3d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 624 (S.D.

Like in\n   <em>\n    Hanson\n   </em>\n   , an injunction of DACA or a favorable declaratory ruling \"might permit\" the States to have redress of their injuries.

The award of lawful presence triggers many state and federal benefits. Additionally, there are other costs implicated by DACA. For example, by its own terms, the DACA memorandum does not require the States to provide educational services, but other aspects of federal law do. The States are required under\n   <em>\n    Plyler v. Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187607\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/202/\">\n    457 U.S. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187607\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/202/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187607\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/202/\">\n    72 L.Ed.2d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982), to educate all children, regardless of their immigration status. Similarly, as a condition to participate in federal Medicare and Medicaid, states must provide emergency services to all individuals, also regardless of immigration status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20440.255\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The States argue that DACA increases these costs because it \"incentivize[s] aliens-who would otherwise be unlawfully present and unauthorized to work without these programs-to remain in the country, including in the Plaintiff States.\" [Doc. No. 218, at 42]. In other words, because DACA increases the total number of aliens in the States by disincentivizing those already present from leaving, the States must provide more of these social services, which cost more. The States have demonstrated both aspects of this causal chain: they bear the costs of providing these social services required by federal law, and the DACA program increases the volume of individuals to whom they must provide these services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   First, as explained above, federal law requires the States to provide certain social services to individuals regardless of their immigration status. For example, Texas alleges it spent more than $375,000,000 over the past eleven years providing emergency Medicaid services to illegal aliens. Decl. of Monica Smoot [Doc. No. 7, at 28]. While that figure also captures the expenses borne from non-DACA aliens, DACA recipients certainly constitute some of those expenses, too. This is corroborated by the Defendant-Intervenors' expert, who opined that Texas incurs\n   more than $250,000,000 in total direct costs from DACA recipients per year. [Doc. No. 219, Ex. 1, at 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Second, the DACA program increases the total number of individuals using Texas's social services. DACA relief has been conferred on approximately 115,000 individuals in Texas as of September 2017. [Doc. No. 1, at 82]; [Doc. No. 302, at 93]. Texas argues that some percentage of these recipients would leave the country if DACA ends. The State Demographer of Texas, Lloyd B. Potter, found that some DACA recipients \"could be expected to migrate out of the U.S.\" if they did not have permission to work, and that it was \"reasonable to conclude that some DACA participants would return to their country of origin if they lose or are not given permission to work in the U.S.\" Decl. of Lloyd B. Potter [Doc. No. 7, at 5-7]. This claim is supported by the empirical findings of the Defendant-Intervenors' expert, who conducted a survey of over 3,000 DACA recipients that found over twenty-two percent of survey respondents were either likely or very likely to leave the United States if DACA ended. [Doc. No. 219, Ex. 2, at 4] (survey of Tom K. Wong). Since enjoining DACA would invalidate DACA recipients' deferred action status and work authorization, this study shows that a quantifiable percentage of individuals would likely leave the United States. Under those circumstances, Texas would no longer be obliged to pay for those DACA recipients' social services costs, thereby reducing some of its financial losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Speaking broadly, Defendant-Intervenors have three responses to this argument: first, that there is no evidence of injury to Texas nor evidence that DACA recipients would leave the United States if DACA ended; second, that Texas's purported injuries are not traceable to DACA; and third, that the revenues generated by DACA recipients offset any purported injuries to Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The Defendant-Intervenors' first argument-that there is no evidence of injury-focuses on the fact that the States rely on cost estimates that the Defendant-Intervenors claim are inaccurate or methodologically flawed. First, for purposes of the Plaintiff States' standing vis-\u00e0-vis their declaratory judgment action, the Court accepts the States' allegations from their pleadings that invalidating DACA would reduce the number of DACA recipients using the States' social services.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Venator Grp. Specialty, Inc. v. Matthew/Muniot Family, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9371507\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/835/#p841\">\n    322 F.3d 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 (5th Cir. 2003) (assuming the truth of plaintiff's pleaded allegations to review a motion to dismiss plaintiff's declaratory action for lack of justiciability). Second, even with respect to the preliminary injunction, the Court finds that the States have carried their burden regarding standing. Though the Defendant-Intervenors lodge attacks against the evidence supporting each type of cost-education, healthcare, and law-enforcement services-the Court need not address those arguments line-by-line because the States only must show\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   injury, as opposed to a \"substantial\" injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    OCA-Greater Houston v. Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275338\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/604/#p612\">\n    867 F.3d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612 (5th Cir. 2017) (\"To be sure, OCA's injury was not large. But the injury alleged as an Article III injury-in-fact need not be substantial; 'it need not measure more than an \"identifiable trifle.' \" This is because 'the injury in fact requirement under Article III is qualitative, not quantitative, in nature.' \" (internal citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Court is satisfied that Texas's evidence demonstrates an injury. Texas has established that it bears hundreds of millions of dollars in costs providing emergency Medicaid services to illegal aliens. As discussed above, Texas's estimates include the costs of providing emergency services\n   to both DACA recipients and those who do not have DACA status. The Defendant-Intervenors argue that these costs cannot constitute any \"direct evidence that even a single DACA recipient benefitted from these programs\" because the costs are estimated and because Texas does not inquire about residency or citizenship when providing these services. [Doc. No. 224, at 27]. For standing purposes, Texas need not plead damages from a particular individual when it pleads and has proof that it is being damaged by the entire program. In the scope of a program the size of DACA, with over 115,000 recipients in Texas alone, it is virtually certain that at least some DACA recipients utilize the emergency Medicaid services Texas is required to provide them. The Court is not deciding a motion on the merits, rather it is only determining standing. Finally, and perhaps most importantly for this topic, Defendant-Intervenors' own witness directly connected the dots for the Plaintiff States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 219, Ex. 1, at 4] (estimate of M. Ray Perryman that DACA recipients impose over $250,000,000 in costs to Texas annually).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The Defendant-Intervenors' own evidence not only cures any flaws of which they complain, it also supports the Plaintiff States' arguments in other ways as well. They cite a national survey that found approximately fifty-seven percent of DACA recipients have employer-based, private health insurance. [Doc. No. 224, at 28]. Their same expert who discusses that survey also notes that \"[w]ithout private health insurance, DACA recipients would become\n   <em>\n    more reliant on emergency Medicaid\n   </em>\n   and community-based uncompensated care.\" Decl. of Leighton Ku [Doc. No. 225, Ex. 3, at 121] (emphasis added). Provided these are both true, the forty-three percent of DACA recipients who do not have employer-based, private health insurance are likely \"more reliant on emergency Medicaid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Leighton Ku [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124] (\"2016 NHIS data indicates that DACA-type adults who are not working have a 19 percent probability of using emergency room care in the last 12 months.\"); Dep. of M. Ray Perryman [Doc. No. 219, Ex. 8, at 15] (Question: \"You don't dispute that the State of Texas does indeed incur a cost to provide health care to DACA recipients?\" Answer: \"... I assume there would be some people in the DACA population who are likely to have some type of care that is reimbursed in some way by the state.\"). This is a sufficient showing of injury for purposes of demonstrating standing at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The Defendant-Intervenors' second argument, that Texas's purported injuries are not traceable to DACA, is also unpersuasive. The States argue that DACA disincentivizes self-deportation, thereby causing the States injury because more people use the States' social services. The Defendant-Intervenors contest the factual basis of this theory, arguing that DACA does not encourage DACA recipients to stay in the States. They do so primarily by attacking the credibility of the States' expert on the subject. Even totally discounting the declaration of the States' expert, however, the Defendant-Intervenors' own expert sufficiently demonstrates the causal link between DACA and Texas's injuries; as mentioned above, Dr. Tom K. Wong's survey found that just\n   over twenty-two percent of DACA recipients were either likely or very likely to leave if the DACA program ended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. No. 219, Ex. 2, at 4]. The Defendant-Intervenors' response to this finding is to challenge their own expert's survey. They claim that Dr. Wong's question required DACA recipients to \"predict future behavior,\" that it concerned complex decisions that are \"inherently speculative,\" and that the question order might have \"inaccurately bias[ed]\" the survey takers, all leading to the conclusion that there are \"strong reasons to doubt those answers are predictive\" of whether former DACA recipients would leave. [Doc. No. 288, at 16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   These arguments are unavailing at least for standing purposes. People routinely \"predict [their] future behavior,\" even in the face of considerable contingencies. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Although it is possible that some of the study's participants might change their minds, that does not destroy standing for Texas. Further, if some former recipients were to change their minds, more might decide to leave than to stay. No one can know the answer to this question. What is evident, however, is that it was the Defendant-Intervenors who decided to seek Dr. Wong's expert assistance and submitted his survey for consideration in this lawsuit. Had they taken issue with the survey's methodology or results, they could have expressed those concerns to Dr. Wong or simply not introduced his survey into the preliminary injunction record. Instead, the Defendant-Intervenors chose an expert with this opinion, knowing from the beginning of the suit that the States were asserting this basis for standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 5, at 10] (\"DACA, Expanded DACA, and DAPA cause those costs because these programs incentivize aliens-who would otherwise be unlawfully present and unauthorized to work without these programs-to remain in the country, including in the Plaintiff States.\").

The Court held that the\n   Postmaster General could be compelled by mandamus to \"execute\" the law. The Court rejected Kendall's claim that only the President could compel him to act:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   This is a doctrine that cannot receive the sanction of this court. It would be vesting in the President a dispensing power, which has no countenance for its support in any part of the constitution; and is asserting a principle, which, if carried out in its results, to all cases falling within it, would be clothing the President with a power entirely to control the legislation of congress, and paralyze the administration of justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   To contend that the obligation imposed on the President to see the laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution, is a novel construction of the constitution, and entirely inadmissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Moreover, Supreme Court precedent seems to have pitted different interpretations of the clause against each other.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   The second striking element is that\n   <em>\n    the functions that the Court ascribes to the Take Care Clause are often in unacknowledged tension with one another.\n   </em>\n   For instance, deriving a strong prosecutorial discretion from the clause may collide with the scruple against dispensation that the Court also reads into it. Similarly, the Court has said that the Take Care Clause precludes presidential lawmaking while also finding that the clause justifies the exercise of a presidential completion power-an implied presidential authority to prescribe extrastatutory means when necessary to execute a statute.\n   <em>\n    The internal tensions, moreover, often give rise to doctrines that ask for judgments of degree-line drawing that does not lend itself readily to judicially manageable standards.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The instant case pits the concept of faithfully enforcing the law against the concept of prosecutorial discretion.

The number of cases that interpret the Take Care Clause are relatively few, and those few cases rarely, if ever, set out discernable guideposts for use by lower courts. In a non-scientific survey of Supreme Court jurisprudence, this Court has located fewer than ten cases in which the Take Care Clause is actually discussed by name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Nevertheless, even when one uses the entirety of Supreme Court jurisprudence as guidance, the interpretation of the clause seems somewhat case-specific and fact-driven. In fact, some commentators have described the Supreme Court's interpretations of the clause as \"(Non)interpretations.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   Two things stand out about the Court's reliance on the Take Care Clause to serve so many ends simultaneously. The first is that, in each of these contexts,\n   <em>\n    the Court treats the meaning of the clause as obvious when it is anything but that.\n   </em>\n   The Court's decisions rely heavily on the Take Care Clause but almost never interpret it, at least not in\n   any conventional way. The Court does not typically parse the text of the clause or try to situate it in the broader constitutional structure that gives it context. Nor does the Court typically examine the clause's historical provenance (except to invoke an almost equally conclusory set of interpretations by members of the First Congress in the Decision of 1789).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   ... the Court has [interpreted the clause] so casually and at a high level of generality, without any attention to detailed interpretive questions about the clause's meaning or history.

It does not look at any of the evidence one would expect an interpreter to consider in determining the clause's relevance to the many uses to which the Court has put it. The Court has never taken more than a glancing look at the text, its common law meaning, the subsequent practical construction (\"liquidation\" of the clause's meaning), the clause's place in the broader constitutional structure, or the political context from which it emerged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   Nor has the Court sought to reconcile its various Take Care Clause doctrines with one another or troubled itself about its own capacity to resolve the intractable line-drawing problems that its doctrine has created.

More importantly, it has no need to do so. Given the fact that federal courts strive to avoid constitutional issues when possible; given the fact that the clause at issue seems to be a vehicle for both bestowing and restricting executive authority; and given the fact that the Supreme Court's analysis seems to be very case-specific and somewhat devoid of useful, uniform guidance, this Court finds caution to be the better part of wisdom and constitutional avoidance to be the best course of action at this preliminary stage.

Under the interpretation of those who instituted DACA, the entire illegal population could receive deferred action. During the Supreme Court's oral argument in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , Chief Justice Roberts questioned the Government on precisely this point:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   Chief Justice Roberts: Under your argument, could the President grant deferred removal to every unlawful - unlawfully\n   present alien in the United States right now?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   General Verrilli: Definitely not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   Chief Justice Roberts: Why not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n   General Verrilli: Here are the limits.

It was not an inconsequential question because this Court and the Fifth Circuit had asked it as well, but as one can see, the Solicitor General's response to Chief Justice Roberts was, in effect, \"the Executive Branch just would never do that.\" This response was less than reassuring, since at the same time it was the Executive Branch that was attempting to give lawful presence to a combined DACA, Expanded DACA, and DAPA population of approximately 5.8 million individuals, over half of the country's 11.3 million estimated illegal aliens. Utilizing the Defendant-Intervenors' position in this case, the Executive Branch could still give every illegal alien currently present in the United States lawful status, if only the DHS were to do it in smaller numbers, group-by-group. This cannot be a correct interpretation of the law. The DACA program, like DAPA, which attempts to give lawful presence and a wide variety of benefits to upwards of a million individuals, is far from any program conducted in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   More importantly, unlike the DAPA situation, Congress has directly addressed DACA or a DACA-like population, so one need not guess its position. Both houses of Congress have, time after time, considered and rejected bills that would afford lawful immigration status to the same or a similar group of individuals contemplated by DACA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   These proposals, while not necessarily covering identical populations or attempting to achieve the exact same goals, are often labelled in the popular press as \"DREAM Acts.\" Over a period of more than a decade, they have been filed, considered, and have at times even been put to vote (both before and after the implementation of DACA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   As recently as June of this year, the House of Representatives rejected a bill by an almost 3-to-1 margin\n   that would have legalized the DACA recipients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress's consistent rejection of these bills cannot be read as a tacit approval of DACA. To the contrary, its underlying concept has been rejected time and again.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   However attractive it might be as a matter of policy, the DACA program appears to violate the proper respect for congressional primacy in lawmaking that should guide executive action, even when substantial exercises of prosecutorial discretion are inevitable. To the extent Congress has adopted overly broad and unduly harsh immigration laws, Congress should remain accountable for its choice.

No. 215, at 27] (citing\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   173 ). They point to two salient differences: 1) there is arguably no analogous statutory provision that DACA would displace; and 2) DACA affects fewer people than DAPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   To distinguish DACA from DAPA and Expanded DACA, Defendant-Intervenors first point to a passage in the\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   opinion citing a specific collection of INA provisions that provides \"an intricate process\n   for illegal aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification from their children's immigration status.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 179-80 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201151\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(i), 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), 1201(a), 1255 ). The\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   court held that DAPA was unlawful in part because permitting DAPA would nullify the particular group of provisions and displace it with a new method for alien parents to acquire citizenship through their children. The Defendant-Intervenors argue that because no analogous set of provisions exists for DACA, the Fifth Circuit's ruling does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   This Court cannot agree. First, the Fifth Circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   did not rely exclusively on the existence of the provisions allowing illegal aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification from their children's immigration status. The court, in fact, relied at least as much on DAPA's incompatibility with the INA's provisions for lawful presence and work authorization, as discussed above. Moreover, the Fifth Circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   clearly was not predicated solely on the existence of those provisions, as evidenced by the court's holding that Expanded DACA was also unlawful. That program had no overlap with the cited provisions, and the court obviously did not rely on their existence in ruling against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Second, analogous provisions\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   exist regulating the lawful admission of children, as well as for students and veterans. Congress has passed many acts relating to the immigration of children, and at least two of them provide methods for attaining status that significantly overlap with the DACA age group: derivative citizenship and naturalization upon application. Congress has allocated a method for children to derive citizenship from a parent, whereby a child born outside of the United States may become a citizen if the child: 1) has an American citizen parent; 2) is under 18 years of age; 3) lives in the legal and physical custody of the American citizen parent; and 4) is a lawful permanent resident.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Another provision provides for the naturalization of a child born outside the United States upon application of the parent, if the child: 1) has a U.S. citizen parent; 2) has a parent who has been physically present in the United States for at least five years, two after the age of fourteen; 3) is under eighteen years of age; 4) is residing outside of the United States in the legal and physical custody of the applicant; and 5) is temporarily present in the United States pursuant to a lawful admission.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201433\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court earlier discussed the statutes that Congress has passed concerning students and veterans. Suffice it to say DACA allows certain recipients to acquire lawful presence without complying with any of Congress's requirements. This is especially troubling when one considers that Congress has consistently rejected any legislative effort to give the DACA recipients legal status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   Defendant-Intervenors also argue that DACA is different from DAPA because it affects fewer people. [Doc. No. 215, at 19]. This contention, based solely on a numerical difference, is factually accurate, but provides no legal distinction. The 1.5 million people DACA would permit to receive lawful presence and work authorization are still too numerous to fit into the individualized notion of deferred action that courts have found permissible in other contexts. Over a million individuals is still an outsized number, and it remains outside the authority of the agency to defer action for this many people. As were DAPA and Expanded DACA, DACA is \"foreclosed by Congress's careful plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201433\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201433\">\n    at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   The fact that DAPA was three times the size of DACA is of no\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   significance. One of Defendant-Intervenors' experts is an immigration law professor and was Chief Counsel to the United States Customs\n   and Immigration Service from 2011 to 2013, during which time DACA was instituted. He finds only two differences between DACA and DAPA: 1) the size; and 2) DACA is an active program at the time of litigation, whereas DAPA had yet to be instituted when it was challenged. He testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-285\">\n   Q: Okay. I forgot to ask you one additional question. So earlier we had talked about the differences between DACA and DAPA; right? And you can think of two right now. One is the size of the population, which you said doesn't affect the merits of whether DACA and DAPA are legally the same thing; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n   A: In my opinion, it should not have that effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   Q: Okay. And then the second thing you mentioned was the ongoing nature of the DACA program as opposed to the soon-to-be implemented nature of the DAPA program; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-288\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-289\">\n   Q: But, again, in your opinion, going to the underlying merits of whether these two programs are legal, that shouldn't make a difference; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-290\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Dep. of Stephen Legomsky [Doc. No. 284, Ex. 67, at 99:14-100:6.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   Consequently, even one of the Defendant-Intervenors' own experts-one who was involved in immigration policy at the time of the implementation of the DACA program-finds that the difference in the possible number of participants between it (1.5 million) and Expanded DACA-DAPA (4.3 million) is of no legal significance. The most troubling aspect of the position of the Defendant-Intervenors is that, using their logic, the DHS could just grant deferred action to smaller groups of 750,000 to 1.5 million (DACA size) more frequently and still give the entire illegal population lawful presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   There may be one other significant difference between DAPA and DACA, but it too has no effect on legality. Many of the amici argue that DACA has garnered much national media attention and clearly invokes the sympathetic nature of the nation's populace. DACA affects a younger population. Many came to this country unlawfully or stayed in this country without permission through no fault of their own. Further, the DACA population is generally better educated and, according to many of the amicus briefs, better situated to contribute to the well-being of this nation than other immigrant populations. For many, these factors make the DACA population a much more appealing group. Although the group of DACA recipients may be smaller, more deserving of sympathy, and perhaps even more worthy than those who would have been covered by DAPA, those facts do not alter the legal reasoning underpinning this Court's conclusion. The result here is compelled by law. \"The law's function is understood to be to neutralize the emotionality that legal disputes arouse in the participants and lay observers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   As much as this Court might agree with these arguments, and as popular as this program might be, the proper origination point for the DACA program is Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <strong>\n    d. This Exercise of Deferred Action Is Not Supported by Historical Precedent.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Defendant-Intervenors also argue historical precedent provides a source of authority for the institution of DACA. They cite past examples in which the Executive has deferred prosecution for particular groups of aliens\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n   and argue that those instances provide precedent for the program at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   In distinguishing previous deferred action programs from DAPA, the Fifth Circuit rejected precisely this argument: those programs, unlike DAPA, were \"[mostly] done on a country-specific basis, usually in response to war, civil unrest, or natural disasters,\" or \"were bridges from one legal status to another.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same shortfalls present in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   are also present here, and DACA fares no better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   DACA, although closer in size, is no more analogous than DAPA to the cited historical programs. The DACA program is by no means a \"bridge\" to anywhere; in fact, the very memorandum that created it states it is not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   DACA awards lawful presence to individuals who have never before received or no longer possess lawful status, and it was not implemented in response to any natural disaster or other similar crisis. Its closest analog is not any of the programs cited by Defendant-Intervenors; DACA is most like DAPA and is directly analogous to Expanded DACA. As was DAPA, the DACA program is not authorized by historical precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Additionally, Defendant-Intervenors highlight a particular example of deferred action-the \"Family Fairness\" policies of 1987 and 1990-as allegedly analogous to the DACA program. These policies are attractive candidates for comparison because of their size: they allegedly provided deferred action for approximately 1.5 million individuals. [Doc. No. 215 at 12]. The Fifth Circuit, however, already specifically rejected this analogy as well.\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"436\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Deeming the policies distinguishable from the DAPA and Expanded DACA programs, the court called Family Fairness \"interstitial to a statutory legalization scheme,\" because the policies' purpose was to delay prosecution until Congress could enact legislation providing the same benefits. Congress later passed the Immigration Act of 1990, which superseded the Family Fairness Program. Pub. L. No. 101-649,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Stat.%204978\">\n    104 Stat. 4978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (enacted Nov. 29, 1990). The court said that Family Fairness was unlike DAPA because Congress had consistently declined to enact a DREAM Act, and DAPA was therefore not interstitial to any piece of legislation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Stat.%204978\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"DAPA is far from interstitial: Congress has repeatedly declined to enact the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act ('DREAM Act'), features of which closely resemble DACA and DAPA.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   The same conclusion applies here because DACA is not interstitial to an act of Congress. In fact, just the opposite situation exists. Congress has repeatedly considered and declined to pass a DREAM Act to provide benefits to the same or a similar class of aliens protected by DACA. Although the Defendant-Intervenors would have the Court view DACA as a means of waiting for congressional action, given the DREAM Act's history in Congress, the Court is unable to predict that Congress will pass such an act in the future. Although Congress may someday enact such a DREAM Act, until it does, its continued rejection of bills coextensive with DACA evinces a rejection of this policy. The Fifth Circuit found DAPA to be contrary to law because it clearly was not \"a bridge[ ] from one legal status to another.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . DACA suffers from the same deficiency.

Over 800,000 individuals have already received the benefit of lawful presence. Most have received work authorization, and over half a million more individuals are or will be eligible to apply. Moreover, the individual Defendant-Intervenors, New Jersey, and the many states appearing through amicus curiae briefs have without exception urged this Court to consider the substantial positive impact these recipients have made. No matter which party's briefs and exhibits one reviews, each stresses the impact of the DACA program. DACA clearly has impacted the entire country. Although the DACA program has conferred lawful presence on a smaller number of people than DAPA would have, it has nonetheless impacted the Plaintiff States and affected individuals in an equally important manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Next, the Fifth Circuit employed a test originating in the D.C. Circuit. This test considers the \"effect on those interests ultimately at stake in the agency proceeding,\" and whether a rule \"impose[s] 'derivative,' 'incidental,' or 'mechanical' burdens upon regulated individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"455\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Sec.

The court elaborated on the test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-309\">\n   [A] procedural rule generally may not encode [ ] a substantive value judgment or put[ ] a stamp of approval or disapproval on a given type of behavior, but the fact that the agency's decision was based on a value judgment about procedural efficiency does not convert the resulting rule into a substantive one. A corollary to this principle is that rules are generally considered procedural so long as they do not change the\n   <em>\n    substantive standards\n   </em>\n   by which the [agency] evaluates applications which seek a benefit that the agency has the power to provide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   Under this test, the Fifth Circuit reached the same conclusion as it had using the substantial impact test: DAPA and Expanded DACA were not procedural\n   rules. It looked to the fact that DAPA established \"the substantive standards by which the [agency] evaluate[d] applications which [sought] a benefit that the agency [purportedly] ha[d] the power to provide.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880129\" index=\"457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/931/77/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880129\" index=\"457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/931/77/#p107\">\n    at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same is true in this case. The five criteria by which DACA applicants are evaluated are clearly substantive standards and are no different than the DAPA criteria at issue in\n   <em>\n    Texas I.\n   </em>\n   What could be more of an inherent value judgment than requiring an individual to pass a background check? The DACA memorandum changes the substantive standards significantly by creating a broad new category of aliens for whom lawful presence and work authorization are available. It provides the criteria by which the agency allocates \"benefit[s] that the agency has the power to provide\": lawful presence and employability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880129\" index=\"458\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/931/77/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880129\" index=\"458\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/931/77/#p107\">\n    at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

First, in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , the DHS could not find one example of anyone who complied with all of the DACA requirements and was turned down for a discretionary reason. Second, some years later, Acting DHS Secretary Duke confirmed that \"USCIS has not been able to identify specific denial cases where an applicant appeared to satisfy the programmatic categorical criteria as outlined in the June 15, 2012 memorandum, but still had his or her application denied based solely upon discretion.\" [Pls. Motion for Prelim. Inj., Ex. 5 n.1, App. 22-23].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   The Plaintiff States have brought forth other evidence on this point as well. For instance, the USCIS Texas Service Center, which no longer handles DACA applications but did for many years, has never turned anyone down who met the June 15, 2012 criteria. [Doc. No. 284, Ex. 4]. The States have also presented hundreds of pages of DHS manuals and procedures that instruct, in painful detail, each step a reviewer should take and what types of evidence each reviewer may consider as evidence that the DACA applicant has satisfied each of the criteria. Further, the States point to the fact that if DACA applicants satisfy the criteria, they are not interviewed, as their applications are granted by the service centers sight unseen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Finally, there is the June 15, 2012 memorandum itself, which states that the USCIS should establish a clear and efficient process for exercising prosecutorial discretion on an individual basis, but then instructs the agency on exactly what factors to use. For example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-334\">\n   3. With respect to the individuals who are\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   currently in removal proceedings and meet the above criteria, and pass a background check:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-335\">\n   \u2022 USCIS should establish a clear and efficient process for exercising prosecutorial discretion, on an individual basis, by deferring action against individuals who meet the above criteria and are at least 15 years old, for a period of two years, subject to renewal, in order to prevent low priority individuals from being placed into removal\n   proceedings or removed from the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-336\">\n   \u2022 The USCIS process shall also be available to individuals subject to a final order of removal regardless of their age.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-337\">\n   \u2022 USCIS is directed to begin implementing this process within 60 days of the date of this memorandum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   Thus, while employing the words \"prosecutorial discretion,\" the memorandum itself lays out who is eligible-\"the individuals ... who meet the above criteria and pass a background check\"-and then instructs the reviewer to grant eligible applicants deferred action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   The Defendant-Intervenors respond by pointing to the increase in the denial rate of DACA applicants in recent years. They also have provided this Court with multiple emails from instructors who teach the DACA processors that suggest that a shift may have taken place following this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   in early 2015. [Doc. No. 215, Ex. 1]. After that decision, DHS began denying (even in the Texas Service Center) more applications than it had in the first three years of the DACA program. The Defendant-Intervenors claim this was due to an exercise of discretion, as opposed to applicants not meeting the established criteria, but this conclusion is not necessarily proven by facts. Finally, Defendant-Intervenors produced a post-\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   email from one instructor that, while talking about the established criteria, said that she liked to \"jokingly say our standard is whether or not you would want to live next door to the person.\" [Doc. No. 215, Ex. 1, at 405]. While this Court will not opine on whether the \"neighbor\" standard is one capable of refined precision or even whether it would be legally enforceable, if it were routinely being used, it would certainly be indicative of a discretionary standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   The Court recognizes that one of two possibilities is more than likely true regarding the current state of discretion in the DACA program. It could be that the June 15, 2012 memorandum still controls, and that any discretion being exercised is not based upon outside factors, but rather solely on whether an applicant satisfies the June 15, 2012 \"programmatic\" criteria. It could also be that, following this Court's opinion in 2015, the DHS may have begun to shift its process\n   <footnotemark>\n    106\n   </footnotemark>\n   to allow its application processors more discretion. If the former scenario is actually the case, then the only actual discretion in the DACA program was that exercised by the Secretary in 2012, and her instructions have bound everyone since that time. This kind of situation has been considered by the D.C. Circuit, which found similar guidelines to be substantive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-341\">\n   In applying the second criterion in\n   <em>\n    Pickus v. U. S. Board of Parole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3686446,129894\" index=\"484\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/507/1107/\">\n    507 F.2d 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1974), we took into account the language, structure, and calculable effect of the statement. The Parole Board claimed that guidelines specifying many of the factors it used in deciding whether to parole prisoners were \"general statements of policy.\" The court disagreed, on the grounds that those guidelines \"were of a kind calculated to have a substantial effect on ultimate parole decisions....\n   <em>\n    Although they provide no formula for parole determination, they cannot help but focus the decisionmaker's attention on the Board-approved criteria. They thus narrow his field of vision, minimizing the influence of other factors and encouraging decisive reliance upon factors whose significance might have been differently articulated had Section 4 (now section 553 of the APA) been followed.\n   </em>\n   \" In sum, the court held, the guidelines \"\n   <em>\n    are substantive agency action, for they define a fairly tight framework to circumscribe the Board's statutorily broad power.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   The evidence presented thus far has not convinced the Court which of these alternatives, if either, is accurate. Some evidence suggests that individual decision-makers are not exercising, and are not allowed to exercise, discretion. That evidence, however, is not convincing, either in its quantity or quality, and there is at least some evidence presented by the Defendant-Intervenors to the contrary-that the actual individuals screening the applications may have some discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   That being the case, this Court looks to which party bears the burden of proof.

Based on the evidence in the preliminary injunction record, the Court holds that the Plaintiff States have not made a \"clear showing\" that those processing DACA applications are not free to exercise discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Weighing a Policy that Imposes Rights and Obligations but Allows Discretion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   Given this Court's findings-that DACA imposes rights and obligations, but that the Plaintiff States have not clearly shown an absence of discretion-the resolution of the \"policy statement vs. substantive rule\" test turns on whether the criteria set out in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   are factors to consider or are like elements of a cause of action, where each must be proven. The Plaintiff States argue that their evidence on the first criterion-whether DACA confers rights and imposes obligations-is so overwhelming that they need not prevail on the second-whether a lack of discretion exists. In other words, they claim that the evidence in the first category is so persuasive that the Court can rule that DACA is not a statement of general policy\n   as a matter of law regardless of the eventual outcome concerning the issue of discretion. The Defendant-Intervenors respond by arguing that an adverse finding (or a failure by the States to carry their burden of proof) on the \"discretion\" prong means the Plaintiff States have not made a clear showing that DACA is a substantive rule. If the States have not proven DACA is a substantive rule, then the States have failed to prove a violation of the procedural requirements of the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   The Court finds the evidence concerning the exercise of discretion to be equivocal and lacking the quality that one would require to find that it equates to a clear showing. Conversely, the evidence that DACA confers rights and imposes obligations is overwhelming. The program confers lawful presence and an entire array of benefits on DACA recipients. Additionally, it imposes upon the States and the Government multiple obligations, many of which flow automatically from DACA's award of lawful presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   While this Court need not decide the merits of the procedural aspects of the APA claims, given its eventual ruling below, it may be in the best interests of all concerned and in the interests of any subsequent appeal for this Court to indicate its holding on these issues. The Fifth Circuit specifically described these factors as \"criteria\" that \"[w]e evaluate.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the criteria were to be considered as elements that must be proven, there would certainly be clearer ways to express that concept. Consequently, this Court holds that the Plaintiff States need not prove (or clearly show a likelihood of success) on both criteria; rather this Court evaluates each independently. Despite the less-than-convincing evidence regarding discretion and given the overwhelming evidence concerning the rights conferred and the obligations imposed, this Court holds that the Plaintiff States have shown DACA to be a substantive rule that should have complied with the notice-and-comment procedures required by the APA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   In conclusion, despite not ruling on the Take Care Clause issue, this Court finds that, as a matter of law, the Plaintiff States have made a clear showing they are likely to succeed on the merits at trial. For the purpose of a preliminary injunction, they have shown their substantive APA claim is likely to be successful. The DACA program contradicts statutory law and violates the APA because the INA directly addresses the issues of lawful presence and work authorization for aliens in this country but does not include those designated by DACA. Furthermore, the award of lawful presence and an entire array of federal, state, and local rights and benefits to aliens Congress has deemed inadmissible flies in the face of the INA's goals of deciding who comes to and stays in the United States, who works in the United States, and who qualifies for government-funded benefits. This Court also holds that the States have shown a likelihood to succeed on their procedural APA claim. As the Fifth Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , and as is basically true here, \"[a]t its core, this case is about the Secretary's decision to change the immigration classification of millions of illegal aliens on a class-wide basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This program, which allots lawful presence and its corresponding benefits to more than a million aliens, must be committed to the decision-making power of Congress, not\n   the Executive alone. Nevertheless, if implemented by the Executive Branch, it must at least undergo the formalities of notice and comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   For these reasons, the Court holds that the Plaintiff States have clearly shown, as a matter of law, that they are likely to succeed on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Preliminary Injunction Factor Two: Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   In addition to showing a likelihood of success on the merits on at least one of their claims, the Plaintiff States must also demonstrate a \"likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury\" if the injunction is not granted, and the \"inadequacy of remedies at law.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Shea v.

The Plaintiffs' injury need not have already been inflicted or be\n   <em>\n    certain\n   </em>\n   to occur; a strong threat of irreparable injury before a trial on the merits is adequate for a preliminary injunction to issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 11A Charles Alan Wright et al.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2948.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   The Plaintiff States allege they will suffer injuries due to various causes should an injunction be denied. First, they claim that they are paying millions of dollars annually to provide for uncompensated healthcare expenses and other state-provided benefits. [Doc. No. 5, at 41]. Additionally, they will suffer increased law-enforcement and educational costs \"imposed by aliens who would not remain in the country but for the removal of their unlawful-presence status and work authorizations.\" [Doc. No. 218, at 49]. Further, they claim the increased presence of the DACA recipients causes injury to their legal residents, as the DACA recipients diminish the chances for employment for legal residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   The Plaintiff States maintain that these expenses are incurred on a daily basis and accurately claim that they stand little or no chance of getting monetary compensation from the federal government for these costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7651203\" index=\"498\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/661/#p662\">\n    106 F.3d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 662 (5th Cir. 1997). This category of damages was rejected by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   because the damages claimed were actually projected costs and were not based on the actual policy being challenged or the costs associated with the DAPA or Expanded DACA recipients. Instead, these damages were allegedly being caused by other aliens, who, inspired by the existence of DACA and the prospect of DAPA, chose to illegally come to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   In the instant case, Texas has proven that it suffers some amount of costs associated with increased social services expenses that are directly associated with the continued presence of its over 100,000 DACA-recipient residents. The Defendant-Intervenors maintain that Texas, the only state that attempted to prove damages, did not suffer any real loss on a net basis, and that these costs are more than offset by the economic advantages that Texas derives from the DACA recipients, a position on which they may ultimately be proven\n   correct when this case is tried on the merits. Despite the fact that Defendant-Intervenors purport to question the existence of these damages, their own expert, Dr. M. Ray Perryman, estimated that DACA recipients cost the State of Texas $250,007,800 annually. The States maintain, again based upon studies proffered to the Court by Defendant-Intervenors, that if DACA was rescinded, at least twenty percent of DACA recipients would return to their home country. [Doc. No. 219, Ex. 22, at 13]. The Plaintiff States reasonably conclude that they would save that same percentage of their annual DACA-related expenditures if the program was enjoined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   Most of Texas's own testimony and evidence concerning DACA recipients is encompassed in much larger figures that relate to costs incurred by the State for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   illegal aliens or for unaccompanied alien children. Nevertheless, whatever holes were created by the deficits in the evidence offered by the States' experts were filled in by the testimony of the Defendant-Intervenors' experts. The Plaintiff States presented evidence that these costs continuously accrue as DACA continues, in addition to the argument that DACA continues to incentivize more illegal immigration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    109\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stated differently, Texas argues that DACA's continued existence allows its recipients to stay legally in the United States, which continues to compel Texas to expend funds that it would not otherwise be compelled to spend. Indeed, several of the Defendant-Intervenors went to public school in Texas, each of which cost the State of Texas thousands of dollars per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   Defendant-Intervenors have gone to great lengths to prove that, aside from these costs, the overwhelming majority of DACA recipients provide a decidedly positive economic effect on the states in which they reside. The Defendant-Intervenors claim that the States might actually suffer more irreparable damage should the DACA recipients lose their lawful presence and have produced multiple affidavits and studies which do indeed support that claim. That is certainly the position voiced by New Jersey and a large number of amicus curiae states. Texas, however, argues that the Fifth Circuit held that the \"standing analysis is not an accounting exercise.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"499\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court quoted this language previously when it found that Texas has standing; however, that does not necessarily mean that the Plaintiff States automatically have proven that they will suffer irreparable harm-a necessary element for obtaining a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   The Court at this stage need not go through an extensive accounting exercise that analyzes each of the Plaintiff States' economic arguments and each of the Defendant-Intervenors' rebuttals. Initially, a plaintiff is not precluded from claiming damages in one area just because there is a possibility that the damages might ultimately be offset in another. Moreover, the States correctly argue that the law allows a lesser level of precision and proof in a case where the proof of damages is clear and where the movant has clearly shown a likelihood of success on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Fla. Med. Ass'n. Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Health, Educ. &amp; Welfare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498759\" index=\"500\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/601/199/\">\n    601 F.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203 n.2 (5th Cir. 1979). This Court has reviewed the evidence of ongoing damages and finds it sufficient to support a finding of injury that is irreparable, as there is no source of recompense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   Nevertheless, this does not resolve the issue. The Defendant-Intervenors claim the States' delay in bringing this action forecloses any injunctive relief. All concede that Texas and the other Plaintiff States dismissed\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   after the DHS agreed to phase out DACA. The DHS attempted to make good on this representation in September of 2017, and it would have but for the injunctions and vacatur issued by district courts in California, New York, and the District of Columbia. Texas filed this lawsuit in May of 2018, less than a week after the district court in Washington, D.C. indicated in\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   that it would order DACA continued indefinitely into the future. (California and New York had issued their respective injunctions as to current DACA recipients and renewals in January and February of this year.) Why the first two injunctions did not provoke the filing of this case, but the D.C. order did, is beyond the knowledge of this Court. One would suspect it was because the order in\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   indicated the D.C. court would order the DHS to process new DACA applications in addition to the renewal applications the other courts had already mandated. This Court finds that Texas's reaction to this group of injunctions was timely, especially when one takes into account the fact that it had just dismissed its 2014 lawsuit based upon the Government's promise to dissolve the DACA program. If these were the only relevant considerations, the Court would stop here. This timeline, however, is not the only one the Court finds important.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   The DACA program was instituted in June of 2012. No pertinent congressional or agency action regarding this program (except for the repeated refusal of Congress to enact a corresponding DREAM Act and the 2014 attempt to expand DACA) has taken place in the meantime; nor have there been any impediments suggested or convincing reasons given for the fact that the Plaintiff States waited almost six years to file this suit. The Plaintiff States correctly argue that the statute of limitations has not expired as to their claims and that they are still able to assert their rights as sovereign states to protect their citizens from the ongoing damages that they perceive flow from the DACA program. In fact, the Defendant-Intervenors more or less concede the accuracy of this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   The problem with this proposition, however, is that the issuance of a preliminary injunction is a matter of equity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11A Charles Alan Wright et al.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2947 (\"[T]he grant or denial of a preliminary injunction remains a matter for the trial court's discretion, which is exercised in conformity with historic federal equity practice.\").

Similarly, delays have been found to be reasonable if the parties have been trying to reach an amicable resolution short of litigation.\n   <em>\n    Tex. Children's Hosp. v. Burwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248155\" index=\"512\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/76/224/\">\n    76 F.Supp.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2014). This Court will assume, as the Plaintiff States claim, that the resolution of the 2014\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   lawsuit accounted for some of the delay in this matter, but even that does not explain the nearly six-year wait. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiff States sought and received extraordinary relief that enjoined certain amendments intended to expand DACA-these amendments were adopted in the same manner DACA was and were subjected to most of the same arguments being made in this lawsuit. The Plaintiff States have not explained why DACA itself was not included in that 2014 suit and why extraordinary interlocutory relief is warranted now, but could not have been sought in December of 2014. After all, when\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   was filed in December of 2014, DACA had been in effect for over two years, and almost all of the proof as to why DAPA and DACA's expansion were legally defective was either based upon arguments equally applicable to the original DACA or based upon facts derived from the implementation and operation of DACA. At oral argument in this case, counsel for the States voiced what can best be described as \"strategic reasons\" for not including DACA in\n   <em>\n    Texas I.\n   </em>\n   It may have been an effective strategy, but one's strategy\n   in a prior lawsuit does not legally justify delay in another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   One might argue that a finding of delay should not apply to those who have not yet applied, to those who are just \"aging-in\" to DACA eligibility, or to any future renewals. This Court disagrees. The States could have brought a lawsuit against the entire program in 2012 or anytime thereafter. Renewals occurred as early as 2014 and those claims could have been included in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   but were not. The entire population that could ever be eligible for DACA (absent the amendments that were enjoined in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   ) was fixed in 2012, and since that finite population is not growing and since a determination as to DACA's legality is ongoing, this Court does not consider the possibility of new applicants or renewals to be an emergent situation demanding injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   The Plaintiff States have put forth what would otherwise be sufficient proof of irreparable damage and have shown that they have no other viable legal remedy. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Plaintiff States cannot prevail on the legal element of irreparable harm due to their delay in pursuing the claims they now bring concerning DACA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Thus, in addition to demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm, a movant must show that it would suffer more harm without the injunction than the enjoined party would if it was granted. The award of preliminary relief is never \"strictly a matter of right, even though irreparable injury may otherwise result to the plaintiff,\" but is rather \"a matter of sound judicial discretion\" and careful balancing of interests of-and possible injuries to-the respective parties.\n   <em>\n    Yakus v.

Instead of maintaining the status quo, they want this Court to halt the operation of DACA. As noted in this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   , the existence of DACA in its 2012 configuration was and still is the status quo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303866\" index=\"523\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/86/591/\">\n    86 F.Supp.3d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 608 (S.D. Tex. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   In this case, the factor concerning significant hardship to the parties has a particular significance. The dissolution or the enjoining of the ongoing DACA program would have immediate effects-it would deprive the individual Defendant-Intervenors of their ongoing lawful status and their ability to work. The proposed injunction could cause the DACA recipients to lose their ability to travel within the United States and many other benefits that flow from lawful presence. For many, this could, in theory, make them susceptible to immigration proceedings and eventual removal where applicable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, New Jersey and those states, cities, and employers who find themselves in the shoes of New Jersey (a status which many of the amicus curiae purport to hold), could lose residents whom they consider to be valuable members of their communities or employees who are integral to various schools, municipalities, and industries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   Conversely, if the court were to enter an injunction, Texas and the other Plaintiff States would be able to escape the kinds of costs and damages that they have suffered and continue to suffer as a consequence of DACA. Nevertheless, due to the continued presence of a large illegal alien population (which would still include approximately eighty percent of the DACA recipients even based on the most favorable evidence), many of the secondary costs about which they complain would still remain. The Plaintiff States would still incur medical, education, and law-enforcement expenses, albeit to a lesser extent. The Plaintiff States may also have some resident workers who would gain job opportunities that they might otherwise not have, but others would still lose opportunities to individuals who are illegally in the country and are hired because they are less expensive than legal workers. According to the evidence, the number of illegal aliens would decrease due to the approximately twenty percent of DACA recipients who said they would leave the country, but the States, nonetheless, would still be forced to absorb the costs of those who remained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   When this Court weighs the evidence produced by all parties, it is convinced that both the third and the fourth factors favor maintaining the status quo and denying the injunction. This Court does not necessarily agree with some of the reasoning (and the bases given for the decisions\n   made) by the other courts that have addressed the rescission of DACA. Nonetheless, in each case in which an injunction or order of vacatur was issued and in this case in which an injunction is not being issued, the purpose of the orders was to maintain the status quo until a definitive decision could be reached. If this Court were to grant an injunction, it would upset that balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   Moreover, this Court used two time-worn sayings in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   and its associated hearings when it ruled that an injunction was warranted to stop the implementation of DAPA and Expanded DACA: \"one cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube\" and \"one cannot unscramble the egg.\" It enjoined those programs so that a decision could be reached on the front end, before individuals and society had developed a reliance on a program that would later have to be set aside. Here, the egg has been scrambled. To try to put it back in the shell with only a preliminary injunction record, and perhaps at great risk to many, does not make sense nor serve the best interests of this country. The States argue that any reliance on DACA was misplaced because DACA status was always revocable and because it did not confer any permanent rights. This Court does not dispute that premise based upon the language of the June 15, 2012 memorandum, but the reality of the situation is that it conferred lawful presence and numerous other benefits, and many DACA recipients and others nationwide have relied upon it for the last six years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   Some might engage in conjecture as to what this or any other court would have ruled if the Plaintiff States had challenged DACA in 2014 when\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   was filed, but conjecture is all that it would be. This case is taking place almost four years later, and throughout that time individuals have continued to apply for and renew their DACA status. The Plaintiff States may ultimately prevail and prove their right to declaratory relief, but given the delay in confronting DACA, and given that the interests of the Defendant-Intervenors and the public outweigh those of the Plaintiff States, the Court denies the request for preliminary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Casa de Maryland\n   </em>\n   , the court expressed the sentiment that the question of the eligibility of the DACA recipients to remain in the United States and to continue contributing their skills and abilities to the betterment of this country is an issue crying out for a legislative solution. This Court agrees. Nevertheless, the failure of Congress to act does not bestow legislative authority on either the Executive or Judicial Branches, and the need for legislation cannot take precedence over the application of the Constitution and the laws of the United States, which this and all other federal courts are sworn to uphold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   Counsel for the defendants and intervenors in\n   <em>\n    Texas I\n   </em>\n   argued that DAPA and Expanded DACA must be legal because Congress had not said otherwise-an argument that Justice Kennedy rightly described as \"upside-down\" and \"backwards.\" Transcript of Oral Argument at 24,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598061\" index=\"524\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2271/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (No. 15-674). Justice Kennedy's reaction that this proposition is upside-down is unassailable. It turns the entire Constitution on its head. The Defendant-Intervenors suggested at oral argument that oft times Congress rejected DREAM Act legislation because the proposals either made the recipients citizens or guaranteed them a pathway to some permanent status or because they included some other controversial provision. This Court has no means to determine why each Representative or Senator voted against a particular bill, but it is clear that someone in Congress could have introduced a bill that simply authorized\n   DACA-especially after the legal challenges to DAPA and Expanded DACA were sustained-and if Congress so desired it could have become law. This Court cannot view Congress's repeated rejection of the concept as an indication that DACA complies with its dictates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   That being the case, this Court is forced to view the DACA question just as one of the Defendant-Intervenors' experts did when asked to comment on the plaintiffs' decision not to challenge DACA in\n   <em>\n    Texas I:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-385\">\n   It's an interesting exclusion, given that the legal arguments for both\n   <em>\n    DACA and its 2014 spin-off for parents, DAPA, are basically identical\n   </em>\n   ....\n   <em>\n    It's hard for me to think of any ground striking DAPA that wouldn't apply to DACA\n   </em>\n   .... So why not challenge DACA? They might have worried [that] the court wouldn't want to strike down such a popular program. So they think go after DAPA and if they win, then they have a nice precedent to go after DACA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   Both assumptions appear to be correct. DACA and DAPA are basically identical, and there is no legal ground for \"striking DAPA that wouldn't apply to DACA\" (and certainly no legal ground for striking Expanded DACA that does not apply to DACA itself). Further, DACA is a popular program and one that Congress should consider saving. Unfortunately, the Judiciary is not the branch of government designed to salvage a program that should have emanated from Congress, or at the very least complied with the APA. The\n   <em>\n    Casa de Maryland\n   </em>\n   court cited a recent dissent from a Fourth Circuit decision that aptly expressed the need for judicial restraint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-387\">\n   The public debate over the Administration's foreign policy and, in particular, its immigration policy, is indeed intense and thereby seductively tempts courts to effect a politically preferred result when confronted with such issues. But public respect for Article III courts calls for heightened discipline and sharpened focus on only the applicable legal principles to avoid substituting judicial judgment for that of elected representatives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   <em>\n    Casa De Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522858\" index=\"525\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/284/758/\">\n    284 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   767 n.21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Int'l Refugee Assistance Project v.

Under most circumstances, a procedural right relaxes standing requirements, but that framework does not apply precisely here. The \"injury-causing party,\" the Government, continues administering the DACA program because they have been ordered to, rather than by their own volition. It therefore seems inaccurate to say that judicial relief will cause the Government to \"reconsider\" their decision to continue DACA-it has already reconsidered the decision by attempting twice to rescind the program.

No. 224, at 28-29] (citing\n    <em>\n     Texas v. United States\n    </em>\n    , No. B-94-228, at *7 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 7, 1995), for the proposition that \"the decision to cross the border without documented status results from the 'conscious actions of aliens,' rather than a policy decision of the U.S. government\"). The Court rejects this argument for two reasons. First, this is not a case where causation and redressability depend on the unmediated and untethered wills of DACA recipients. Their decisions are, in fact, both mediated by and tethered to DACA, as many DACA recipients have indicated that their decision to stay or leave the country turns on the continued existence of the DACA program. In that sense, the injury Plaintiff States complain about\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    caused by the DACA program and would be redressed, at least to some extent, if the program were to end. Second, the dissolution of DACA would void the DACA recipients' deferred action, making them removable. Though not every individual would be removed, some might, which would reduce the social services costs of which the Plaintiff States complain. Particularly under the relaxed causation and redressability standards this Court must afford the Plaintiff States under\n    <em>\n     Massachusetts v.

No. 288, at 16 n.4]. Defendant-Intervenors do not cite a case supporting the proposition that a\n    <em>\n     de minimis\n    </em>\n    injury is not an injury for Article III purposes. In fact, the opposite is true.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     OCA-Greater Houston\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275338\" index=\"573\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/604/#p612\">\n     867 F.3d at 612\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[T]he injury in fact requirement under Article III is qualitative, not quantitative, in nature.\" (citations omitted) ). Even if a\n    <em>\n     de minimis\n    </em>\n    injury was insufficient for Article III purposes, however, Defendant-Intervenors' criticism misses the point: the States' reliance on the survey is not to show that 683 specific individuals would leave, but rather that some of the people across the entire DACA population (115,000 of which live in Texas) would leave.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-446\">\n    Second, the Defendant-Intervenors claim that they personally would not leave if DACA ended, which they argue \"rebuts Plaintiffs' inferences from the Wong survey.\" [Doc. No. 288, at 17]. That fact only proves that some DACA recipients would intend to stay. It does not \"rebut\" the survey result that some would leave, which is the proposition the States seek to establish here. It also assumes that these recipients who are illegal aliens can stay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-447\">\n    Third, the Defendant-Intervenors claim that \"Texas has not shown that any use of public benefits are traceable to the DACA recipients whom Texas claims would leave the state.\" [Doc. No. 288, at 15]. In response to a similar traceability argument in the DAPA litigation, the Fifth Circuit invoked Texas's special solicitude under\n    <em>\n     Massachusetts v.

In\n    <em>\n     Gill\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court held that individual voters did not have standing to challenge \"the statewide harm to their interests in their collective representation in state legislature, and in influencing legislature's overall composition and policymaking.\" --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"577\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1931\">\n     138 S.Ct. 1916\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1931, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2018) (quotations omitted).

Many of these groups have provided this Court with amicus curiae briefs which, in addition to being helpful, are demonstrative displays of support. Indeed, this Court is likewise enamored with the thought of young people overcoming many hardships and hurdles and becoming productive members, if not leaders, of our communities. The Judiciary, however, is not the branch of government that can make decisions based upon the popularity of an idea or because many are sympathetic toward or biased against a particular group or program. Congress is the branch of government that weighs competing public sentiments when it enacts or refuses to enact legislation. Pointedly, if the Congressmen and women of New Jersey and of the states that have appeared as friends of this Court had voted for the dreamer population in this latest bill, it would have passed the House by a two-to-one margin.
