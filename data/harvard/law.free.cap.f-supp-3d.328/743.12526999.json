The homeowner returned home during the home invasion and noticed an unfamiliar Chevy Impala parked in his driveway with the engine running but nobody inside the vehicle. As the homeowner was investigating the Impala, he saw defendant's accomplice walk out of the garage that was attached to the house. The homeowner confronted the accomplice and told him to wait for the police to arrive. About five minutes after confronting the accomplice, the homeowner saw defendant run through his backyard away from his house. Defendant ran into the cornfield that was located beyond the homeowner's backyard. Employees at an industrial gravel pit bordering the cornfield saw defendant emerge from the cornfield soon after he fled the house. The police apprehended defendant at the gravel pit and brought him to the homeowner's house, where he identified defendant with 85 percent certainty as the man who fled through his backyard. Meanwhile, the police apprehended defendant's accomplice who had fled in the Impala. The police recovered items from the Impala that belonged to the homeowner and also found a pair of gloves outside the house next to a crowbar or chisel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, the homeowner testified that he was \"positive\" that defendant was the man who fled through his backyard on the day in question. A DNA expert testified that she tested the gloves found at the house and determined that the DNA recovered from the gloves matched defendant's DNA. The homeowner and his wife each testified that they did not give anyone permission to enter their house on the day in question. They further testified that when they searched their house after the home invasion, they observed that the sliding door that opened to the backyard had been unlocked and left open. The homeowners also testified that several items were missing and other items were relocated within the house. A camera, iPod, and laptop computer had been gathered into a beach bag and moved into the closet of their guest bedroom. The bag was found on top of a handgun that had been in the master bedroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    People v.

This evidence, at a minimum, established Petitioner's guilt on the charge of second-degree home invasion. Petitioner's girlfriend rented the vehicle that was left parked in the driveway during the break-in. Police found gloves containing Petitioner's DNA outside the house next to burglary tools. Numerous items of value were moved within the house or removed from the house. The homeowner confronted Petitioner's accomplice and told him to wait for the police to arrive. About five minutes later, the homeowner observed Petitioner run through his backyard away from the home into an adjoining cornfield. Employees at an industrial gravel pit next to the cornfield witnessed Petitioner emerge from the cornfield soon after he fled the house. The police arrested Petitioner at the gravel pit and brought him to the homeowner's house, where he identified Petitioner with 85-percent certainty as the man who fled through his backyard. This evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, clearly established Petitioner's involvement in the home invasion, either as a principal or as an aider and abettor, proving the offense of second-degree home invasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Petitioner argues, however, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for first-degree home invasion and felony-firearm because it did not establish any connection between Petitioner and the victim's firearm, which was recovered in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Petitioner's claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Moreover, the evidence supported the reasonable inference that during the commission of the home invasion and larceny, either defendant or his accomplice discovered a firearm belonging to the homeowner, possessed this firearm, and subsequently discarded the firearm along with other valuable items.\n   <em>\n    Although the prosecution was unable to present evidence linking defendant, rather than his accomplice, to the possession of the firearm\n   </em>\n   , the possession of the firearm was a natural and probable consequence of the intended home invasion. Because \"a defendant is liable for the crime the defendant intends to aid or abet as well as the natural and probable consequences of that crime,\" this evidence was sufficient to enable\n   the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant either possessed a firearm or aided and abetted his accomplice's possession during the home invasion. Thus, viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury verdict, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions of first-degree home invasion and felony-firearm, i.e., the jury could have found that the essential elements of the crimes were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    People v.

Appellate counsel filed a twenty-page appellate brief which raised the first four claims that Petitioner has presented in his petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 8-12. The first claim raised by appellate counsel was the sufficiency of evidence claim upon which this Court is granting relief in part. Petitioner has not shown that appellate counsel's strategy in presenting these four claims and not raising other claims was deficient or unreasonable. Moreover, for the reasons stated by the Allegan County Circuit Court in rejecting Petitioner's post-conviction claims and by the Assistant Michigan Attorney General in the answer to the amended petition for writ of habeas corpus, none of the claims raised by Petitioner in his post-conviction motion were \"dead bang winners.\" Because the defaulted claims are not \"dead bang winners,\" Petitioner has failed to establish cause for his procedural default of failing to raise these claims on direct review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMeans v.

Because Petitioner has not demonstrated any cause for his procedural default, it is unnecessary for the court to reach the prejudice issue.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Petitioner's sufficiency of evidence claim is insufficient to invoke the actual innocence doctrine to the procedural\n   default rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malcum v.

Mich. 2003). Because Petitioner has not presented any new reliable evidence that he is innocent of these crimes, a miscarriage of justice will not occur if the Court declined to review Petitioner's procedurally defaulted claims on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court grants Petitioner a writ of habeas corpus with respect to his first claim. The Court denies relief with respect to the remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court will also deny a certificate of appealability to Petitioner with respect to his second through seventh claims. In order to obtain a certificate of appealability, a prisoner must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). To demonstrate this denial, the applicant is required to show that reasonable jurists could debate whether, or agree that, the petition should have been resolved in a different manner, or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\n   <em>\n    Slack v.

When a district court rejects a habeas Petitioner's constitutional claims on the merits, the Petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims to be debatable or wrong.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508758\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/473/#p483\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508758\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/473/#p483\">\n    at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508758\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/473/#p483\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, when a district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner's underlying constitutional claims, a certificate of appealability should issue, and an appeal of the district court's order may be taken, if the Petitioner shows that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the Petitioner states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right, and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508758\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/473/#p483\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508758\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/473/#p483\">\n    at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508758\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/473/#p483\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The district court must issue or deny a certificate of appealability when it enters a final order adverse to the applicant.\" Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases, Rule 11(a), 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For the reasons stated in this opinion, the Court will deny Petitioner a certificate of appealability with respect to his second through seventh claims because he has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a federal constitutional right with respect to these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
