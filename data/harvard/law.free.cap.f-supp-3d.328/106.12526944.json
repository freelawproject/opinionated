(\"UBNS\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (Dkt. 60 at 3-5). Plaintiff alleges violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1983, the New York State Human Rights Law, New York Executive Law \u00a7\u00a7 290,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"NYSHRL\"), the United States Constitution, the New York State Constitution, and New York State common law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1). He raises six claims: (1) race and national origin discrimination and hostile work environment under Title VII; (2) retaliation under Title VII; (3) discrimination and retaliation under the NYSHRL; (4) discrimination and retaliation under \u00a7 1981 ; (5) discrimination and retaliation under \u00a7 1983 ; and (6) tortious interference with contract, employment, and prospective economic advantage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court are UBNS' and Dr. Levy's motion to dismiss all of Plaintiffs claims, except those arising under \u00a7 1981, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (Dkt. 63); the University and the Medical School's motion to dismiss all of Plaintiff's claims, except those arising under Title VII, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) (Dkt. 65); and Kaleida's motion to dismiss all of Plaintiff's claims pursuant to Rule 41(b), and, in the alternative, its motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims arising under \u00a7 1983 and New York common law (Dkt. 67). For the reasons set forth below, UBNS' and Dr. Levy's motion is granted in part and denied in part, the University and the Medical School's motion is granted, and Kaleida's motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are taken from the second amended complaint and assumed to be true for purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The University controls and operates the Medical School and the University at Buffalo Neurosurgery Group (\"UBNG\"). (Dkt. 60 at \u00b6 11). The UBNG is \"an academic neurosurgical group comprised of physicians and other healthcare employees who are part of the University's 'UBMD Physicians Group,' which boasts more than 500 doctors ... practicing medicine and teaching medical students and residents at [the]... Medical School and in area hospitals, including Kaleida facilities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The UBMD Physicians Group, also known as UBMD, Inc., \"provides marketing services to other physician practice groups associated with the University, including [UBNS].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). \"UBNS is a New York not-for-profit corporation associated with the University, providing academic support and is a clinician care component for the University.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Like UBNG, UBNS is part of the UBMD Physicians Group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). Kaleida \"is a large healthcare provider in Western New York\" that \"operates several hospitals and surgical facilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Kaleida's neurosurgeons are all associated with the University, and Kaleida publicly identifies Plaintiff as \"a Kaleida Health physician.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With the exclusion of Dr. Levy, Defendants \"have one or more agreements with each other defining their relationship and interrelation of operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). These agreements allegedly cover the management of \"surgical training ... for University medical students and clinical medical treatment for their joint patients,\" which includes \"billing and expenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"UBNS never identified itself ... as an entity separate or distinct from the University[,]\" and the University frequently \"works cooperatively or in a parent relationship to UBNS in investigating [discrimination]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   complaints.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16). Dr. Levy is \"a Caucasian individual ... employed by the University, UBNS, and Kaleida.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). He is a University professor, a physician with UBNG and UBNS, Chief of Neurosurgery at Kaleida, and Co-Director of Kaleida Health Stroke Center and Cerebrovascular surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff is of African and Southeast Asian origin and a doctor currently employed in Buffalo, New York, by the Delaware Medical Group, P.C., as its Director of Head and Neck/Skull Base Surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 32-33). He was previously employed by the University as a faculty member in the Departments of Neurosurgery and Otolaryngology at the Medical School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). The University compensated him and had the power to terminate his employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36). He was \"also considered an employee of Kaleida\" because Kaleida gave him certain privileges and asserted direction and control over his work performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37). Plaintiff received patient referrals from doctors employed by the University, UBNS, and Kaleida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendants should be considered his functional employers under the single integrated employer doctrine, the joint employer doctrine, or the interference liability doctrine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). First, Plaintiff alleges that \"the University, UBNS, and Kaleida, nominally separate entities, are actually part of a single integrated enterprise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). These entities work together \"to provide surgical services for medical training purposes,\" and they \"jointly hired [Dr. Levy]\" to fulfill this objective and delegated to him \"the power and control to hire and fire other doctors and staff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Furthermore, UBNS \"is under common ownership and management with the University,\" and is \"organized as a separate not-for-profit corporation\" only to comply with regulatory requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff points to one surgical training procedure as an example of the integrated activities of the University, UBNS, and Kaleida:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Dr. Levy] directed the location for the surgery to be [at] Kaleida; [Dr. Levy] had the surgery scheduled at Kaleida; [Dr. Levy] selected the doctors to perform the surgery, including Plaintiff; [Dr. Levy] directed that medical students form [sic] the University and [M]edical [S]chool be present for training via the surgery; [Dr. Levy] directed a specific protocol for the surgery, including what each doctor and staff member and medical student present was or was not to do during the surgery and the order of events that would occur within the surgery; [Dr. Levy] controlled the process for billing for the surgery and how each doctor was to be compensated; and [Dr. Levy] subsequently terminated Plaintiff's University faculty position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Alternatively, Plaintiff alleges that if the University, UBNS, and Kaleida are not a single integrated enterprise, then they should be considered his employers under the joint employer doctrine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). Specifically, Plaintiff claims that Dr. Levy appointed him to a position in the University where he \"was expected to train University medical students\" at \"Kaleida surgical operation facilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). These trainings occurred while Plaintiff engaged in surgeries alongside UBNS doctors, such as Dr. Levy, and were directed by UBNS and Dr. Levy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Levy terminated Plaintiff from his position for \"allegedly not following [Dr. Levy's] surgery protocol for the operation and for allegedly attempting to reschedule that surgery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Levy controlled the operation \"on behalf of UBNS and/or Kaleida,\" and \"all billings and compensation\n   for the operation had to be submitted and coordinated through UBNS and Kaleida.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, Plaintiff also alleges that the \"interference liability theory\" applies in this case because the University \"delegated its responsibility and duty of selecting, hiring, firing, managing[,] and scheduling its faculty members for training and teaching experiences to UBNS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the University, UBNS, and Kaleida allowed Dr. Levy \"to engage in severe and pervasive discrimination against women and people of color,\" and \"to retaliate against Plaintiff for having complained of these wrongful acts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40). He also alleges that those defendants \"interfered with his employment with the University., Kaleida, and Delaware Medical Group.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff further alleges that \"[Dr. Levy] engaged in severe and pervasive harassment toward Plaintiff due to his race and national origin, and he has otherwise created a hostile work environment for dark-skinned employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff alleges two incidents in which Dr. Levy made inappropriate comments about race or national origin. First, Dr. Levy has referred to or allowed other individuals \"to refer to UBNS as 'BUNS,' an acronym for 'Brown University Neurosurgery' because of the prevalence of physicians of color in that department.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42). Second, on July 22, 2014, Dr. Levy \"stated that he felt like he was at a 'UPS convention' \" during an operation in which Plaintiff, Dr. Levy, and others participated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43-45). Plaintiff further alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Dr. Levy] was asked to repeat himself and he did so by stating, \"A UPS convention. Do you know what the UPS slogan is?\" He specifically turned to Plaintiff and directly asked, \"Do you know?\" to which Plaintiff replied that he did not. Next, [Dr. Levy] stated, \"What can\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   do for you?\" There were eight people, including Plaintiff, in the operating room that had brown skin tones and were of African-American, South-East Asian, or Middle Eastern descent or origin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 14, 2014, Plaintiff complained, by letter, about Dr. Levy to Dr. Michael E. Cain, Dean of the Medical School (\"Dean Cain\"), and Jody Lomeo, CEO of Kaleida, and requested an investigation into Dr. Levy's discrimination based on these comments and his \"other abusive and harassing conduct that ... creat[ed] the hostile work environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 51-52). Plaintiff alleges that Dean Cain (or his representative) released Plaintiff's letter to Dr. Levy on or before August 19, 2014, despite the University's policy of confidentiality in such matters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53). Ten days later, on August 29, 2014, Dr. Levy terminated Plaintiff's faculty position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Kaleida failed to investigate Dr. Levy and Plaintiff's letter complaint (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54), and that the University, \"[d]espite ... issuing a report that strongly suggests that Plaintiff's complaints are accurate and that Dr. Levy committed wrongful acts,\" has not taken \"definitive action,\" other than to require Dr. Levy to participate in anti-discrimination training (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55). Plaintiff further alleges that, as retaliation for complaining about Dr. Levy, Defendants each \"have interfered with the employment relationship between Plaintiff and Delaware Medical Group\"-his current employer-by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , ceasing referrals to Plaintiff or the Delaware Medical Group, and by conspiring to interfere with his employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that, for several years, he had been building a specialized, shared practice-called the \"Specialty Practice Group\"-with employees of the\n   University, UBNS, and Kaleida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57). According to Plaintiff, \"the University, Kaleida, UBNS, and [Dr. Levy] ... are unlawfully and improperly exerting pressure on the other doctors in their employ and under their control to retaliate against and punish Plaintiff for having made complaints about [Dr. Levy] and to interfere with his employment relationship with the Delaware Medical Group.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58). Plaintiff contends that Defendants,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"acted with a discriminatory animus toward [him] and retaliated against him for complaining of the discrimination and hostile work environment by interfering with his compensation and employment with Delaware Medical Group and interfering with his economic advantage and contracts with other doctors employed and/or controlled by Defendants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he \"filed a timely charge of discrimination against Defendants\" with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). Plaintiff's second amended complaint does not specify the respondents named in the EEOC charge, nor is the identity of the respondents apparent from two right-to-sue letters that are attached to the amended complaint. (Dkt. 60-1 at 2-3). Those right-to-sue letters were dated September 16, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on December 15, 2015, by filing a complaint. (Dkt. 1). On March 15, 2016, Plaintiff filed his first amended complaint. (Dkt. 21). On April 15, 2016, UBNS and Dr. Levy moved to dismiss the first amended complaint. (Dkt. 32). A motion hearing was held before the undersigned on October 28, 2016, at which time the Court requested additional briefing from both parties and reserved decision. (Dkt. 38). The parties submitted additional briefing on November 14 and 15, 2016. (Dkt. 39; Dkt. 40; Dkt. 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On May 19, 2017, the Court issued its Decision and Order regarding UBNS' and Dr. Levy's motion. (Dkt. 42). The Court dismissed Plaintiff's Title VII claims asserted against UBNS and Dr. Levy, in his individual capacity, the NYSHRL claims asserted against UBNS, the \u00a7 1983 claims asserted against UBNS and Dr. Levy, and the New York common law claims asserted against UBNS and Dr. Levy, all without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32). The Court also denied that portion of the motion seeking to dismiss the NYSHRL claims asserted against Dr. Levy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On October 19, 2017, Plaintiff filed his second amended complaint, which is the operative pleading in this case. (Dkt. 60). On November 2, 2017, UBNS and Dr. Levy, the University and the Medical School, and Kaleida filed three separate motions to dismiss. (Dkt. 63; Dkt. 65; Dkt. 67). Plaintiff has opposed each motion. (Dkt. 72; Dkt. 73). Oral argument was held on May 23, 2018, at which time the Court reserved decision. (Dkt. 84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     UBNS' and Dr. Levy's Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 63-2 at 9-12). Plaintiff argues that the \"law of the case\" doctrine should apply because the Court already addressed this very issue in its May 19, 2017, Decision and Order, and determined that at this stage of the proceedings, it was unclear whether the \"identity of interest\" exception to the exhaustion requirement had been satisfied.

(Dkt. 42 at 11). While acknowledging that Plaintiff had been represented by counsel during the EEOC proceedings, the Court also found that the allegations regarding how UBNS related to the other Defendants was unclear, and thus, the second factor could not yet be resolved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ultimately, the Court was unable to determine whether the exception applied to the first amended complaint based on the limited allegations set forth in that pleading at the motion to dismiss stage of this litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 (\"Because the amended complaint contains only limited allegations concerning the relationships between UBNS and the named respondents, and because of the procedural posture of this case-a motion to dismiss, before any discovery has occurred-the\n   limited record does not permit a determination as to whether the identity of interest exception applies.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   UBNS does not explain why the Court should reach a different conclusion in light of Plaintiff's second amended complaint. In fact, UBNS makes largely the same arguments that were presented in its first motion to dismiss on this issue. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 32-3 at 9-12,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 63-2 at 9-12). By contrast, Plaintiff's new allegations only reinforce the apparent overlap between UBNS and the other named respondents. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 15 (\"At all times, [UBNS] presented itself to Plaintiff as part of the UBMD Physician's Group and that it was therefore one-in-the-same as UBNG, a part of the University and the Medical School.\"), 16 (\"The University routinely and as a practice passes copies of discrimination complaints to UBNS and works cooperatively or in a parent relationship to UBNS in investigating complaints.\"), 27 (alleging that the \"University delegated its responsibility and duty of selecting, hiring, firing, managing and scheduling its faculty members for training and teaching experiences to UBNS\") ). If anything, these new allegations strengthen any \"identity of interest\" that may exist between UBNS and the parties named in the administrative charge. Indeed, if UBNS presented itself to Plaintiff as a component entity of the University and the Medical School, this factor may weigh in favor of a finding that the identity of interest exception has been met.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1801814\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/931/203/#p209\">\n    931 F.2d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the relevance of \"whether the unnamed party has in some way represented to the complainant that its relationship with the complainant is to be through the named party\" (quotation marks and citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff's second amended complaint still does not contain any allegations relating to whether UBNS was prejudiced by its absence from the EEOC proceedings (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42 at 11 (\"The amended complaint lacks any allegations relevant to the third [factor] ....\") ), and UBNS, for its part, argues that it was \"clearly prejudiced by being prevented from initiating steps toward conciliation or resolution under the EEOC process\" (Dkt. 63-2 at 11). Moreover, even considering Plaintiff's additional allegations that suggest a stronger relationship between UBNS and the University, the degree of overlap between these two entities is still unclear at this stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The \"identity of interest\" question is not always easily resolved in the context of a motion to dismiss, and when that is so, courts generally permit the case to proceed against the unnamed party.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

However, Plaintiff has also alleged that Dr. Levy interfered with Plaintiff and UBNS' contract to develop a specialty practice group. (Dkt. 60 at \u00b6 99;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Plaintiff's second amended complaint alleges that Dr. Levy terminated Plaintiff's University faculty position after Plaintiff submitted a letter complaint responding to, among other things, Dr. Levy's alleged use of racially-charged comments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 50-52, 58). Plaintiff further alleges that the University \"delegated its responsibility and duty of selecting, hiring, firing, managing and scheduling its faculty members for training and teaching experiences to UBNS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). Indeed, Dr. Levy is employed by UBNS, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33), and it was Dr. Levy who terminated Plaintiff's University faculty position (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50). In addition, Dr. Levy was also aware of Plaintiff's letter complaint several days before Plaintiff was terminated, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53), and, according to Plaintiff, UBNS routinely investigates complaints of discrimination alongside the University (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In light of Dr. Levy's employment relationship with UBNS and UBNS's alleged receipt of Plaintiff's discrimination complaints, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that UBNS was aware of Dr. Levy's purported discriminatory behavior, and yet still condoned, assented to, or otherwise failed to prevent Dr. Levy from terminating Plaintiff's position in an allegedly retaliatory manner. Counsel for UBNS and Dr. Levy urges the Court to find that Plaintiff has failed to allege that the viability of the\n   contract between UBNS and Plaintiff was tied to Plaintiff's continued status as a University faculty member. The Court acknowledges that Plaintiff does not expressly allege that the fulfillment of this contract was dependent upon his position with the University. However, given Plaintiff's alleged association with University and UBNS employees in developing a shared, specialty practice, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57), as well as UBNS's alleged responsibility under the agreement to contribute financial resources and specialty physicians toward developing the specialty practice group, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96), it is not unreasonable to infer-in light of UBNS's close relationship with the University-that Plaintiff's status as a University faculty member was essential to the establishment of the specialty practice group. Under the circumstances presented, and in giving Plaintiff the benefit of every reasonable inference, the Court cannot say, at this stage of the litigation, that Dr. Levy's allegedly wrongful termination of Plaintiff's University faculty position did not \"intentionally induce[ ]\" UBNS \"to breach or otherwise render performance of [the] contract with ...

Therefore, UBNS' and Dr. Levy's motion to dismiss the sixth cause of action is granted only insofar as Plaintiff has attempted to allege a tortious interference with contract claim against UBNS based upon the alleged interference with the contract between Plaintiff and Dr. Leonardo, but the motion is in all other respects denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The University and the Medical School's Motion to Dismiss is Granted in its Entirety\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Pursuant to Local Rule 15(c), a party seeking to file an amended pleading \"must file and serve the amended pleading upon the existing parties within fourteen (14) days of entry of the order granting the motion.\" L.R.

(Dkt. 67-2). Plaintiff filed and served his amended pleading the next day. (Dkt. 60). Plaintiff argues that he should be excused from any negative consequences of this untimely submission because his untimeliness was not due to bad faith, resulted in no prejudice to Kaleida, and was merely \"due to an errant docketing date.\" (Dkt. 72 at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \"[T]he Second Circuit has held that while district courts lack the authority to enlarge statutory filing limits, they do have the discretion to excuse non-compliance with the Local Rules, which are not statutes, in the interest of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Total Energy Corp. v.

Since Plaintiff's three-day delay was a negligible oversight that neither inflicted undue prejudice upon Kaleida nor was the result of bad faith conduct, the Court-in the exercise of its discretion-will disregard Plaintiff's noncompliance with the Local Rules. Accordingly, to the extent Kaleida's motion requests that Plaintiff's second amended complaint be dismissed in its entirety for the failure to comply with Local Rule 15(c), it is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Dkt. 67-3). In regards to Plaintiff's fifth cause of action, Kaleida argues that the second amended complaint fails to sufficiently allege that it was acting \"under color of state law,\" as required by \u00a7 1983. (Dkt. 67-3 at 9). Plaintiffs response reprises many of the same arguments made in opposition to UBNS' and Dr. Levy's motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 72 at 10-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Plaintiff does not allege that Kaleida is a state actor. Instead, he alleges that all Defendants, \"acting under color of state law, infringed upon and deprived [Plaintiff] of his Constitutional rights ....\" (Dkt. 60 at \u00b6 89). In opposition to Kaleida's motion, Plaintiff again argues that the allegations in the second amended complaint raise a plausible inference that \"there is an unwritten policy that permits ... unlawful discrimination, harassment, [a] hostile work environment[,] and retaliation\" at the work place. (Dkt. 72 at 12). Apparently relying upon his most recent allegations that all Defendants should be considered his direct and/or functional employers, Plaintiff also argues that he has sufficiently alleged the existence of \"joint activity, joint employer-status, a conspiracy, domination and control by Defendants over other Defendants and action under the color of law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   For similar reasons outlined above relating to UBNS' status as a private entity acting \"under color of state law,\" Plaintiff plausibly alleges that Kaleida is a private entity acting \"under color of state law\" pursuant to the \"entwinement theory.\" Plaintiff alleges that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Kaleida's neurosurgeons\n   are associated with the University. (Dkt. 60 at \u00b6 17). In addition, Dr. Levy, who is a state actor employed by the University, is the \"Chief of Neurosurgery\" and the \"Co-Director of Kaleida Health Stroke Center and Cerebrovascular surgery\" at Kaleida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). Indeed, while Plaintiff was employed as a faculty member in the Departments of Neurosurgery and Otolaryngology at the Medical School, he was \"also considered an employee of Kaleida.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 37). Plaintiff further alleges that Dr. Levy appointed him to a position at the University where he \"was expected to train University medical students\" at \"Kaleida surgical operation facilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). Plaintiff also alleges that Dr. Levy \"controls the staffing of [neurosurgery ] operations by ... Kaleida staff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). Furthermore, Dr. Levy directed at least one such surgery to be performed at Kaleida, where students enrolled at the University and the Medical School were expected to attend for training purposes, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23), and it was this surgical procedure that gave rise to the instant action (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 44-53). Dr. Levy was responsible for directing similar training procedures for the University and the Medical School's students at Kaleida facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Giving Plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences at this stage of this litigation, the Court finds that Plaintiff has set forth sufficient factual allegations that permit the Court to infer that Kaleida was pervasively entwined with the State due to the substantial overlap between Kaleida's neurosurgeons and those associated with the University, the University's extensive use of Kaleida's facilities, and Dr. Levy's direct control over Kaleida's operations and personnel management.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch v.

Again, the Court concludes only that Plaintiff has set forth sufficient factual allegations that raise a plausible inference that Kaleida, though a private entity, acted \"under color of state law,\" and thus, Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claim may proceed against Kaleida. The Court does not opine upon whether Plaintiff will ultimately prevail on his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Therefore, to the extent Kaleida requests that Plaintiff's fifth cause of action be dismissed in the absence of sufficient allegations of \"state action,\" Kaleida's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Tortious Interference with Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Kaleida also argues that Plaintiff's sixth cause of action should be dismissed because Plaintiff has failed to allege that Delaware Medical Group, P.C. breached its contract with Plaintiff. (Dkt. 67-3 at 10). Plaintiff's opposition papers recite a litany of allegations establishing the existence of oral agreements between himself and UBNS, Dr. Leonardo, and Delaware Medical Group, P.C. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 72 at 13-14). However, Plaintiff's responsive papers fail to point out any allegations that Kaleida procured an actual breach of any contract by Delaware Medical Group, P.C. In fact, the only paragraph in the second amended complaint that alleges Kaleida's specific interference with a contract is paragraph\n   106, where Plaintiff alleges that Kaleida \"interfered with [Plaintiff]'s employment agreement with the Delaware Medical Group, P.C.\" (Dkt. 60 at \u00b6 106). However, this paragraph does not allege that any wrongful action by Kaleida caused Delaware Medical Group, P.C. to breach its employment agreement with Plaintiff-indeed, Plaintiff was still employed by Delaware Medical Group, P.C. at the time he filed the second amended complaint.
