Leighton, United States District Judge\n   THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. # 42]. Plaintiff Leonard Peltier claims Defendants violated his first amendment rights when they prematurely removed four of his paintings from a Department of Labor and Industries exhibit promoting Native American heritage month. [Dkt. # 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Leonard Peltier is a Native American convicted of murdering two FBI agents and is serving a life sentence. Peltier has become an established painter during his more than 40 years in prison. Leonard Peltier's son, Chauncey\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , manages an art gallery featuring Leonard's paintings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Timothy Church is the public affairs manager of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. Defendant Joel Sacks is the Director of L &amp; I. Defendant Jay Inslee is the Governor of Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2015, L &amp; I held a month-long Native American heritage event at its Tumwater office. Chauncey Peltier agreed to loan four of Leonard Peltier's paintings for the event, and the paintings were exhibited in the L &amp; I building's rotunda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Soon after exhibiting Peltier's art, L &amp; I received at least three complaints from people upset that it was promoting an artist who had been convicted of murdering two FBI agents. Two of these complaints were from former FBI agents. L &amp; I removed Peltier's paintings two weeks before the exhibit was over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Leonard (and Chauncey) Peltier sued, claiming the removal violated Leonard's federal and Washington State constitutional rights. He also sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants seek summary judgment on all claims. They argue that the display was L &amp; I's speech-not Peltier's-and the first amendment does not apply to government speech. [Dkt. 53 at 2]. Defendants Sacks and Inslee argue that Peltier's claims against them fail as a matter of law because they were not personally involved in removing Peltier's paintings. All Defendants argue that no reasonable jury would find that removing the paintings was outrageous, and that they did not intentionally inflict emotional distress on Peltier. They argue that Peltier's negligence claim fails because there is no tort duty sounding in negligence arising from the constitution. Defendants also argue that there is no private cause of action for violations of Washington's constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Peltier argues that his paintings were his speech, not the government's. He argues that Sacks and Church took responsibility for removing the paintings, and that Inslee must have participated in the decision to remove them because he is the \"highest decision-maker in the state.\" Peltier argues that Defendants acted with an \"extreme attitude\" toward his first amendment rights, and with \"reckless disregard\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   for the emotional distress that censoring his art would cause. He argues that Defendants owed him a duty to not \"trample on his first amendment rights,\" which should give rise to a negligence claim. Peltier concedes he has no private claim for money damages under the Washington constitution; he now seeks a (mandatory) injunction requiring L &amp; I to display his paintings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

There, a City's refusal to include a religious group's artwork in a city monument did not violate the First Amendment because the monument was government speech.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pleasant Grove\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n     555 U.S. 460\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The monument consisted of several different art pieces relating to the history of the city, including some pieces that were donated by private citizens. Because the City set a clear \"message\" for the monument-the City's history-and erected it permanently in a public park, the monument was government speech. While government approval was an important factor in determining whether the government speech doctrine applied, it certainly was not the only factor. The overall focus in\n    <em>\n     Pleasant Grove\n    </em>\n    was on whether a reasonable observer would view the statement made to be a statement by the government.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Eagle Point Educ.

In the context of a permanent monument at a public park there was little chance that observers would fail to appreciate the identity of the speaker. Thus, the monument was government speech as a\n    matter of law.\n    <em>\n     Pleasant Grove,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n     555 U.S. 460\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at 471,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    In this case, the identity of the speaker is not so clear. Promotional materials for the heritage month event advertised Peltier individually, encouraging onlookers to \"come see art by the renowned Native American artist Leonard Peltier,\" and including a link to Peltier's website. Other materials for the event advertised Native American dance performances, story telling, movie screenings, and discussions. A reasonable observer could have seen the event poster and believed that the speakers were the Native American artists that were listed and promoted individually. Likewise, an observer who saw the poster promoting Peltier's paintings certainly could have identified the intended speaker as Peltier. At the very least, it would not have been clear to an observer that Peltier's art exhibit, and other individually promoted performances, were actually L &amp; I \"speaking.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    To the extent that government approval of speech supports a government speech defense, L &amp; I simply could not have \"effectively controlled\" or \"exercised final approval authority\" over the entirety of speech disseminated during the Native American Heritage Month event. L &amp; I certainly could not have controlled the speech within a discussion or a dance performance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Viewed in the light most favorable to Peltier, the evidence supports a finding that L &amp; I provided a forum for groups and individuals to exercise private speech. The Native American Heritage Month celebration was therefore not government speech. Thus, the extent to which the Government can control speech depends on the nature of the relevant forum.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Traditional public fora are those places which \"by long tradition or by government fiat\" have been devoted to assembly, debate, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.\n    <em>\n     Perry Educ.

Defendants initially found no reason to exclude Peltier's paintings from the Native American heritage month event, despite discussing\n    the risk of controversy beforehand. Nor were Defendants concerned about the paintings during the first two weeks of the event. Defendants decided that Peltier's paintings conflicted with \"L &amp; I's message\" only after receiving complaints, reaching out to those who complained, and \"listening carefully to their thoughts and concerns.\" In other words, whether artwork fell within L &amp; I's intended purpose of celebrating Native American heritage seemingly depended on the approval or disapproval of outside viewers.
