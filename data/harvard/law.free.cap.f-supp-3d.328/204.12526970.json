The plaintiff alleges retaliation in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"RA\"), the New York State Human Rights Law (\"NYSHRL\"), the New York City Human Rights Law (\"NYCHRL\"), the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Article 1 \u00a7 8 of the New York State Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendants move to dismiss all of the plaintiff's claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 8.) She was fired on August 15, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) Two years before her termination, on September 24, 2014, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights for the United States Department of Education (\"OCR\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) In the complaint, the plaintiff alleged that P.S. 195 - the school where she worked - failed to provide adequate services for, or proper evaluation of, special-needs students.(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-35.) After several months, on April 6, 2015, OCR asked the plaintiff if she would agree to mediate her claim against the school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) The plaintiff declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) OCR asked again on September 18, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) The plaintiff again refused to mediate and asked OCR to continue its investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Eleven days after the plaintiff's second refusal to mediate, on September 29, 2015, she began receiving letters of reprimand from her school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) The letters alleged misconduct and unprofessional behavior for a variety of reasons, including neglect of her professional duties, unprofessional conduct, general misconduct, unsatisfactory lesson plans, and insubordination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Within a month of her decision not to mediate, she also received a negative performance evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45(d).) In her entire career, she had never before received a reprimand letter or a negative evaluation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff received sixteen\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   letters of reprimand and three negative evaluations over the following five months.(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 44-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Approximately five months after receiving her first letter of reprimand, on February 18, 2016, the plaintiff received a letter from the BOE informing her that she was being brought up on disciplinary charges under New York State Education Law \u00a7 3020-a. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45(s).) The letter informed her that she was banned from all BOE schools during the pendency of the action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This letter came only a few days before OCR was scheduled to visit P.S. 195 to investigate the plaintiff's complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Because she was barred from the school, she was not present during OCR's investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff's \u00a7 3020-a proceeding took place over four days in April 2016. (J.W. Reiter Decl. Ex. A, at 1 [hereinafter \u00a7 3020-a Opinion].) The charges brought against the plaintiff were all based on the plaintiff's interactions with one student and that student's family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Compl. \u00b6 45.) The allegations were: (1) the plaintiff failed to follow school protocol when the student would not enter the classroom and the plaintiff contacted a school aide to take care of the student; (2) the plaintiff repeatedly called the student's parent; (3) the plaintiff told the student's mother, \"[y]our daughter has mental problems\"; (4) the plaintiff spoke inappropriately to and antagonistically towards the student's mother; and (5) the plaintiff had her students write get well cards to the student and sent the letters and an application for home school instruction to the student's home. ( \u00a7 3020-a Opinion at 2-3.) These charges were based on only three of the sixteen reprimands the plaintiff received between 2014 and 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 45(c), (f), (p).) During the hearing, the plaintiff noted that she believed she had been targeted by the school because she had lodged complaints against it. ( \u00a7 3020-a Opinion at 11.) She argued that her complaints caused the administration to view her as a \"meddler\" and \"someone who stuck her nose where it didn't belong.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 15, 2016, the plaintiff's \u00a7 3020-a hearing concluded. (Compl. \u00b6 45(u).) The hearing officer found that the plaintiff was guilty of dealing with the student at issue inappropriately, harassing that student's parents, and sending unwelcome packages to the student's home. ( \u00a7 3020-a Opinion at 19-30.) Based on the finding of misconduct, the plaintiff's employment was terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.) The hearing officer made no specific finding on whether the school had retaliated against the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiff then filed a proceeding in the New York State Supreme Court pursuant to Article 75 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, seeking to vacate the hearing officer's decision. (Compl. \u00b6 57.) The Supreme Court denied the petition. (J.W. Reiter Decl. Ex. C, at 23.) The plaintiff then appealed that ruling to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court where that appeal is still pending. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A. Fuchs berg Decl. Ex. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendants move to dismiss the Complaint on three grounds. First, they argue that the plaintiff is collaterally estopped from bringing her retaliation claim because it was already litigated during the \u00a7 3020-a proceeding. Second, they claim that the plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to succeed on her retaliation claims. And third, they assert that there is no individual liability for violation of the RA and ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendants argue that all of the plaintiff's claims should be dismissed under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. They contend that the plaintiff is attempting to relitigate claims that she lost after a full and fair \u00a7 3020-a hearing. The plaintiff responds that her retaliation claim was \"neither actually nor necessarily decided\" at the \u00a7 3020-a hearing and, therefore, collateral estoppel does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating an issue that the party previously litigated and lost.\n   <em>\n    Parklane Hosiery Co. v.

There is no indication that the hearing officer addressed, much less decided, whether the charges leading to the plaintiff's termination were driven, even in part, by retaliatory intent.

The plaintiff's \u00a7 3020-a hearing involved only a small fraction of the reprimands and none of the negative evaluations that the plaintiff received. Indeed, the hearing only produced evidence of the plaintiff's interactions with one child resulting in three of her sixteen reprimands. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 45(c), (f), (p).) Therefore, the hearing officer had no occasion to consider whether the thirteen additional reprimands and the three negative evaluations were retaliatory. Those incidents of alleged retaliation could not be precluded by collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, the defendants' motion to dismiss based on collateral estoppel is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendants also argue that the plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim under the ADA, the RA, the NYSHRL, the NYCHRL, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, or Article 1 \u00a7 8 of the New York State Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plaintiff has withdrawn her claim under the ADA.

To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the RA and NYSHRL, the plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in a protected activity, (2) her employer was aware of this activity, (3) the employer took an action disadvantaging the plaintiff, and (4) a causal connection exists between the alleged adverse action and the protected activity.\n   <em>\n    Treglia v.

The plaintiff alleges exactly that. (Compl. \u00b6 41 (\"Plaintiff's election to pursue her [OCR] complaint was known to Defendants.\").) That allegation is wholly plausible. The BOE was the object of the ongoing investigation and was presumably aware of those proceedings. Moreover, the plaintiff declined two offers to mediate and it is plausible that the BOE - the other party of the mediation - would have also been asked to participate in the mediations. Thus, the plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to show that the defendants knew about her complaint to OCR and her decision not to mediate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   With respect to the third element, the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded that adverse actions were taken against her. The defendants contend that the only adverse actions against the plaintiff were (1) the \u00a7 3020-a charges and hearing, and (2) the termination of the plaintiff's employment. The defendants' assertion ignores the deluge of reprimand letters and negative evaluations that the plaintiff received after declining to mediate her OCR claim, all of which constitute adverse actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry.
