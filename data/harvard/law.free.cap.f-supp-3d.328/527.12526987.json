Marvin Quattlebaum, Jr., United States District Judge\n   Before this Court is the Motion for Summary Judgment of Defendant Christie Michelle Acosta, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Michael Jason Dunn (\"the Estate\") (ECF No. 13), Plaintiff Scottsdale Insurance Company (\"Scottsdale\")'s Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 72), and Scottsdale's Motion to Strike Third Defense or Alternative Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 75.) The Court held a hearing on these motions on May 22, 2018, and has considered the arguments of the parties, as well as the briefing submitted and the entire record in this case. For the reasons set forth herein, this Court DENIES the Estate's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 13), GRANTS Scottsdale's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 72), and finds as MOOT Scottsdale's Motion to Strike Third Defense of Alternative Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The motions before the Court arise out of a declaratory judgment action commenced by Scottsdale pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against defendants GS Thadius, LLC d/b/a The Bar (\"The Bar\"), NEM, Inc. d/b/a/ Sandy Monkey (\"Sandy Monkey\"), William J. Muse (\"Muse\"), Sharon Cumbie (\"Cumbie\"), and Christine Michelle Acosta, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Michael Jason Dunn (\"the Estate\") (collectively, the \"Defendants\") for the purposes of determining whether the Assault and/or Battery exclusions of two insurance policies issued to The Bar and the Sandy Monkey respectively, preclude coverage for the Estate's claims in connection with a lawsuit filed in the Court of Common Pleas for Horry County brought by the Estate on July 21, 2017 (\"Underlying Lawsuit\"). The Court's jurisdiction is based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because there is diversity of citizenship among the parties and the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of $75,000. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Underlying Lawsuit alleges that Michael Jason Dunn (\"Decedent\" or \"Estate's Decedent\") sustained injuries when he was run over by an SUV driven by Janelle Castillo (\"Castillo\") after being knocked unconscious during a brawl that occurred in the parking lot of the Sandy Monkey. (ECF No. 1-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) According to the Underlying Lawsuit, Castillo had been drinking heavily at two or more bars prior to the incident. (ECF No. 1-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.) According to the declaratory action complaint, Scottsdale is providing a defense to The Bar, the Sandy Monkey, Muse, and Cumbie in the Underlying Lawsuit under a reservation of rights. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 19.) Scottsdale issued the policies of both The Bar and the Sandy Monkey for commercial general liability (\"CGL\") and liquor liability coverage, subject to the terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions of the Policies. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 20.) An Assault and/or Battery Exclusion applies to both Policies' general liability coverage parts and liquor liability coverage parts. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) Scottsdale contends that coverage in this case is excluded under the CGL coverage parts of The Bar Policy and the Sandy Monkey Policy pursuant to the Liquor Liability Exclusions, and further contends\n   that coverage is excluded under the CGL coverage parts and liquor liability coverage parts of The Bar policy and the Sandy Monkey Policy pursuant to the Assault and/or Battery Exclusions (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.) Accordingly, Scottsdale seeks a declaration that it has no defense or indemnity obligation to Defendants under the respective Policies. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 31.) Scottsdale also contends that the claims and damages are precluded under the Policies' punitive or exemplary damages exclusions (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Estate moves for summary judgment on the grounds that the incident underlying the declaratory judgment action falls within the insuring agreement, meaning that the Assault and/or Battery Exclusions do not preclude coverage. (ECF No. 13-1.) The Estate, therefore, contends this declaratory judgment action is subject to dismissal. In what is effectively a mirror image motion, Scottsdale also moves for summary judgment, maintaining that the undisputed material facts demonstrate that the Underlying Lawsuit arose out of an assault and/or battery as those terms are used in the respective policies. (ECF No. 72.) Thus, Scottsdale contends it is entitled to a declaration that the alleged damages in the Underlying Lawsuit are excluded from coverage, and, therefore, Scottsdale does not have any defense or indemnity obligations with respect to the suit. (ECF No. 72 at 1.) In sum, both Scottsdale and the Estate contend there are no genuine issues of material fact and ask this Court to determine, as a matter of law, whether (or not) Scottsdale has a duty to defend or indemnify Defendants in the Underlying Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Scottsdale also moves to strike the Third Defense of Defendants the Sandy Monkey, Muse and Cumbie asserted in their answer to the complaint, or alternatively, for partial summary judgment, on the ground that these Defendants have not offered any facts to support an affirmative defense of waiver on the part of Scottsdale. (ECF No. 75.) Replies and responses have been filed and the Court has thoroughly considered them in reaching its conclusions as set forth herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Summary Judgment:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A court shall grant summary judgment if the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The complaint alleges that \"a dispute arose inside The Sandy Monkey which led to a fight ... which escalated into a brawl\" in the parking lot of the Sandy Monkey. (ECF No. 1-3 at \u00b6 10.) It further alleges that \"Decedent tried to be a peacemaker between the participants of the fight\" and \"in the process, he was rendered unconscious by one of the combatants and lay motionless in the parking lot.\" (ECF No. 1-3 at \u00b6 11.) Defendant Castillo was allegedly sitting in her SUV during the fight when one of the fight participants, her boyfriend or male acquaintance, got into her car. (ECF No. 1-3 at \u00b6 12.) Allegedly intoxicated after having consumed \"large quantities of alcoholic beverages\" at Defendants' bars, \"she then drove off, running over the Decedent's head, causing great bodily harm which ultimately led to his death.\" (ECF No. 1-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.)

The Policies specifically states that the insurance does not apply to \"injury\" or \"bodily injury\" arising from \"Assault and/or Battery committed by any insured, any employee/ \"employee\" of any insured, or any other person.\" (ECF No. 1-1 at 36; ECF No. 1-2 at 43.)

Scottsdale contends that it has no duty to defend because the allegations and damages in the underlying suit are excluded from coverage by the Policies' Assault and/or Battery Exclusions. (ECF No. 72 at 1.) Scottsdale maintains that it is clear that the Decedent's death arose from an assault and battery within the meaning of the exclusions, i.e., the brawl that rendered him unconscious and put him in a position where Ms. Castillo could have run over him in the parking lot. (ECF No. 72-1 at 13, 15-16.) Just as vigorously, the Estate argues that the death was proximately caused by Ms. Castillo running over the Decedent in her intoxicated state which was caused by the act of the bars overserving her liquor. (ECF No. 13-1 at 7-8.) The Estate further claims that there is no evidence in the record to support an assertion that the impact between Ms. Castillo's vehicle and the Decedent was an \"assault and battery,\" as Ms. Castillo was not indicted intentional assault and battery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 13-1 at 5-6.)

Those cases drew a connection between \"caused by\" and the immediacy and direct nature of the damage. For example,\n   <em>\n    Canopius US Ins., Inc. v. Middleton\n   </em>\n   involved an insurer's duty to defend and indemnify based on several underlying state court actions filed against a nightclub regarding a shooting on the premises. The relevant CGL policy contained an assault and battery exclusion at issue in a declaratory judgment action brought by the insurer. The court concluded the first filed civil action alleged an injury arising from an assault or battery, in that the underlying complaint indicated that the gunfire arose from an assault or battery, even though the victim was not directly involved in the dispute.\n   <em>\n    Canopius US Ins., Inc. v.

The second set of state court actions did not specify the circumstances that led to the gunfire on the night of the incident. Thus, a question arose as to the intent of the shooter in light of the state law definitions of assault and battery.

Ultimately, the court considered the chain of events as set forth in by the record and the undisputed fact that the shooter fired the gun in reaction to being chased out of the saloon following an altercation. The court concluded that where the shooter \"unintentionally struck decedent when firing 'randomly' at the side of the Saloon, the causal link between the assault and decedent's death is immediate and direct ... therefore the court finds that decedent's death 'arose from' the assault within the meaning of the Policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Ins.

In light of the Policies' language, the Court cannot just proceed as though the brawl never happened. Thus, the Court returns to the underlying complaint itself to evaluate whether there is an \"immediate and direct\" link between the initial assault and the subsequent act of Ms. Castillo in running over the decedent with her vehicle. The complaint alleges that Ms. Castillo was driving off and away from the fight once her boyfriend, who had been a direct participant in the fight, entered her vehicle. (ECF No. 1-3 at \u00b6 10-12.) In this light, the injury to Decedent was \"caused by\" him being knocked unconscious by the fight and Ms. Castillo's act of running over the decedent as she fled from the fight, at the direction of her male companion who was in the fight. (ECF No. 13-2 at 2.) Ms. Castillo's alleged conduct is neither isolated nor independent from the Decedent being knocked unconscious. Instead, the relationship between the assault and battery and the ultimate injury, based on the record before the Court, was immediate and direct. It, therefore, arose from the assault and battery as contemplated under the policy exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court finds the South Carolina Court of Appeals decision in\n   <em>\n    Sphere Drake InsuranceCompany v.

Factually similar to the instant matter, two men got into a fight inside the club and were thrown out of the club into the parking lot where they continued fighting. One of the intoxicated fight patrons and his brother got into an SUV in the parking lot. Subsequently, the intoxicated driver jumped a curb and hit a number of individuals who were not involved in the fight. The defendants, injured individuals, argued that there were material disputes of fact as to whether the underlying damages arose of assault or battery. The court concluded that: (1) the fact that the intoxicated driver was not formally charged with assault and battery, and (2) that hitting the injured defendants with the SUV may or may not qualify as assault and battery were irrelevant to the analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174419\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/181/810/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174419\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/181/810/\">\n    at 815-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the Court noted that \"Defendant cannot seriously dispute they were hit because they were unfortunately caught in the crossfire of an ongoing altercation ... But for the fight that started inside Mambo's and moved into the parking lot, Defendants would not have been injured. The theories of liability alleged in the complaint all rely on injuries that arose from assaults and batteries that began inside the nightclub and continued in the parking lot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174419\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/181/810/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174419\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/181/810/\">\n    at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding that the policy language was clear in this regard, and rejecting the claim that the injured defendants' injuries could be attributed to other distinct causes such as negligence of the club.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Burlington Ins. Co. v.

The Court finds this decision persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Based on the above, the Court finds Scottsdale is entitled to summary judgment against Defendants. The allegations and alleged damages in the Underlying Lawsuit are excluded from coverage by the Policies' Assault and/or Battery Exclusions which apply to the CGL and Liquor Liability forms. Accordingly, Scottsdale does not have any defense obligations to any party in connection with the Underlying Lawsuit. The undisputed evidence shows that an assault or battery occurred in this case and that the Decedent was injured in connection with the event. The complaint itself acknowledges that Castillo was involved, in some way, in the bar fight and altercation that took place. The chain of events is immediate and direct in that regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court has carefully considered the Estate's Motion which maintains that the Decedent's death did not \"arise out of\" and was not \"caused by\" an assault or battery, but was instead the result of the Decedent being \"run over by a drunken driver to whom Scottsdale's policyholders had been [serving] alcoholic beverages.\" (ECF No 13-1 at 13.) As has been fully analyzed above, the proper analysis for this Court in determining the applicability of the exclusions in the relevant insurance policies must take into account the initial bar fight in the sequence of events. It is important to note that this analysis is not for the purposes of determining \"legal liability,\" as it might pertain to the Underlying Lawsuit. It is possible that Defendants have legal liability in that action. The Court takes no position on that issue. The analysis here is for the purposes of determining Scottsdale's potential obligations under the policies. (ECF No. 13-1 at 9.) \"Although the injuries may have been caused by the negligent acts of the defendant, that does not necessarily mean that they did not arise out of an assault and/or battery.\"\n   <em>\n    Catlin Specialty Ins. Grp. v.

June 8, 2017) (internal citations omitted)(declaring that the assault and battery enforcement of a CGL policy precluded insurance coverage in a matter arising out of a bar fight). Because the facts and circumstances alleged in the underlying complaint, even if proved, fall outside of the policies' coverage in that they trigger the assault and/or battery exclusion, the Estate is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Scottsdale's claims. Thus, the Estate's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Having found that Scottsdale has no duty to defend, it also necessarily finds that it has no duty to indemnify Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penn-Am.

However, as noted above, the Court is not deciding liability for the underlying action in state court. It is only considering the coverage obligations under the Policies. In doing so, this Court is \"limited to the interpretation of the contract made by the parties, regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or failure\n   of the parties to guard their rights carefully.\"\n   <em>\n    Sphere Drake Ins.

Considering the Policies, the allegations of the Underlying Lawsuit, and South Carolina law, the Court finds that the Assault and/or Battery exclusions apply. Therefore, Scottsdale has no duty to defend or indemnify Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Estate's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 13) is DENIED; and Plaintiff Scottsdale's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 72) is GRANTED. For the reasons stated above, the court declares that, under the terms of the Policy, Scottsdale has no duty to defend and no duty to indemnify the Defendants in the Underlying Lawsuit. Accordingly, the Court need not rule on Scottsdale's Motion to Strike the Third Defense or Alternative Motion for Partial Summary Judgment regarding Sandy Monkey's waiver defense and the adequacy of Scottsdale's reservation of rights letter. That Motion is now MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   IT IS SO DECLARED AND ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Scottsdale does not seem to be adopting the position that the Assault and/or Battery exclusion applies based on Ms. Castillo's conduct or state of mind. It is clear to the Court that Scottsdale's position is instead that the original brawl referenced in the complaint was a \"but for\" cause of the Decedent's death. (ECF No. 79 at 6.) \"An assault is an attempt or offer, with force or violence, to inflict bodily harm on another or engage in some offensive conduct,\" and a battery is \"the actual infliction of any unlawful, unauthorized violence on the person of another, irrespective of its degree.\"\n    <em>\n     Mellen v.
