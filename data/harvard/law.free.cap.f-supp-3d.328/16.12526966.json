Plaintiffs are the widow, two children, and estate administrator of Michael Romano Jr., a member of the Carrozza faction of La Casa Nostra. Romano Jr. was murdered by individuals affiliated with Francis \"Cadillac Frank\" Salemme in 1994. Romano Jr. was mistaken for a rival Mafia leader, Enrico Ponzo, and shot at close range while changing a flat tire. Plaintiffs allege that Mark Rossetti, a mob leader aligned with Salemme who was also an FBI informant, had ordered the hit on Ponzo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs have brought suit against the United States under the under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202671\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , for failure to prevent the murder.

Accordingly, the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply, and Count 1 must be dismissed.

However, without plausible factual allegations demonstrating that the FBI had control over Mark Rossetti's actions, or affirmatively acted in some way that furthered his conduct, Romano Jr.'s survivors do not have a claim for money\n   damages against the United States. The government permits itself to be sued only under certain circumstances, and the circumstances here do not qualify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is GRANTED.
