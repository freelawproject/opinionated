In brief, the Court found that each of the three Plaintiffs was entitled to some measure of unpaid wages, prejudgment interest, liquidated damages, and/or statutory penalties, but that the measure of each was far less than had been sought. Counsel for Plaintiffs now move to recover attorney's fees, as well as the costs incurred in bringing this action.

The Pretrial Proceedings and the Bench Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Israel Gamero, Norberto Mastranzo, and Oscar Sanchez filed their complaint alleging federal and state labor law violations on April 7, 2015. (Dkt. # 1). Defendant Michelle Koo filed a notice of appearance and an answer on May 11, 2015 (Dkt. # 4, 5), and appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   in this case for approximately one year. Defendant Koodo Sushi Corp. filed an answer on June 8, 2016 (Dkt. # 47), after\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel entered a notice of appearance on its behalf and that of Defendant Koo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the first fourteen months of the case, a few things occurred: An initial pretrial conference was held on July 15, 2015, and a case management plan was endorsed by the Court the following day. (Dkt. # 13). The matter was referred to United States Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn for a settlement conference, and\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel was appointed on a limited-purpose basis to assist Koo with that conference. (Dkt. # 16-22). The matter did not settle, and the Court convened an in-person conference on February 10, 2016, to discuss outstanding discovery issues, and a telephonic conference on March 18, 2016, to discuss the setting of a trial date. (Dkt. # 39, 43 (transcripts) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   With the appointment of\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel to represent Defendants at trial, the Court held a second pretrial conference, on May 18, 2016, to set the matter down for trial. (Dkt. # 37 (transcript) ). Because of a variety of scheduling conflicts, an extended trial date of October 17, 2016 (Dkt. # 33), was set; in the interim, discovery was reopened on a limited basis, because so little discovery had been conducted while Koo was proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. # 46, 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Trial began on October 17, 2016, and continued for two additional days. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entries for October 17, 18, 20, 2016).

However, focusing on more recent decisions from this District, and finding none of the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   factors to counsel in favor of a higher rate, the Court concludes that a rate of $400 for Mr. Faillace is reasonable on the specific facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pineda\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Frisolino, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15 Civ. 3774 (GBD) (BCM),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203628898\">\n    2018 WL 3628898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

They include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 Precisely because Mr. Faillace has such extensive experience in filing and prosecuting wage and hour complaints, the Court rejects as unreasonable the 7.4 hours allocated to preparing and filing the Complaint in this matter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clark Fee Decl., Ex. A, Entries for March 27, 2015, and April 7, 2015). The Court observes in this regard that the Complaint was substantively indistinct from many that have been filed by\n   Mr. Faillace's firm with this Court. Accordingly, it will award only 3.5 hours for those efforts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Clark billed 1 hour for reviewing the case file, apparently after Ms. Gutierrez departed the firm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clark Fee Decl., Ex. A, Entry for August 31, 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will not task Defendants with fees occasioned by changes within Plaintiffs' legal team.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Santos billed 4.5 hours for attending depositions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clark Fee Decl., Ex. A, Entry for October 10, 2016). Mr. Clark billed the same time, and billed also for preparing for those depositions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360453\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/102/511/#p520\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Entries for October 7, 2016, and October 10, 2016). The Court will only credit the time to Mr. Clark.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Clark billed 19.5 hours under the nondescript heading \"Preparation re Trial,\" and an additional 2 hours under the slightly-more-descriptive heading \"Preparation re Trial, Deps.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clark Fee Decl., Ex.

Based on the Court's observations of the conduct of trial, and considering as well the hours billed for similar (if not the same) work by Ms. Santos, the Court reduces the aggregate figure of 21.5 hours to 10 hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Clark and Ms. Santos have very different figures for the amount of time they were engaged in the actual trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clark Fee Decl., Ex. A, Entries for October 17, 2016, October 18, 2016, and October 20, 2016). The Court will use Ms. Santos's lower figures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Clark and Ms. Santos jointly billed 13 hours for the preparation of Plaintiffs' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clark Fee Decl., Ex. A, Entries for January 5, 2017, January 9, 2017, January 11, 2017, January 12, 2017, and January 13, 2017;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 75). However, the document itself comprises 33 pages of proposed findings and conclusions and a two-page chart. More importantly, substantial portions of the document were basic legal precepts that seemed cut and pasted from other documents. For this category of work, the Court will allow 8 hours, reducing each of Mr. Clark's and Ms. Santos's submitted entries by 2.5 hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Thus, the Court determines that the reasonable hours attributable to Mr. Faillace are 7.05; to Ms. Gutierrez are 34.9; to Mr. Clark are 46.45; and to Ms. Santos are 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Reducing the Award Based on Limited Success\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Multiplying the reasonable hours figures by the reasonable rates figures determined in the preceding sections yields a tentative fees award to Plaintiffs' of $31,480. Such an award, however, stands in stark incongruity to the actual recovery obtained, exclusive of prejudgment interest, of $24,937.12. Precisely for this reason, Defendants request that the Court reduce the fees awarded by 50 percent, to account for the fact that \"Plaintiffs succeeded in recovering a mere 5 percent of their alleged damages[.]\" (Def. Fee Opp. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Evaluation of Defendants' argument requires the Court to consider two conflicting lines of precedent.

Sept. 15, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After reviewing\n   <em>\n    Barfield\n   </em>\n   and its more recent progeny, the Court concludes that it will reduce Plaintiffs' tentative attorney's fees award by an additional 35 percent. In so doing, the Court wishes to make clear the bases of its decision. To a degree, the Court has considered the enormous disparity (even setting aside the change in the law concerning liquidated damages) between the damages Plaintiffs\n   originally sought and those they ultimately were awarded. But that is not the principal basis for the reduction. In no way does the Court wish to penalize counsel for bringing difficult cases - that is precisely why the FLSA and the NYLL contain fee-shifting provisions. And this Opinion should not be read to disincentivize attorneys from bringing these important cases, which in this District disproportionately affect poor and undocumented workers who can be easy prey for unscrupulous employers. What happened in the instant case, however, is different: Perhaps because of inattention, Plaintiffs' counsel did not adequately probe their clients before taking their claims to trial. As an immediate result, Plaintiffs' counsel argued for wildly outsized damages awards that were at odds with the facts of the case, even when presented in discovery with records of Plaintiffs' employment. More problematically, however, counsel allowed at least one Plaintiff to present perjured testimony at trial. The Court will not punish a plaintiff's attorney for bringing a marginal case, but it will punish the attorney for subverting, or permitting the client to subvert, the trial process. Thus, the Court will award attorney's fees in the amount of $20,462.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
