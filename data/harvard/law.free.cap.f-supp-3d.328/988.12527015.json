Petitioners appeared through their counsel, Thomas Weiss. Respondents appeared through their counsel, Carolyn Tsai and Susan Carson.

Dkt. 1, Ex. A at 1, 5, 11, 19. The petition was originally filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, and was removed to this court by respondents DHCS and its director, Jennifer Kent, on June 17, 2015, on the basis of federal question jurisdiction, where it was assigned to Judge Conti. Dkt. 1; Dkt. 11. Petitioners filed a motion to remand, arguing that there was no viable claim under federal law. Dkt. 4. They asserted that there is no viable federal claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A) (\"\u00a7 30(A)\") because \"the hospital petitioners do not have standing to enforce Section 30(A) in the federal courts,\" although they argued that state courts would have the power to decide the merits under state law.

The second cause of action is for \"declaratory relief\" in the form of a declaration that the reduced payments to Medi-Cal providers were invalid and unlawful for the reasons alleged in the first cause of action, and it seeks an order requiring that the Department \"disgorge and pay the Petitioners the monies collected under\" the reduced payments to Medi-Cal providers.
