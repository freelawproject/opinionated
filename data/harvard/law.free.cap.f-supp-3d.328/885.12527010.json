PALLMEYER, United States District Judge\n   This long-running patent dispute proceeded to trial a year ago. Plaintiff LoggerHead Tools, LLC prevailed, winning a jury verdict and a large damages award against Defendants Sears Holdings Corp. and Apex Tool Group, LLC, on claims that by selling the \"Max Axess Locking Wrench,\" Defendants infringed LoggerHead's patent for an \"Adjustable Gripping Tool.\" This court concluded, however, that the jury instructions were infected by an inaccurate claim construction. The court therefore vacated the jury's verdict, revisited the claim construction performed by Judge Darrah (to whom this case was previously assigned), and ordered a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LoggerHead Tools, LLC v. Sears Holding Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Cow.%209033\">\n    12 C 9033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206569629\">\n    2017 WL 6569629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. Dec. 22, 2017). Plaintiff now asks the court to reconsider its decision and reinstate the verdict. In the alterative, Plaintiff seeks summary judgment in its favor under the court's revised claim construction. For their part, Defendants Sears and Apex contend that the revised claim construction dictates summary judgment in their favor. For the reasons explained here, the court agrees. Plaintiff's motions are denied and Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Most of the relevant facts of this case are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff LoggerHead Tools, LLC, is the assignee of United States Patents No. 6,889,579 (hereafter \"'579 patent\") and No. 7,992,470 (hereafter \"'470 patent\"). Both patents are titled \"Adjustable Gripping Tool\" and both describe several wrench-like hand-tools designed to \"impart work upon a workpiece.\" (Defs.' L.R. 56.1 Statement of Facts (hereafter \"DSOF\") [504], at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) Two embodiments of such a tool appear below. Squeezing the tool's handles together causes several tooth-like \"gripping elements\" (labeled 26 in the images below) to close in on, and grip, a lug nut or other workpiece.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   ( '579 Patent, Ex. 1 to DSOF, Figs. 2, 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   These \"gripping elements\" are at the center of this litigation. The claims LoggerHead now asserts against Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   require \"at least one gripping element.\" Each gripping element, in turn, must include a \"body portion\" (34), an \"arm portion\" (36), and a \"force transfer element\" (38). The arm portion must be \"configured to engage\" certain other components of the tool (called \"guides\"); the body portion must be \"adapted for engaging the work piece\"; and the force transfer element must be \"contiguous with the arm portion.\" (DSOF \u00b6 13.) Two images of a set of gripping elements satisfying all these requirements appear below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ( '579 Patent, Fig. 1.; Pl.'s Tr. Demonst. Ex., Fig. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties agree that a gripping element need not be U-shaped, like those depicted above, to satisfy all the applicable requirements in the asserted claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Add'l Material Facts (hereafter \"PSAMF\") [507-2], at \u00b6 2; Defs.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Resp. to PSAMF [515], at \u00b6 2.) The key question in this case is whether a gripping element that is a solid rectangle-like the one in Defendants' accused product, discussed in greater detail below-includes the requisite \"arm portion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Prosecution History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The prosecution history of the '470 patent shows why the inclusion of an arm portion in LoggerHead's claims is significant. During prosecution, LoggerHead\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   distinguished its claims from the prior art by arguing that the prior art did not include an arm portion. The company made this argument in response to the U.S. Patent Office's rejection of certain claims on the grounds that they were anticipated by United States Patent No. 2,787,925 (hereafter \"Buchanan patent\" or \"Buchanan\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PSAMF \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   LoggerHead first applied for the '470 patent on April 11, 2005.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '470 patent, at [22]. The patent examiner rejected LoggerHead's claims as anticipated by Buchanan on April 16, 2008. The examiner stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that a feature of the Buchanan patent referred to as a \"plunger\" satisfies LoggerHead's proposed claims involving a gripping element,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the plunger \"includ[es] a body portion (24) adapted for engaging the work piece, an arm portion configured to engage one at least one guide and a force transfer element (26) contiguous with the arm portion.\" (PSAMF \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   LoggerHead raised several arguments in response to this rejection. The company argued, for example, that \"Buchanan does not show the elements united in the same way as disclosed in Applicant's claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.) The company also argued that Buchanan's \"plunger\" does not disclose both a body portion and an arm portion. LoggerHead attached the following images to its response to illustrate the differences between Buchanan's plunger and the gripping element LoggerHead claimed:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (LoggerHead Response of July 16, 2008, Ex. 3 to PSAMF, at LH-00001657.) The company noted that \"[t]he Examiner does not specify where Buchanan teaches an arm portion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, LoggerHead asserted, \"Buchanan's gripping element does not contain an arm portion. Instead, the force transfer element (i.e., pin 26) of\n   Buchanan is directly attached to the body portion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Buchanan's force transfer element, LoggerHead continued, \"is contiguous with the body, not an arm portion because Buchanan does not teach or suggest an arm portion.\" (PSAMF \u00b6 27.) LoggerHead concluded that the claims in its patent thus differed from Buchanan and should be allowed. \"For this reason alone,\" LoggerHead asserted, referring to the absence of an arm portion in the Buchanan patent, LoggerHead's \"claims are in condition for allowance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The company did not submit any claim amendments with this response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) On November 3, 2008, the Patent Office concluded that LoggerHeads' \"arguments ... are persuasive,\" and therefore withdrew the April 2008 rejection. (PSAMF \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Patent Office nevertheless did not immediately allow LoggerHead's proposed claims. Instead, the Office rejected the claims several more times based on \"art other than Buchanan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) On at least one such occasion, on January 26, 2010, LoggerHead chose to amend its proposed claims instead of contesting the rejection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For reasons that are not clear from the record, the patent examiner subsequently turned his attention back to the Buchanan patent. On October 13, 2010, the examiner again rejected several of LoggerHead's proposed claims as anticipated by Buchanan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.) Like the April 2008 rejection, the October 2010 rejection asserted that Buchanan discloses a gripping element that includes a \"body portion (24) adapted for engaging the work piece,\" an \"arm portion ... configured to engage one the at least one guide,\" and \"a force transfer element (26) contiguous with the arm portion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unlike the April 2008 rejection, however, which did not identify exactly where or how Buchanan's plunger discloses an arm portion, the October 2010 rejection identified the purported arm portion as being \"adj. 25\"-that is, adjacent to the indentation in the plunger identified by the number 25 in the image labeled \"Buchanan's Plunger\" above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response to the October 2010 rejection, LoggerHead again argued that \"Buchanan does not show all the elements united in the same way as disclosed in Applicant's claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.) LoggerHead also attached the same two images contrasting Buchanan's plunger with LoggerHead's gripping element that it had attached to its response to the April 2008 rejection. The company urged that, contrary to the patent examiner's assertion that an arm portion is \"adj[acent]\" to the indentation in Buchanan's gripping element, \"[n]o structure is adjacent to the crimping portion 25 of Buchanan except for the pin 26.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) LoggerHead then repeated its earlier contentions that \"Buchanan's gripping element does not contain an arm portion,\" and that Buchanan's force transfer element \"is contiguous with\n   the body, not an arm portion because Buchanan does not teach or suggest an arm portion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) LoggerHead again declined to amend its claims in response to the October 2010 rejection, and, on April 25, 2011, the Patent Office again withdrew its rejection, this time noting that \"[a]pplicant's arguments ... have been fully considered and are persuasive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.) In its ensuing Notice of Allowability, the Office explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [t]he art of record considered as a whole, alone, or in part, fails to provide,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , at least one gripping element including\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a body portion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    ...,\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     an arm portion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   configured to engage on said at least one guide\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and a force transfer element\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   contiguous with the body portion[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis and ellipses in original).)

The Max Axess Locking Wrench\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant Sears Holdings Corporation began retailing Loggerhead's \"Bionic Wrench\" in 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LoggerHead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206569629\">\n    2017 WL 6569629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. As described in this court's previous opinion, however, LoggerHead's business relationship with Sears soured in early 2012.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206569629\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Around the same time, Sears began working with Defendant Apex Tool Group to develop and market another adjustable gripping tool as part of Sears' \"Craftsman\" product line.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206569629\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Both Apex and Sears were aware of LoggerHead's patents during the development of this new adjustable gripping tool.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. At various points during the design process, Apex consulted with outside patent counsel John Owen about the possibility of an infringement action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DSOF \u00b6 25.) On at least one occasion, Owen suggested that Apex likely could avoid such a charge if it were to mimic certain design features from the Buchanan patent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In a letter dated March 8, 2012, for example, Owen explained that LoggerHead had \"argued multiple times during prosecution ... that\n   <em>\n    Buchanan's plungers do not have an arm portion\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    LoggerHead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206569629\">\n    2017 WL 6569629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (emphasis in original). \"This means,\" Owen wrote, \"that [LoggerHead] is very likely precluded from now asserting that a flat body structure like Buchanan's 'plungers' falls within the scope of [LoggerHead's] claims that require an arm portion on the gripping element.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206569629\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sears began retailing Apex's tool, the \"Max Axess Locking Wrench\" (\"Max Axess\" or \"MALW\"), in September 2012.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206569629\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Unlike the U-shaped gripping element depicted in LoggerHead's patents, the MALW's gripping element is a solid, block-like structure with a pin (that is, the force transfer element) driven through one end. (DSOF \u00b6 28.) Images of the MALW's gripping element appear below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The central dispute in this case is whether the MALW's gripping element includes the \"arm portion\" necessary for infringement of LoggerHead's patents. LoggerHead's expert witness, Dr. Jonathan Cagan, has testified that the MALW's gripping element does include an arm portion, which he distinguishes from the body portion using the image below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Pl.'s Statement of Material Facts (hereafter \"PSOF\") [501-2], at \u00b6 26.) According to Cagan, the \"body portion\" of the gripping element is simply the \"face\" that \"contacts the workpiece,\" plus \"enough substance to be able to impart force.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) Neither Cagan nor LoggerHead suggests that the pin is an arm portion. Rather, they argue that the arm portion is the area of the rectangular block outside the superimposed dotted lines in the image above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.) Significantly, these dotted lines do not appear on the MALW gripping element itself. According to Cagan, however, they correspond to \"the portion [of the gripping element] that is engaged within the guide ... and that abuts the force transfer element.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.) LoggerHead points to the following image, showing what the company describes as \"wear marks\" running along the sides of a MALW gripping element, to support its contention that Cagan's superimposed lines correspond to the portion of the gripping element that engages the tool's guide, and thus are fairly characterized as an \"arm portion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29 (circles added).) LoggerHead offers no evidence of any structural variation within the gripping element, or on the surface of the gripping element, that corresponds to the areas where the gripping element engages the guide. But Cagan nevertheless asserts that a person of ordinary skill in the art \"would understand that the structure configured to engage the guide is called an 'arm portion' because it performs an arm-like function by extending from the body portion to align the gripping element within the guide.\" (Cagan Decl. (I), Ex. 3 to Pl.'s Resp. Br. [507-3], at \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants challenge this interpretation and insist that the MALW's gripping element does not contain an arm portion. They contend-and their expert witness, Dr. Frank Fronczak, has emphasized-that the MALW's gripping element is \"a unitary, monolithic block that is not susceptible to being parsed into portions.\" (Fronczak Decl. \u00b6 13, Ex. 6 to DSOF.) According to Fronczak, a person of ordinary skill in the art (POSITA) \"would understand that a monolithic mass (such as a\n   solid block) could not satisfy the 'arm portion' limitation because a POSITA would not parse it into portions and because the block would not have any portions that project (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , protrude or jut out) from any other portions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) Although Defendants concede that the wear marks in the image above \"roughly correspond to the areas of the surface of the MALW gripping element where that piece can touch the guides,\" they deny that Cagan's superimposed lines correspond to the wear marks. (Defs.' Resp. to PSOF [506], at \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31.) Defendants note that the wear marks run the full length of the gripping element, while Cagan's alleged \"arm portion\" is cut off at the point where the alleged \"body portion\" begins. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31; Fronczak Decl. \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Judge Darrah construed the terms of the patents in August 2015, concluding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"arm portion\" means \"portion of a gripping element(s) configured to engage one of the guides and contiguous with a force transfer element.\"\n   <em>\n    LoggerHead Tools, LLC v.

In the alternative, Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of willfulness. In a lengthy opinion, the court explained that Judge Darrah's construction of \"arm portion\" was erroneous, and therefore re-construed the term as \"identifiable structure that projects from the body portion of the gripping element.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LoggerHead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206569629\">\n    2017 WL 6569629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-16.

Propriety of revisiting claim construction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   LoggerHead first suggests that the court committed \"clear legal error\" by revising Judge Darrah's construction of arm portion in the absence of any intervening change in the law or the discovery of significant new facts. To support this argument, LoggerHead cites several cases describing the variant of the law-of-the-case doctrine that governs reconsideration by one district judge of rulings by another district judge in the same litigation. The case law recognizes that \"[l]itigants have a right to expect that a change in judges will not mean going back to square one. The second judge may alter previous rulings if new information convinces him that they are incorrect, but he is not free to do so ... merely because he has a different view of the law or facts from the first judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Indeed, the law-of-the-case doctrine \"has greater force ... when there is a change of judges during the litigation and the new judge is asked to revisit the rulings of his predecessor,\" because \"[r]eluctance to admit one's own errors discourages casual reconsideration of one's own rulings-but not of another judge's rulings.\"\n   <em>\n    HK Systems, Inc. v.

The court began by observing that Judge Darrah's construction of \"arm portion\" \"simply repeat[ed] the words that already follow the word 'portion' in the text of the claim,\" and therefore assigned \"no independent meaning\" to the word arm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11. The court then noted that the patents' specifications do not define \"arm portion,\" and proceeded to consider how a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the term.

Based on these sources, the court concluded that an arm portion must be \"an identifiable structure that projects from the body portion of the gripping element.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The court referred to the MALW only in passing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *13-14. It did so to illustrate how a person of ordinary skill in the art would describe gripping elements of various shapes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *13 (\"A POSITA would almost certainly refer to the entire structure [of a block-like gripping element resembling the MALW's] as one body, not a body with arms.\"), and to explain the difference between the court's revised construction and the one it replaced,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *13-14 (noting, with reference to a depiction of the MALW, the objective difference between a gripping element that is merely \"configured to engage the guide\" and a gripping element with a separately identifiable, projecting portion that is \"configured to engage the guide\"). The court would have been wise to use an example other than the MALW to illustrate these points. But even if the court erred by referring to the MALW, the remainder of its claim-construction analysis is sound. None of that analysis depended in any way on the court's discussion of the MALW. The court did not tailor its construction of \"arm portion\" to reach a preconceived judgment on the issue of infringement, and its passing references to the MALW were, at most, harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

LoggerHead analogizes this case to\n   <em>\n    GPNE Corp. v. Apple, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , where a court concluded that it did not commit prejudicial error by failing to instruct the jury \"to apply plain and ordinary meaning [of the claim term 'node'] after reading the entire patent and file history.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364438\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/108/839/#p860\">\n    108 F.Supp.3d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (N.D.

It was sufficient, that court concluded, to instruct the jury that \"the claim language's plain and ordinary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention applies,\" because the law governing claim construction did not actually require the jury to \"read the entire patent and file history\" in order to determine the plain meaning of \"node.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364438\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/108/839/#p860\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The analogy to\n   <em>\n    GPNE\n   </em>\n   is not persuasive. In\n   <em>\n    GPNE\n   </em>\n   , the court adopted a plain-meaning construction of the claim term at issue, and then instructed the jury that \"the claim language's plain and ordinary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention applies.\" These instructions included all of the essential elements of the construction. In this case, by contrast, LoggerHead has not pointed to any language in the instruction that even hints at two essential elements of an \"arm portion\"-i.e., (1) an identifiable structure that (2) projects from the body portion of the gripping element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   LoggerHead next observes that \"Judge Darrah's construction was not dispositive on infringement,\" because \"there were issues of fact as to whether the MALW's arm portion was 'configured to engage the guide' \" and \"it was left to the jury to apply the claims and their constructions to the accused device to determine infringement.\" (Pl.'s Mot. 17-18.) As best the court comprehends this part of LoggerHead's argument, it is premised on a basic misunderstanding of the legal standard for ordering a new trial. It is irrelevant whether a reasonable jury could have concluded from the evidence presented at trial that the accused product satisfies a legally erroneous construction of LoggerHead's claims. What matters is whether \" 'there was sufficient evidence at trial to support a finding of [non-] infringement\n   <em>\n    under the correct construction.\n   </em>\n   ' \"\n   <em>\n    CytoLogix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927812\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/1168/#p1174\">\n    424 F.3d at 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nor would it make a difference if, as LoggerHead also argues, \"Defendants presented exactly the same evidence and arguments relating to non-infringement based on 'arm portion' that they would under the revised construction.\" (Pl.'s Mot. 18.) If a reasonable jury could apply this same evidence to the correct construction of arm portion and return a verdict of non-infringement, that means the court's erroneous jury instruction was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial. LoggerHead has offered no reason to doubt the court's previous conclusion that Defendants did, in fact, present sufficient evidence\n   at trial to support a verdict of non-infringement under the correct construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LoggerHead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206569629\">\n    2017 WL 6569629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, LoggerHead suggests that Defendants waived any argument about the sufficiency of the jury instruction by failing to object to that instruction at trial. \"Rule 51 generally requires a party to object to an error in a jury instruction before the jury retires in order to preserve the claim of error on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Ecolab\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9448668\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/1362/#p1373\">\n    285 F.3d at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

What's more, the court was aware of Defendants' position on how \"arm portion\" should be construed, as that position was evident from Judge Darrah's claim construction opinion. Nevertheless, in its ruling on several pre-trial motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , this court indicated to Defendants (wrongly, in hindsight) that it would be futile to reassert their objection to Judge Darrah's construction of \"arm portion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order [419], at 2 (granting Plaintiff's motion [409] to preclude Defendants from introducing evidence or argument for purpose of contradicting Judge Darrah's construction of \"arm portion,\" among other rulings).

LoggerHead's claims require that this identifiable, projecting structure also be \"configured to engage\" the tool's guide. The parties do not dispute that the MALW's\n   <em>\n    gripping element\n   </em>\n   is \"configured to engage\" the MALW's guide. They dispute whether the MALW's gripping element includes an\n   <em>\n    identifiable, projecting structure\n   </em>\n   -that is, an arm portion-that is configured to engage the tool's guide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendants present evidence that the MALW's gripping element does not include an identifiable, projecting structure that is configured to engage the guide. Defendants' expert witness has testified that the MALW gripping element is a \"solid,\" \"monolithic block\" with a \"unitary structure.\" (Fronczak Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 21.) Images confirm that the MALW gripping element is substantially rectangular. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DSOF \u00b6 29.) The pin-that is, the force transfer element-is the only part of the MALW gripping element that resembles an identifiable, projecting structure, but LoggerHead does not suggest that the pin is an arm portion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   LoggerHead characterizes the \"arm portion\" identified by Dr. Cagan as an \"identifiable structure,\" but none of the company's evidence supports this. Cagan asserts that \"[t]he MALW gripping element includes an identifiable structure for the arm portion and for the body portion.\" (Cagan Decl. (I) at \u00b6 15.) But Cagan has not identified any structural feature of the MALW's gripping element that distinguishes the supposed arm portion from the body portion. Rather, he draws an imaginary line on the surface of a solid, rectangular block and declares the area outside of that line to be an \"identifiable structure.\" Conclusory statements like this are insufficient to establish a triable issue of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266319\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/833/#p840\">\n    872 F.3d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840 (7th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   LoggerHead suggests that Cagan's purported arm portion is \"identifiable\" because its surface area corresponds to wear marks that appear on the surface of the MALW's gripping element. But even if this surface area does correspond to the wear marks, it does not follow that this surface area corresponds to a distinct \"structure\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   -let alone a structure that\n   \"projects\" from the body portion. The purportedly identifiable structure here would be indistinguishable from the rest of the gripping element but for the fact that its surface makes contact with the MALW's guide. The fact that an otherwise indistinguishable part of the gripping element's surface contacts the guide means that the\n   <em>\n    gripping element\n   </em>\n   is \"configured to engage\" the guide. It does not mean that an identifiable structure that projects from the gripping element-an arm portion-is configured to engage the guide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Neither the wear marks nor Dr. Cagan's testimony is sufficient to establish a triable issue of fact regarding the existence of an identifiable, projecting structure that is configured to engage the MALW's guide. Because this is the only evidence LoggerHead presents on this question, the court concludes that there is no genuine dispute about whether the MALW's gripping element includes an arm portion. It does not, and Defendants therefore are entitled to summary judgment on the issue of literal infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Doctrine of equivalents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The MALW could still infringe the asserted claims under the doctrine of equivalents, even though it lacks a literal arm portion.

Br. 9, 12.) But this mischaracterizes the subject matter LoggerHead claims under the doctrine of equivalents. The MALW does not have a \"non-projecting arm portion,\" if such a term has any useful meaning. It lacks any arm portion at all. LoggerHead's argument under the doctrine of equivalents is that the MALW's arm-portion-less gripping element is equivalent to a gripping element that does have an arm portion. The relevant question for the court's analysis of prosecution history estoppel is whether LoggerHead clearly and unmistakably disclaimed a gripping element that lacks an \"arm portion,\" not a \"non-projecting arm portion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   LoggerHead next suggests that it did not clearly and unmistakably disclaim gripping elements without arm portions because the company simply \"point[ed] out that the Examiner failed to explicitly disclose where or how Buchanan taught the claimed 'arm portion.' \" (Pl.'s Resp. Br. 11-12.) It is true that in responding to the patent examiner's concerns, LoggerHead\n   stated that \"[t]he Examiner does not specify where Buchanan teaches an arm portion, as claimed.\" (PSAMF \u00b6 29.) But the company did not stop there. It proceeded to assert that \"Buchanan does not teach or suggest an arm portion,\" and that \"[f]or this reason alone, [LoggerHead's] claims are in condition for allowance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7642627\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/104/1299/#p1304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is difficult to see how this statement can be interpreted as anything other than a disclaimer of gripping elements that lack an arm portion. The examiner rejected LoggerHead's claims on the grounds that they were anticipated by Buchanan. The company then responded to this rejection by arguing that its claims were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   anticipated by Buchanan precisely because those claims require an arm portion and Buchanan's do not. A competitor of ordinary skill in the art would almost certainly conclude from this exchange that LoggerHead was surrendering its claim to gripping elements that lack an arm portion.
