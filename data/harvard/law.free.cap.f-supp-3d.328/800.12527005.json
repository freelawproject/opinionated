(\"Sears Roebuck\"), and an entity Defendants named as \"Sears Holding Corporation d/b/a Sears Hometown &amp; Outlet and Sears.com\"-which Plaintiffs assert are in fact two separate entities: Sears Holding Corporation (\"Sears Holding\") and Sears Hometown and Outlet, Inc.

Sears Corporate Structure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sears Holding Corporation (\"Sears Holding\") was formed in 2004 through the\n   merger of Sears, Roebuck and Co. (\"Sears Roebuck\") and Kmart Holding Corporation. Sears Holding and Sears Roebuck LR 56.1(a)(3) Stmt. (\"Sears Holding LR Stmt.\") \u00b6 9, ECF No. 111.

SHO sells home appliances, garden equipment, tools, and hardware.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.

Appliance Alliance Franchise Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Turleys, on behalf of the Appliance Alliance, signed four Franchise Agreements (\"Agreements\") with SHAS in 2010. SHAS, SAHS, and SHO LR 56.1(a)(3) Stmt. (\"SHAS LR Stmt.\") \u00b6 8, ECF No. 107. The 2010 Agreements granted Appliance Alliance the right to operate four Sears Home Appliance Showrooms in Texas, located in Euless, Ft. Worth, Burleson, and Cedar Hill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mazak Decl., Exs. 3-6, Euless, Ft. Worth, Burleson, and Cedar Hill Agreements, ECF No. 116-1. Prior to signing the 2010 Agreements, Defendants hired a franchise attorney, who conducted a comprehensive review of SHAS's Franchise Disclosure Document (\"FDD\"). SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Brent Turley, Defendants initially decided to open an SHAS franchise \"in reliance upon the representations and assurances in the Franchise Disclosure Document, the verbal statements from the Sears representative that commissions were actually averaging over [12.5] percent, the [117]-year history of Sears, Roebuck and Company, and the 'instant business' concept of the franchise in association with the Sears Kenmore brand.\" Turley Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 132. Turley claims that Defendants met twice with Russell Smith, a Sears franchise sales agent, before executing the initial Agreements, and that, in those meetings, Smith misrepresented commission rates, misled Defendants to believe that after two years of operations Defendants would receive a 2% local marketing fee, and failed to disclose the competitive structure in which Defendants would operate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both the FDD and the Agreements included statements that Defendants might face competition from other Sears entities. While the FDD granted Defendants a territory in which SHAS would not license anyone to operate another Sears Home Appliance Showroom,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mazak Decl., Ex. 22, May 2009 FDD at TUR00401, ECF No. 116-1, it also stated that Defendants \"will not receive an exclusive territory to sell Merchandise\" and \"may face competition from other outlets that our affiliates own or from other channels of distribution or competitive brands that we or our affiliates own.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at TUR00402;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 10. The Agreements included similar language reserving SHAS's rights, on behalf of their agents and dealers, to sell Showroom merchandise online and at stores inside and outside the granted territory. SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 17; Mazak Decl., Exs. 3-8, Euless, Ft. Worth, Burleson, Cedar Hill, Carrollton, Dallas\n   Franchise Agreements (collectively, \"Agreements\") \u00a7 1.C, ECF No. 116-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Agreements also specified that Defendants would receive a \"variable commission rate,\" calculated in accordance with the Agreement, that could be modified at SHAS's discretion, although \"in no event\" would the \"aggregate commission on the sales of Merchandise for each fiscal year during the Term be less than 9.25% of the total Net Sales of Merchandise.\" Agreements \u00a7 2.B(1); SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 18. The Agreements further stated that any amounts owed to SHAS, including \"payments due under any promissory note issued to our affiliate in connection with your acquisition of the Showroom\" would be deducted from commission payments, and that SHAS may \"set off, to the fullest extent permitted by law, against any payment that we owe you any amounts that you owe us ... regardless of whether we demanded payment.\" Agreements \u00a7 2.B(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In negotiating the 2010 Agreements, Defendants requested that the minimum annual aggregate commission be raised from 9.25% to 15% or 20%, but SHAS did not agree to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Defendants complained repeatedly about the commission rate, requesting in October 2011 that the average rate be raised to 25% and, in January 2013, requesting 19.5%.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 46. It is undisputed that Defendants' commissions never fell below 9.25%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2012, again according to Brent Turley, Defendants were specifically looking for an opportunity to open a Dallas franchise, but Sears refused to grant them the Dallas location without also requiring them to open another store in a \"much less desirable location\" in Carrollton. Turley Decl. \u00b6 3. Ultimately, Defendants signed Agreements in 2012 to operate both the Dallas and Carrollton showrooms. SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14. The 2012 Agreements, like the 2010 Agreements, included a severability and integration clause specifying that there were no other \"oral or other written understandings, representations, or agreements\" between SHAS and Defendants \"relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2012, as in 2010, Defendants were also provided with FDDs before signing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. In addition, Brent Turley signed a Representations and Acknowledgement Statement on behalf of Appliance Alliance that represented, among other things, that Defendants' \"decision to purchase the franchise has not been influenced by any oral representations, assurances, warranties, guarantees or promises whatsoever made by the Franchisor or any of its officers, employees or agents ... including as to the likelihood of success of the franchise,\" and that \"[n]either the Franchisor nor any of its officers, employees, or agents ... has made a statement, promise or assurance to me concerning any matter related to the franchise ... that is contrary to, or different from, the information contained in the [FDD].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants also signed subleases with SHAS for the Dallas and Carrollton stores.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. The subleases provided that, in the event of default, which included termination under \u00a7 20(c) of the Agreements, SHAS had \"the immediate right to re-enter the Premises and expel\" Defendants and, if that happened, Defendants \"agree[d] to peacefully and quietly yield-up and surrender the Premises to [SHAS] and to immediately remove [Defendants'] personal property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mazak Decl., Ex. 17, Dallas Sublease, \u00a7 20(a)-(c), ECF No. 116-1;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 18, Carrollton Sublease, \u00a7 20(a)-(c), ECF No. 116-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   All of the Agreements-both those signed in 2010 and in 2012-included a number of additional provisions. Section 7.H required Defendants to \"maintain the\n   number of sufficiently qualified and trained staff as necessary for the proper operation of the Showroom\" and be \"solely responsible for their compensation.\" It further required that Defendants \"pay ... amounts due with respect to all amounts paid or owing to ... [Defendants'] employees, independent contractors, creditors, and others.\" Section 7.I required that Defendants acquire and maintain, at Defendants' expense, all necessary business equipment, furnishings, and office supplies, SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 19. Section 11.B granted SHAS access to Defendants' showrooms and records and permitted SHAS to confer with Defendants' employees \"for all purposes, including to determine [Defendants'] performance and observance of all of [Defendants'] obligations and conditions under this Agreement,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. And \u00a7 11.C gave SHAS the right \"to require that [Defendants] submit to [SHAS], by dates and with the frequency that [they] specify, profit and loss statements, statements of cash flow, balance sheets and other financial statements pertaining to [Defendants'] operation of the Showroom,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Agreements also incorporated the Operations Manual (\"Manual\") by reference and instructed that Defendants were to \"perform and observe all obligations, terms, and conditions in the Operations Manual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18; Agreements \u00a7 7.L. According to \u00a7 06.01.03 of the Manual, stores would occasionally be expected to participate in free delivery programs, where franchisees \"may be reimbursed at a predetermined promotional rate for the free deliveries processed at the [point of sale].\" SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties negotiated an amendment to each of the Agreements, which stated that starting in February 2012, and for a two-year period thereafter, SHAS would withhold a marketing allowance of 2% of net sales and execute a local marketing plan for the Showroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. The amendment specified that after the two-year period, SHAS would no longer execute a marketing plan for Defendants, at which point, as long as Defendants were in compliance with the Agreement, SHAS would provide Defendants with the marketing allowance of 2%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The provision further stated that SHAS \"may from time to time request that you prepare and submit a report to us which accounts for the manner in which you spent the Marketing Allowance\" and provided that SHAS \"may, at any time during the Term, elect to ... cease providing the Marketing Allowance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After the two-year period, in February 2014, Defendants asked SHO\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to stop running the local marketing for three of their stores and instead provide Defendants with the 2% marketing allowance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. In response, SHO requested that Defendants provide a marketing plan setting forth how they intended to spend the allowance, and offered to provide marketing analytics to assist Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Showroom Performance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to Brent Turley, the first four Sears franchises were profitable but, over time, the profitability of all of Defendants' franchises was affected by erosion in the credibility of the Sears brand, as well as competition with other Sears entities. Turley Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6. Turley claims that Sears' restructuring forced Defendants to compete directly with Sears, including \"through terminals we would be required to install in our stores that would allow our\n   customers to see online Sears products, but prohibit us from price-matching the prices and features that Sears were offering online.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As a result of this reduction in profitability, Turley admits that Defendants \"f[e]ll behind on various obligations, primarily including payroll and rent owed to landlords.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. According to Rudy Mazak, Vice President of Dealer and Hometown Stores at SAHS, Defendants were unable to stay current with their rent payments in September and October 2011. Mazak Decl. \u00b6 29, ECF No. 107. In October 2011, Defendants decided to take a \"drastic step[ ] and reassign the lease agreements back to Sears.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 40, 10/26/2011 Turley Email, at SHAS00002666.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Then, in early 2014, Defendants again fell behind on rent. At that time, SHO loaned Defendants over $44,000 to assist in meeting Defendants' rent obligation for two of their locations. SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 57. On June 6, 2014, SHO issued a Notice of Deficiencies documenting this failure to pay rent as a \"deficiency\" under the Agreements and related documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mazak Decl., Ex. 53, 6/6/2014 Notice of Deficiencies at SHAS00001754-58, ECF No. 116-3. The notice informed Defendants that failure to bring their stores into compliance with the Agreements \"may result\" in SHO exercising its rights to terminate one or more of the Agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at SHAS00001755.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In March 2015, Defendants were again behind on their rent. According to Brent Turley, Defendants had fallen behind solely because of a change in payment method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mazak Decl., Ex. 56, 4/3/2015 Turley Email at SHAS00001994, ECF No. 116-3. As Turley explained at his deposition, Sears had been paying Defendants' rent directly to their landlords since early 2014 and taking the money out of their commissions, to ensure Defendants were current on their rent. Mazak Decl., Ex. 1, Turley Dep. at 105:1-4, ECF. No. 116-1. But the Burleson store then stopped accepting cashier's checks from SHO, and SHO informed Defendants in late November that Defendants were directly responsible for paying the December rent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105:17-106:6. Turley testified that, as of March 2015, Defendants had not paid any of their rent obligations for Burleson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106:7-107:15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Meanwhile, Defendants were also struggling to pay their employees. SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 61. Turley acknowledged in his deposition that the company \"was not always current\" with making payroll, as they \"were a growing company.\" Turley Dep. at 117:11-16. Along these lines, the June 2014 Notice of Deficiencies also mentioned Defendants' failure to meet their payroll obligations to their employees in all of their stores. 6/6/2014 Notice of Deficiencies at SHAS00001758. The letter stated that Defendants were, in June 2014, \"behind in payroll obligations of approximately $40,000.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Then, on February 23, 2015, SHO sent a Notice of Default identifying Defendants' failure \"to meet [their] payroll obligations as they became due.\" SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 68; Mazak Decl., Ex. 57, 2/23/2015 Notice of Default at TUR02086. The Notice instructed Defendants that the default \"constitute[d] violations of the Agreements and grounds for termination pursuant to Sections 1.5B(12) and 15.B(22) of the Agreements if each Default is not cured timely and in the manner outlined below.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at TUR02087. According to the Notice, to cure the default, Defendants were required to \"fulfill all payroll obligations and submit documentation evidencing that same\" within 60 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is undisputed\n   that Defendants never provided the requested documentation showing that they had fulfilled the payroll obligations. Defs.' Resp. SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The February 23 Notice of Default also identified as a default Defendants' \"failure to comply with financial reporting requirements mandated by the operations manual\"-specifically, SHAS's multiple requests to Defendants for financial statements for each of the Showrooms for 2012, 2013, and the first three quarters of 2014. 2/23/2015 Notice of Default at TUR02086. To cure this default, the letter instructed Defendants to provide, within 60 days, financial reports including annual profit and loss statements (by location), quarterly statements of cash flows, and quarter-end balance sheets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at TUR02087.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SHAS reserved the right, under the Agreements, to \"require that [Defendants] submit to us, by dates and with the frequency that we specify, profit and loss statements, statements of cash flow, balance sheets and other financial statements pertaining to your operation of the Showroom.\" SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 20; Agreements \u00a7 11.C. And it is undisputed that SHO repeatedly asked Defendants for financial statements on a store-by-store basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But as Brent Turley testified, SHO began asking for Defendants to provide previous years' financial statements, per store and per quarter, after Defendants had already provided the data from 2012, 2013, and 2014. Turley Dep. at 74:17-22. Turley stated that he did not comply with SHO's request that he provide store-by-store financial statements, both because SHO had never before made such a request and because SHO had never provided Defendants with store-by-store data for Defendants to utilize.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75:3-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants and SHO also had a dispute about store hours. Both the Agreements and the Manual specified requirements for the operating hours of the showrooms. The Agreements required Defendants to \"maintain regular days of operation and business hours\" that SHAS specified and to \"extend the days of operation and business hours\" at SHAS's request. Agreements \u00a7 7.E. Section 1.01 of the Manual further dictated that, if for any reason the store could not open on time or needed to close early, the Franchisee was to notify the District Manager immediately. SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On several occasions in 2015, Defendants operated their stores on more limited hours than those designated in the Manual, by opening late and closing early.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 54. According to Defendants, the only days on which the stores opened late were \"ice storm days during the winter.\" Defs.' Resp. SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 54. But according to District Manager Samantha Wilks, Appliance Alliance stores opened late without communicating to Wilks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilks Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, ECF No. 113. Wilks further stated that later the same day, Brent Turley informed her that the stores would be closing early, and when Wilks stated that she would send up for approval, Turley told Wilks that \"this was not a request, he was going to close at 6:00 p.m.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Wilks testified that Defendants\n   also had failed to notify her in advance when stores opened late again on March 5, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Meanwhile, as Defendants saw it, Wilks had been \"taking over management control of [Defendants'] employees.\" Turley Decl. \u00b6 11. Turley states that Wilks, who took on the role of District Sales Manager in January 2015, was supposed to train Defendants' employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Instead, Turley claims Wilks called all of Defendants' stores every day to speak with the employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. She told the employees to contact her instead of Defendants if they had questions or issues, a practice which Turley told her to stop, but she continued doing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Turley, Wilks also directed employees to provide \"free\" delivery to some customers, against Defendants' wishes,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and gave employees and managers directions as to store hours and operating procedures,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Section 15.B of the Agreements allowed SHAS to terminate the Agreements if Defendants did any of the following: \"take any action in furtherance of abrogation, disaffirmance, or repudiation of the Agreement or of any of your obligations under the Agreement,\" \u00a7 15.B(5); \"fail to pay your obligations as they become due,\" \u00a7 15.B(12); fail to perform a term, condition, or other obligation in a loan agreement or lease, \"including a lease for the Sears Home Appliance Showroom,\" 15.B(13); or \"default in the performance or breach of (i) any other agreements with us or our affiliates, including agreements for or related to another Sears Home Appliance Showroom,\" \u00a7 15.B(16). Section 15.B also allowed SHAS to terminate the Agreements if SHAS \"issue[s] three or more notices of default of provisions of this Agreement within a 12-month period, regardless of whether the defaults were cured,\" \u00a7 15.B(19).

It is further undisputed that Defendants failed, several times, to timely pay their employees and that, when notified that such failure was a default, did not cure such default within the required time period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Turley Dep. at 117:11-16 (acknowledging the company was not always current on payroll); June 2014 Notice of Deficiencies (noting that Defendants were $40,000 behind in payroll obligations); SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 66 (Defendants did not provide documentation that they had cured the default of failing to timely pay their employees). This provided two more grounds for termination under \u00a7 15.B(12) and \u00a7 15.B(22) of the Agreements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreements \u00a7 15.B(12) (stating that SHAS is entitled to terminate the Agreements if Defendants \"fail to pay their obligations as they become due.\"); Moreover, \u00a7 15.B(16) of the Agreements entitled Plaintiffs to terminate all Agreements if Defendants defaulted or could be terminated pursuant to another Agreement. As such, Plaintiffs were entitled, under the plain language of the Agreements, to terminate all six Agreements for failure to pay rent and payroll alone, as well as for the issuance of three notices of default in a twelve-month period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreements \u00a7 15.B(19); SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Prior Material Breaches by Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendants contend that termination was unjustified because Defendants' breaches were excused by Plaintiffs' prior material breaches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 11. As far as the Court can tell,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs committed the following prior material breaches: (1) forcing Defendants to compete with other Sears-branded entities; (2) failing to pay commissions as promised; (3) shifting costs on Defendants for \"free delivery\" promotional offers and office supplies; (4) refusing to pay Defendants the 2% marketing fee; (5) \"arbitrar[il]y charging [ ] unexplained charges to the bimonthly distributions\" to Defendants; (6) altering the required hours\n   for Defendants to stay open; and (7) \"fail[ing] to deal with the Turleys in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d.

Mem. at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   But Defendants fail to present any evidence that Plaintiffs committed these proposed breaches prior to terminating the Agreements. First, Defendants' claim that Plaintiffs breached the Agreements by forcing Defendants to compete with other favorably positioned Sears entities finds no support in the FDD and the Agreements, both of which warned Defendants, in unambiguous terms, that they might face competition from other Sears entities. For instance, the FDD explained that Defendants \"will not receive an exclusive territory to sell Merchandise\" and \"may face competition from other outlets that our affiliates own or from other channels of distribution or competitive brands that we or our affiliates own.\" 2009 FDD at TUR00402;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 10. The Agreements include similar language reserving SHAS's rights, on behalf of their agents and dealers, to sell Showroom merchandise online and at stores and centers within and outside of the granted territory. Agreements \u00a7 1.C. Defendants do not provide any evidence of competition that exceeded the scope of the competition permitted in the FDD and the Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As for whether Plaintiffs breached the contract by failing to pay commissions as promised, the undisputed evidence is that the Agreements promised only to pay commissions at a rate of at least 9.25%, Agreements \u00a7 2.B(1), and Defendants' commissions were always above 9.25%, SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 47. For their part, Defendants assert that, before they signed the Agreements, a Sears representative had told them that commissions were averaging 12.5%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Turley Decl. \u00b6 2. But by signing the Agreements, Defendants agreed that there were no other \"oral or other written understandings, representations, or agreements\" between SHAS and Defendants \"relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,\" SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 27. Accordingly, any evidence of statements made during the negotiation of the Agreements is barred by the parol-evidence rule, which excludes evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements within the scope of a fully integrated written contract.\n   <em>\n    Bend Mut.

According to \u00a7 06.01.03 of the Manual, stores are expected to participate, \"from time to time,\" in free delivery programs, where franchisees \"may be reimbursed at a predetermined promotional rate for the free deliveries processed at the [point of sale].\" SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 34. It is undisputed that SHO provided some reimbursements for free delivery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49, but Defendants contend that Sears' policy changed over time and that \"in the later years the reimbursements were severely limited or non-existent.\" Defs.' Resp. SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 49. Defendants, however, point to no evidence supporting this assertion, and even if they did, the Manual informs franchisees that they are expected to participate in free delivery offers, and states only that they \"may\" be reimbursed. As for office supplies, \u00a7 7.1 of the Agreements provides that Defendants \"acquire and maintain\" office supplies at their expense. SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 19. Thus, Defendants have failed to present any evidence that Plaintiffs breached the contract by shifting costs for promotional offers or office supplies onto Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs breached the Agreements by refusing to pay Defendants a 2% marketing fee. The parties had negotiated an amendment to the Franchise Agreements that specified that, for two years starting in February 2012, SHAS would withhold a marketing allowance of 2% of net sales and execute a local marketing plan for Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. The amendment provided that after the two-year period, SHAS would no longer execute a marketing plan for Defendants, at which point, as long as Defendants were in compliance with the Agreements, SHAS would provide Defendants with the marketing allowance of 2%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The provision also allowed SHAS to \"at any time during the Term, elect to ... cease providing the Marketing Allowance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   According to the undisputed evidence, after the two-year period expired, Defendants asked SHO to stop running local marketing for three of its stores and instead provide Defendants with the 2% marketing allowance,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. SHO responded by requesting that Defendants provide a marketing plan setting forth how it intended to spend the marketing allowance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Defendants never provided the marketing plan, and SHO did not pay them the marketing allowance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Defendants now contend that the Agreements did not require Defendants to provide a marketing plan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , but that is immaterial-the Agreements permitted SHO to stop providing the marketing fee for any reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Therefore, if SHO wished to condition its provision of the marketing fee on the submission of a marketing plan, it was entitled to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendants also claim that Plaintiffs breached the Agreements by altering the required hours for Defendants to stay open. Defendants do not present any evidence supporting this contention, but even if they had, it is undisputed that the Agreements required Defendants to \"maintain regular days of operation and business hours\" specified by SHAS and \"extend the days of operation and business hours\" at SHAS's request. Agreements \u00a7 7.E. And as for Defendants' claim that Plaintiffs arbitrarily charged unexplained charges to the bimonthly distributions paid to Defendants, Defendants have identified no evidence of any such charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendants' claim that Plaintiffs failed to deal with Defendants in good faith also fails. Under Illinois law, \"the implied covenant of good faith\" requires that a controlling party \"exercise [its] discretion reasonably and with proper motive, and ... not do so arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Beraha v.

While the Court has already found that Plaintiffs had grounds to terminate the Agreements, it has not analyzed whether those grounds-or other actions or inactions by Defendants-qualify as contract breaches under Illinois law.

The relevant question then is whether the Agreements imposed any duties that Defendants failed to fulfill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Defendants breached the Agreements by failing to timely pay rent and payroll. Section 7.I required Defendants to be \"solely responsible for ... operating costs and expenses of the Showroom, including rent,\" while \u00a7 7.H required them to \"maintain the number of sufficiently qualified and trained staff as necessary for the proper operation of the Showroom\" and be \"solely responsible for their compensation.\" Section 7.H further specified that Defendants must \"pay ... amounts due with respect to all amounts paid or owing to ... [Defendants'] employees, independent contractors, creditors, and others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , it is undisputed that Defendants failed, several times, to timely pay their employees,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Turley Dep. at 117:11-16 (acknowledging the company was not always current on payroll), as well as to timely pay rent,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g, id.\n   </em>\n   at 106:7-107:15 (Defendants were several months behind in rent at their Burleson location in March 2015). There is therefore no material dispute of fact that Defendants breached \u00a7 7.H of the Agreements by failing to pay amounts due to employees and to landlords,\n   and \u00a7 7.I by failing to pay rent for the Showrooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   It is also undisputed that Defendants failed to provide store-by-store financial statements as requested by Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Turley Dep. at 75:3-22; SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 59. Plaintiffs argue that by failing to provide such information, Defendants breached \u00a7 11.C of the Agreements, which reserved for SHAS the right to require Defendants to submit, \"by dates and with the frequency that [SHAS] specif[ies], profit and loss statements, statements of cash flow, balance sheets and other financial statements pertaining to your operation of the Showroom.\" SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 20. Defendants disagree, contending that store-by-store requests were unreasonable, given that Defendants had already provided Plaintiffs with the (non-store-specific) data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Turley Dep. at 74:17-22. But the Agreements included no such limiting language, and given that the Agreements were signed on a store-by-store basis, SHAS was well within its rights to request the financial data for each store pursuant to the Agreement that applied to that particular store. The Court therefore finds that no reasonable jury could conclude that Defendants did not breach \u00a7 11.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants violated certain provisions in the Agreements and Manual that required Defendants to maintain business hours according to SHAS specifications and notify SHAS's district manager immediately if the store could not open on time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreements \u00a7 7.E (\"You will maintain regular days of operation and business hours that we specify.\"); Manual \u00a7 1.0.1 (\"If for any reason the store cannot open on time, or must close early due to inclement weather, etc., the Franchisee must notify the District Manager immediately.\"). It is undisputed that, on several occasions in 2015, Defendants operated their stores on more limited hours than those designated in the Manual. SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 54. And Wilks states that, on multiple occasions, Defendants failed to notify her in advance of deviations from normal business hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilks Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendants do not dispute Wilks' statements. Instead, they argue that deviations from standard hours were driven by concerns for employee safety during adverse weather conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Turley Decl. \u00b6 15. But Defendants point to no provision in the contracts that would justify a failure to inform the district manager in such instances, and the Manual specifically requires 'immediate\" notice if a store \"must close early due to inclement weather.\" Manual \u00a7 1.01. As such, the Court finds that there is no material dispute of fact that Defendants breached the Agreements and Manual as related to store hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For these reasons, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to their breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Counterclaim for Breach of Contract and Wrongful Termination (Count I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In Count I of Defendants' counterclaim, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs breached the Agreements and wrongfully terminated Defendants. The Court has already found that Plaintiffs had grounds to terminate Defendants under the contract and that Defendants failed to present any material evidence of a breach prior to termination. Defendants also contend, however, that Plaintiffs breached the Agreements\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   termination by \"fail[ing] to return the Turleys' property to them or to tender an offer to purchase as required by the contracts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 10-11. Defendants\n   do not indicate which provision they believe imposes such requirements, although \u00a7 15.E of the Agreements provides SHAS with the option upon termination to \"purchase any or all of the furniture fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements used in the operation of the Showroom.\" SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 23. In any event, it is undisputed that SHO informed Defendants that their property was being left behind in four stores and offered to negotiate for the value of the property in the remaining two stores,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77, and Plaintiffs have failed to adduce any evidence in support of a claim that \u00a7 15.E was breached, if indeed that is their claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    477 U.S. at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As Defendants have failed to provide evidence of any breaches, pre- or post-termination, and the Court has already found that the termination was justified, summary judgment is granted to Plaintiffs as to Defendants' counterclaim for breach of contract and wrongful termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Additionally, it is undisputed that Defendants negotiated an amendment to the Agreements that included a provision that Plaintiffs could opt to not provide the marketing allowance at all after the two years,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 32.

Defendants' average annual commission in 2011 for its four stores were as follows: 10.83%, 9.98%, 10.33%, and 11.3%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SHAS LR Stmt. \u00b6 47. Therefore, to the extent that there may have been any misrepresentation of commission rates, Defendants would have been on notice of this by 2012, when Defendants knew that their 2011 commission rates were significantly below 12.5%. The statute of limitations on this claim therefore expired in 2014, a year before this suit was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Because the undisputed evidence demonstrates that Defendants agreed to contractual terms that disclosed the guaranteed rate of commissions, competition from other Sears entities, and the possibility that Plaintiffs would not pay the marketing fee to Defendants, and because the statute of limitations has expired as to any misrepresentation related to anticipated commission rates, the Court grants summary judgment to Plaintiffs as to Count VI of Defendants' counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Counterclaim for Unfair Competition (Count IV)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment as to Defendants' claim for unfair competition.

To prove a claim of unfair competition, therefore, Defendants must prove an underlying cause of action giving rise to their allegations of unfair competition. Because the Court has already found that Defendants either waived or failed to adduce evidence supporting any of their counterclaims, Defendants' claim for unfair competition must also fail because they cannot prove an underlying cause of action. The Court therefore grants summary judgment to Plaintiffs as to the unfair competition claim in Count IV of Defendants' counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As the Court has granted summary judgment to Plaintiffs on all of Defendants' counterclaims, the Court declines to reach the additional arguments advanced by Wilks, Sears Holding, and Sears Roebuck, as to why summary judgment should be granted as to them specifically. The Court also declines to reach Count IV of Plaintiff's Complaint, which asserts that Plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys' fees under the Agreements and the promissory notes, as these issues may require further factual development as the case proceeds on the issue of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants in full Wilks' [103] and Sears Holding and Sears Roebuck's [109] motions for summary judgment.

The Court grants the motion as to all of the counterclaims asserted in Defendants' Second Amended Counterclaim, as well as to Counts I and II of Plaintiffs' Complaint. The Court further grants summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' claim in Count III that it properly terminated Defendants and declares that Sears Home Appliance Showroom properly terminated the Franchise Agreements with Appliance Alliance. The Court denies summary judgment as to Count IV of the Complaint, as well as to Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory judgment in Count III relating to the Texas action.

Because these wrongs are later asserted as independent counterclaims,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Counts II-V, and because Defendants point to no related obligations in the Agreements, the Court does not construe this additional list of wrongs as alleged breaches of contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Count V of Defendants' counterclaim is technically a counterclaim for \"economic duress and business coercion,\" but as the Court stated in its order on Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss Defendants' counter-claims,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Appliance All.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20839483\">\n     2017 WL 839483\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *8 n.8, Defendants' allegations of business coercion are indistinguishable from their allegations of economic duress, and the parties act as if the only allegations are those of economic duress.

In line with the parties' approach, the Court assumes that Count V asserts a claim only for economic duress.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
