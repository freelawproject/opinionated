BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Niskanen Center, Inc. is seeking information about the National Coal Council, a chartered federal advisory committee that provides advice and recommendations to the Department of Energy. NCC was established in 1984 by the Secretary of Energy to \"give coal ... the same voice\" in government that petroleum had long had.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18 (Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp.), Exh. A (Website) at 1. NCC has an incorporated counterpart - NCC, Inc. - in which the Center is also interested. Plaintiff thus submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to DOE for thirteen categories of information regarding NCC and NCC, Inc. DOE has turned over two sets of responsive documents, but Plaintiff remains dissatisfied with the adequacy of the search and the extent of the withholdings. Suit having been filed, each party now moves for summary judgment. The Court will grant in part and deny in part both Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By letter dated March 10, 2017, Plaintiff explained that it is \"engaged in a study of the long-term effectiveness of certain federal advisory committees\" and requested\n   from DOE thirteen categories of information regarding NCC and NCC, Inc., dating from 1986.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp., Exh. O (Plaintiff's Request); ECF No. 16 (Def. MSJ), Exh. B (Email Amending Request). The Center sought such documents as membership lists, reports and studies, newsletters and announcements, agendas and transcripts, financial statements, tax filings, as well as information about NCC subgroups, NCC, Inc.'s incorporation and 501(c)(6) status, NCC Inc.'s finances and expenditures, and the relationship between NCC and NCC, Inc.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Request at 1-2. DOE responded on April 7, 2017, that it had \"assigned\" the request to DOE's Office of Fossil Energy (OFE) to conduct a search of its files for responsive documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. C (DOE Response) at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ten days later, when DOE failed to respond further by FOIA's statutory deadline, the Center filed this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Complaint). By letter dated July 7, 2017, DOE finally responded to Plaintiff, identifying eleven documents and one Windows Media Player file responsive to the request and indicating that partially withheld documents were redacted pursuant to FOIA Exemption 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16-1 (Declaration of Alexander C. Morris), \u00b6 21; Def. MSJ, Exh. D (DOE First Response Letter) at 1-2. After reviewing the production, the Center advised DOE that it believed the search deficient, \"including because DOE had failed to provide any documents falling within the categories of Plaintiff's request specifically pertaining to NCC, Inc. and its relationship to [NCC].\" Pl.

DOE then conducted a further search, identifying in a September 13, 2017, letter 21 additional documents and one additional VOB (Video Object) file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Morris Decl., \u00b6 31; Def.

MSJ &amp; Opp., Exh. C (NCC Charter) at 1.

First, Plaintiff misses the mark in maintaining that Defendant's failure to locate records from 1986 to 2008 demonstrates the inadequacy of its search. \"[T]he fact that responsive documents once existed does not mean that they remain in the [agency's] custody today.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilbur v.

Cir. 2004). On the other hand, the Court agrees that the search of OFE was deficient in one respect -\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , DOE's failure to use search terms calculated to locate documents relating to NCC, Inc. The Center's request listed thirteen categories of records, of which categories 6-13 concerned that entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Request at 2. Nowhere does DOE indicate, however, that it searched physical and electronic documents for the term \"NCC, Inc.,\" as well as \"NCC,\" nor does it maintain that a search for the latter term would necessarily uncover uses of the former. Defendant's contention that its search was still adequate because it did in fact locate\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   documents concerning NCC, Inc. is unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 20 (Def.

The search must be \"reasonably calculated to uncover the requested documents.\"\n   <em>\n    SafeCard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As it did not include a term central to the second half of the Center's request, the search does not meet that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To sum up, DOE's search was inadequate in two respects. First, the Agency either did not sufficiently detail its attestation that OFE was the only office likely to contain responsive materials, or it failed to search all offices likely to contain them. Second, the search of OFE itself was not reasonably calculated to uncover all responsive documents as it did not contain terms reflecting the second half of the Center's request.

First, it maintains that the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index and declarations explaining the withholdings are insufficient on their face, and that the Morris Declaration does not satisfy the requirements for summary judgment because it is insufficiently detailed and not based on personal knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp. at 17-19. Second, Plaintiff contends that Exemption 4 does not cover DOE's withholdings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Finally, the Center asserts that, even if some of the material may be withheld pursuant to that exemption, DOE has not disclosed segregable non-exempt information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.

The Court cannot disagree that much of DOE's declarations and\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index are merely boilerplate. It is not necessary here, however, to order that the Government supplement these items, as it has submitted its withholdings for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.

MSJ &amp; Opp. at 18 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4) ).

MSJ at 9-10. The Center maintains the contrary position, claiming that the information was given involuntarily to DOE by \"entities that exist\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   to advise the federal government and could not perform that solitary function without a formal government charter that may be eliminated by DOE at any time and for any reason.\" Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp. at 22. DOE disputes the characterization that the entities exist solely to advise DOE, arguing that \"[NCC] and NCC, Inc. are not one in the same [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ].\" Def. Reply at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 20-1 (Declaration of Janet Gellici), \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.

Reply at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court finds that\n   <em>\n    National Parks\n   </em>\n   is the appropriate standard here. Given NCC's status and functions, it makes little sense to conclude it is furnishing documents voluntarily to DOE, and NCC, Inc. is an alter ego ultimately situated no differently from NCC itself. Whether DOE obtained the documents by subpoena or court order is not the relevant test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Center for Public Integrity v.

In this case, DOE exercises substantial authority over NCC, which is federally chartered and cannot meet without the presence of a DOE officer or employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. App. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 9(c), 10(e) ; Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp., Exh. R (NCC Meeting Request). That officer or employee can \"adjourn any such meeting.\" 5 U.S.C. App. 2 \u00a7 10(e). NCC itself has recognized, in statements to members, that its authority \"emanates from the charter which is granted by the DOE and the Secretary himself or herself,\" with the Secretary \"appoint[ing] the members.\" Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp., Exh. B (Meeting Transcript) at 49. The Federal Advisory Committee Act also requires DOE to engage in oversight of NCC's activities, including ensuring that NCC is not influenced by any special interest and that its membership is fairly balanced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. App. 2 \u00a7 5(b)(2)-(3). FACA also mandates that DOE \"exercise control and supervision over the establishment, procedures, and accomplishments\" of NCC and \"assemble and maintain\" its \"reports, records, and other papers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268200\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/65/#p74\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8. In other words, FACA itself requires that DOE obtain a variety of documents from NCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   DOE's assertion that NCC, Inc. is differently situated from NCC is equally unpersuasive. NCC, \"perhaps uniquely among federal advisory committees,\" Pl. Request at 2, has a dual structure; NCC, Inc. serves as an incorporated alter ego. There is no meaningful distinction between the two. To begin, NCC, Inc.'s bylaws treat it as identical to NCC, indicating that \"meetings of members of the Corporation\" are \"held to develop and consider advice,\n   information or recommendations to be given to the Secretary of Energy ... subject to and consistent with [FACA],\" with \"[m]embers of the Corporation\" being \"selected and appointed to serve on the National Coal Council by the Secretary of Energy.\" Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp., Exh. M (NCC, Inc. Bylaws) at 1. NCC and NCC, Inc. have a single joint website, and the contact information listed on that website and in the federal charter is identical for both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Website at 5; NCC Charter at 6. The members of NCC are also shareholders of NCC, Inc., and the officers of NCC and NCC, Inc. are identical.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Meeting Transcript at 51.

Consistent with the D.C. Circuit's instruction that \"the fiction of a corporate entity cannot stand athwart sound regulatory purpose,\" particularly where \"the corporate fiction would enable circumvention of a statute,\"\n   <em>\n    Quinn v. Butz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688475,146997\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/510/743/\">\n    510 F.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 758 n.95, 759 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (citations omitted), the Court concludes that there is no meaningful difference between NCC and NCC, Inc. that could support the conclusion that DOE obtained the records concerning NCC, Inc. by voluntary disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As such a conclusion means that the\n   <em>\n    National Parks\n   </em>\n   standard applies, this essentially resolves the dispute over Exemption 4. This is because the Government never really argues that its withholdings satisfy that standard. It does not contend, for example, that disclosure of the withheld information would impair its ability to obtain such information in the future, and it makes only a cursory statement that disclosure would harm NCC, Inc.'s competitive position by \"dissuad[ing] members from joining the organization,\" providing indicia that \"could be read to indicate the value of the company,\" or \"caus[ing] reputational harm.\" Gellici Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. DOE also offers a vague assertion that \"[d]isclosure of this information\" would \"harm\" NCC, Inc.'s \"transactions with third parties for memberships and membership fees, the ability to negotiate salary and benefits with staff, and the ability to make decisions regarding private litigation,\" while \"curtail[ing] companies from entering into contracts or other negotiations with the Government in the future.\" Morris Decl., \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   These statements are insufficient to demonstrate that the Government has satisfied\n   <em>\n    National Parks\n   </em>\n   , and, having reviewed the documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that the redactions in Documents 1, 2, 4, 5, and 19 and the fully withheld Document 3 are not confidential for the purposes of Exemption 4. The documents include an agenda reference to private litigation, a budget overview, a legal memorandum, a strategic plan, meeting notes, and a statement of activities. There is no colorable argument that disclosure of any of this information would impair DOE's ability to obtain it in the future, and it is difficult to\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   how disclosure would harm NCC, Inc.'s competitive position. To the extent NCC, Inc. could be said to have competitors, a proposition about which the Court is dubious, none of the information in question is likely to harm NCC, Inc.'s negotiating position\n   <em>\n    vis-\u00e0-vis\n   </em>\n   its members, staff, or the Government. As a result, the documents cannot be withheld as confidential under Exemption 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   c. Privilege\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The game is not yet over. Even if the information in question is not confidential, withholdings may be permissible under Exemption 4 if any of the information in question is\n   <em>\n    privileged\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington Post Co. v.

Cir. 1982). DOE makes a specific assertion of privilege only as to Document 3, invoking the attorney-client and work-product privileges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 2. The Court believes that further briefing is warranted before it can resolve the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"The attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications from clients to their attorneys made for the purpose of securing legal advice or services,\" and it \"also protects communications from attorneys to their clients if the communications rest on confidential information obtained from the client.\"\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts v. IRS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11967576,3707851\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/607/\">\n    117 F.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (internal quotations and citations omitted). While the invocation of the privilege is certainly cursory,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of Document 3, a legal memorandum passing between NCC, Inc. and counsel, confirms that it meets the requisite test. Plaintiff, however, is correct that voluntary disclosure to a third party waives the privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Permian Corp. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687584,472330\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/665/1214/\">\n    665 F.2d 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1219 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Although the Court has concluded that disclosure was\n   <em>\n    involuntary\n   </em>\n   for the purposes of the confidentiality analysis, it is not clear that the same standard for voluntariness applies to the waiver question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Center for Public Integrity v.

The Court will thus require further briefing regarding the appropriate standard and the circumstances under which Document 3 was submitted to DOE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Nor is it clear that the work-product privilege applies. That privilege protects a \"document[ ] or tangible thing[ ] ... prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3). \"In ascertaining whether a document was prepared in anticipation of litigation,\" the D.C. Circuit applies a \" 'because of' test, asking whether, in light of the nature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case, the document can fairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Criminal Defense Lawyers v.

The Court cannot determine, based on Defendant's summary invocation of the privilege in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, whether Document 3 meets that test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 2. The briefing should also therefore provide further detail on that score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, DOE also indicates that one of the redactions in Document 1 covers \"an agenda item referring to private litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 1. To the extent the reference to private litigation could be read as an invocation of privilege, the Court rejects the claim of either attorney-client or work-product privilege as to that document. The redacted agenda item is not a communication between an attorney and a client, nor is it prepared in anticipation of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In sum, as to the Exemption 4 claim, the Court will deny the Government's Motion in part and grant the Center's Cross-Motion in part, ordering the release of Documents 1, 2, 4, 5, and 19. As to Document 3, the Court will require further briefing to determine if a privilege applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Segregability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   One issue remains.
