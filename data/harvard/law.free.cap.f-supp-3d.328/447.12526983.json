Plaintiffs Calisia Kelley and Johnnie Mae Kelley (\"Plaintiffs\") have asserted claims against Defendants for excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a civil rights violation under the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. Having considered Plaintiffs' Complaint, (Docket No. 1), the Port Authority Motion and the brief in support of same, (Docket No. 12 (hereinafter \"Port Authority Brief\"), the Allegheny County Motion and the brief in support of same, (Docket No. 14 (hereinafter \"Allegheny County Brief\"), Plaintiffs' responses in opposition, (Docket Nos. 15-17, 20), and Defendants' replies to Plaintiffs' responses, (Docket No. 22 (hereinafter \"Port Authority Reply\"), 23 (hereinafter \"Allegheny County Reply\") ), the Port Authority Motion and the Allegheny County Motion are GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs, Johnnie Mae Kelley and Calisia Kelley, are the co-administrators of the Estate of Bruce Kelley, Jr. (Docket No. 1, at \u00b6 1). Their claims arise from an incident between the deceased, Bruce Kelley, Jr., and certain Allegheny County Port Authority Police Officers. The following is a recitation of the facts as alleged in the Complaint, which the Court will accept as true for the sole purpose of deciding the pending motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On Sunday, January 31, 2016 in the afternoon, Bruce Kelley, Jr. was spending time with his father in a gazebo in Linear Park in the Borough of Wilkinsburg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24). Two Port Authority police officers approached and accused\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Kelley, Jr. and his father, Kelley, Sr., of open container violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). While Kelley, Sr. interacted with the two officers, Kelley, Jr. stood passively hugging the gazebo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). During the interaction between the officers and Kelley, Sr., Kelley, Jr. walked away from the officers and the gazebo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). Back-up was called and numerous police officers responded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31). As he was walking away from the officers, Kelley, Jr. pulled out a knife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). He carried this knife for his self-protection because he was homeless at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). Kelley, Jr. walked away from the officers at a slow pace as the officers pursued him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At some point, the police officers called for the Port Authority K-9 Unit, and approximately fourteen Port Authority Officers cornered Kelley, Jr. in front of a house on Whitney Avenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-39). With guns drawn, the officers told Kelley, Jr. to drop the knife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39). Kelley, Jr. refused to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40). The Port Authority Police K-9 Unit arrived, including Defendants O'Malley and Rivotti and their german shepherd dog. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41). Defendant O'Malley told Kelley, Jr. that he would sic the dog on Kelley, Jr. if he did not drop the knife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42). In response, Kelley, Jr. replied that he would stab the dog to protect himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43). Defendant O'Malley released the dog and it attacked Kelley, Jr., biting Kelley, Jr.'s left arm while Kelley, Jr. held the knife in his right hand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 44-45). Kelley, Jr. slashed at the dog to defend himself and the dog was wounded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46-47). Defendants O'Malley and Rivotti then shot Kelley, Jr. seven times, including two shots in the back, killing him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48). The K-9 dog also died as a result of his injuries, though this was unknown to the officers on the scene at the time of the shooting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a Complaint in this Court on December 11, 2017 asserting that Defendants O'Malley and Rivotti used unreasonable, excessive, deadly force by shooting Kelley, Jr. in the back repeatedly and killing him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51). The Port Authority Motion was filed on May 4, 2018 on behalf of Defendants Allegheny County Port Authority, Allegheny County Port Authority Police Department, Brian O'Malley, Matthew Porter, and Dominic Rivotti (collectively, the \"Port Authority Defendants\"). (Docket No. 10). The Allegheny County Motion followed on May 7, 2018. (Docket No. 13). The Motions are now fully briefed and ripe for disposition. (Docket Nos. 10-11, 13, 14-17, 22-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Instead, they would have known that they were joining a police pursuit of an armed suspect in a residential area and that the suspect had refused to drop his weapon, despite commands by the other officers to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-41). Given the totality of Kelley Jr.'s actions, the Court further finds that a reasonable officer would have likely believed he was authorized to use deadly force against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Analogous cases from other circuits also favor O'Malley and Rivotti in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blanford v.
