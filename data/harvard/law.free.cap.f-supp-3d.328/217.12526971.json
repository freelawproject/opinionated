Until November 2014, the price of physical gold was set twice daily through a private auction involving some of the largest bullion banks in London. Plaintiffs allege that the afternoon \"Gold Fixing\"-also known as the \"PM Fixing\"-was a cover for a price-fixing conspiracy among the entity charged with operating the Gold Fixing, defendant London Gold Market Fixing Ltd. (\"LGMF\"), and the participant banks: The Bank of Nova Scotia (\"BNS\"), Barclays Bank plc (\"Barclays\"), Deutsche Bank AG (\"DB\"), HSBC Bank plc (\"HSBC\"), and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (\"SocGen\") (collectively, the \"Fixing Banks\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs have also named as a defendant UBS AG and its affiliates (together \"UBS\"). Although UBS was not a member of the Gold Fixing at any point during the alleged class period, Plaintiffs contend UBS conspired with the Fixing Banks to suppress the price of gold as determined by the PM Fixing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs are individuals and entities that sold physical gold, gold futures traded on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (\"COMEX\") market, shares in gold exchange-traded funds (\"ETFs\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or options on gold ETFs during the Class Period.

In brief, UBS contends that its participation in a scheme to suppress the PM Fixing is implausible. According to UBS, the Fixing Banks, with their ready-made forum for collusion and substantial market power, had no reason to involve UBS in their alleged conspiracy. UBS also moves to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction over a Swiss entity, UBS AG. For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees that Plaintiffs' allegations against UBS are implausible. The motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the prior proceedings in this case and the Court's prior opinion in\n   <em>\n    In re Commodity Exch., Inc., Gold Futures and Options Trading Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271786\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/631/\">\n    213 F.Supp.3d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Gold I\n   </em>\n   \") and the Court's memorandum order granting leave to amend, Dkt. 258 (\"\n   <em>\n    Gold II\n   </em>\n   \"). In recent years, the Gold Fix auction (which originated in 1919) has been conducted during a conference call among representatives of the five Fixing Banks. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 87-92. No third parties participated in the call, making it an almost perfect forum for collusion among competitors. The market-clearing price in the auction (the \"Fix Price\") was published as a benchmark price for physical gold. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 83-84. Because of a near-perfect correlation between prices for physical gold and gold derivatives, Plaintiffs allege that the Fix Price also effectively set the market price for gold futures, options, and forwards. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 112-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In support of their claims, Plaintiffs allege that there has been a persistent downward bias in gold prices immediately before and during the PM Fixing call. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 9, 27. From 2004 through 2012 (Plaintiffs' proposed class period), the spot price of gold decreased during the PM Fixing on between 60% and 80% of trading days, TAC \u00b6\u00b6 27, 123-25, even though, it is alleged, an efficient market would be equally likely to move upwards or downwards on a given day. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 128-29. The PM Fixing also registered as one of the most volatile periods in the trading day, TAC \u00b6\u00b6 145, 156-60, a phenomenon not seen around the morning or \"AM\" fixing, TAC \u00b6 153. Plaintiffs' analysis further shows that the downward movement in the price of physical gold consistently began in the minutes before the PM Fixing call began, evidence, according to Plaintiffs, of coordinated trading based on foreknowledge of the Fix Price that would emerge from the auction. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 125, 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs also identified alleged patterns in the Defendants' price quotes, which, Plaintiffs contend, link them to anomalous pricing behavior observed around the PM Fixing. According to Plaintiffs, Defendants consistently quoted similar (or \"bunched\"), below market prices around the PM Fixing, a trend that was more pronounced on so-called \"down days,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , on days when the Fix Price was lower than the spot price of gold before the Fix Price was announced. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 209, 257-60, 262-65. On certain days identified by Plaintiffs, Defendants\n   quoted prices that appeared to either cause or anticipate downward movement in the PM Fixing. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 268-74 &amp; App'x. I. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants employed manipulative trading tactics, like \"spoofing,\" \"wash sales,\" and \"front-running\" client orders, in order to further manipulate the price of physical gold and gold-denominated assets before and during the PM Fixing. TAC \u00b6 10 &amp; n.4. Notwithstanding the fact that UBS was not a member of the fixing panel at any point during the class period, Plaintiffs contend that UBS facilitated the conspiracy by using its large trading position to move the market in tandem with suppression of the Fix Price.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 15 (\"A single actor could not and would not have attempted to move the market so consistently. There would not have been enough 'ammo' to do so, and the risk (and cost) would have been too high.\"). Trading to create artificial downward momentum in the price of gold assisted the Fixing Banks by \"altering the starting price, ..., and giving cover to an auction-rate that would otherwise have stood out like a sore thumb.\" TAC \u00b6 10. Defendants supposedly benefited from this scheme by using their foreknowledge of the PM Fixing to make profitable trades in the physical gold and gold derivatives markets, trigger \"stop-loss\" orders, and time margin calls to accrue favorable cash flows. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 18, 237-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gold I\n   </em>\n   , the Court denied the Fixing Banks' motion to dismiss and granted UBS's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271786\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/631/\">\n    213 F.Supp.3d at 642, 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Likewise, while Plaintiffs claimed the Defendants were net short COMEX gold futures during the class period, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 171, 209-216, 228, 272-suggesting a motive to suppress gold prices-they did not specify which banks were short and by how much.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 201-08 (stating UBS had large positions in gold products during the class period, but with no indication whether UBS was long or short, or what percentage of those positions were held on behalf\n   of clients). On certain days, identified in Appendix I to the SAC, UBS and one or more of the Fixing Banks were alleged to have offered spot quotes showing a reversion in prices at the time of the PM Fixing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC 253-58 &amp; App'x I. But it was impossible to tell whether these quotes reflect legal, parallel pricing behavior (e.g., matching a competitor) or something more nefarious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gold I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271786\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/631/\">\n    213 F.Supp.3d at 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The centerpiece of the TAC are fragments of electronic chat messages, sixteen in all, between a precious metals trader at UBS and a precious metals trader at Deutsche Bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 358-73. Plaintiffs contend that these chat messages are evidence that \"UBS understood, participated in and benefited from [ ] collusive activities\" in the gold markets. TAC \u00b6 11. At a minimum, according to Plaintiffs, they show a high degree of interfirm communications and are therefore circumstantial evidence of an antitrust conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

The UBS trader responded that it was \"not rocket science\" but cautioned his friend that he had \"seen fixings go real wrong before ... like-300k pnl [personal net loss].\" TAC \u00b6 360 The Deutsche Bank trader asked, \"wrong side?\" to which the UBS trader responded \"nope basically bad timing ... push too early ... run out of ammo at the end.\" TAC \u00b6 360 One month later, the Deutsche Bank trader said he had been \"prop [proprietary] trading on the fix\" and characterized \"the fix,\" somewhat nonchalantly, as a \"free option.\" TAC \u00b6 361. In response, the UBS trader recounted the same story. Lastly, on May 11, 2011, the UBS trader told the trader at Deutsche Bank that \"we smashed it [the fix] good.\" TAC \u00b6 363.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The TAC also includes two new statistical analyses, which Plaintiffs contend support an inference UBS participated in a scheme to suppress the PM Fixing. According to Plaintiffs, UBS, on average, quoted below-market prices beginning in the ten minutes before the PM Fixing and continued to quote below market prices until immediately before the London market closed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 355-56. Plaintiffs also allege that \"UBS's prices at the time of the PM Fixing fell in the bottom 5% and 10% for prices of the day far more often than they fell into the top 5% and 10%.\" TAC \u00b6 357. This is evidence, according to Plaintiffs, that UBS's prices \"were not in line with normal market expectations ....\" TAC \u00b6 357.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   UBS has moved to dismiss the TAC on the grounds that the chat messages do not alter this Court's earlier conclusion that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged UBS was involved in a conspiracy with the Fixing Banks to suppress the Fix Price. As UBS points out, the Gold Fixing was a self-contained process, involving only the Fixing Banks. Because the Fixing Banks had complete control over the process, UBS's involvement was not necessary to the scheme and would not have been to the conspirators' benefit. UBS Mem. (Dkt. 298) at 12-13. The chat messages, UBS contends, are perhaps evidence of order manipulation or collusive trading-what UBS calls euphemistically \" 'episodic' coordination,\" UBS Mem. at 2-but not of an agreement to suppress the fix: time-stamps on the chats, annoyingly omitted by Plaintiffs, show that the communications occurred primarily in the middle of the night London time and never close in time to the PM Fixing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UBS Mem. at 16-17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Eric J. Stock (\"Stock Declr.\") (Dkt. 299) Ex. 1 (chronological chart of chat messages cited in the TAC including time stamps and locations for the participants). Moreover, none of the chats references an agreement to manipulate the PM Fixing; the only references to a fixing describe incidents during which UBS admitted to \"smashing\" an unspecified fix and the story described above in which the UBS trader recounted (twice) a\n   <em>\n    failed\n   </em>\n   attempt to \"push\" an unspecified fix by an unspecified trader at an unidentified bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UBS Mem. at 17-18 (citing TAC \u00b6\u00b6 360-61). Hedging its bet, UBS also moved to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing because\n   UBS was not the proximate cause of their injury and that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction as to the Swiss entity UBS AG because the TAC does not allege any suit-related, in-forum conduct by UBS AG in particular.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In evaluating a motion to dismiss, the Court must \"accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer v.

Three of the chat messages included in the TAC reference \"fixes,\" but none describes a scheme among UBS and the Fixing Banks persistently to suppress the Fix Price. In messages on April 1, 2011, and May 1, 2011, the UBS trader described an occasion on which he observed a fixing \"go\n   real wrong\" resulting in a personal net loss of \"300k\". TAC \u00b6\u00b6 360, 361. The Deutsche Bank trader responded by asking if the trader-whose identity is unspecified and whose employer is open to speculation-had been on the \"wrong side,\" to which the UBS trader responded \"nope,\" he had \"push[ed] too early\" and \"run out of ammo.\" TAC \u00b6 360. Even assuming the unidentified trader was employed by UBS, a single failed attempt at \"pushing\" the PM Fix is inconsistent with there being a conspiracy with the Fixing Banks to persistently suppress the PM Fix Price; given the Fixing Banks' complete control over the Fix Price, \"pushing\" the PM Fixing itself would be unnecessary. Moreover, the context of the discussion was to warn the Deutsche Bank trader that it\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   possible to lose money on the PM Fixing-it is \"not always fun and g[a]mes.\" TAC \u00b6 360. That warning suggests that the UBS trader did not have inside knowledge that the Fix Price was being controlled by a conspiracy. The other references to the \"fix\" describe proprietary trading that has no obvious connection to a fix-suppression conspiracy, and a time UBS \"smashed\" an unspecified \"fix.\" TAC \u00b6\u00b6 361, 363. Like \"pushing,\" \"smashing\" the PM Fix-assuming that is what UBS did-is inconsistent with a broader conspiracy involving the Fixing Banks. Neither of the chats indicates the traders acted in concert with others. The other chat messages describe coordinated trading and sharing of order flow information and proprietary pricing information, but they do not discuss manipulation of the PM Fixing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 364-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs do not dispute that the chat messages are not direct evidence of a price fixing conspiracy. Instead, according to Plaintiffs, the chat messages are a \"plus factor\" or circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy to be evaluated in the context of Plaintiffs' statistical analysis that shows anomalous pricing behavior around the PM Fixing. The Court does not find Plaintiffs' theory of parallel pricing and circumstantial evidence to be sufficient to nudge its allegations across the line to \"plausible.\" In\n   <em>\n    Gold I\n   </em>\n   , the Court rejected Plaintiffs' argument that they had plausibly linked UBS to a conspiracy to suppress the PM Fix through circumstantial evidence of parallel pricing during and around the PM Fixing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271786\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/631/\">\n    213 F.Supp.3d at 678-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"At best,\" and accepting Plaintiffs' group-pleading, the statistical analysis in the SAC was evidence that UBS quoted below-market prices at the same time as a downward reversion in prices occurred around the PM Fixing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271786\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271786\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/631/\">\n    at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs' coefficient of variation, or \"bunching,\" analysis also refers to the \"Defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 257-65. Because the analysis does not specify the coefficient of variation for any individual bank, the Court cannot determine whether UBS quoted \"bunched\" prices or whether variance in UBS's quotes is obscured by the group-wide analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those analyses that are UBS-specific show that UBS had a substantial position-long or short-in the gold markets, TAC \u00b6\u00b6 210-15, and that on specific days during the class period UBS quoted spot prices for physical gold that were in parallel with a downward trend in prices around the PM Fixing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 267-74 &amp; App'x I. But UBS's status as a major market-maker for gold is not evidence that UBS was involved in a conspiracy to suppress the price of gold, and without information as to whether UBS specifically was long or short, the Court cannot infer a motive to suppress gold prices. The charts in Appendix I are as consistent with parallel, market-following behavior, or a legitimate expectation prices would fall, as they are with participation in a price-fixing scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent the charts in Appendix I are probative, they are limited to approximately a dozen days over an 8-year class period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The TAC adds two new, UBS-specific analyses. According to Plaintiffs, UBS quoted below market spot prices for physical gold throughout the class period, beginning shortly before the PM Fixing and persisting until shortly before the close of the London market at 4:30 p.m. London time. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 355-56. Normalizing the market price to 1.000, at the peak of the variance, shortly after the PM Fixing began, UBS quoted prices that were, on average 0.04% or 0.05% (4 or 5 basis points) below market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is notable that this underpricing\n   begins before the PM Fixing, an indication that UBS may have anticipated a drop in prices. But the analysis also appears to show that from approximately 2:50 p.m. to 4:25 p.m. (i.e., from 10 minutes before the beginning of the Fixing Call until five minutes before the London market closed, which is approximately 85 minutes after the Fix Price was announced), UBS was underpricing everyone, including the Fixing Banks, its alleged co-conspirators. Plaintiffs do not explain why UBS continued (on average) to quote below-market prices for more than an hour after the PM Fixing. Because the Fix Price was also the market price, Plaintiffs' analysis appears to show that UBS consistently quoted prices below the Fix Price in afternoon trading in London. A market participant with foreknowledge of the price to be set in the PM Fixing would be able to accurately predict the market price, not consistently undershoot it. Plaintiffs also present an analysis to show that UBS's prices around the time of the PM Fixing were more frequently in the bottom 5% to 10% of the market that day than they were in the top 5% or 10%. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 357.

But analysis of inter-firm communications is not mechanical, and the probative value of such evidence depends on the participants, the information exchanged, and the context-specifically, the connection between the content and the price-fixing conspiracy alleged. For example, communications of pricing information among senior executives around the time of observed parallel pricing behavior tends to make it more likely that the parallel prices are the product of an unlawful agreement rather than legitimate, conscious parallelism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Publ'n Paper Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504207\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/51/#p67\">\n    690 F.3d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67 (2d Cir. 2012) (\"[T]he causal link is presumed to be particularly strong when, as alleged here, the agreement is between executives at rival companies, each of whom has final pricing authority.\").

The Deutsche Bank trader's uncertainty regarding prices is also inconsistent with an insider's knowledge of a price-fixing conspiracy. As Plaintiffs appear to concede, the relevance of chat messages showing market manipulation and order flow sharing depends on an inference that if these two traders were willing to share information and collude in Singapore, then they or others at UBS and Deutsche Bank must have also been sharing information in London leading up to and during the PM Fixing.

Sept. 20, 2016) (excusing Plaintiffs' failure to plead information concerning the \"specific dates, times, currency pairs and customers discussed\" in chat messages between traders because that information was \"exclusively in Defendants' control\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Reviewing the charts is an inexact science because Plaintiffs have not provided data on the variance of each quote from the market trend-line. As far as the Court can tell, the charts do not show that UBS quoted prices that were at a greater variance from the trend line than other market participants. It is also unclear whether the charts are based on a complete universe of quotes from the spot market for physical gold or a limited subset of market participants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    There is no information in the TAC as to how this variance compares to other market participants. It is unlikely that any market participant would quote prices perfectly in line with the average market price, even averaged over many years. Nonetheless, it is interesting that UBS's prices moved downward immediately before the PM Fixing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Insofar as the PM Fix Price more often marked a downward trend in prices, it seems logical that quotes from UBS (and apparently every other market maker) around the PM Fixing would be more likely to be in the bottom 10% of quotes for the day than the top 10%. Plaintiffs initially presented a version of this analysis as evidence of anomalous pricing around the time of the PM Fixing. The Court agrees that this analysis, currently included at TAC \u00b6\u00b6 139-42, is evidence of a downward reversion in prices at the time of the PM Fixing. But Plaintiffs leave unexplained why quoting prices consistent with a market-wide trend is evidence of participation in a fix-suppression conspiracy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Because the chat messages are incorporated into the TAC, the Court may consider the complete messages as provided by the Non-Fixing Banks.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Nokia Corp.
