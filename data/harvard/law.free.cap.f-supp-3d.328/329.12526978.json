PAUL OETKEN, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2015, a container of audio equipment left Tokyo, Japan, bound for Memphis, Tennessee. The container crossed the ocean and arrived in Los Angeles, California without incident. But the equipment suffered damage during its transcontinental journey, when the train carrying the container derailed in southwestern Missouri. The cargo owners and their insurer sued the shipper, and the shipper then sued the subcontractors responsible for the container's overland transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The subcontractors move to dismiss the Amended Third-Party Complaint (the \"Complaint\") for, among other reasons, lack of personal jurisdiction. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are taken from the Complaint and are assumed true for purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As is common in intermodal, intercontinental shipping, this case involves a series of contracts and subcontracts. The foundational document is Sea Waybill number BANQTY02217950 (the \"Sea Waybill\"), issued by Kuehne + Nagel, Inc. (\"K+N\") to American Music and Sound, LLC for the transportation of a container of audio equipment from Tokyo, Japan to Memphis, Tennessee, via the Port of Los Angeles, California. (Dkt. No. 46 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 17; Dkt. No. 49-2 at 7.) After issuing this bill of lading, K+N then subcontracted AZ/CFS West, Inc. (\"AZ\") to provide \"transportation logistics services\" for the overland leg of the ship's journey. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 24.) AZ, in turn, arranged for rail transportation by BNSF Railway Company (\"BNSF\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The cargo container departed Tokyo aboard the vessel Mol Experience in November 2015. (Compl. \u00b6 17; Dkt. No. 49-2 at 7.) After safely arriving in Los Angeles, the container was transferred to a train bound for Memphis. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 22.) But the train encountered flooding along Shoal Creek in Newton County, Missouri, causing the train to derail. (Compl. \u00b6 22.) American Music and Sound, LLC and its insurer Affiliated FM Insurance Company (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") allege that the audio equipment suffered both water and crushing damage as a result. (Compl. \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Invoking federal maritime jurisdiction, Plaintiffs filed suit against K+N and the Mol Experience in January 2017 (Dkt. No. 1), and K+N, in turn, filed a third-party complaint against AZ and BNSF (collectively, \"Third-Party Defendants\"). (Dkt. No. 26.) K+N asserts claims for breach of contract, negligence, and indemnification against Third-Party Defendants. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-40.) K+N also has made a tender pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 14(c), alleging that Third-Party Defendants are liable to K+N for some or all of its liability to Plaintiffs or, alternatively, that they are liable to Plaintiffs directly. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.) Third-Party Defendants move to dismiss on a variety of grounds, including for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The first is a forum selection clause giving this Court exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising under the Sea Waybill. Paragraph 21.1 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   For US Carriage, this sea waybill is governed by United States law and the United States Federal Court of the Southern District of New York has exclusive jurisdiction to hear all disputes hereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Dkt. No. 49-3 \u00b6 21.1.) The second is a so-called Himalaya Clause, a type of contractual provision commonly used by shippers to \"extend[ ] contractual protections that would otherwise apply only to the entity issuing the bill of lading to the subcontractors of the issuing entity as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Royal &amp; Sun All.

The relevant portion of the Sea Waybill's Himalaya Clause states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Without prejudice to the other provisions in this Clause ..., every Sub-Contractor shall have the benefit of all provisions herein benefiting the Carrier including clause 21 ..., the jurisdiction and law clause, as if this sea waybill ... were expressly for its benefit[,] and in entering into this contract the Carrier, to the extent of these provisions, does so not only on his own behalf but also as agent or trustee for such Sub-Contractor and such Sub-Contractor shall to this extent be or be deemed to be parties to this contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Dkt. No. 49-3 \u00b6 5.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Sea Waybill defines \"Sub-Contractors\" to include \"any independent contractors, servants or agents employed by the Carrier ... and any direct or indirect sub-contractors, servants, or agents thereof, whether in direct contractual privity with the Carrier or not.\" (Dkt. No. 49-3 \u00b6 1.) Although AZ and BNSF fall within the Sea Waybill's definition of \"Sub-Contractors,\" they are not identified by name; indeed, neither AZ nor BNSF appears anywhere on the Sea Waybill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Enforceability of the Sea Waybill's Forum Selection Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   K+N argues that the Sea Waybill's forum selection clause binds Third-Party Defendants and that, as a result, AZ and BNSF have consented to personal jurisdiction in the Southern District of New York. (Dkt. No. 57 at 8.) The latter half of this proposition is true: If AZ and BNSF are indeed parties to the forum selection clause, then they have waived any objection to personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D.H. Blair &amp; Co. v.

Sept. 24, 2010) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The important question, therefore, is whether the forum selection clause is enforceable against AZ and BNSF. In\n   <em>\n    M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that a maritime contract's forum selection clause is \"prima facie valid and should be enforced unless enforcement is shown by the resisting party to be 'unreasonable' under the circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p10\">\n    407 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p10\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p10\">\n    32 L.Ed.2d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). Following the\n   <em>\n    M/S Bremen\n   </em>\n   decision, the Second Circuit announced a four-part test for determining the validity of a forum selection clause. Initially, a court asks (1) \"whether the clause was reasonably communicated to the party resisting enforcement,\" (2) whether \"the clause [is] mandatory or permissive,\" and (3) \"whether the claims and parties involved in the suit are subject to the forum selection clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

Imagine three parties, Principal A, Contractor B, and Subcontractor C. Principal A and Contractor B have signed Contract X, which obligates Contractor B to perform services for Principal A. Contractor B then subcontracts with Subcontractor C to perform some of those services. Consider three scenarios under which Subcontractor C-a non-signatory to the contract-may become implicated in a suit to enforce Contract X: (1) Subcontractor C seeks to enforce a provision of Contract X against Principal A; (2) Principal A seeks to enforce a provision of Contract X against Subcontractor C; or (3) Contractor B seeks to enforce a provision of Contract X against Subcontractor C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Scenario One is the case presented by\n   <em>\n    Magi XXI\n   </em>\n   . There, the Second Circuit held that Subcontractor C may enforce a forum selection clause against Principal A if Subcontractor C is \"closely related\" to Contractor B such that Subcontractor C's enforcement of the clause is \"foreseeable\" to Principal A. However, as other courts have observed, \" 'the phrase 'closely related' is not particularly illuminating,' and ... courts have varied in their application of the doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Recurrent Capital Bridge Fund I, LLC v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 6-13.) But this case is a Scenario Three case. K+N (Contractor B) is seeking to enforce a provision of its contract with Plaintiffs (Principal A) against its own subcontractors (Subcontractor C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In glossing over this crucial difference, K+N presumes what no court in the Second Circuit has yet held: the applicability of the \"closely related\" test to a dispute between a signatory contractor and its non-signatory subcontractor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This Court declines to extend the \"closely related\" test to a Scenario Three case for a simple reason: It is unnecessary. The purpose of the \"closely related\" test is to facilitate shipping transactions by creating certainty. It gives parties who have come to an agreement the ability to enforce that agreement against the universe of entities who should expect as much-successors-in-interest, executive officers, and the like-without being overly persnickety about who signed on the dotted line. The desire to protect negotiated-for expectations is what led the Second Circuit to caution that \"[a] literal approach to interpreting forum selection clauses-an approach that always ignored affiliates of the signatories-could ... undermine the contribution that such clauses have been praised for making to certainty in commercial transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    Magi XXI, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864786\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/714/#p723\">\n    714 F.3d at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

In other words, when parties negotiate ex ante to litigate in a particular forum, their agreement should not be easily scuttled ex post by a technicality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But the situation is very different when contractors and their subcontractors are involved. Unlike Principal A and Subcontractor C, who are legal strangers to each other, Contractor B and Subcontractor C have a preexisting contractual relationship. This means that Contractor B and Subcontractor C had the opportunity to negotiate and agree to a forum selection clause, but, for whatever reason, they declined to do so. If the purpose of a foreseeability test is to enforce parties' reasonable expectations, then such a test is wholly unnecessary when the parties actually memorialized their expectations in a contract.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Asoma Corp. v.

As a general matter, non-parties to a contract may sue under that contract if they are its intended beneficiaries.

Neither condition exists in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, Third-Party Defendants have in no way agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Sea Waybill. True, AZ and BNSF seek the protection of the Sea Waybill's Himalaya Clause, and in so arguing they admit to qualifying as \"Sub-contractors\" under its terms. But K+N's attempt to wring a \"judicial admission\" out of Third-Party Defendants' reliance on the Himalaya Clause is unavailing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 57 at 2-6.) As discussed above, AZ and BNSF can benefit from the protection of the Himalaya Clause without agreeing to be bound by the burden of the Sea Waybill's forum selection clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mar.

The Himalaya Clause does state that \"in entering into this contract the Carrier ... does so not only on its own behalf but also as agent or trustee for such Sub-Contractor.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 49-3 \u00b6 5.3.) But K+N's reliance on this clause collapses under its own weight. In effect, K+N claims that a contract to which AZ and BNSF are not parties created an agency relationship between AZ and BNSF, on the one hand, and K+N on the other. Further straining credulity, K+N appears to argue that in this same document, it somehow inked a contract between itself as contractor and itself as agent, thereby binding AZ and BNSF to K+N's choice of forum.

Rule 14(c)(2) allows a defendant, proceeding as a third-party plaintiff to \"demand judgment in the plaintiff's favor against the third-party defendant,\" and, in that circumstance, \"the action proceeds as if the plaintiff had sued ... the third-party defendant\" directly.

Such a hypothetical action poses a Scenario Two case-and one in which application of the \"closely related\" test is more appropriate. Even so, in the absence of any contrary argument by K+N, the Court concludes that K+N and Third-Party Defendants are not so closely related that Plaintiffs' enforcement of the forum selection clause against AZ and BNSF would have been foreseeable to those parties. Third-Party Defendants neither \"played an active role in the transaction\" creating the Sea Waybill, nor did they serve as \"principal[s] of the signatory company.\"\n    <em>\n     Bent\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20153092\">\n     2016 WL 153092\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4.
