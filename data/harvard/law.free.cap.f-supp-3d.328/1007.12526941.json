Instead, Versace needs to show only that the VAS mark is \"likely to impair the distinctiveness\" of the Versace marks. There is no genuine dispute of fact on that point, given the marks' similarities and the Versace marks' distinctiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The remaining blurring factors favor Versace. With respect to the third factor, Versace has acted defensively to protect its marks, and tightly controls its diffusion lines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Opp. at 32-33; Pls.

As to the fifth factor, remarks from purchasers and Versace's expert report show that consumers actually associate the VAS and Versace marks.

As to whether the marks are associated, the evidence underlying the Court's infringement analysis applies. VAS does not dispute that the marks are associated for purposes of tarnishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Versace contends that, as a factual matter, VAS's products are inferior to Versace's. To support that assertion, Versace relies on expert testimony and consumer complaints detailing the poor quality of VAS products and workmanship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Briers Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 158-164, 226-264, Ex. 30 (\"Serdari Rep.\") at 21 n.61, 28; Briers Decl., Ex. 12 (\"Bergman Depo.\") at 190:11-19, 196:13-197:3. VAS specifically denies just one of these consumer complaints (pertaining to a moldy product); otherwise, VAS does not address Versace's evidence. VAS does broadly assert that Versace fails to \"offer any comprehensive evidence as to the quality of the products VAS licensed.\" Defs. Opp. at 34. VAS is simply incorrect, and given the substantial evidence Versace sets forth, it is VAS that bears the burden to come forward with evidence that its products are not inferior. VAS has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Separately, VAS suggests that it may have licensed higher quality products because Versace has a \"1 percent return rate from consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191776\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/1316/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But VAS fails to explain the relationship between Versace's return rate and VAS's product quality. VAS also does not present evidence of, or even assert, its own rate of product return. It is accordingly unclear why this fact is material, even if it is disputed. Summary judgment is appropriate on Versace's tarnishment theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    C. VAS's Counterclaims and Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In addition to moving for summary judgment on its own claims, Versace also seeks summary judgment on: (1) VAS's counterclaims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment; and (2) VAS's\n   affirmative defenses of waiver, collateral estoppel, laches, and fair use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.

The Agreement settled an Italian infringement lawsuit brought by Versace against VAS, and was entered by the Court of Milan in July 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Mot. at 4; Defs. Opp. at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The parties' dispute turns on the meaning and interpretation of the Conciliation Agreement. Versace argues that the Agreement prohibits VAS from using the Versace name for any purpose except where the law requires VAS to use its full name.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls. Mot. at 4. Versace presents a certified translation in support of its interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 223 (\"Pennekamp Decl.\"), Ex. H. at 2 (\"Mr. Papadas ... agrees to forego registration of the distinctive sign [VAS] ... although he retains the right/duty to indicate the full name of the manufacturer and/or importer of the products in cases required by law including for purposes of the labeling, but the current font being used must be modified....\"). Versace acknowledges that, under the Agreement, it has waived \"all rights and/or claims\" against VAS in the event that VAS complies with the Agreement's terms. And yet, VAS admitted in this litigation that no U.S. law requires VAS to place its full name on products involved in the present lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Briers Decl., Ex. 37 (\"VAS states that it does not at this time contend, and does not need to contend, in this action that the applicable law requires the full company name to be placed on the subject labels that are involved in the present lawsuit.\"). Versace highlights that multiple Italian courts have agreed with its interpretation of the Agreement (which is written in Italian). Versace argues that principles of comity merit deference to those decisions, regardless of either party's English translation of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In response, VAS contends that the Agreement allows VAS to use the \"Versace\" marks for purposes of labeling irrespective of whether the law requires it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer \u00b6\u00b6 8, 28(a); Defs.

No. 139-1 at 1 (\"It is therefore understood that [Papadas] has the right and the duty to indicate the complete company name of the producer and/or importer of the products in those cases stated by the law, also for the products labeling by modifying the eventual font used.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court defers to the decisions of numerous Italian courts holding, respectively, that Versace's interpretation of the Agreement is correct and that VAS's reading is incorrect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pennekamp Decl., Ex. L at 3 (\"Such use of the petitioner's name, whose identifying heart is clearly represented by the surname VERSACE, clearly exceeds the requirements to comply with European Union law and consumer protection law, the purpose of which is to allow the manufacturer to be identified, and represents a form of use strictly as a distinctive sign, in violation of the settlement agreements invoked.\"), Ex. M at 2 (\"[T]he [settlement] agreement allows [Papadas] only to use the name Versace if it is a part/component of the company name of the manufacturer or importer and, therefore, always in the context of the entire company name, in cases where the indication\n   of the company name is obligatory, including on labels, but with the requirement of possible modification of the font used.\"), Ex. N at 6 (\"As to 'in cases where required by law', a correct interpretation of the clause in the context of the settlement agreement ... was intended by the parties to be strictly limited to cases where the use of the manufacturer, importer or exporter company's name is required by law....\"). Notably-in the most recent of these decisions-the Court of Appeal of Milan affirmed the lower court's rejection of VAS's interpretation of the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pennekamp Decl., Ex.

In reaching that holding, the appellate court reasoned,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   From the literal tenor of the [settlement] agreement, it is clear that its primary goal is to affirm that Papadas and its companies do not have the right to use the national and international fame of the 'Versace' brand in order to promote their own products.

Versace's counsel also sent letters to VAS in 2015 regarding VAS's alleged infringing activity in the United States. Luedtke Decl., Ex. 161 at 2. These letters show, at this stage, that VAS was on notice regarding the marks as early as 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   A reasonable factfinder could likewise find that VAS had actual notice of its infringing activity based on the multiple adverse judgments of Italian courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Mot. at 5. As discussed, those courts unanimously rejected VAS's reading of the Conciliation Agreement.

L. Evidence of actual notice also comes in the form of VAS's undisputed inclusion of, and communications regarding, an indemnity provision in its licensing agreements whereby VAS agreed to indemnify licensees if Versace initiated infringement proceedings against them.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Briers Decl.

Versace's State Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Summary judgment is not warranted on VAS's state law claims. VAS argues that there is no dispute that: (1) Versace did not sustain any damage as a result of confusion from sales of VAS products in California, and (2) neither VAS nor its licensees generated any revenue from product sales in California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.

Versace's Dilution Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Here too, VAS's attempt to rely on its status as a licensor fails. VAS argues,\n   without authority, that it cannot be liable for dilution because it simply licensed others to use its mark. In relevant part, 15 U.S.C. Section 1125(c) provides that liability attaches where one \"commences use of a mark or trade name in commerce,\" with exceptions that are not applicable here. \"Commercial use\" within the meaning of the statute need not involve physical attachment of the disputed marks to a product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Panavision Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191776\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/1316/\">\n    141 F.3d at 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

VAS not only failed to redress this confusion, but encouraged it by highlighting to potential licensees that they could use the Versace name as part of the VAS mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The consequent loss of goodwill incurred by Versace renders money damages inadequate. This is especially so considering that VAS has continued its infringing activity despite receiving multiple adverse judgments from foreign courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neurovision Med.

Opp. at 38. VAS again relies for that proposition on its \"good faith\" interpretation of the Conciliation Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204679001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For the reasons discussed, VAS's good faith claim is not credible. VAS also fails to identify any hardship\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   would suffer as a result of a permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.

In view of the substantial and uncontroverted evidence of harm to Versace, the equities clearly weigh in Versace's favor. Versace argues, and VAS does not disagree, that the public interest favors entry of an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court accordingly finds that a permanent injunction of some sort is warranted based on the above discussed factors, Yet, the Court is required to consider all circumstances in determining whether the injunction issued constitutes \"fair and equitable relief.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    La Quinta Worldwide LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179253\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/867/#p880\">\n    762 F.3d at 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore intends to discuss with the parties Versace's proposed order and permanent injunction, particularly Versace's inclusion of provisions requiring VAS and third party licensees to destroy and provide \"proof of destruction of all remaining inventory of all goods or services subject\" to the Court's order and permanent injunction.
