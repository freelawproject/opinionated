No. 245) and Defendants' Motion for Protective Order (Dkt. No. 268). Having reviewed the Motions, the Responses (Dkt. Nos. 266, 278), the Replies (Dkt. Nos. 273, 281), the Supplemental Briefs (Dkt. Nos. 289, 292, 293) and the related record, and having considered the submissions of the parties at oral argument, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel and DENIES Defendants' Motion for Protective Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 26, 2017, President Donald J. Trump announced a ban on military service by openly transgender people (the \"Ban\"). On March 23, 2018, following the Court's entry of a preliminary injunction, the President issued a Presidential Memorandum (the \"2018 Memorandum\") directing the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") to implement the Ban. (Dkt. No. 224, Ex. 3.) That same day, Defendants moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction. (Dkt. No. 215.) On March 29, 2018, Defendants requested to preclude discovery pending resolution of their motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction. (Dkt. No. 225.) The Court denied that request and ordered\n   discovery in the case to proceed. (Dkt. No. 235.) The Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   To the extent that Defendants intend to claim executive privilege, they must \"expressly make the claim\" and provide a privilege log \"describ[ing] the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed-and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(i)-(ii) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 13, 2018, the Court ordered the preliminary injunction to remain in effect and granted partial summary judgment against the Ban. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 233.) The Court held that the Ban would be subject to strict scrutiny, but declined to rule on its constitutional adequacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court observed that \"[w]hether Defendants have satisfied their burden of showing that the Ban is constitutionally adequate (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it was sincerely motivated by compelling state interests, rather than by prejudice or stereotype) necessarily turns on facts related to Defendants' deliberative process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) Because those facts were not yet before it, the Court directed the parties \"to proceed with discovery and prepare for trial on the issues of whether, and to what extent, deference is owed to the Ban and whether the Ban violates equal protection, substantive due process, and the First Amendment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) Defendants filed a notice of appeal and requested that the Ninth Circuit stay the preliminary injunction pending its review. (Dkt. No. 236);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karnoski v. Trump\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-35347, Dkt. No. 3 (9th Cir. May 4, 2018). On July 18, 2018, the Ninth Circuit denied the request, holding that \"a stay of the preliminary injunction would upend, rather than preserve, the status quo.\" (Dkt. No. 295.) The appeal is set to be heard in October 2018. (Dkt. No. 296.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Requested Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Throughout this litigation, Plaintiffs have sought discovery regarding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 The identity of the individuals with whom President Trump discussed or corresponded regarding policies on military service by transgender people;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 The date on which President Trump decided that transgender people should be banned from military service;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 The process by which President Trump formulated the Ban, including identification of \"all sources of fact or opinion\" he \"consulted, considered, or otherwise referred to\" in formulating the Ban;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Documents and communications related to President Trump's consultation with employees, agents, contractors, or consultants of the United States Armed Forces regarding military service by transgender people;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Documents and communications relating to, and including all drafts of, the 2017 Memorandum;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Communications between President Trump and Congress concerning military service by transgender people prior to August 26, 2017; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Documents relating to visits and communications between President Trump and his Evangelical Advisory Board.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Dkt. No. 278 at 3-4; Dkt. No. 268 at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To date, Defendants have objected to each of these requests and have withheld or redacted tens of thousands of documents based on the deliberative process privilege. President Trump has refused to substantively respond at all based on the presidential communications privilege. (Dkt. No. 245 at 8-9; Dkt. No. 246, Ex. 28; Dkt. No. 278 at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 10, 2018, Plaintiffs moved to compel responses withheld under the deliberative process privilege. (Dkt. No. 245.) On May 21, 2018, Defendants moved to preclude discovery directed at President Trump. (Dkt. No. 268.) These motions are now before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Trump v. Hawaii\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Before turning to the merits of the pending discovery motions, the Court addresses the impact of the Supreme Court's recent ruling in\n   <em>\n    Trump v. Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). In\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that President Trump's policy restricting the entry of certain foreign nationals did not violate the Immigration and Nationality Act or the Establishment Clause. The majority found the policy to be \"facially neutral toward religion\" and plausibly related to the government's stated national security objectives.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/\">\n    at 2418-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Defendants claim that the same reasoning precludes discovery directed to President Trump in this case, the Court disagrees for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First,\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   involved an entirely different standard of scrutiny. The Court already ruled that the Ban is subject to strict scrutiny (Dkt. No. 233 at 20-24) and rejects Defendants' suggestion that it \"turns on a medical condition-gender dysphoria-and its treatment, not on any protected status.\" (Dkt. No. 289 at 5.) Unlike the policy in\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , the Court need not \"look behind the face\" of the Ban, as the Ban is facially discriminatory.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . President Trump's announcement explains that \"the United States Government will not accept or allow ... Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military\" (Dkt. No. 149, Ex. 1); the 2017 Memorandum, 2018 Memorandum, and Implementation Plan are titled \"Military Service by Transgender Individuals.\" (Dkt. No. 149, Ex. 2; Dkt. No. 224, Exs. 1, 3.) That the Ban turns on transgender identity-and not on any medical condition-could not be clearer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, the majority in\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   repeatedly emphasized that the exclusion policy was formulated following a \"worldwide, multi-agency review.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2404-06, 2408, 2421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This review considered risks \"identified by Congress or prior administrations\" and involved the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the State Department, \"several intelligence agencies,\" and \"multiple Cabinet members and other officials.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/\">\n    at 2403-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority considered this process \"persuasive evidence\" that the policy had \"a legitimate grounding in national security concerns, quite apart from any religious hostility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/\">\n    at 2421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, Defendants in this case have provided no information whatsoever concerning the process by which the Ban was formulated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   does not purport to address the scope of discovery or the application of any privilege. For these reasons, the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   does not impact its consideration of either of the pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs move to compel documents withheld under the deliberative process privilege. (Dkt. No. 245.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The deliberative process privilege protects documents and materials which would reveal \"advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\"\n   <em>\n    N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p150\">\n    421 U.S. 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 150,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p150\">\n    95 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p150\">\n    44 L.Ed.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975). For the privilege to apply, a document must be (1) \"predecisional,\" meaning that it was \"generated before the adoption of an agency's policy or decision,\" and (2) \"deliberative,\" meaning that it contains \"opinions, recommendations, or advice about agency policies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    FTC v. Warner Commc'ns Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613334\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/742/1156/#p1161\">\n    742 F.2d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1161 (9th Cir. 1984). \"Purely factual material that does not reflect deliberative processes is not protected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613334\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/742/1156/#p1161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The deliberative process privilege is not absolute. Several courts have recognized that the privilege does not apply in cases involving claims of governmental misconduct or where the government's intent is at issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    121 F.3d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738, 746 (D.C.

Defendants concede that the President has not provided substantive responses or produced a privilege log, but contend that because the requested discovery raises \"separation-of-powers concerns,\" Plaintiffs must exhaust discovery \"from sources other than the President and his immediate White House advisors and staff\" before he is required to do formally invoke the privilege.

While Defendants claim they need not do so until Plaintiffs \"exhaust other sources of non-privileged discovery, meet a heavy, initial burden of establishing a heightened, particularized need for the specific information or documents sought, and at a minimum substantially narrow any requests directed at presidential deliberations\" (Dkt. No. 268 at 3), the Court finds no support for this claim. To the extent the President intends to invoke the privilege, the Court already ordered that he \" 'expressly make the claim' and provide a privilege log 'describ[ing] the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed-and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.' \" (Dkt. No. 235 at 3) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(b)(5)(i)-(ii).) Only then can the Court evaluate whether the privilege applies and if so, whether Plaintiffs have established a showing of need sufficient to overcome it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Having found that President Trump has failed to demonstrate that he need not invoke the presidential communications privilege, the Court DENIES Defendants' Motion for a Protective Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court ORDERS as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   1. The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel and ORDERS Defendants to turn over those documents that have been withheld solely under the deliberative process privilege within 10 days of the date of this Order;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   2. The Court DENIES Defendants' Motion for a Protective Order and ORDERS Defendants to produce a privilege log identifying the documents,\n   communications, and other materials they have withheld under the presidential communications privilege within 10 days of the date of this Order;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   3. The Court notes that the government privilege logs it has reviewed to date are deficient and do not comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5)(A)(i)-(ii). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 246, Exs. 11-27.) Privilege logs must provide sufficient information to assess the claimed privilege and to this end must (a) identify individual author(s) and recipient(s); and (b) include\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    non-boilerplate\n   </em>\n   privilege descriptions\n   <em>\n    on a document-by-document basis.\n   </em>\n   To the extent they have not already done so, the Court ORDERS Defendants to produce revised privilege logs within 10 days of the date of this Order;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   4.

No. 224, Ex. 1 at 4, Ex. 2 at 7.) As the Court previously noted, \"[r]equiring transgender people to serve in their 'biological sex' ... would force [them] to suppress the very characteristic that defines them as transgender in the first place.\" (Dkt.
