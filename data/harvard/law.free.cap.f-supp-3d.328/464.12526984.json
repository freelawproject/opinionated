INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendant Agway Energy Services, LLC's (\"Agway\") Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and Brief in Support, (Docket Nos. 21, 22); Plaintiff James Brown's (\"Plaintiff\") Response, Brief in Opposition, and Exhibits in Support of Opposition to Motion (Docket Nos. 32, 33, 34); and Agway's Reply Brief, (Docket No. 35). Agway seeks dismissal of all claims asserted by Plaintiff in his March 13, 2018 Class Action Complaint (\"Complaint\"). (Docket No. 21, at 1). Count One of Plaintiff's Complaint is a claim for breach of contract. (Docket No. 1, at 18). Count Two pleads, in the alternative, an unjust enrichment claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). Plaintiff withdrew Count Two, leaving only one claim- breach of contract-pending before the Court. (Docket No. 33, at 8 n.1). This Court exercises subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's remaining claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A) (Class Action Diversity). After careful consideration of the parties' positions and for the following reasons, Agway's Motion to Dismiss will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   II. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Agway is an electric generation supplier (\"EGS\") that purchases energy directly or indirectly from energy production companies and, in turn, sells that energy to consumers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19). Consumers may opt to switch from a public utility to an EGS, at which point the EGS sets the price for the consumer's energy supply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). Plaintiff switched to Agway, an EGS, for his electricity needs in March 2016, contractually binding him to electricity rates set by Agway in accordance with Agway's \"Customer Contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). The Customer\n   Contract, attached to Plaintiff's Complaint as Exhibit A, is a two-page document with key terms provided in an easy-to-read chart on the first page and more comprehensive language enumerated in sections on the second page. (Docket No. 1-1). The first page contains the following relevant language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Price Structure: The\n   <strong>\n    Electric\n   </strong>\n   Variable Rate shall be set each month at Agway's discretion and reflect the cost of electricity acquired by Agway from all sources (including energy, capacity, settlement, ancillaries), related transmission and distribution charges, renewable energy compliance charges and other market-related factors, plus all applicable taxes, fees, charges or other assessments and Agway's costs, expenses and margins. The underlying costs are a derivative of the PJM market. The monthly variable price will be communicated to you in your invoice from your Electric Distribution Company (EDC).\n   <strong>\n    There is no limit on how much the variable rate can change from one billing cycle to the next.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Electricity Supply Price: The first month of the Initial Term will be at an Introductory Rate per kWh for electricity; thereafter a monthly variable rate will apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Statement Regarding Savings: Participation in this program is NOT a guarantee of future savings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Incentives: EnergyGuard\u2122 Repair Program\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Cancellation/Early Termination Fees: Either party may terminate this agreement at any time without prior written notice.

Service. This is an agreement between Agway Energy Services, LLC (\"Agway\") and the undersigned customer (\"Customer\") under which Customer will be enrolled as an electric generation supply customer of Agway (the \"Agreement\"). The Agreement includes the Cover Letter and any approved addenda. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Agway agrees to sell and cause to be delivered, and Customer agrees to purchase and accept, Customer's full requirements of electricity for the location(s) listed herein, as estimated by Agway, acquired by Agway from a variety of third party sources. Agway is not affiliated with your Electric Distribution Company (\"EDC\"). Your EDC will continue to deliver the energy supplied by Agway. Generation price refers to the charge for production of electricity. Transmission price refers to the charge for moving high voltage electricity from a generation facility to the distribution lines of an EDC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. Term. This Agreement shall commence as of the first day of the billing cycle which commences immediately after your EDC switches\n   your electric generation supplier to Agway, and shall continue for twenty-four (24) months thereafter (the \"Initial Term\"). Unless otherwise agreed to, upon completion of the Initial Term, this Agreement will renew with a monthly variable rate methodology with no change to the Agreement without the Customer's affirmative consent. Either party may cancel or terminate this Agreement at any time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3. Price. The price for electricity sold during the initial term will be at an introductory rate/kwh. All electricity sold under this Agreement will be at a variable price. The variable price will be calculated by Agway, at Agway's discretion, on a customer specific basis each billing cycle and will include all of the costs incurred in providing service to customer, including the following: electricity acquired by Agway from all sources (including energy, capacity, settlement, ancillaries), transmission and distribution charges, renewable energy compliance charges, other market-related charges, plus all applicable taxes including the gross receipts tax, fees, charges or other assessments and Agway's costs, expenses and margins. The underlying costs are a derivative of the PJM market (PJM Interconnection, LLC is a regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of 13 states, including Pennsylvania). This price will be calculated for each meter each month, depending upon factors such as changes in wholesale energy prices, or other variables listed above, and so the price for each meter, even for the same customer, are likely to be different each month. All charges will be included in our monthly, per kwh charge. There is no limit on how much the variable rate can change from one billing cycle to the next. Historical prices are not indicative of present or future prices. To obtain historical average billed prices, please contact us at 1-888-982-4929 or www.agwayenergy.com.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   a. Generation prices are set by the electric generation supplier you have chosen, in this case, Agway. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission regulates distribution prices and services. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates transmission prices and services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   4. Agency (electric): Customer hereby designates Agway as agent to: (a) arrange and administer contracts and service agreements between Customer and Agway and those entities, including PJM, engaged in the generation, transmission and delivery of Customer electricity supplies; and (b) nominate and schedule with the appropriate entities including your EDC for the delivery of electricity to the EDC which is the interface between PJM and the and the Customer's end-use premises. Agway as agent for the Customer will schedule the delivery of adequate supplies of electricity that meet the Customer's requirements as established by your EDC and in response to information provided by your EDC. These services are provided on an arm's length basis and market-based compensation is included in the price noted above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   9. Incentives. Customer is eligible for, and will receive service under the Agway EnergyGuard\u2122 program when Customer begins receiving their electricity supply from Agway\n   and according to the EnergyGuard terms and conditions, which are separate from this Agreement. Customer should refer to the EnergyGuard brochure for the terms and conditions and details on this incentive. Agway will notify the Customer if the terms and conditions of the EnergyGuard program are updated or otherwise changed at least thirty (30) days in advance of any such change. Customer may terminate this Agreement without penalty if the proposed changes to the EnergyGuard program are unacceptable. If Customer terminates this commodity Agreement with Agway, Customer will no longer receive the benefits of the Agway EnergyGuard program. It may take thirty (30) to sixty (60) days to enroll Customer in the EnergyGuard\u2122 program after Customer switches to Agway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   10. Dispute Resolution. In the event of a disagreement involving Agway's service hereunder, the parties will use their best efforts to resolve the dispute. If Customer is not satisfied following discussion with Agway, Customer may contact the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. A dispute or complaint relating to a residential customer may be submitted by Customer at any time to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's Bureau of Consumer Services by calling 1-800-692-7380.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   13. Choice of Laws. Venue for any lawsuit brought to enforce any term or condition of this Agreement or to construe the terms hereof shall lie exclusively in the State of Pennsylvania. This Agreement shall be construed under and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania without regard to application of its conflicts of laws principles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   14. No Warranties. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Agway provides, and Customer receives, no warranties, express or implied, statutory, or otherwise and Agway specifically disclaims all other warranties, express or implied, including, without limitation, warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   19. For inquiries and information regarding Electric Generation Suppliers and the Competitive Retail Energy Market, contact the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's toll-free number at 1-800-692-7380 or visit their web site at www.PaPowerSwitch.com.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement is binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and legal assigns. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior negotiations, proposals, understandings, representations and oral or written agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof. Subject to Agway's rights, as set forth in this Agreement, to unilaterally change prices for each Renewal Term and to unilaterally modify this Agreement to reflect a Regulatory Change, this Agreement may only be amended by a writing executed by both parties, and provisions herein may only be waived by Agway in writing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Docket No. 1-1, at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he \"was initially placed on a plan with introductory teaser rates for electricity for the first two\n   months of service.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 10, at \u00b6 35). After those two months, Agway charged a variable month-to-month rate that was between 20% and 46% higher than his local utility's rates during those same months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 39). Plaintiff cancelled his service with Agway in January 2017, and he returned to his local utility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff brings this suit individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated alleging that Agway uses improper pricing practices with respect to its variable rates, resulting in its consumers paying considerably more for their electricity than they otherwise should pay under the Customer Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1). According to Plaintiff, Agway lures customers into switching energy suppliers by offering initial teaser rates and then promising a variable rate based on market-related factors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). In reality, Plaintiff alleges that Agway's later variable rates are not based on market-related factors but are instead inflated, price-gouged rates that do not conform with Agway's own \"price structure\" provisions of its Customer Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff initiated this action by filing his Complaint on March 13, 2018. (Docket No. 1). Defendant responded by filing its Motion to Dismiss and Brief in Support on April 30, 2018. (Docket Nos. 21, 22). Plaintiff countered with his Response and Brief in Opposition on May 25, 2018. (Docket Nos. 32, 33, 34). Defendant submitted its Reply on June 8, 2018. (Docket No. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thereafter, the Court was advised that the parties disputed whether discovery should commence or not while the motion to dismiss remained pending and the Court set a briefing schedule to resolve this matter. (Docket No. 36). Pursuant to the Court's Order, Defendant filed its Motion to Stay on July 17, 2018; Plaintiff submitted his Response on July 27, 2018; and Defendant sought leave to file a reply brief on July 31, 2018. (Docket Nos. 37-40). After considering the parties' arguments, the Court entered an Order on July 31, 2018 staying discovery pending disposition of this motion. (Docket No. 41). Plaintiff then filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority on September 6, 2018, providing the Court with a decision by the Hon. Mark R. Hornak in another case involving the same subject matter as the instant dispute. (Docket No. 42). Defendant filed a response to Plaintiff's Notice on September 13, 2018. (Docket No. 43). The parties have not requested oral argument and the Court does not believe it is necessary to resolve this straightforward dispute. As the matter is fully briefed, it is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   IV. LEGAL STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   When reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court must \"accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Eid v.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Agway argues that the breach of contract claim-the sole remaining claim in the case- should be dismissed because Plaintiff fails to allege any cognizable breach of Agway's duties under the Customer Contract.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). Finally, Agway contends that even if Plaintiff states a plausible claim for breach of contract and satisfied the UCC's notice requirements, the claim is nonetheless barred by the voluntary payment doctrine.

Failure to Allege Breach of Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Agway argues that Plaintiff's allegation that he paid too much for his electricity is insufficient to allege a breach of the Customer Contract because it clearly states that Agway has sole discretion to set electricity rates based on numerous factors, which include factors beyond the \"market rate.\" (Docket No. 22, at 18). Agway further claims that its variable rates cannot be compared to the local utility's rates because Agway offers \"energy-related, value added services\" that the local utility does not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). Agway also points to\n   <em>\n    Orange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410283\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/711/681/\">\n    711 F. App'x 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as controlling authority on the issue of higher utility rates by EGSs and breach of contract claims by consumers. (Docket No. 22, at 19). Plaintiff responds that he adequately pleads a breach of the Customer Contract because the Complaint plausibly shows that Agway failed to charge rates for electricity that were based on market-related\n   factors, which is what the Customer Contract represents. (Docket No. 33, at 12). To support his argument, Plaintiff points to the local utility's rates as an accurate reflection of market-based rates and points out that Agway failed to list EnergyGuard (the \"energy-related, value added service\") in the Customer Contract's price structure section as one of the factors it considers in setting its rates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15). Plaintiff seeks to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Orange\n   </em>\n   and directs the Court to a plethora of district court cases, including\n   <em>\n    Basile v.

Sept. 6, 2016). (Docket No. 33, at 13). In reply, Agway insists that its set rates do not constitute a breach but rather conform to its stated price structure, which takes into account factors beyond \"market-related\" factors. (Docket No. 35, at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that the parties do not dispute that Pennsylvania law applies to Plaintiff's breach of contract claim and that no choice-of-law analysis is necessary regarding same.

(Docket No. 22-1, at 4). In doing so, the Court will not convert Agway's motion to a motion for summary judgment.

Plaintiff relies solely on the Customer Contract's language that the variable rate structure revolves around \"market-related factors,\" and thus, Plaintiff concludes, the ultimate rate must be competitive with the local utility's rates. (Docket No. 33, at 12). Because Agway charged variable rates between 20% and 46% higher than the local utility's rate, Plaintiff alleges that Agway is in breach of the Customer Contract's variable rate terms.

By including the \"costs, expenses and margins\" factors into its rate structure, Agway has promised a rate structure that allows it to pass on\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   costs and expenses to consumers. That Agway did not specifically cite to EnergyGuard or an \"incentive program\" in the specific rate\n   sections of the Customer Contract is of no consequence.

In the Court's estimation, the two pled charts, taken together, undermine Plaintiff's argument that the local utility's rates offer an appropriate benchmark of what the market rate should have been. For the May 17, 2016, billing period, Plaintiff alleges that Agway charged 20% more than West Penn Power charged, yet Agway's rate was somehow 40% higher than what Plaintiff claims \"Agway should have charged for electricity based on the factors enumerated in its contract.\" (Docket No. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 48). This implies that Agway was contractually bound to charge rates 20% less than the local utility for that billing period, a result that completely undercuts Plaintiff's argument that Agway's rate must reflect market- related factors and the local utility's rate is an accurate reflection of market-related factors.
