BREYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This order addresses whether the allegations in a Volkswagen bondholder's second amended complaint (1) satisfy the reliance element of its Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) claims against Volkswagen and related defendants, (2) give rise to a strong inference of scienter as to defendant Michael Horn and Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., and (3) are sufficient to support Section 20(a) control person claims against Horn. The order also addresses whether the bondholder should be given leave to amend its complaint for a third time to add insider trading claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On three occasions in 2014 and 2015, Volkswagen Group of America Finance LLC (\"VWGoAF\") issued U.S.-dollar denominated bonds to institutional investors. (SAC \u00b6 3.) VWGoAF issued the bonds in private placements, which were led primarily by U.S.-based investment banks. (SAC \u00b6 15.) The bonds were exempt from registration with the SEC under Rule 144A and so could be purchased only by qualified institutional buyers. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.) After the initial offerings, the bonds traded in a secondary market. (SAC \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Each of the initial offerings was made pursuant to an Offering Memorandum. Lead Plaintiff, a public pension fund, purchased bonds on May 23, 2014 pursuant to the terms of a May 15, 2014 Offering Memorandum. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 16.) Within the Memorandum were certain statements\n   about Volkswagen's R &amp; D priorities and exposure to regulatory risks. An example of an R &amp; D statement is that \"Volkswagen's top priority for research and development in [recent years has been] to develop engines and drivetrain concepts to reduce emissions.\" (SAC \u00b6 227(a).) An example of a regulatory-risk statement is that \"Volkswagen's vehicles must comply with increasingly stringent requirements concerning emissions.\" (SAC \u00b6 227(d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the R &amp; D and regulatory-risk statements were materially misleading, in violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b), because Defendants failed to disclose that Volkswagen was using a defeat device in many of the diesel vehicles it was selling in the United States and around the globe, which enabled Volkswagen to deceptively pass emission tests and to sell vehicles that emitted certain pollutants at levels up to 40 times the legal limits. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 170, 228.) In\n   <em>\n    Bondholders I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court concluded that the R &amp; D and regulatory-risk statements were plausibly misleading:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The statements that Volkswagen's \"top priority\" and \"focal point\" for R &amp; D was to develop engines that reduced emissions could have led a reasonable investor to conclude that Volkswagen was committed to emissions-reducing technology. A reasonable investor also could have concluded ... that Volkswagen's commitment to emissions-reducing technology was important for the Company's future success given the \"increasingly stringent [regulatory] requirements concerning emissions\" .... Together, the inference that arises from these statements is that Volkswagen was a good investment\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   of its commitment to emissions-reducing technology. That inference was misleading because Volkswagen was in its fifth year of a massive fraud to cheat emissions standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Bondholders I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203058563\">\n    2017 WL 3058563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (alteration in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Bondholders I\n   </em>\n   also concluded that Martin Winterkorn (the former CEO of Volkswagen AG (\"VWAG\") ) and Michael Horn (the former CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.

In\n   <em>\n    Bondholders II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court ruled on motions to dismiss the amended complaint. In its order, the Court reconsidered the element of reliance in light of new authority cited by Defendants and held that Plaintiff could not rely on\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Ute\n   </em>\n   to plead reliance.\n   <em>\n    Bondholders II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201142884\">\n    2018 WL 1142884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-6. The Court also considered two other theories of reliance-direct reliance and fraud on the market-but concluded that neither was well pled.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201142884\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *6 -10. Having determined that the reliance element was not satisfied, the Court dismissed the first amended complaint in its entirety with leave to amend. Plaintiff responded by filing the second amended complaint, and Defendants responded by filing separate\n   motions to dismiss the second amended complaint, one by Horn and the other by the remaining Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff contends that reliance is now well pled under a direct-reliance theory, and that a presumption of reliance is also available under four different theories. The Court begins with the direct-reliance theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Direct Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the first amended complaint, Plaintiff asserted that it relied directly on the misleading statements at issue in the May 15, 2014 Offering Memorandum. Plaintiff made this argument even though it did not allege that any of its agents actually read the Memorandum. Instead, Plaintiff asserted that the Memorandum's text supported direct reliance because it effectively stated that investors had relied on the information contained in the Memorandum in making their investment decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because Plaintiff's argument depended on the language of the Memorandum and no party questioned the Memorandum's authenticity, the Court considered the actual language at issue under the incorporation by reference doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VW Bondholders II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201142884\">\n    2018 WL 1142884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Knievel v. ESPN\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9174169\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/1068/#p1076\">\n    393 F.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) ). Upon reviewing two acknowledgment clauses in the Memorandum and their surrounding content, the Court concluded that the clauses did not plausibly support that investors had in fact read the Memorandum, but only that \"investors, by accepting the Memorandum, agreed not to rely on extrinsic materials in making their investment decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. Because the clauses did not carry the meaning asserted by Plaintiff, the Court held that Plaintiff had not plausibly pled direct reliance. The Court gave Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to include the missing allegations, instructing that \"[t]o plausibly plead direct reliance, Plaintiff must also allege that one or more of its agents actually read the Memorandum and relied on the statements therein that are at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Seeking to cure the previously noted deficiency, Plaintiff has added new allegations to the second amended complaint. Plaintiff now alleges that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Pursuant to its relevant contractual investment agreement with its investment advisor, its investment guidelines as incorporated into that relevant contractual investment agreement, and fiduciary obligations owed to it by its investment advisor, Plaintiff, through its authorized investment advisor with complete investment discretion, reviewed and relied upon the information contained in the Offering Memorandum that corresponds to Plaintiff's Bond purchases, including the alleged omissions and misrepresentations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (SAC \u00b6 348.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The new allegations support (1) that Plaintiff's investment advisor was acting as an authorized agent of Plaintiff; and (2) that Plaintiff, through its agent, \"reviewed and relied upon\" the Offering Memorandum, \"including the alleged omissions and misrepresentations.\" (SAC \u00b6 348.) Taking these allegations as true, they plausibly support direct reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In arguing that Plaintiff's new allegations are insufficient to plead direct reliance, Defendants argue that more detail is needed to satisfy Rule 9(b). But paragraph 348 of the second amended complaint answers the basic \"who, what, when, where, and how\" questions needed to satisfy Rule 9(b).\n   <em>\n    Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp.

Given that the advisor is alleged to have \"relied\" on the information in the Memorandum (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), it is reasonable to conclude that the advisor read the statements before executing the bond purchase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Where\n   </strong>\n   did Plaintiff's investment advisor read these statements? The allegations do not answer this question, but this question is of limited importance here. Defendants do not need to know whether the investment advisor read the statements in an office, on a plane, or somewhere else in order to adequately answer the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344027\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/1097/#p1106\">\n    317 F.3d at 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that Rule 9(b) only demands that allegations of fraud be \"specific enough to give defendants notice of the particular misconduct so that they can defend against the charge\") (citation omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 And\n   <strong>\n    how\n   </strong>\n   did the investment advisor rely on these statements? By considering them before executing the bond purchase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   These answers are \"specific enough to give defendants notice\" so that they can \"defend against the charge.\"\n   <em>\n    Vess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344027\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/1097/#p1106\">\n    317 F.3d at 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The allegations therefore satisfy Rule 9(b). Taking these allegations as true, they also plausibly support that Plaintiff, through its agent, directly relied on the misrepresentations at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Presumptions of Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that it relied directly on the statements at issue in the Offering Memorandum, Plaintiff also argues that it can invoke a presumption of reliance under several different theories. Having concluded that reliance is now well pled under a direct-reliance theory, the Court does not need to address whether a presumption of reliance is also appropriate. Nevertheless, because the parties have submitted extensive briefing on the question of whether a presumption of reliance applies, because the Court considered in\n   <em>\n    Bondholders I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   whether a presumption would be available, and because the parties acknowledge that Plaintiff may have difficulty proving direct reliance on a class-wide basis, the Court again considers whether a presumption of reliance is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Market Based Presumptions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff contends that a presumption of reliance is appropriate under\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   's fraud-on-the-market theory, as well as under two related theories, one termed \"fraud created the market\" and the other known as \"fraud on the regulatory process.\" For the reasons discussed in the next three subsections, a presumption of reliance is not appropriate here under any of these theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Fraud on the Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   's fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance applies in securities-fraud cases when (1) the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known, (2) they were material, (3) the securities traded in an efficient market, and (4) the plaintiff traded the securities between the time the misrepresentations were made and when the truth was revealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halliburton Co. v.

This was because Plaintiff purchased VWGoAF bonds in an initial offering, not in a post-offering market, and did not allege that the initial-offering market was efficient. The Court gave Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint \"to add any allegations that it believes support\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   's application.\"\n   <em>\n    Bondholders II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201142884\">\n    2018 WL 1142884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the second amended complaint, Plaintiff has added allegations about how the VWGoAF bonds were originally priced. For example, Plaintiff alleges that the bonds' original price was dependent upon a number of factors, including the risk profile of Volkswagen, the credit rating of Volkswagen and the bonds, and the comparative yield of the bonds versus other investment-grade bonds. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 356-58.) Plaintiff also alleges that these factors \"reflect[ed] all publicly available information that [was] material to investors.\" (SAC \u00b6 357.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even taking these allegations as true, they are insufficient to support the efficient-market element. The fraud-on-the-market presumption \"is available\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when a plaintiff alleges that a defendant made material misrepresentations or omissions concerning a security that is\n   <em>\n    actively traded\n   </em>\n   in an 'efficient market,' thereby establishing a 'fraud on the market.' \"\n   <em>\n    Binder v.

Plaintiff does not allege that it purchased an \"actively traded\" bond, much less one that traded on \"well-developed markets.\" To the contrary, Plaintiff alleges that it purchased the VWGoAF bonds at issue directly from two investment banks in a Rule 144A private placement, not by trading in any market. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 15-16.) And the May 15, 2014 Offering Memorandum confirms that the bonds were \"new issues of securities\n   <em>\n    for which there currently is no market.\n   </em>\n   \" (Giuffra Decl., Ex.

Because there were misstatements in that case-namely, inaccurate line items in financial reports-\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Ute\n   </em>\n   's purpose of avoiding the need to prove a speculative negative was arguably not implicated there. And yet rather than concluding that the presumption was not available, as this Court did in\n   <em>\n    Bondholders II\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Blackie\n   </em>\n   that the plaintiffs could rely on the presumption to plead reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Also giving the Court pause is Plaintiff's argument that the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Bondholders II\n   </em>\n   would foreclose the use of\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Ute\n   </em>\n   in all Rule 10b-5(b) cases. On the one hand, such a result would not be ungrounded. The Fifth Circuit has held that\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Ute\n   </em>\n   's presumption is only available for claims under subsections (a) and (c) of Rule 10b-5, and not for claims under subsection (b), because claims under Rule 10b-5(b) are inherently tied up with affirmative statements and therefore do not require proof of a speculative negative. In the Fifth Circuit's own words:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   By the terms of [Rule 10b-5], a presumption of reliance would not arise where the plaintiff's case is grounded in the second subsection. Subsection [ (b) ] requires disclosure only when necessary to make a statement made not misleading. For this reason, a subsection [ (b) ] claim always rests upon an affirmative statement of some sort, reliance on\n   which is an essential element plaintiff must prove.... By contrast, under the first and third subsections the duty not to engage in a fraudulent 'scheme' or 'course of conduct' could be based primarily on an omission. Hence, the presumption could be warranted only under subsections one and three, but not under subsection two.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

There was therefore concern in\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Ute\n   </em>\n   that if the plaintiffs needed to affirmatively prove reliance they would essentially be required to prove a speculative negative-that they would have relied on information about the secondary market for tribal stock had the bank disclosed it. The same concern is not present in cases under Rule 10b-5(b), as claims under that subsection must be based on one or more false or misleading statements. As a result, plaintiffs bringing such claims are not necessarily required to prove a speculative negative in order to prove reliance; they can prove that they relied on the actual statements made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On the other hand, the Ninth Circuit has not expressly held that\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Ute\n   </em>\n   applies only in claims under Rule 10b-5 subsections (a) and (c). And indeed, the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Binder\n   </em>\n   , which was a Rule 10b-5(b) case, suggests that\n   <em>\n    Affiliate Ute\n   </em>\n   's presumption may be available in Rule 10b-5(b) cases if they \"can be characterized as [cases] that primarily allege[ ] omissions.\"\n   <em>\n    Binder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11548122,11548194,11548149\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/1059/\">\n    184 F.3d at 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that, through its investment advisor, it relied directly on the misleading statements in the Offering Memorandum. Those allegations are sufficient to support the reliance element at the pleading stage, while the question of whether Plaintiff can use\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Ute\n   </em>\n   to prove reliance on a class-wide basis is a question that needs to be resolved in considering class certification. Taking this procedural posture into account, the Court will not finally resolve at this time whether Plaintiff may invoke\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Ute\n   </em>\n   's presumption of reliance to prove its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Reliance Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The element of reliance is now well pled under a direct-reliance theory, and so Plaintiff's case may proceed past the pleading stage. It is also clear that a presumption of reliance is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   available under fraud-on-the-market, fraud-created-the-market, or fraud-on-the-regulatory-process theories. Whether a presumption of reliance is available under\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Ute\n   </em>\n   is a thornier issue. But because it is an issue that does not need to be finally resolved until the class certification stage, the Court will not finally resolve it at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bondholders I\n   </em>\n   , the Court concluded that it was plausible that Winterkorn and Horn made the misleading R &amp; D and regulatory-risk statements in the May 15, 2014 Offering Memorandum, and that Winterkorn and VWAG (but not Horn and VWGoA) made these statements intentionally or recklessly, i.e., with scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zucco Partners, LLC v.

Plaintiff has added allegations to the second amended complaint in an effort to cure the scienter shortfall for Horn and VWGoA.

The ICCT study referenced was a study conducted at West Virginia University that was commissioned by the International Council on Clean Transportation. It indicated that during road tests Volkswagen's \"clean diesel\" vehicles emitted nitrogen oxides at levels up to 40 times the legal limits. (Compl. \u00b6 151.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Based on the timing of when Horn received the Schmidt email-the same day that the May 14, 2014 Offering Memorandum was issued and only a week before Plaintiff's bond purchase was finalized on May 23, 2014-the Court previously concluded that the email did not support a strong inference that Horn made the statements in the May 15, 2014 Offering Memorandum with scienter, or that his failure to correct the Offering Memorandum by May 23, 2014 was done with scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bondholders I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203058563\">\n    2017 WL 3058563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. In reaching this conclusion, the\n   Court explained that \"[e]ven if Plaintiff did not finalize its bond purchase until May 23, 2014, and Horn accordingly had time to read the Schmidt email before the transaction was complete, managers are permitted a reasonable amount of time to consider, digest, and investigate negative information before they disclose that information to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203058563\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And under the circumstances alleged, the Court reasoned that \"it would have been reasonable for Horn to have obtained the Schmidt email and to have considered and investigated the issue for more than a week before disclosing the information to potential bondholders or the public.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203058563\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    B. New Allegations of Horn's Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Plaintiff now alleges that Horn first learned of the ICCT study on March 31, 2014, not on May 15, 2014. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that on March 31 an Audi engineer warned Horn that soon a study would be published that showed that under real-world driving conditions VW's \"clean diesel\" vehicles \"produced emissions up to nearly 40 times higher than allowed by EPA and CARB.\" (SAC \u00b6 170;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77, 171.) Upon learning of this study, Plaintiff alleges that \"Horn requested reports and analyses of the ICCT report from VWGoA's Environmental and Engineering Office.\" (SAC \u00b6 77.) Horn allegedly asked for these reports in April 2014. (SAC \u00b6 324.) \"Managing engineers at VWAG and VWGoA (including several engineers who participated in the design and implementation of the defeat devices in the early-2000s) then provided documentation and information to numerous senior management officials including both Defendants Horn and Winterkorn.\" (SAC \u00b6 171.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The new allegations adjust the timeline with respect to when Horn first learned that Volkswagen's vehicles were significantly out of compliance with U.S. emission standards. Instead of being notified of the ICCT report on the day that the May 15, 2014 Offering Memorandum was released, and only one week before Plaintiff finalized its purchase of the bonds, on May 23, 2014, Plaintiff now alleges that Horn knew of the ICCT report seven weeks before May 23. Given the amount of time between when Horn is now alleged to have learned about the emissions issue and when Plaintiff's bond purchase was finalized, a strong inference arises that Horn acted with an intent to deceive or with deliberate recklessness when he failed to disclose in the May 15 Offering Memorandum that there was reason to believe that VW's \"clean diesel\" vehicles were significantly out of compliance with U.S. emission standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Horn and Volkswagen, on separate grounds, argue that the new allegations are still not sufficient to support scienter with respect to Horn, but their arguments are not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   First, Horn contends that the seven-week period between when he is alleged to have learned of the ICCT study and when the bond offering was finalized is still within the bounds of what courts have concluded is a reasonable period of time for managers to investigate potentially negative information before public disclosure. In support of this position, he cites to three cases that this Court previously relied on in concluding that \"managers are permitted a reasonable amount of time to consider, digest, and investigate negative information before they disclose that information to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Bondholders I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203058563\">\n    2017 WL 3058563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (citing\n   <em>\n    Slayton v.

Instead, the Court concluded that \"it would have been reasonable for Horn to have obtained the [May 15, 2014] Schmidt email and to have considered and investigated the [emissions] issue for more than a week before disclosing the information to potential bondholders or the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Bondholders I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203058563\">\n    2017 WL 3058563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. Under the facts alleged now, and drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, the Court can no longer conclude that Horn's delay was reasonable as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Also, the time periods in the three cited decisions are distinguishable from the time period here in a material way. In each of those decisions, the relevant time period was between the defendants' discovery of potentially negative information and their disclosure of that information to shareholders following internal investigations. On this scale, the seven-week gap between Horn's March 2014 discovery of the emissions issue and the May 2014 bond offering is incomplete. For Horn did not disclose the emissions fraud seven weeks after he is alleged to have become aware of it; he disclosed the fraud\n   <em>\n    one-and-a-half years\n   </em>\n   later, on October 8, 2015, in testimony before Congress after EPA had determined that VW had \"manufactured and installed defeat devices in certain model year 2009 through 2015 diesel light-duty vehicles.\" (SAC \u00b6 246;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 271.) And during that one-and-a-half-year period, Plaintiff alleges that supervisors at Volkswagen agreed to conceal the defeat device in response to questions from U.S. regulators. (SAC \u00b6 173.) Given that Horn did not disclose the emissions issues until Volkswagen was actually caught, the inference that Horn acted with intent to deceive or with deliberate recklessness when he was silent at the time of the May 2014 offering is \"cogent and at least as compelling\" as the inference that he was still innocently conducting an investigation at that time.\n   <em>\n    Tellabs, Inc. v.

As alleged, Horn learned in March 2014 that certain Volkswagen vehicles did not comply with U.S. emission standards. (SAC \u00b6 77.) But Plaintiff does not allege that Horn received any report suggesting the existence of an illegal defeat device in the vehicles prior to the May 15, 2014 Schmidt email. (SAC \u00b6 302.) \"There is a world of difference,\" VW argues, \"between learning of an anomalous test result on March 31, 2014, to learning of the defeat device on May 15, 2014.\" (Dkt. No. 4422 at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendants' failure to disclose Volkswagen's use of the defeat device is indeed the primary omission upon which Plaintiff relies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bondholders I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203058563\">\n    2017 WL 3058563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"Plaintiff contends that the 'heart of this action' is Defendants' failure to disclose their massive defeat-device scheme.\"). But Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants omitted other information in\n   the Offering Memorandum, including that a significant number of Volkswagen's vehicles were out-of-compliance with U.S emission standards. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6 228(c) (alleging that the R &amp; D statements in the Offering Memorandum were misleading, not only because Defendants failed to disclose the illegal defeat device, but also because the statements \"implied that Volkswagen had already reduced vehicle emissions when in truth Volkswagen's diesel engines emitted more pollutants than Defendants represented.\").) As alleged in the second amended complaint, Horn knew by March 31, 2014 that Volkswagen's vehicles were significantly out of compliance with U.S. emission standards. Given what he knew and when he knew it, a strong inference arises that he acted with intent to deceive or with deliberate recklessness when he failed to disclose this information to bond investors who participated in the May 2014 offering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The second amended complaint cures the deficiency with respect to pleading a strong inference of scienter as to Horn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    C. VWGoA's Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Because Horn was the CEO of VWGoA during the relevant period, the allegations supporting Horn's scienter are also sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter as to VWGoA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re ChinaCast Educ.

To prove a prima facie case under Section 20(a), Plaintiff must prove: (1) a primary violation of federal securities laws, and (2) that Horn \"exercised actual power or control over the primary violator.\"\n   <em>\n    Howard v.

In\n   <em>\n    Bondholders I\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that a primary violation of the federal securities laws was sufficiently alleged as to VWGoAF, but the Court deferred considering the Horn control-person claims at that time. Now that scienter is also well pled as to VWGoA, the \"primary violation\" requirement is satisfied as to both VWGoA and VWGoAF.

Indeed, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Chiarella\n   </em>\n   discussed\n   <em>\n    Cady, Roberts\n   </em>\n   and explained that the Commission there \"recognized a relationship of trust and confidence between the\n   <em>\n    shareholders\n   </em>\n   of a corporation and those insiders who have obtained confidential information by reason of their position with that corporation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    445 U.S. at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The sale of stock is simply not at issue here. Nor has Plaintiff cited to authority supporting that a corporation's bondholders can sidestep the fact that they do not have a fiduciary or similar relation of trust with the corporation-as needed to prevail on a traditional insider trading claim-by relying on the duties owed by the corporation to current and future shareholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \"When an allegation of fraud is based upon nondisclosure, there can be no fraud absent a duty to speak.\"\n   <em>\n    Chiarella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    445 U.S. 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    63 L.Ed.2d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants owed no such duty to Plaintiff because at the time they sold Plaintiff VWGoAF bonds Plaintiff was a\n   prospective bondholder, not a current or future shareholder. Because of this shortcoming, Plaintiff's proposed Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 insider trading claims would be immediately subject to dismissal were the Court to permit Plaintiff to amend its complaint. There is also no reason to believe that the deficiencies in the pleading, which are based on Plaintiff's status as a bondholder, a status that is central to the other claims alleged (which are based on statements made to Plaintiff in a bond offering memorandum), can be cured with additional allegations. The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiff's proposed Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 subsection (a) and (c) insider trading claims are futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
