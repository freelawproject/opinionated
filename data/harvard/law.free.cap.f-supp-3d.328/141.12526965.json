U.S. Bank moves to stay this action under the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   doctrine based on two sets of pending state court actions. In the alternative, it seeks to dismiss Ambac's Streit Act claims, breach of fiduciary duty claims, and any breach of contract claims that accrued prior to April 11, 2011. For the reasons that follow, U.S. Bank's motion to stay is denied,\n   and its motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Roughly a decade after the collapse of the U.S. housing market plunged the nation into economic crisis, litigation arising in its fallout continues to pit various permutations of parties involved with the mortgage loan securitization process against each other-whether they be investors, trustees, underwriters, originators, or other entities. The most recent iteration seeks to hold RMBS trustees responsible for defaulting on their contractual, statutory, and common-law obligations to take action against mortgage originators and sponsors for breaches of the governing trust documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The mortgage loan securitization process has been described in myriad New York state and federal cases.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ACE Secs. Corp. v. DB Structured Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    25 N.Y.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    15 N.Y.S.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    36 N.E.3d 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625 (2015). In broad strokes, the process begins when a lender (the \"Originator\") originates mortgage loans and sells its interest in those loans to another financial institution (the \"Sponsor\"), which pools the loans and transfers the loan pools to a special purpose vehicle (the \"Depositor\"). The Depositor then conveys the loan pools to a trust, which subsequently issues certificates (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , RMBS) backed by cashflows from payments made by borrowers of the underlying mortgage loans. Because investors who purchase the certificates essentially purchase entitlements to these payments, their rate of return ultimately turns on the creditworthiness of the loans and the borrowers' ability to repay them. The certificates are also divided into tranches, or classes, that correspond to different payment priorities. To protect investors against the risk of insufficient payments by borrowers, insurers like Ambac issued policies guaranteeing payments on those certificates in exchange for a premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While the passage of time has increasingly exposed the arcana of RMBS to the public eye, this Court nonetheless reviews the pertinent allegations of the Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\"), which are presumed true for purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Creation and Operation of the RMBS Trusts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   U.S. Bank is the trustee of the five RMBS trusts at issue in this action: Harborview Mortgage Loan Trust (\"Harborview\") 2005-2, Harborview 2005-8, Harborview 2005-12, Harborview 2005-13, and Harborview 2005-16 (the \"Trusts\"). (Compl., ECF No. 62, \u00b6 1.) The Trusts are backed by loans originated and sold by Countrywide Home Loans Inc. (\"Countrywide\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 24.) As part of the securitization process, Countrywide sold its interest in the loans for all five Trusts to the sponsor of the securitizations, Greenwich Capital Financial Products, Inc. (\"Greenwich\"), pursuant to a Master Mortgage Loan Purchase and Servicing Agreement (\"MMLPSA\"). (Compl. \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the MMLPSA, Countrywide assumed obligations to Greenwich and made a number of representations and warranties relating to the quality and characteristics of the loans, including that the loans were underwritten in accord with guidelines relating to the borrower's ability to repay and the quality of the loan collateral, that the loans were originated without fraud, that the loans were described accurately in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, and that complete loan files were delivered to the designated custodian. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-31.) If Countrywide breached its representations and warranties, the MMLPSA generally required Countrywide to cure or repurchase the breaching loan. (Compl. \u00b6 29.) Finally, under the MMLPSA, Countrywide also retained the right to service the loans, although it subsequently assigned that\n   right to Countrywide Home Loans Servicing (\"Countrywide Servicing\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To complete the mortgage loan securitization process, Greenwich pooled the loans and transferred the loan pools to the depositor pursuant to a Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (\"MLPA\"), which then conveyed the loans to the Trusts pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement (\"PSA\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) Under these agreements, Greenwich assigned its rights against Countrywide and Countrywide Servicing to U.S. Bank, which obliged U.S. Bank as trustee to enforce the Countrywide entities' obligations and Countrywide's representations and warranties for the benefit of the Trusts and their beneficiaries. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 34-35.) In Reconstituted Servicing Agreements (\"RSAs\"), Countrywide and Countrywide Servicing acknowledged these assignments of rights to U.S. Bank, and Countrywide also restated the representations and warranties it made in the MMLPSA. (Compl. \u00b6 36.) Each transaction closed between April and November of 2005. (Compl. \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    The Instant Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ambac is a monoline insurer that issued financial guaranty insurance policies guaranteeing principal and interest payments to certain classes of certificates in exchange for a premium. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 38.) Ambac is an express trust beneficiary under the PSAs, which also vest Ambac with the right to exercise the rights of insured certificateholders. (Compl. \u00b6 39.) In relevant part, Ambac contends that U.S. Bank, as trustee of the five Trusts, violated an array of contractual, statutory, and common-law obligations owed to Ambac as trust beneficiary, both before and after Events of Default (\"EOD\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank's Obligations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prior to an Event of Default, U.S. Bank had an obligation under the PSAs to acquire and protect trust assets for the benefit of all certificateholders. (Compl. \u00b6 42.) Thus, U.S. Bank was required to certify that it received complete mortgage loan files to ensure that the Trust legally owned the loan and U.S. Bank had standing to institute a foreclosure action if the borrower defaulted. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 34, 43, 56-57.) The PSAs also imposed a duty on U.S. Bank to enforce Countrywide's obligation to cure or repurchase loans that breached its contractual representations and warranties, Greenwich's obligation to deliver complete loan files to the Trusts, and Countrywide Servicing's obligation to service the loans properly. (Compl. \u00b6 44.) Finally, Ambac alleges that U.S. Bank owed a pre-EOD duty to Trust beneficiaries to fulfill its contractual obligations with due care. (Compl. \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   An Event of Default occurs under the Trusts' PSAs when Countrywide or Countrywide Servicing fail to observe or perform their covenants or agreements under the MMLPSA after receiving written notice of such failure. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54, 63.) After an Event of Default, the PSAs impose a heightened duty on U.S. Bank to \"exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by [the PSAs], and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise\n   or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.\" (Compl. \u00b6 48 (citing language from the PSAs).) Moreover, as Ambac alleges, U.S. Bank incurred heightened post-EOD duties under New York common law to act prudently and to act with undivided loyalty, along with the post-EOD duty under New York's Streit Act to act prudently. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank's Alleged Breaches\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   U.S. Bank's purported dereliction of its duties as RMBS trustee began even before Events of Default occurred. Like other financial institutions who had a hand in different parts of the RMBS securitization process, U.S. Bank originated, underwrote, and serviced mortgage loans in addition to serving as an RMBS trustee. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.) But U.S. Bank had also entered into agreements with federal regulators to settle allegations of its improper origination, underwriting, and servicing practices. According to Ambac, U.S. Bank's misfeasance in its loan origination, underwriting, and servicing practices incentivized inaction as trustee in enforcing the Trusts' rights against Greenwich, Countrywide, and Countrywide Servicing to avoid scrutiny of its own conduct and maintain good relationships with its counterparties. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.) Thus, U.S. Bank reneged on its contractual duties under the PSAs by failing to enforce Countrywide's and Greenwich's obligations to cure or repurchase breaching loans, even though Countrywide and U.S. Bank knew or should have known of deficiencies in the loans. Specifically, Countrywide had been notified of breaches in the loans backing the Harborview 2005-8 Trust, U.S. Bank had known that certain loan files were missing documents and that Greenwich failed to deliver complete mortgage loan files to the Trusts, and U.S. Bank knew or should have known about breaches in loans backing the Harborview 2005-10 trust. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83-88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Additionally, Ambac alleges breaches of its heightened contractual and fiduciary post-EOD obligations premised on U.S. Bank's failure to investigate Countrywide's breaches of representations and warranties, to enforce contractual remedies as to breaching loans, and to timely bring hundreds of millions of dollars of claims against Countrywide, despite knowing or having reason to know that the loans backing the Trusts did not conform to Countrywide's representations and warranties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 74, 81-82.) Specifically, U.S. Bank failed to act despite (1) having actual knowledge since no later than 180 days after the closing date of the transactions of Events of Default based on Countrywide's failure to deliver complete mortgage files as required by the MMLPSA, (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-62); (2) having reason to know of Events of Default based on Countrywide Servicing's rampant servicing misconduct in breach of the MMLPSA, (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-71); (3) having actual knowledge of Countrywide's failure to repurchase certain breaching loans in the Harborview 2005-8 Trust for which U.S. Bank had already provided notice to Countrywide, (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-73); and (4) having reason to know since at least 2011 that the Trusts likely contained breaching loans based on extensive losses experienced by the Trusts as well as lawsuits brought against Countrywide alleging widespread breaches in Countrywide loans originated in the same time period as the loans backing the Trusts. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ultimately, U.S. Bank's abdication of its contractual, statutory, and common-law obligations to protect Trust assets and enforce the Trusts' rights depleted those assets and deprived the Trusts of recoveries, which in turn caused Ambac to pay or accrue over $300 million in claims under the policies it issued to the Trusts. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 91, 110, 115, 122.) If U.S. Bank had fulfilled its duties, then Ambac would have avoided claims under the policies or been\n   reimbursed through recoveries deposited into the Trusts stemming from breaching mortgage loans. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Colorado River Abstention\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The lion's share of the parties' briefing centers on the applicability of the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   abstention doctrine.

Here, neither the Countrywide Actions nor the Blackrock Action shares an overlap of both plaintiffs and defendants with this action-instead, U.S. Bank seeks to draw parties from both sets of actions to cobble together a parallel state proceeding. Accordingly, this Court analyzes whether each set of state actions is a concurrent or parallel proceeding in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Countrywide Actions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Countrywide Actions are fraudulent inducement actions brought by Ambac against an originator, Countrywide,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which\n   at bottom allege that Countrywide misrepresented the quality of its collateral to induce Ambac into insuring the trusts. U.S. Bank contends that the Countrywide Actions are parallel because taken together, they concern the same trusts, the same misconduct by Countrywide with respect to its breaches of representations and warranties, and the same question of whether Countrywide must reimburse Ambac for the insurance payments it made. Ambac counters that there is no commonality of parties because the defendants in the Countrywide Actions do not overlap with the Defendant here, and the Countrywide Actions principally concern Countrywide's misrepresentations to Ambac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This Court concludes that the Countrywide Actions are not parallel proceedings that would warrant\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   abstention. The core of the Countrywide Actions concerns Countrywide's misrepresentations about the loans it originated and its practices regarding origination, underwriting, and quality control. Those misrepresentations, which Countrywide made in meetings, public statements, and prospectus supplements, are alleged to have fraudulently induced Ambac into issuing the policies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Louis A. Chaiten in Support of U.S. Bank's Motion to Stay or Dismiss the Complaint, ECF No. 39 (\"Chaiten Decl.\"), Ex. A (\"Wisconsin Countrywide Action Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 30, 47-73, 171-184; Chaiten Decl. Ex. B (\"2014 Countrywide Action Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 15, 42-82, 210-223.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To be sure, the Countrywide Actions implicate the same representations and warranties by Countrywide that Ambac allegedly considered in deciding whether to insure the Trusts. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Wisconsin Countrywide Action Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 178-179, 187; 2014 Countrywide Action Compl. \u00b6 217-218, 226,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 25.) But the focus of this action is whether U.S. Bank failed to perform its obligations as trustee based on U.S. Bank's actual or constructive knowledge of Countrywide's breaches of those representations and warranties.\n   <em>\n    SeeDittmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11826158\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/113/#p118\">\n    146 F.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (commonality in subject matter or overlap of issues is insufficient standing alone for abstention). Thus, even though \"both actions arise out of a similar set of circumstances,\" this action and the Countrywide Actions are not parallel because \"the nature of the claims\" in question differs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DDR Constr.

Framed differently, it is not substantially likely that the disposition of the Countrywide Actions would resolve the claims in this case. Even if, for example, the Countrywide Actions result in a finding that Countrywide breached its representations and warranties, the factfinder in this action must nevertheless determine whether U.S. Bank fulfilled its obligations to provide notice and enforce contractual remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, there is no identity of defendants between this action and the Countrywide Actions because U.S. Bank is not a party to the Countywide Actions, and Countrywide is not a party to this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smulley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=634%20Fed.%20Appx.%20335\">\n    634 Fed.Appx. at 336-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that because \"the only [remaining] defendant in the federal action ... is not a party to any state action, there are no concurrent, 'parallel' actions in state court\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheerbonnet, Ltd. v.

However, those cases are distinguishable because the parties on the side for which no overlap existed shared virtually identical interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Canaday\n   </em>\n   , homeless mothers with dependents sought injunctive relief requiring the City of New York to provide additional emergency shelter for homeless families.\n   <em>\n    Canaday v.

While the\n   <em>\n    Canaday\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs were \"technically not represented\" in a state court proceeding brought by different homeless mothers with dependents seeking,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the same injunctive relief, the court found that such an injunction \"would benefit Daisy Canaday no less than\" a named plaintiff in the state court proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Canaday\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5718240\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/608/1460/#p1464\">\n    608 F.Supp. at 1475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Congress Talcott\n   </em>\n   , the court found that the individual defendant in the federal proceeding was \"closely related\" to a separate individual defendant and two entity defendants in the state proceeding where both individual defendants were principals of one entity defendant and where the federal defendant was the president, secretary, and sole shareholder of the other entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Congress Talcott Corp. v.

Sept. 4, 1996). Here, by contrast, U.S. Bank fails to demonstrate that its interests are similarly aligned with those of Countrywide-a counterparty whose promises U.S. Bank was charged with enforcing-aside from a general interest in a judicial determination that Countrywide did not breach its representations and warranties. Accordingly, the Countrywide Actions are not concurrent proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Blackrock Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Blackrock Action is brought by a putative class of investors who purchased certificates issued by 770 RMBS trusts-including the five Trusts at issue in this case-for which U.S. Bank serves as trustee. In sum, the investors seek damages arising from U.S. Bank's alleged failure to satisfy its fiduciary duties as well as its pre-EOD and post-EOD duties under the PSAs for the trusts. U.S. Bank contends that the Blackrock Action is a parallel proceeding because it involves the same defendant, same trusts, and same misconduct by Countrywide and U.S. Bank with respect to Countrywide's alleged breaches of representations and warranties. Ambac retorts that it is not a party to the Blackrock Action, that the scope of the Blackrock Action dwarfs that of this action, and that the Blackrock Action does not concern financial guarantors such as Ambac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While a closer call than the Countrywide Actions, this Court likewise concludes that the Blackrock Action is not \"essentially the same\" as this action.\n   <em>\n    Shields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275345\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/891/567/#p577\">\n    891 F.Supp.2d at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . U.S. Bank contends that the issues common to this action and the Blackrock Action-namely, whether U.S. Bank performed its contractual and common-law pre-EOD and post-EOD obligations for the Trusts-are sufficient to satisfy the threshold parallelism requirement.

In particular, the only common party to this action and the Blackrock Action is U.S. Bank, the defendant in both actions. However, no overlap exists on the other side of the ledger-Ambac is not a plaintiff to the Blackrock Action, and none of the investor-plaintiffs in that action is a plaintiff here.

In\n   <em>\n    Caisse Nationale\n   </em>\n   , the court observed that because the plaintiff could have intervened in the state court action, it was \"reluctant to allow plaintiff's forum-shopping tactics to work in its favor in the abstention inquiry, which is equitable in nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Caisse Nationale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20345216\">\n    1997 WL 345216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But\n   <em>\n    Caisse Nationale\n   </em>\n   is inapposite for at least two reasons.

Second, the court concluded that the \"piecemeal litigation\" factor \"point[s] toward abstention only because of the peculiar circumstances of [that] case\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , because plaintiff \"apparently sought to avoid the state forum\" by commencing the federal action.\n   <em>\n    Caisse Nationale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20345216\">\n    1997 WL 345216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. The mere filing of any lawsuit-whether in state or federal court-necessarily\n   reflects a choice of forum.

Specifically, Ambac premises these breaches on U.S. Bank's failure to investigate the extent of Countrywide's breaches of contractual representations and warranties, failure to notify Countrywide of those breaches, and failure to file suit against Countrywide within the limitations period to enforce the trusts' rights under the PSAs. (Compl. \u00b6 114.)

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.)

Moreover, the gravamen of the Complaint is that Ambac suffered harm resulting from U.S. Bank's nonfeasance-not that U.S. Bank engaged in any fraudulent conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   U.S. Bank's argument rests on the following syllogism: (1) any breach of fiduciary duty occurred at the very latest based on U.S. Bank's alleged failure to bring timely put-back actions against Countrywide for breaches of its contractual representations and warranties; (2) because U.S. Bank purportedly knew of Countrywide's alleged breaches at the latest by mid-2006, the latest it could have brought a put-back action based on those breaches was mid-2012; and (3) therefore, any claim for breach of fiduciary duty lapsed three years later, in mid-2015. At the outset, Ambac implicitly concedes that its claims for breach of fiduciary duty are untimely if they are solely premised on U.S. Bank's failure to timely file suit in the face of Countrywide's alleged breaches of its contractual representations and warranties. Indeed, under the bright-line rule established by the New York Court of Appeals, the six-year limitations period for U.S. Bank's put-back claims against Countrywide accrues on the date that Countrywide's allegedly false contractual representations and warranties were made,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the closing dates of the Trusts in 2005.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACE Sec.

At the very latest, then, Ambac's claim for breach of fiduciary duty accrued once the window for U.S. Bank to bring timely put-back actions based on Countrywide's purported breaches of representations and warranties lapsed-namely, sometime in 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Instead, Ambac retorts that its breach of fiduciary duty claims are timely based on U.S. Bank failure to enforce the Trusts' rights against Greenwich, Countrywide, and Countrywide Servicing for their failure to notify U.S. Bank of their breaches, as well as U.S. Bank's failure to notify Ambac of the existence of an Event of Default. As to the first, Ambac correctly notes that the New York intermediate courts have recognized that an RMBS seller's \"failure to provide the trustee with notice of material breaches it discovers in the underlying loans states an independently breached contractual obligation, allowing a plaintiff to pursue separate damages.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.

But aside from a stray reference that U.S. Bank's inaction was driven in part by its interest in shrouding its failure to give notice of the defective loans it originated, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 90), Ambac does not theorize that Countrywide, Countrywide Servicing, or Greenwich shirked their duties to notify U.S. Bank of breaches of their contractual representations and warranties. And this Court declines to read such allegations into the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soules v. Conn., Dep't of Emergency Servs. &amp; Public Prot.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515970\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/52/#p56\">\n    882 F.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56 (2d Cir. 2018) (reiterating the general rule that \"parties may not amend the pleadings through motion papers\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On the other hand, Ambac's breach of fiduciary duty claims may be timely insofar as they are based on U.S. Bank's failure to notify it of the existence of Events of Default. For instance, Ambac alleges that despite pervasive servicing misconduct by Countrywide Servicing, U.S. Bank failed to act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.) In particular, the PSAs require U.S. Bank to provide Ambac and certificateholders with notice within 60 days of any event which constitutes or which, with notice\n   or a passage of time, would constitute an Event of Default-such as Countrywide Servicing's violations of its servicing obligations under the MMLPSA. (Compl. \u00b6 71 (citing PSA \u00a7 7.04(b) ).) But according to the Complaint, \"[a]lerting certificateholders and Ambac to deficiencies in Countrywide Servicing's servicing practices would have required U.S. Bank to take a position potentially contrary to\" legal positions taken with regulators by U.S. Bank's own servicing arm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 89.) Thus, if the time for U.S. Bank to notify Ambac of Events of Default lapsed within three years of the filing of this action-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , after April 2014, then Ambac's breach of fiduciary duty claims may be timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   U.S. Bank's objections are unavailing. First, it argues that such claims must be time-barred because the only Events of Default alleged in the Complaint occurred years before April 2014, and as such, a breach of fiduciary duty claim based on U.S. Bank's failure to notify Ambac of Events of Default must have accrued long before 2014. But while the Complaint alleges that U.S. Bank had reason to know of Countrywide Servicing's breaches of its servicing obligations in 2010 and 2011, these allegations do not foreclose the possibility that Events of Default occurred even after 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 65-70.) Stated differently, the Complaint merely alleges that Countrywide Servicing had failed to comply with its servicing obligations without exhaustively listing every purported violation. Because it is not evident from the face of the Complaint that such a breach of fiduciary duty claim would be untimely, dismissal at this stage of the proceedings is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, U.S. Bank contends that an ongoing duty to notify that extends past the six-year limitations period for put-back actions for breaches of representations and warranties would be pointless because it would \"yield no relief for the aggrieved parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. WMC Mortg.

July 10, 2015).\n   <em>\n    FHFA/WMC\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable, however, because it addresses a sponsor or originator's duty to notify the trustee of its breaches of representations and warranties, which is distinct from a trustee's duty to notify trust beneficiaries of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   Events of Default. Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    FHFA/WMC\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that a sponsor or originator's duty to notify is an obligation dependent on and derivative of its contractual representations and warranties.\n   <em>\n    FHFA/WMC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209450833\">\n    2015 WL 9450833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Based on this premise, that court concluded that the expiration of the \"duty to cure or repurchase, which is the sole remedy available for a breach of the representations and warranties,\" logically extinguished the duty to notify of such breaches.\n   <em>\n    FHFA/WMC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209450833\">\n    2015 WL 9450833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. But this reasoning by the\n   <em>\n    FHFA/WMC\n   </em>\n   court and other courts was subsequently repudiated by the Appellate Division's trilogy of cases addressing failure-to-notify claims. Those cases recognized that \"the contractual obligation to notify was independent of the warranty obligations and that claims for failure to notify were not claims 'respecting a warranty breach' subject to the 'sole remedy' clause\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the breach of a sponsor or originator's duty to notify could give rise to an independent cause of action for damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of N.Y.

Nor does Ambac contend that any breach of contract claim based on U.S. Bank's duties to certify that mortgage documents were properly delivered to the Trusts are timely. Rather, it concedes that its breach of contract claims are not predicated on U.S. Bank's document certification obligations, and that the fact that U.S. Bank actually\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   prepare the certifications simply establishes U.S. Bank's knowledge of Countrywide and Greenwich's breaches of their document delivery obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   To the extent that Ambac's breach of contract claims are based on U.S. Bank's failure to discharge its contractual obligations to respond to Countrywide's breaches of its representations and warranties, this Court cannot conclude that they are untimely as a matter of law. For instance, Ambac alleges that U.S. Bank had notified Countrywide of 466 loans in the Harborview 2005-8 Trust that breached Countrywide's representations and warranties and demanded repurchase no later than the fourth quarter of 2011. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72, 84.) Nonetheless, Countrywide never repurchased any of those loans. Thus, according to Ambac, U.S. Bank breached its contractual obligation by failing to provide additional notice at the end of the 90-day cure period, filing suit, or taking other action to enforce Countrywide's repurchase obligation. (Compl. \u00b6 73, 85.) Accepting these allegations as true, claims based on these contractual breaches would be timely. At this stage in the proceedings, this Court need not \"give the claims in the case a 'haircut' by trimming off [each] time-barred allegation[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Light/Deutsche Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345869\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/700/#p719\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   709 n.3. Because the untimeliness of Ambac's breach of contract claims does not appear from the face of the Complaint, U.S. Bank's motion to dismiss them as untimely is denied to the extent that they are not based on U.S. Bank's duty to certify that mortgage documents were properly delivered to the Trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Streit Act Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Streit Act \"regulates all mortgage investments where the properties are located in the state, the trustee does business with respect to the investments in New York, or the trustee is authorized to do business in New York.\"\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Light/Deutsche Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345869\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/700/#p719\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   722 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Real%20Prop.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20124\">\n    N.Y.

As has become somewhat customary in cases against RMBS trustees, Ambac claims that U.S. Bank violated the Streit Act by defaulting on its statutory obligation to act prudently following an Event of Default-here, by failing to investigate further breaches, notify Countrywide, or take other action following Countrywide's failure to cure or repurchase loans in breach of its representations and warranties.

In\n   <em>\n    Commerzbank\n   </em>\n   , this Court joined the consensus of courts in this District holding that the plain language of \u00a7 126\"requires only that trust instruments include certain provisions\" without imposing any affirmative obligations on trustees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commerzbank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419333\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/483/#p497\">\n    277 F.Supp.3d at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

But like the trustee's pre-EOD obligation to avoid conflicts of interest, such an obligation is not construed as a fiduciary duty. Thus, the result in\n    <em>\n     Commerzbank\n    </em>\n    differs because the tort claims arising out of U.S. Bank's pre-EOD duty to perform ministerial tasks with due care were brought in that action as negligence and gross negligence claims-not breach of fiduciary duty claims.
