The least sophisticated consumer can start by easily eliminating LTD as a possibility since LTD is explicitly identified as a \"debt collector\" and not as a creditor.

First, the least sophisticated consumer should be able to understand (and know the difference between) the words \"current\" and \"original\" because these words \"are plain-English words, not specialized terms that could confuse the ordinary debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    Zuniga v.

As the district court in\n   <em>\n    Zuniga\n   </em>\n   stated, \"[i]t is unlikely that a significant fraction of even the most unsophisticated consumers, possessing 'reasonable intelligence,' would fail to understand the difference between 'original' and 'current,' or fail to understand that the 'current' creditor is the creditor to whom the debt is currently owed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2051063\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This Court agrees with the\n   <em>\n    Zuniga\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning and conclusion and notes\n   that the least sophisticated consumer should know that \"current\" means \"now\" and thus the current creditor is the creditor to whom the debt is owed now (at the moment the Letter was sent), while \"original\" means \"initial\" and thus the original creditor is the creditor to whom the debt was initially but is no longer owed. Second, Congress itself appears to have drafted Section 1692g(a) with the assumption that consumers should know the difference between \"current\" and \"original.\" Section 1692g(a)(5) requires that the collection notice contain \"a statement that, upon the consumer's written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the\n   <em>\n    original creditor\n   </em>\n   , if different\n   from the\n   <em>\n    current creditor.\n   </em>\n   \" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a)(5) (emphases added). If consumers were not expected to understand the terms \"current\" and \"original\" and know the difference between them, then Section 1692g(a)(5)'s requirement would be futile in serving the FDCPA's goal of \"protect[ing] consumers against debt collection abuses,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), since consumers would not understand the very information that Section 1692g(a)(5) requires. Third, as Defendants point out, Section 1692g(a)(5)'s use of the term \"current creditor\" as a synonym for \"creditor to whom the debt is owed\" shows that the two phrases are interchangeable and that the phrase \"current creditor\" should easily be understood as meaning \"the creditor to whom the debt is owed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 14 at 8) (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zuniga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201519162\">\n    2018 WL 1519162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2051063\">\n    2018 U.S. Dist.

The Letter does not contain any \"confusingly named non-creditors.\" The only non-creditor entity mentioned in the Letter is LTD, which is clearly identified as \"a debt collector.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Letter also does not contain any \"opaque technical terms.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2051063\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) And, as discussed above, there is nothing else confusing about the Letter that makes its identification of JH Portfolio as the current creditor (and thus the creditor to whom the debt is owed) unclear. In fact, Plaintiff distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Zuniga\n   </em>\n   only by arguing that the letter in\n   <em>\n    Zuniga\n   </em>\n   \"did not include the confusing statement that the collector had been retained by the above named creditor.\" (Doc. 19 at 13 n.4). Again, however, despite Plaintiff's statement to the contrary, the Letter never states that \"[LTD] had been retained by the above named creditor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, the reference to the \"above named creditor\" merely describes which\n   <em>\n    account\n   </em>\n   was placed with LTD and thus does not create any confusion that detracts from the clarity resulting from JH Portfolio's being labeled as the current creditor and Comenity Bank's being labeled as the original creditor. Thus, the Letter's first sentence is not confusing. Because the Letter's first sentence is not confusing, the Letter is similar to the letter in\n   <em>\n    Zuniga\n   </em>\n   and thus also clearly states the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed as required by Section 1692g(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On the other hand, the Letter can be distinguished from the letters in the cases in which the plaintiff's claim survived a motion to dismiss despite the letters explicitly identifying the \"current creditor.\" The letters in these cases had additional confusing elements, namely the identification of a non-creditor client of the debt collector, that are not found in the Letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pardo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205607646\">\n    2015 WL 5607646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20125526\">\n    2015 U.S. Dist.

In fact, the\n   <em>\n    Pardo\n   </em>\n   court stated that if the letter had only identified the \"Current Creditor,\" without also identifying the client who was \"willing to accept pament,\" the court may have \"indeed conclude[d] that as a matter of law the dunning letter was not confusing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20125526\">\n    2015 U.S. Dist.

Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Pardo\n   </em>\n   , the reason that an explanation of the relationship between the parties was needed was because another entity (the debt collector's client) was identified as an entity that was \"willing to accept payment,\" and this created confusion as to the identity of the creditor to whom the debt was owed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20125526\">\n    2015 U.S. Dist.

The Letter, however, does not identify any additional entity that is \"willing to accept payment.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 1-2 at 1).

Instead, relevant to this analysis, the letters in\n   <em>\n    Janetos\n   </em>\n   stated three facts regarding Asset Acceptance and its relationship with the two other entities mentioned in the letters, AMERISTAR and Fulton, Friedman &amp; Gullace, LLP (\"Fulton\"): (1) that Asset Acceptance was the \"[a]ssignee of AMERISTAR\"; (2) that the \"above referenced account [had] been transferred from Asset Acceptance, LLC to Fulton, Friedman &amp; Gullace, LLP\"; and (3) that \"if the consumer had 'already entered into a payment plan or settlement arrangement with Asset Acceptance, LLC,' Fulton was 'committed to honoring the same,' \" and that \"consumers [should] direct all future contact, including any questions they had, to Fulton's offices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324436\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/317/#p321\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324436\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/317/#p321\">\n    at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Janetos\n   </em>\n   court found that the letters did not clearly state the name of the creditor to whom the debt was owed because \"Asset Acceptance was identified as the 'assignee' of another company, not as the current creditor or owner of the debt,\" and \"each recipient was left to guess who owned the debt following the 'transfer' of the 'account' \" from Asset Acceptance, LLC, to Fulton.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324436\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/317/#p321\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324436\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/317/#p321\">\n    at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Letter, however, unlike the letters in\n   <em>\n    Janetos\n   </em>\n   , clearly identifies JH Portfolio as the \"current creditor,\" not as merely an \" 'assignee' of another company.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 1-2 at 1). Additionally, unlike the letters in\n   <em>\n    Janetos\n   </em>\n   , which stated that the account had been transferred to Fulton but never identified Fulton as a debt collector and thus possibly allowed an inference that Fulton was the creditor to whom the debt was owed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Janetos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324436\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/317/#p321\">\n    825 F.3d at 320-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Letter clearly identifies LTD as \"a debt collector\" and states that the account \"has been placed with ... a debt collector\" and thus does not allow the same inference. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 1-2 at 1). Because\n   of these differences between the letters in\n   <em>\n    Janetos\n   </em>\n   and the Letter, the least sophisticated consumer here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Janetos\n   </em>\n   , is not \"left to guess who owned the debt\" after the account was placed with LTD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is obvious that JH Portfolio, the current creditor, is the creditor who owns the debt and to whom the debt was owed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thus, the Letter is much more similar to the debt collection letters in cases such as\n   <em>\n    Zuniga\n   </em>\n   , in which the letters clearly conveyed the name of the creditor to whom the debt was owed, than the debt collection letters in cases such as\n   <em>\n    Pardo\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Janetos\n   </em>\n   , in which the letters did not clearly convey the name of the creditor to whom the debt was owed. This supports the Court's analysis of the Letter and its finding that the Letter clearly conveys to the least sophisticated consumer the name of the creditor to whom the debt was owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The facts of this case are simple. Plaintiff received a debt collection letter that clearly identified JH Portfolio as the current creditor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 1-2 at 1). The only other entities mentioned in the letter were Comenity Bank, which was clearly identified as the original creditor, and LTD, which was clearly identified as a debt collector. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324436\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/317/#p321\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff then brought suit against Defendants, claiming that the Letter \"violates [Section] 1692g(a)(2) of the FDCPA because it failed to effectively\n   identify the\n   <em>\n    current creditor\n   </em>\n   to whom the debt was owed.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 1 at 4, \u00b6 16) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). As indicated by the Court's analysis and supported by the case law, however, the Letter clearly identifies JH Portfolio as the current creditor (and thus \"the creditor to whom the debt is owed,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a)(2) ) under the least-sophisticated-consumer standard. Of the three entities identified in the Letter, the current creditor is not the debt collector, LTD. The current creditor is also not the original creditor, Comenity Bank. The current creditor is the current creditor, JH Portfolio. While the Court recognizes that explicitly identifying the \"current creditor\" is not always sufficient to comply with Section 1692g(a)(2), nothing in the Letter obscures Defendants' clear identification of JH Portfolio as the current creditor and thus as the creditor to whom the debt was owed. Plaintiff's well-pleaded factual allegations do not \"allow[ ] the [C]ourt to draw the reasonable inference that [Defendants] [are] liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and the case will be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .

This extreme similarity between the unsophisticated consumer and the least sophisticated consumer is not surprising; despite stating that it has rejected the least-sophisticated-consumer standard, the Seventh Circuit, when describing its unsophisticated consumer, cites three cases that use the least-sophisticated-consumer standard, two of which the Eleventh Circuit also cites when describing its least sophisticated consumer.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chaudhry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11620451\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/394/#p408\">\n     174 F.3d at 408-09\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (discussing the \"least sophisticated debtor\" standard);\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Fin.

However, this requirement that a significant fraction of the population be misled is entirely consistent with the least-sophisticated-consumer standard. Judge Easterbrook's reasoning for this requirement was based on the notion that the least sophisticated consumer would believe almost anything.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gammon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533964\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/27/1254/\">\n     27 F.3d at 1259\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Easterbrook, J., concurring) (\"The 'least sophisticated consumers' actually\n    <em>\n     believe\n    </em>\n    that 12 Senators are from other planets.\" (footnote omitted) ). Judge Easterbrook thus reasoned that \"if showing a handful of misled debtors [instead of showing a signification fraction of the population] were enough, [the Seventh Circuit] would as a practical matter be using the 'least sophisticated consumer' doctrine.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1260. However, while it is true that the\n    <em>\n     literal\n    </em>\n    least sophisticated consumer may believe almost anything, the least-sophisticated-consumer standard, as stated above, has a reasonableness component and does not look to the literal least sophisticated consumer.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     LeBlanc\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225498\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/1185/#p1194\">\n     601 F.3d at 1194\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Because the\n    <em>\n     Zuniga\n    </em>\n    court found that the Seventh Circuit's unsophisticated consumer would not be confused by the \"plain-English words\" \"original\" and \"current,\"\n    <em>\n     Zuniga\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201519162\">\n     2018 WL 1519162\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2051063\">\n     2018 U.S. Dist.
