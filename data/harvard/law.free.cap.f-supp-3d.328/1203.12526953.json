The Court here addresses the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case, as it stands following the appellate decision, is brought by the American Humanist Association (\"AHA\") and one of its members whose pseudonym is \"Jane Zoe.\" The AHA is a non-profit organization that promotes the \"separation of church and state and the constitutional rights of humanists, atheists and other freethinkers.\" ECF No. 1 at 5. Ms. Zoe's two children attend Cougar Run Elementary School in Douglas County, Colorado. Plaintiffs claim that defendants promote a culture of promoting the Christian religion in the Douglas County School District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The event that is the focus of the case vis-\u00e0-vis Ms. Zoe was a Guatemala mission trip in 2014. ECF No. 50 at 6-7. The mission trip was created by and for members of a district high school's chapter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (\"FCA\"), a student club in which both students and teachers took part. ECF No. 58 at 13. The FCA planned the trip through an organization called Adventures in Missions (\"AIM\"), which plans Christian mission trips in both the United States and abroad. ECF No. 47 at 1. The stated goals of the mission trip were to \"promote Christianity\" and to \"introduce [children] to the Bible.\" ECF No. 47-23 at 89. Fourteen high school students and two teachers participated in the trip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Specifically as it relates to the Zoe children, in the spring semester of 2014, Cougar Run sixth-grade teacher Micki Benge volunteered to spearhead a supply drive to help fundraise for the mission trip. ECF No. 47 at 5. The supply drive was to last a week and take place during school hours.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276636\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1243/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As part of this effort, Ms. Benge printed flyers regarding the fundraiser which were sent home in students' \"take home folders.\" This flyer stated that the supply drive was \"Sponsored by Cougar Run 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Graders partnering with the FCA (Fellowship of Christian Athletes)\" and noted that \"[t]his effort was born out of a desire for our 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   grade students to make real-world connections with their Latin American social studies curriculum.\" ECF No. 1-59. Ms. Zoe's son received one of these flyers and brought it home. ECF No. 1 at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to the flyer, Ms. Zoe received an email from her son's preschool teacher, Camille Espinosa, encouraging participation in the supply drive. ECF No. 1-60. The email asked for supply donations for the trip and noted that \"monetary donations are also welcome! Please make checks payable to Cougar Run Elementary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276636\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1243/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The email also stated \"we are partnering with HRHS on this effort-specifically the FCA (Fellowship of Christian Athletes) organization\" that \"will be travelling to Guatemala over Spring Break to run camps for Guatemalan orphans.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276636\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1243/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Cougar Run Principal Gutierrez also emailed \"Cougar Run families\" informing them that Cougar Run had \"partnered with [FCA]\" and asked the families to donate money to the supply drive. ECF No. 1-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to an interrogatory, Ms. Zoe stated that her son \"felt coerced into participating and contributing to this religious fundraiser.\" ECF No. 47-8 at 4 (response to Interrogatory 5). As non-Christians, the school's actions in promoting and endorsing a Christian organization ... made us feel like outsiders and unwelcome in our own community.\" ECF No. 47-8.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276636\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1243/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, Ms. Zoe told her son that they would not be supporting the supply drive. In her deposition Ms. Zoe testified that her son was questioned and maltreated by his classmates for his beliefs underlying the reason he did not participate in the drive. ECF No. 58-2 at 10 (depo. p. 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In their Complaint plaintiffs asserted violations of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal Access Act. They sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, nominal damages, attorney's fees and costs under the Establishment Clause and the Equal Access Act. ECF No. 1 at 44-45. However, the Tenth Circuit determined that Ms. Zoe has standing to pursue her claims only in part. She has standing to pursue a claim for violation of the Establishment Clause and to seek retrospective declaratory relief, nominal damages, and presumably, attorney's fees and costs. She does not have standing as to her claim under the Equal Access Act, and she does not have standing to seek prospective relief.\n   <em>\n    American Humanist Association\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276636\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1243/\">\n    859 F.3d at 1253-55, 60-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on the remaining claims. ECF No. 47. Defendants ask the Court to enter summary judgment dismissing the remaining claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50 at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court may grant summary judgment if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the burden to show that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Ms. Zoe's Establishment Clause Claim - Scope and Merits\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Tenth Circuit left it to this Court to determine the scope and merits of Ms. Zoe's Establishment Clause claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276636\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1243/\">\n    859 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1254 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Scope of Ms. Zoe's Claim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ms. Zoe asserts that the District engaged in a pattern or practice of promoting Christianity in violation of the Establishment Clause. ECF No. 1 at 40. I bear in mind the limits of what is before this Court at this time. The Tenth Circuit determined that Ms. Zoe does not have standing to seek prospective relief. Also, Ms. Zoe does not have standing to challenge\n   activities at District charter schools (which her children do not attend or come into contact with) or a Belize mission trip organized by St. Andrew United Methodist Church (over which defendants are not responsible).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1 at 5 (charter school activities), and 39 (Belize trip).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The remaining events identified as constitutionally suspect in the complaint are the following: (1) the week-long supply drive hosted at Cougar Run Elementary during school hours; (2) the flyer and emails sent to students and their parents communicating that the supply drive was \"sponsored by Cougar Run 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Graders\n   <em>\n    partnering with\n   </em>\n   the FCA (Fellowship of Athletes)\" and that the \"FCA students will take [the donated supplies] with them to run camps during their Spring Break mission\"; (3) one week's proceeds from the Cougar Run newsletter \"Press Paws\" were donated to the mission trip; (4) monetary donations to support the mission trip could be made via \"checks payable to Cougar Run Elementary\"; and (5) the DCSD students and faculty who went on the mission trip used the supplies donated at Cougar Run to aid in their proselytizing activities. ECF No. 1 at 26, 34-39, 41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Humanist Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276636\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1243/\">\n    859 F.3d at 1248-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referencing Zoe's retrospective claims). Defendants argue that the scope of Ms. Zoe's claim-and thus the scope of the District's actions that this Court can consider in assessing whether the District violated the Establishment Clause-is limited to conduct that Ms. Zoe and/or her son personally experienced, namely the flyer and email solicitations that they received regarding the supply drive. ECF No. 103 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that the scope of Ms. Zoe's injury went beyond the flyer and email communications and instead includes all \"openly available data\" regarding the District's promotion of Christianity, such as the week-long supply drive at the school and the use of said supplies on the mission trip. ECF No. 104 at 2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    McCreary Cty. v. ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210003\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/844/#p862\">\n    545 U.S. 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 862,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210003\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/844/#p862\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210003\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/844/#p862\">\n    162 L.Ed.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (discussing cases where government's action was held unconstitutional upon review of openly available data) ). I agree with plaintiffs that the scope of Ms. Zoe's claim goes beyond the email and flyer solicitations. She brings her claim in her individual capacity as well as in her capacity as a parent on behalf of a minor, and therefore she has standing over claims involving unwanted contacts she experienced and the unwanted contacts and exposures experienced by her son. Ms. Zoe's son was present at school during the week of the supply drive, and as indicated above, Ms. Zoe has indicated in discovery responses that her son felt pressure to participate in the drive and was maltreated by other children when he ultimately did not participate. Based on this exposure and the resulting injury, I find that Zoe's claim necessarily includes the fact of the supply drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Further, I find that the scope of Ms. Zoe's claim includes the fact of the mission trip and the use of supplies donated at Cougar Run on said trip. The FCA mission trip attendees used items collected at Cougar Run to aid in their proselytizing activities on the trip.\n   <em>\n    Am. Humanist Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276636\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1243/\">\n    859 F.3d at 1248-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, strings and beads donated at Cougar Run were apparently used to make \"Salvation Bracelets.\" ECF Nos. 47-19, 47-20 (testimony that beads donated at Cougar Run were used to make \"Salvation Bracelets\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-56 (flyer stating \"FCA students will take [donated supplies] with them to run camps during their Spring Break mission to San Pedro\"). Because the fruits of the supply drive hosted at Cougar Run were used to proselytize Christianity on the mission trip, and because the mission group's intention to use the donated supplies for that purpose was known by\n   the District prior to the supply drive being hosted at Cougar Run, I find that Zoe's claim includes the use of donated supplies to proselytize on the mission trip as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In sum, I will assess Zoe's Establishment Clause claim by considering the flyer and email solicitations; the fact of the week-long supply drive conducted at the elementary school, including the school's decision to donate proceeds from the school newspaper to the drive; and the fact of the mission trip itself during which items solicited and donated at Cougar Run were used to proselytize Christianity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   None of these allegations directly implicate the actions of Elizabeth Celania-Fagen, superintendent of the District, or Jerry Goings, the principal of Highlands Ranch High School. The claim against Ms. Celania-Fagen in her individual capacity was voluntarily dismissed. ECF No. 11. The claim against her in her official capacity is, in substance, a (duplicative) claim against the District. The claim against Mr. Goings is asserted only in his official capacity; in substance, it is a claim against the Douglas County High School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant John Gutierrez, the principal at Cougar Run, did permit the supply drive to take place at Cougar Run, and he even sent an email promoting the fundraiser to Cougar Run families. ECF No. 47-18. He admits that \"funds were solicited as well as donations ... for the mission trip\" which indicates that he was aware of the religious aspect of the fundraiser to which he requested the Cougar Run families donate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276636\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1243/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olson v.

His decision to allow the fundraiser to take place at Cougar Run and subsequent sending of an email that promoted the Christian mission trip fundraiser from his school email address \"is a choice attributable to the State, and from a constitutional perspective it is as if a state statute decreed that\" the school supported the Christian mission trip.\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Mr. Gutierrez's conduct is within the scope of this Court's review. Nevertheless, because he was sued only in his official capacity, the claim against him is, in substance, a claim against the Cougar Run Elementary School. The claims against defendants Munier, Koceski and Nolan were previously dismissed.

The Court denies defendants' motion for summary judgment as it relates to the Zoe plaintiffs but grants the motion as it relates to the claims of the American Humanist Association.
