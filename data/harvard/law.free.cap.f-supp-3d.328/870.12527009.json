Some of the company's products are metal sheets that feature complex images made from a series of holes, bumps, and indentations in the metal.

In October 2014, representatives of Hendrick and Zahner discussed a licensing arrangement of some kind-the Amended Complaint provides no details on this discussion or the proposed arrangement-but the deal subsequently fell apart. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.)

The installation appears in the image below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Pl.'s Tech. Demonstrative 9.)

'688 patent col. 7 ll. 9-12, 20-21.

Reexam. Cert. col. 1 ll. 25-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Independent claim 11 is slightly more complicated. It similarly combines steps (c) and (d) from claim 17 into a single step 11(c), and combines steps (e) and (f) into a single step 11(e).

The claim further states, in its preamble, that the \"method\" is one for \"transferring a representation of an image to a surface\n   <em>\n    of a building\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added); states that the \"intermediate file\" is an \"intermediate raster file\"; states that the dots in that intermediate raster file are \"arranged according to a predetermined grid and selected ones of the dots are left blank according to the image\"; and states that the \"features\" of the surface to be accommodated by the user's \"manipulation\" of the dots include \"windows, doors, and edges of the sub-components\".\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   col. 8 ll. 35-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Most of the dependent claims add similar details to the independent claims on which they depend.

Claims 1, 8, 17, and 18\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In this case, asserted claims 1, 8, 9, 17, and 18 lack sufficient detail about how the underlying abstract idea is implemented. The first steps in all these claims involve \"receiving the image as an image file\" and \"converting the image file to an intermediate file.\" Like the final step of the process in\n   <em>\n    Digitech\n   </em>\n   (\"combin[ing]\" two data sets \"into a device profile\"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157916\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/758/1344/#p1347\">\n    758 F.3d at 1351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , these steps provide no instruction on how the described actions (\"receiving\" and \"converting\") occur-they just do. Although the claims tell us something about\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   the resulting intermediate file contains (\"a series of dots that vary in dimensional size according to the image\"), we have no information at all about\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the conversion to that format takes place. The basic concepts of receiving images and converting them into computer files comprising a series of dots are themselves abstract, and do not amount to an inventive application of the underlying abstract idea in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The next steps in the claimed process-\"displaying and manipulating the dots to accommodate features of [a] surface,\" and \"converting the intermediate file into at least one control file\"-are equally bereft of detail. The claims again provide no information at all about how the dots are \"displayed\" or \"manipulated,\" or how the intermediate file is subsequently \"converted\" into a control file. All we know is that the manipulation (however it occurs) accommodates (somehow) the features of a surface, and that the manipulated file is (somehow) converted into another file. And although certain general characteristics of the resulting control file are described (it is \"operable to be utilized by a machine to physically manipulate [a] surface according to the dots\"), the claim language does not explain what being \"operable\" by such a generic machine involves. The act of creating a computer file containing code that can be read by another machine does not add inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The remaining steps in claims 1, 8, 17, and 18 are slightly more detailed-but only slightly. All the claims involve the step of \"scaling the intermediate file to the surface,\" which, we are told, is to be accomplished \"by dividing the intermediate file into a plurality of sub-components.\" Each of these sub-components, in turn, \"corresponds to one of a plurality of individual sheets that are to be combined to form the surface.\" Again, however, the patent offers no information about how the \"dividing\" occurs. Nor does it explain what \"correspond[ing]\" to a sheet involves. The acts of splitting an image into multiple pieces and subsequently enlarging those pieces do not add inventive concept. Claim 8 adds an additional step: \"assembling the sheets adjacent a building.\" But it does not provide any details about how the sheets are to be assembled. The act of assembling sheets is not, on its own, inventive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The claims are no more inventive when their steps are considered together as an ordered combination. Plaintiff argues that one \"inventive step\" in this case is \"the incorporation of an intermediate file into the method, as a bridge between the original image file and the machine code known in the prior art.\" (Pl.'s Resp. Br. 16.) But all the intermediate file does is display information on a computer so that it can be manipulated by the user. The fact that this involves the creation and manipulation of a \"file\" is merely a consequence of carrying out the action on a computer. Using a generic computer to \"eliminate[ ] inefficiencies in the prior art\"-as Plaintiff characterizes its invention (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )-is not enough.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2355\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f a patent's recitation of a computer amounts to a mere instruction to 'implement[t]' an\n   abstract idea 'on ... a computer,' that addition cannot impart patent eligibility.\") (citation omitted). Even when the court reads claims 1, 8, 17, and 18 most favorably to Plaintiff, and assumes that the intermediate file must be used in the course of \"transforming flat metal into three-dimensional artwork with bumps, indentations, and holes\" (Pl.'s Reply Br. 17), limiting the claimed invention to this field of use is not enough to make it patent-eligible.

Claims 1, 8, 17, and 18, by contrast, require only that the information be displayed in the form of \"a series of dots that vary in dimensional size according to the image.\" Using a generic computer to create a series of dots that resembles another image is entirely conventional (as any reader of the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   knows), and thus is not analogous to the inventive concept at issue in\n   <em>\n    Trading Technologies\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The court concludes that claims 1, 8, 17, and 18 do nothing more than recite an abstract idea, and therefore are not patent-eligible under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Those claims provide certain details about the ways in which the dots in the intermediate file are displayed, the ways in which the dots are manipulated, or the ways in which the sheets produced by the machine are assembled. These requirements appear to meaningfully limit the scope of the claims. Claim 2, for example, limits the claim to the use of an intermediate file in which the dots are \"positioned according to a predetermined grid.\" It is possible, of course, that this specific limitation is \"well-understood, routine, [or] conventional,\" and is thus insufficient to add an inventive concept under the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2355\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the parties do not discuss this or any of the other additional limitations in claims 2, 5-7, 9, or 11-13. The court therefore has no basis from which it can decide whether these limitations are, in fact, \"well-understood, routine, [or] conventional.\" It would be inappropriate to grant judgment on the pleadings in these circumstances, as the court is required to draw all reasonable inferences in the non-movant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings [24] is granted in part and denied in part.
