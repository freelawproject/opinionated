In February 2010, the insurers entered into a settlement with the Aviation Defendants, resolving their aggregate claims for $1.2 billion.\n   <em>\n    In re Sept. 11 Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826936\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/906/295/#p299\">\n    906 F.Supp.2d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2012). Over Plaintiffs' objection, I approved the settlement \"as the 'fair and reasonable' result of 'hard-fought, arms-length, and good faith negotiations.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826936\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/906/295/#p299\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Sept. 11 Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4098952\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/723/534/#p543\">\n    723 F.Supp.2d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) ). The Second Circuit affirmed on April 8, 2011.\n   <em>\n    In re Sept. 11 Prop. Damage Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873492\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/145/\">\n    650 F.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2011). However, believing that the insurance settlement did not fully compensate their losses, Plaintiffs also filed tort claims against the Aviation Defendants (the \"Tort Action\") and this declaratory judgment action against its insurers, claiming priority over the insurers' subrogation settlement with the Aviation Defendants (the \"Subrogation Action\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Several of my prior rulings in these cases are relevant to resolving the instant motion. Beginning first with the Tort Action, I held that under CPLR \u00a7 4545, Plaintiffs' tort recovery would be offset by the approximately $4.1 billion insurance recoveries and that \"any tort recovery ... would be limited to the lesser of the loss in the fair market value of the leaseholds (from their value immediately prior to the Towers' destruction) or the leaseholds' replacement costs, and that the loss in fair market value was the lesser of these amounts.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sept. 11 Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826936\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/906/295/#p299\">\n    906 F.Supp.2d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After holding a bench trial to determine \"whether the $4.091 billion in insurance recoveries that Plaintiffs received for the main site of the World Trade Center (comprising almost entirely of payments for loss rental income and replacements costs for rebuilding the site) compensated Plaintiffs for the same categories of losses that Plaintiffs might have recovered from the Aviation Defendants,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sept. 11 Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205979670\">\n    2013 WL 5979670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, I held that Plaintiffs' insurance coverage \"correspond[ed] completely to Plaintiffs' potential tort recoveries related to the lost value of their leaseholds, and that the insurance recoveries should be set off against such potential tort recoveries, reducing them to zero.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sept. 11 Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828035\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/501/#p507\">\n    957 F.Supp.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meanwhile, Plaintiffs and the insurers continued to litigate the Subrogation Action. QBE insured Plaintiffs under a WilProp 2000 policy form (the \"WilProp Form\"), which provided in relevant part that \"[i]f any amount is recovered as a result of [subrogation] proceedings, the net amount recovered after deducting the costs of recovery shall be distributed first to the insured in reimbursement for the deductible amount retained and for any uninsured loss or damage resulting from the exhaustion of limits under this policy or primary or excess policy(ies).\" In an Opinion and Order dated November 27, 2012, I held that the term \"uninsured loss or damage\" unambiguously referred to \"legally recoverable tort damages\" and that, as such, \"Plaintiffs gain priority with respect to WilProp Defendants' Settlement Proceeds (after deducting the costs of recovery and aside from the deductible amount retained)\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have legally recoverable tort damages\n   <em>\n    exceeding\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' insurance recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sept. 11 Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826936\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/906/295/#p299\">\n    906 F.Supp.2d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). This holding, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, intertwined the Subrogation Action with the Tort Action, in which Plaintiffs were litigating that same\n   issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After resolving the question against Plaintiffs in the Tort Action following a bench trial, I applied that ruling to the Subrogation Action and held that Plaintiffs had \"no right to the Defendants' settlement proceeds\" under the priority provision of the WilProp Form.\n   <em>\n    In re Sept. 11 Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205979670\">\n    2013 WL 5979670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. On the basis of these decisions, both the Tort and Subrogation Action were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs appealed both of these rulings. With respect to the Tort Action, the Second Circuit agreed that \"Plaintiffs' compensable damages [were] limited to the diminution in the market value of their leasehold interests,\" but vacated portions of my prior decisions concerning how to calculate the value of the lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sept. 11 Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342131\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/314/#p334\">\n    802 F.3d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334-38 (2d Cir. 2015). As to the Subrogation Action, the Second Circuit affirmed my interpretation of the WilProp form-that is, that Plaintiffs were entitled to priority to the insurers' subrogation settlement with the Aviation Defendants only if Plaintiffs suffered legally recoverable tort damages exceeding their insurance recovery.\n   <em>\n    World Trade Ctr. Props.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20Fed.%20Appx.%2010\">\n    627 Fed.Appx. at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But because the Tort Action was remanded, and it was therefore \"conceivable\" that Plaintiffs had suffered \"legally recoverable tort damages in excess of [their] insurance settlement,\" the Subrogation Action was also remanded for further proceedings pending resolution of the Tort Action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20Fed.%20Appx.%2010\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20Fed.%20Appx.%2010\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On remand, the Subrogation Action sat dormant pending resolution of the Tort Action, which proceeded into discovery.
