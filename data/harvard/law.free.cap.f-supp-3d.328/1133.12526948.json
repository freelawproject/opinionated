This matter was heard with oral argument on April 24, 2018. The Court has reviewed the record and files herein, considered the parties' arguments, and is fully informed. For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief (ECF No. 24) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ; Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 27) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   ; and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 27) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 15, 2018, Plaintiffs Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho, Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and Hawaiian Islands, and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland (collectively \"Planned Parenthood\") filed this Complaint against Defendants United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and the Secretary of HHS, Alex Michael Azar II. ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs seek to prevent and declare unlawful HHS's decision to terminate Plaintiffs' grant agreements and end the Teen Pregnancy Prevent Program (\"TPP Program\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1. Plaintiffs assert claims for declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), Establishment Clause, and Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 100-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the instant motion, Plaintiffs move for preliminary injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from terminating without cause Plaintiffs' five-year cooperative agreements under the TPP Program. ECF No. 24 at 8. Defendants oppose Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and request the Court dismiss or enter summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs' claims. ECF No. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are primarily drawn from Plaintiffs' Complaint and documents appended to the instant motion, and are accepted as true for the purposes of the motions for preliminary injunction and to dismiss. The TPP was created by Congress for the 2010 fiscal year (\"FY\"). ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 2. Congress has continued to appropriate funds for the TPP Program since 2010 at approximately $110 million annually.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 31.

ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 30. In April 2015, HHS issued Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) for the TPP Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. The FOAs required a detailed work plan over the \"five-year project period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42; 27-2 at 11 (Ex. A). The FOAs state, \"Each year of the approved project period, grantees are required to submit a noncompeting application which includes a progress report for the current budget year, and work plan, budget and budget justification for the upcoming year.\" ECF No. 27-2 at 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July 2015, HHS awarded 81 new TPP Program grants. ECF No. 1. at \u00b6 40. In the three TPP Programs at issue, the Notice of Award (\"NOA\") forms issued in 2015 and again in 2016 listed the project period as July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2020. ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 41; 24-3 (Ex. A-B); 24-5 (Exs. A-C); 24-6 (Exs. E-F). The budget period in these awards were only for the relevant year. ECF Nos. 24-3 (Ex. A-B); 24-5 (Exs. A-C); 24-6 (Exs. E-F). Plaintiffs\n   assert that over the first three years of the latest round of the TPP Program funding, HHS consistently commended all three Plaintiffs for their implementation of their respective TPP Program projects. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July 2017, HHS awarded FY 2017 funds to Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76. The NOAs for 2017 state, \"This award also shortens the project period to end on June 30, 2018 at the end of this budget year.\" ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 77; 24-3 at 54 (Ex. D); 24-5 at 43 (Ex. C); 24-6 at 565 (Ex. K). On August 1, 2017, Plaintiffs each separately wrote to HHS challenging the alleged termination and Defendants did not respond.

Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, the Court may grant preliminary injunctive relief in order to prevent \"immediate and irreparable injury.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1)(A). Rule 65 also states that \"[b]efore or after beginning the hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court may advance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the hearing.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At oral argument, the Court questioned the parties as to whether there was any reason not to make this action a final injunction. Defendants asserted that Plaintiffs had not sought a permanent injunction. On reply, Plaintiffs clarified that their priority is a preliminary injunction, but see no reason why the resolution should not be final if the Court is ready to resolve the case. The Court finds that there is no reason not to decide the issue as a final injunction as it appears that the Defendants do not have any additional evidence concerning the decision with respect to Plaintiffs' APA claims. Accordingly, the Court considers Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction as a final injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To be entitled to a permanent or final injunction, a plaintiff must demonstrate: \"(1) actual success on the merits; (2) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (3) that remedies available at law are inadequate; (4) that the balance of hardships justify a remedy in equity; and (5) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Indep.

ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 100-13; 24 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Grant Policy Statement Applicability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiffs argue that the GPS is not a binding regulation, but merely informal internal guidance. ECF No. 29 at 20. The GPS states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Recipients are not directly subject to the requirements of HHS Grants Policy Directives and implementing HHS Grants Administration Manuals ..., which are internal documents guiding HHS operations. If an OPDIV [HHS Operating Divisions] implements a requirement in an internal document that does affect recipients, it will not do so by citing that document; rather, the requirement is placed on the recipient through explicit coverage in the NoA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ECF No. 27-2 at 111 (Ex. B). The GPS explains general terms and conditions that are common across all OPDIVs and apply \"unless there are statutory, regulatory, or award-specific requirements to the contrary (as specified in individual Notices of Award).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110. The controlling NOAs specify that the order of precedence for conflicting or inconsistent policies applicable to the grants are: (1) grant program legislation; (2) grant program regulations; (3) award notice including terms and conditions; and (4) federal administrative requirements, costs principles and audit requirements applicable in this grant. ECF No. 24-5 at 14 (item 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants respond that the GPS simply explains what is evident as a consequence of HHS's regulations and the ADA, but is not arguing that the GPS should be followed at the expense of HHS's regulations. ECF No. 30 at 16. Defendants emphasize that HHS's \"Federal award must include wording to incorporate, by reference, the applicable set of general terms and conditions.\" ECF\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.210\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) ). Defendants argue that they did not merely cite the document, but \"placed [it] on the recipient through explicit coverage in the NoA\" terms and conditions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The NOAs state, \"You must comply with all terms and conditions outlined in the grant award, including grant policy terms and conditions contained in applicable Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Grant Policy Statements (GPS) ....\" ECF No. 24-3 at 13. Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' interpretation is clear error because it would require 217 pages of the GPS to be appended to the NOA every year in order for HHS to rely upon its general terms and conditions for grants. ECF No. 30 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court finds that while the NOAs are controlling, the GPS aids in illuminating the general terms and conditions for the TPP Program. The NOAs incorporate the GPS by reference as required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.210\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 24-3 at 13. Yet, the GPS also makes clear that \"statutory, regulatory, or award-specific requirements\" are controlling when they contradict the GPS. ECF No. 27-2 at 110. The NOAs also explain that legislation and regulations control over conflicting terms and conditions. ECF No. 24-5 at 14. Accordingly, the Court will consider the GPS, but regulatory or statutory language controls over any conflicting GPS language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The Court is not persuaded here that Plaintiffs unnecessarily delayed in filing this action and motion. Plaintiffs show that they promptly challenged the action and then filed this motion over three months before the termination becomes effective. Even if they did unnecessarily delay, Plaintiffs are still able to establish irreparable harm to the youth they serve, their staff, the communities, and Plaintiffs' reputation within those communities. Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if their five-year cooperative agreements were terminated early when the parties intended these programs to last five years and Plaintiffs based their programs, budgeting, staffing, and partnerships with communities on this understanding. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have established irreparable harm absent injunctive relief. The Court also determines that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for the injury to the youth and communities that Plaintiffs serve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Counts I, II, and IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have no cognizable claims under the APA or the Due Process Clause. ECF No. 27 at 37. As discussed above, the Court has determined that Plaintiffs succeed on the merits of their APA claims. Since there is an APA violation, there is also a due process violation. The APA violation establishes that there was an invalid termination of the protected property interest of a five-year, non-compete program and Defendants did not provide a pre-termination hearing. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have established violations of the APA and Due Process Clause. The Court denies Defendants' Motion to Dismiss regarding these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Count III: Establishment Clause Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' establishment clause claim. ECF No. 27 at 28. Plaintiffs allege HHS violated Plaintiffs' rights under the Establishment Clause because HHS's conduct has the primary purpose of promoting, advancing, and endorsing religion. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 116-18. Plaintiffs assert that HHS's conduct excessively entangles the government with religion and impermissibly coerces grantees into adopting Christian viewpoints by withdrawing access to funding\n   for pregnancy prevention programs unless grantees espouse a Christian viewpoint in administering these programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Defendants first contend that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert this claim. ECF No. 27 at 38. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claim is not an attack on decisions made regarding their projects' continued funding, but a challenge to what HHS may later decide to do with the TPP Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants assert that the claim is not ripe for review because Plaintiffs do not have Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   To satisfy Article III's standing requirements, the plaintiff must show the follow three elements: (1) the \"plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact-an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;\" (2) there must be a \"causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of-the injury has to be 'fairly traceable' to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court;\" and (3) \"it must be likely, as opposed to speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

ECF No. 27 at 38. Defendants note that HHS has the right to recompete TPP Program funds and Plaintiffs have the right to participate in any such recompete.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. Defendants emphasize that HHS has not yet released a funding announcement for a new round of competitive grant applications, much less reviewed applications or approved any new grants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' speculation about possible future decisions is no basis for standing under Article III.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that they satisfy Article III standing. ECF No. 29 at 33. First, Plaintiffs claim they plausibly alleged that HHS's termination decision will cause them irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, Plaintiffs insist that the injury is traceable to the Defendants because Defendants concede that HHS has chosen \"not [to] make continuation awards to current grantees,\" and that Plaintiffs have an Establishment Clause claim \"based solely on HHS's actual decision not to continue awarding them funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 27 at 39. Third, Plaintiffs state that remedying the violation would likely remedy Plaintiffs' harms. ECF No. 29 at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege a plausible claim for Article III standing. The Court determines that this issue is not ripe for review when there is no evidence of a religious purpose in the text, legislative history, or implementation of the legislation. HHS has yet to recompete the funds and it is unclear if a future grantee would receive the funding because of its religious viewpoints. There is no evidence of religious entanglement in HHS's decision to recompete the TPP Program funds when the funds have yet to be recompeted. The Court cannot determine an Establishment Clause violation without speculating on what Defendants may do with the TPP Program in the future.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly,\n   the Court dismisses Plaintiff's Establishment Clause claim without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   1.

The GPS did not guarantee funds beyond the current budget period, as it would be a violation of the ADA.
