No. 67) on June 27, 2016. On February\n   28, 2018, a Third Superseding Indictment (Doc. No. 481) was returned that increased the number of counts to 39, but reduced the number of defendants by one because Santez Bradford had pled guilty to charges contained in the Second Superseding Indictment Since then, Johnson and Aweis Haji-Mohamed entered pleas of guilt, and Marquis Brandon was acquitted on some charges and convicted on other charges after a jury trail. That leaves Charles Braden who has filed several Motion in relation to his trial that is scheduled to begin on December 4, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion in Limine To Exclude Evidence of Co-Defendant's Statements and or Confessions (Doc. No. 550)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By way of this motion, Braden requests \"that all pre arrest and post arrest, incriminatory statements by co-defendants Marquis Brandon and Aweis Haji-Mohamed made to any Government witness be excluded from evidence at trial.\" (Doc. No. 550 at 2). In doing so, he anticipates that the Government intends to call Ernest Eddie as a witness at trial who is going to tell the jury about a conspiracy to commit a robbery that was never reported to the police, never investigated, and for which the gun was never found. Braden contends it is \"likely\" that Eddie \"will provide multiple statements by codefendant Aweis Muhammed [sic] about the conspiracy which Defendant Braden will be unable to cross examining as he is a non testifying codefendant in this case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He therefore request that any such testimony be excluded at trial based upon\n   <em>\n    Bruton v.

In\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that a defendant is deprived of that right when a co-defendant's incriminating confession is introduced at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed to consider that confession only against the co-defendant. The decision was grounded on the recognition that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   there are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored ....

A trial court \"complie[s] with this general rule\" when it strikes the alias from the indictment and permits the government \"to refer to aliases at trial when\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   to identifying the respective Defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738032\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/456/57/#p59\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original) (citation omitted). That a nickname is supposedly \"benign\" matters not because the Sixth Circuit \"cannot condone\" the use of even innocuous sounding nicknames such as \" 'Big C,' a/k/a/ 'Big Church,' a/k/a 'Big Churp,' a/k/a 'Big.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Randolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12403119\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/685/429/#p435\">\n    685 F. App'x 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435 (6th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Past experience can be a wonderful teacher. At the trial of co-Defendant Marquis Brandon, the Court learned: (1) some witnesses knew individuals by their nicknames only; (2) those who knew individuals by their nicknames were able to testify using that individual's real name when properly prepared, although a few slip-ups occurred; (3) the jury caught on to the use of nicknames early on in the proceeding; (4) the continued use of nicknames and real names became more confusing than helpful; (5) the Government has a penchant for asking witnesses about a person's \"government name,\" when inquiring about the persons real or birth name; and (6) the Court and the Government have a markedly different view of what it means to keep the use of nicknames to a minimum. In short, the Court and jury heard the nicknames \"Cheefa,\" \"Son Son,\" \"Dummy,\" \"Manstinka,\" and \"Wacco\" far more than was necessary to establish the identities of Johnson, Haji-Mohamed, Brandon, Braden, and Bradford, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Given what happened in the last trial and the position the Government has taken in relation to the upcoming trial involving Braden (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that it should be allowed to refer to nicknames from the start to finish of trial), it is obvious that some restraints need to be imposed to comply with Sixth Circuit precedent. In his reply brief, Braden suggests the following limitations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   If a witness claims to know Mr. Braden only as \"Manstinka,\" the Government should simply ask the witness whether they can make an in-court identification of Mr. Braden as the man they know as \"Manstinka.\" If the witness does so identify Mr. Braden, the Government should then be required to instruct the witness that Mr. Braden's legal name is \"Mr. Braden\" and instruct the witness to refer to Mr. Braden as \"Mr. Braden\" henceforth. Obviously, the Government would need to use the word \"Manstinka\" to a limited extent in order to conduct such examinations, and this limited use should be permitted for witnesses who indicate that they know Mr. Braden only as \"Manstinka.\" However, there is simply no need for the Government to use \"Manstinka\" beyond such procedures, which are sufficient to accommodate the limited purpose of identification. Thus, the Government should not be permitted to say \"Manstinka\" in any other context, and the alias should be stricken from both the indictment and jury instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Doc. No. 603 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the Court's view, Braden offers a solution that is in keeping with prevailing law, albeit one that can be made more effective with a couple of minor alterations. It is unnecessary to formally strike \"Manstinka\" from the Indictment. Rather, the Indictment read and given to the jury will simply be revised to include only those counts referencing Braden, and eliminating any references to nicknames. Further, during opening statements, the Government will be allowed to state in the most general way that Braden and others may be known by nicknames, without getting into specifics at that point. Finally, when inquiring into whether a witness knows Braden solely by the nickname \"Manstinka,\" the Government will refrain from referring to \"Charles Braden\" or anyone else as his \"government name.\" While that may be street slang for a person's real name, it unnecessarily conjures up off-putting images of the government issuing names when, in fact, even those who use street slang know what is meant by a person's real name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Subject to the foregoing, Braden's Motion to Strike Alias From the Indictment (Doc. No. 553), as revised by the request made in his reply brief, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Motion to Sever Defendants Under Rule 8(b) and Renewed Motion to Sever Under Rule 14 (Doc. No. 604)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Braden requests that the charges against him be severed from those of Brandon. This Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   because a separate jury trial has already been held in relation to the charges against Brandon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Motion for Release from Subpoena, or Alternatively, to Modify Conditions of Release for Material Witness Kisha Pollard (Doc. No. 751)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, as a housekeeping matter, the Clerk shall\n   <strong>\n    TERMINATE\n   </strong>\n   this as a pending motion because it has been resolved by Magistrate Judge Holmes's July 18, 2018 Order (Doc. No. 759).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
