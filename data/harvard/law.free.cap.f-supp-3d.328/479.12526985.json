As for the March 19, 2009 Notice to Appear, it is true that the notice simply ordered Ordo\u00f1ez \"to appear before an immigration judge of the United States Department of Justice at: 'TO BE CALENDARED, AND NOTICE PROVIDED BY THE OFFICE OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE.' on a date to be set at a time to be set ....\" ECF No. 39-4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-27 (same); Gov't Surreply 1 (conceding that \"the initial NTAs with which DHS served Mr. Ordo\u00f1ez did not list the date, time, and location of his initial immigration hearings\").

But, on April 13, 2009, the San Francisco immigration court personally served Ordo\u00f1ez with a \"Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings,\" which stated that his case had \"been scheduled for a ...

Thus, even if the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   holding has the broad jurisdictional implications that Ordo\u00f1ez views it to have, Ordo\u00f1ez has not shown that the 2009 Notice to Appear, in combination with the Notice of Hearing, did not provide him with the required notice or that he did not waive this argument, and his jurisdictional challenge appears to be without merit. In any event, it is a challenge to the immigration court's jurisdiction, not this Court's jurisdiction.

Further, informing Ordo\u00f1ez that he could seek legal advice to confirm that the immigration judge was correct did not cure the error, given that Ordo\u00f1ez had made clear that he lacked the funds for an attorney and that he therefore was relying on the judge to answer his questions (without misleading him).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    Actual Prejudice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Despite the considerable time that the California immigration judge spent advising Ordo\u00f1ez, two due process rights violations occurred. First, the immigration judge proceeded with the February 28, 2012 deportation hearing notwithstanding clear indicia that Ordo\u00f1ez lacked competence. Second, the immigration judge told him that he needed evidence to obtain asylum and did not correct Ordo\u00f1ez when he stated that he did not have evidence, even though Ordo\u00f1ez of course had the ability to testify on his own behalf. As noted, a due process violation alone does not support dismissal of an indictment, however; there also must be a showing of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, I must consider whether, if the California immigration judge had recognized Ordo\u00f1ez's incompetence and informed Ordo\u00f1ez that he could use his own testimony as evidence in support of asylum, \"there was reasonable probability that he [would have obtained that relief and he] would not have been deported.\"\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p663\">\n    434 F.3d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The clear answer is yes. It is true that Ordo\u00f1ez stated clearly that he did not want to be incarcerated for three more months, waiting for an asylum hearing. But, that was when he thought (based on the immigration judge's erroneous statement) that he could appeal the deportation order, making that option less risky, and then again when he thought (based on another erroneous statement by the judge) that he could not succeed on his asylum application, making that option appear futile. Moreover, previously, with counsel, Ordo\u00f1ez filed his asylum application and his U visa application, as well as two appeals of unfavorable decisions. Thus, it is reasonably probable that, with counsel, Ordo\u00f1ez would have continued to pursue asylum instead of acquiescing to deportation. Moreover, given his history, particularly his mistreatment when he returned to Honduras, he had a reasonable likelihood of success. Indeed, the immigration judge repeatedly encouraged him to pursue asylum instead of accepting deportation, referring\n   to an asylum hearing as \"the safer way\" to proceed.

And in any event, because the California immigration judge did not explain to Ordo\u00f1ez that he himself could provide evidence to support his asylum application, he did not understand that he had been misinformed or that he had any basis for appeal, and therefore he \"did not have the opportunity to seek judicial or administrative review.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Itehua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201470250\">\n    2018 WL 1470250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (reaching same result).

Ordo\u00f1ez's Motion to Dismiss Indictment is granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Through no fault of his own, Pedro Jose Ordo\u00f1ez was brought to this country as a very young child by his mother. She subjected him to sustained serious mental and physical abuse- so much so that she was arrested, convicted and imprisoned for it. Ordo\u00f1ez then lived with his father, who was somewhat less physically abusive, but otherwise indifferent to his care. When he returned to his mother following her jail sentence, she tossed him out into the streets to fend for himself at age fourteen. That he got into trouble in this situation should surprise no one. When accosted by his mother's adult boyfriend (and unable to stop him after trying to walk away three times), Ordo\u00f1ez used a knife to defend himself and stabbed his attacker in the stomach. His bad luck continued. He was not charged by Arizona officials as a juvenile for this offense, but rather as an adult. While detained before and after his conviction for assault, his correctional records documented his serious mental health symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   When Ordo\u00f1ez was released following his short sentence for assault, ICE was waiting for him. He was detained pending removal proceedings, and his mental health symptoms were observed and diagnosed (Schizoaffective Disorder ). What followed were proceedings in Arizona before an immigration judge so fundamentally unfair that the Government wisely has not attempted to defend them. Still a juvenile, Ordo\u00f1ez was deported to Honduras, where he traded physical abuse by his parents for the same or worse by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   His efforts at age seventeen to return to the United States in 2009 failed, and he immediately was intercepted at the border.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Once again he found himself facing removal proceedings, this time in California. His detention records show that his mental health symptoms had not abated-he was placed on suicide watch, and he sought treatment for hearing voices. His mental health needs were rated as \"severe.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   His second removal proceedings continued until February, 2012, when Ordo\u00f1ez once more was deported. At times, Ordo\u00f1ez had\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel. When he did, it made a difference. His lawyers sought relief from removal on his behalf by filing an asylum claim, a claim under the Convention Against Torture, and an application for a U visa based on the abuse he had endured from his mother, whose conviction was obtained with Ordo\u00f1ez's assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   But the funding for\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel did not last, and many times Ordo\u00f1ez found himself in a battle of wits unarmed against DHS counsel intent on securing a \"rock solid\" deportation order, even at the expense of fulfilling their obligation to bring to the attention of the well-meaning, but at times misinformed, immigration judge Ordo\u00f1ez's serious mental health problems. The record is clear that Ordo\u00f1ez tried his best when on his own, but he found himself in the shell-game like situation of trying to pick the best avenue of relief from involuntary deportation to pursue. The immigration judge failed to develop the record by informing Ordo\u00f1ez that his own testimony could provide evidence in support of his asylum claim (which the judge viewed as the safest alternative to deportation for Ordo\u00f1ez). Throughout the proceedings, Ordo\u00f1ez made it clear that his mental health was such that he could not face the prospect of further incarceration, and that concern was driving his decision making. Yet the issue of his competency remained undisclosed by counsel for the DHS and unnoticed by the immigration judge. Believing himself unable to provide evidence to support his asylum claim (because of misinformation from the immigration judge), Ordo\u00f1ez simply gave up. He consented to deportation and again was removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Looking at these particular facts through the lens of the legal requirements for Ordo\u00f1ez to succeed in a collateral attack on the validity of the deportation orders, which the Government must establish to secure a conviction, those unfamiliar with the governing law might do a double take on learning that simply showing that both of his removal proceedings were fundamentally unfair is not enough. He must show prejudice as well, and I find that he has. For that reason, the indictment against him must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Undoubtedly, Ordo\u00f1ez will face another round of deportation proceedings. The Government has every right and obligation to initiate them. But this time around, perhaps it will ensure that they are procedurally fair, the record is fully developed by the immigration judge, and counsel for DHS complies with his or her obligations with the professionalism and skill shown by counsel for the Government in the case before me. And, perhaps Ordo\u00f1ez, too, will have counsel throughout, as this case shows just what a difference skilled, determined, and passionate advocates can make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In sum, for the reasons stated above, Ordo\u00f1ez's Motion, ECF No. 32, IS GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    The terms \"deportation\" and \"removal\" are interchangeable for purposes of \u00a7 1326.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

But, as this discussion has shown, the deportation proceeding violated his due process rights and therefore, even though he could have been removed for being present in the United States, the deportation order could not have been lawfully issued following the deficient procedures that the immigration judge followed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    The immigration judge also erred during the February 28, 2012 hearing when he told Ordo\u00f1ez, who no longer had counsel, that he was ineligible for voluntary departure by operation of INA \u00a7 241(a)(5) (codified at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).
