(\"Plaintiff\") brings this lawsuit against Defendant Colony Insurance Company (\"Defendant\") alleging that Defendant breached the parties' insurance agreement by declining to defend Plaintiff in a lawsuit brought against it by Premier Pools, Inc. (\"PPI\") in Texas state court (the \"Texas Case\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), ECF No. 38-1. This Court granted Defendant's first summary judgment motion in April 2014. ECF No. 20. The Court reasoned that Plaintiff was not a named insured under the parties' insurance agreement's plain language and so Defendant had no duty to defend in the Texas Case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. In May 2016, the Ninth Circuit reversed. ECF No. 27 (the \"Ninth Circuit Ruling\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20Fed.%20Appx.%20490\">\n    649 Fed. Appx. 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the Ninth Circuit mandate issued, Plaintiff filed its SAC in August 2017 and Defendant initially moved for judgment on the pleadings in January 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 38-1 and 45. After that motion was denied without prejudice for failing to meet and confer, Plaintiff filed its motion for partial summary judgment in April 2018. ECF No. 54; ECF No. 71 (\"Pl. Mem.\"). Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on its first claim for declaratory relief, second claim for breach of insurance contract-duty to defend, and third claim for breach of insurance contract-duty to indemnify. Pl. Mem. Defendant opposed and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to all of Plaintiff's claims-the three claims Plaintiff moved on and also Plaintiff's claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and its claim for punitive damages. Def. Mem., ECF No. 74. Plaintiff opposed the cross-motion. Pl. Opp., ECF No. 75. The motions were heard on June 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff entered into an insurance agreement with Defendant in 2010 (the \"Policy\"). The Pertinent policy language reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"We will pay those sums that insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'personal and advertising injury' to which this insurance applies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking those damages.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \" 'Personal and advertising injury means' injury, including consequential 'bodily injury', arising out of one or more of the following offenses: ... Oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services ... The use of another's advertising idea in your 'advertisement'; or Infringing upon another's copyright, trade dress or slogan in your 'advertisement.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \" 'Advertisement' means a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific marketing segments about your goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supports.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Insurance Policy No. AC800001A-2, Ex. 1 to SAC, ECF No. 38-1, at 29, 55-65; Insurance Policy No. AC800001A-3, Ex. 2 to SAC, ECF No. 38-1, at 95, 124-134. The Policy's coverage exclusions state, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Knowing Violation Of Rights Of Another: 'Personal and advertising injury' caused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict 'personal and advertising injury'.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Material Published With Knowledge Of Falsity: 'Personal and advertising injury' arising out of oral or written publication of material, if done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Infringement Of Copyright, Patent, Trademark Or Trade Secret: 'Personal and advertising injury' arising out of the infringement of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights. Under this exclusion, such other intellectual property rights do not include the use of another's advertising idea in your 'advertisement.' However, this exclusion does not apply to infringement, in your 'advertisement', of copyright, trade dress or slogan.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20Fed.%20Appx.%20490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Texas Case-The First Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In July 2012, Premier Pools, Inc. (\"PPI,\" with its principal place of business in Lewisville, Texas) filed its First Amended Petition (\"FAP\") in Texas state court against Plaintiff and Shan Pools, Inc. (Plaintiff's licensee incorporated in Allen, Texas), bringing claims for: (1) common law trade name infringement; (2) common law service mark infringement; (3) unfair competition; (4) infringement of Texas service mark; and (5) trade name and service mark dilution. SAC, ECF No. 38-1, Ex. 6, at 217-244.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The FAP includes the following relevant allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"... I[n] 2011, Defendant Pools Management licensed Defendant Shan to use the name \"Premier Pools and Spas\" and began advertising Defendant Shan as its \"Dallas/Fort Worth location on its website.\" FAP, \u00b6 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Defendants have taken advantage of Plaintiff's well known \"Premier Pools\" name and mark, and its reputation for providing services of the highest quality, to cause Plaintiff to lose business and harm its valuable reputation.\" FAP, \u00b6 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"For over 22 years, the Dodds have built a favorable and valuable reputation for themselves in this geographic area under the trade name and service mark 'Premier Pools' [.]\" FAP, \u00b6 12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"In early 2012, Defendant Pools Management blanketed the Dallas-Fort Worth market with advertising about 'Premier Pools and Spas' and its operations in Dallas, sending advertisements\n   to homes all over the Dallas-Fort Worth area...\" FAP, \u00b6 21.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Beyond all of the confusion that is being caused and the business that is being lost, Plaintiff's reputation and goodwill are being seriously harmed because Defendant Shan's work does not rise to the level of quality and professionalism that has defined Plaintiff's business.\" FAP, \u00b6 34.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"A direct example of how Defendant Shan's work is tarnishing Plaintiff's reputation occurred in Flower Mound, when a city official, as a courtesy, called Plaintiff to ask if a pool that had been built in the area was Plaintiff's product, saying effectively that the pool that had been built was so deficient and in violation of the relevant code provisions that it could not have been Plaintiff's work.\" FAP, \u00b6 34.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"By using the name 'Premier Pools and Spas,' Defendant Shan has unfairly competed with Plaintiff by appropriating Plaintiff's valuable goodwill and business and injuring Plaintiff thereby. FAP, \u00b6 50.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 5, 2013, four days after receiving Plaintiff's tender of the Texas state court case, Colony's adjuster, Becky Vogel (\"Vogel\") notified Plaintiff's founder Paul Porter (\"Porter\") by email that Defendant was \"in receipt of the notice of the lawsuit in Texas alleging trademark infringement. Colony will investigate this matter under a full and complete reservation of rights as afforded by the policy.\" Pl. Notice of Lodgment (\"PNOL\"), ECF No. 71-5, Ex. 2, ECF No. 71-7. Vogel also asked Porter for a copy of PPI's complaint against Plaintiff to investigate whether there was coverage under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20Fed.%20Appx.%20490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On March 15, 2013, Vogel told Porter that based on her initial review, it appeared PPI was alleging trade name and service mark claims that the Policy did not cover. Decl. of Rebekah Vogel (\"Vogel Decl.\"), ECF No. 74-4, \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To investigate further, Vogel spoke with Plaintiff's counsel in the Texas Case, Leland de la Garza (\"de la Garza\"), on March 27, 2013, and went through each of the offenses listed in the definition of \"personal and advertising injury\" with him. Vogel Decl., \u00b6 5. Vogel claims that de la Garza told her there was (1) no allegation in the lawsuit that Plaintiff used PPI's advertising ideas or that Plaintiff was infringing upon a copyright, trade dress or slogan; (2) that \"Premier Pools\" was not a slogan; and (3) the PPI lawsuit was purely a trade name and service mark infringement matter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20Fed.%20Appx.%20490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   de la Garza testified that he recalls reviewing the claims with Vogel but does not recall her using the terms \"offenses\" and he does not believe he stated that \"PPI was not alleging any claim that fit within the covered offenses.\" Decl. of Leland de la Garza (\"de la Garza Decl.\"), ECF No. 75-5, \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The next day, Colony (via Vogel) formally denied Plaintiff's tender by letter. SAC, Ex. 8, ECF No. 38-1, at 247-256. Vogel explained in her letter that trade name infringement and service mark infringement did not fit within the \"Personal and Advertising Injury\" definition under the Policy and that Plaintiff was not named as an insured on the Policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20Fed.%20Appx.%20490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant also reserved the right to rely on the exclusion for \"Infringement Of Copyright, Patent, Trademark Or Trade Secret\" claims and reserved the right to assert that Plaintiff did not qualify as an insured.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20Fed.%20Appx.%20490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Texas Case went to trial in July 2013 and the jury found in favor of PPI, but awarded no damages. Decl. of Paul Porter (\"Porter Decl.\"), ECF No. 71-3, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Plaintiff moved for, and was granted, a second trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20Fed.%20Appx.%20490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Texas Case-The Second Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In July 2012, Plaintiff again tendered a coverage request to Defendant, and Defendant\n   again declined. Porter Decl., \u00b6 7. In September 2013, PPI brought substantially the same claims against Plaintiff and Shan Pools in its Second Amended Petition (\"SAP\"). PNOL, Ex. 1, ECF No. 71-6. The only apparent differences in the claims are that the second claim is styled \"Common Law Trademark and Service Mark Infringement,\" the fifth claim is styled \"Trademark, Trade Name and Service Mark Dilution\" and PPI added a claim for declaratory judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20Fed.%20Appx.%20490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Porter did not send the SAP to Vogel. Vogel Decl., \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Allegations And Testimony About Advertising\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The SAP added new allegations that Plaintiff created a letter purportedly from the Better Business Bureau (\"BBB\") that Plaintiff used in its advertising and sales that falsely attributed BBB complaints to PPI to make it look like PPI committed the actions giving rise to the BBB complaints. SAP, \u00b6\u00b6 46-48. Specifically, PPI alleged that Defendant Shan Johnson wrote a bogus letter purporting to be from the BBB dated April 9, 2012.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20Fed.%20Appx.%20490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In it, Johnson allegedly wrote that the BBB erroneously named \"Premier Pools and Spas of Allen Texas with the complaint you have inquired about. This complaint should have been placed in the bureau of a smaller pool builder in Lewisville, Texas also using the name Premier Pools. We have corrected this error and offer you our apologies for this inconvenience.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 46. PPI alleged Shan Johnson had given this letter to one or more of his sales personnel and told them to show this to customers if they inquired about complaints filed against Defendant Shan with the BBB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PPI alleged that the BBB denied authoring this letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 47. Finally, PPI alleged that this letter was created to show to potential customers to attempt to deflect inquiries about BBB complaints against Shan Johnson to PPI, and \"falsely make it look like the offending conduct was committed by [PPI].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   PPI expert Karl D. Weisheit (\"Weisheit\") also wrote in his November 2013 report that Plaintiff sent advertisements throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area about \"Premier Pools and Spas\" that confused customers into thinking they were looking at advertisements by PPI. PNOL, Ex. 3. For example, the advertisements falsely claimed Plaintiff had operated in the area since 1988 because PPI had operated in the area since 1989.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One of Plaintiff's representatives testified that customers cared about how long the companies had been around. PNOL Ex. 5, ECF No. 71-10, Trial Transcr. Vol. 7, 247:24-248:13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At the second trial in September 2014, PPI's representatives testified that their advertising relied almost entirely on their name and what it represented. PNOL Ex. 5, ECF No. 71-10, Trial Transcr. Vol. 7, 191:15-22; PNOL Ex. 6, ECF No. 71-11, Trial Transcr. Vol. 8, 53:13-20. Plaintiff's representatives also testified that they falsely showed pools built by Plaintiff's franchises outside the Dallas-Fort Worth area and tried to pass them off like they had been built in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. PNOL Ex. 5, Trial Transcr. Vol. 7, 135:6-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After the case closed and the parties prepared jury instructions, PPI's counsel argued that false advertising constituted independent tortious activity that was required for PPI's unfair competition claim. PNOL Ex. 7, ECF No. 71-12, Trial Transcr. Vol. 11, 37:18-38:2. The Court disagreed that false advertising had been tried, but stated \"I'm not sure why we didn't try a false advertising claim because it's certainly present, but we didn't.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 44:4-9. The Court's jury instruction on PPI's unfair competition claim stated, in relevant part, that \"[t]o prove unfair competition, it is not necessary to prove that Defendants intended to deceive the public,\n   nor that anyone was actually deceived. However, either actual or probable deception must be shown, and a mere possibility of deception is not enough.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 74:8-18. During closing arguments, Plaintiff's counsel argued that Premier Pools is just defined as a \"high quality pool, a first class pool.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 113:21-23. PPI's counsel responded in rebuttal that \"[t]he deception, the clever thing is, well, if you advertise, if you spend more, you have a bigger website, you have search engine optimization, you have the mark ... you can't advertise your way to a good reputation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 157:17-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Recently in a deposition, Plaintiff's attorney from the Texas Case testified that PPI's only slogan was its name, Premier Pools. PNOL Ex. 8, ECF No. 71-13, Depo. of Leland de la Garza, 52:12-53:11, 57:17-58:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Involvement In The Second Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At the second trial, Plaintiff retained Veritas Advisory Group (\"Veritas\") as rebuttal damages experts. Porter Decl., \u00b6 12; SAC, \u00b6 30. Plaintiff, however, could not afford Veritas and asked Defendant to pay for Veritas's services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant agreed to pay $25,000 for the expert's services and reserved its rights. Def. Not. of Lodgment of Exhibits (\"DNOL\"), ECF No. 74-8, Ex. 4, ECF No. 74-12. One of Defendant's explicit reservations was that it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   continues its denial of coverage to Premier Pools on all the grounds previously asserted in its correspondence and its papers filed in the matter of\n   <em>\n    Premier Pools Management Corp. v. Colony Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:13-cv-02038-JAM-EFB (E.D. CA), including without limitations that Premier Pools is not an insured under the Colony policy, that the claims in the Underlying Action do not fall within the policy's \"personal and advertising injury\" coverage and that coverage for the claims are barred by various exclusions [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20Fed.%20Appx.%20490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant never sought reimbursement of these fees it paid. Porter Decl., \u00b6 3. In addition to paying for Veritas's services at the second trial, Defendant also had a representative attorney attend the second trial. PNOL Ex. 9, ECF No. 14, Depo. of Ellen Fine (\"Fine Depo.\"), ECF No. 71-14, 58:10-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In October 2014, the jury found Plaintiff liable to PPI for trademark and tradename infringement and unfair competition and awarded $287,876.00 in damages for lost profits. SAC, Exs. 10-11, at 259-78. Plaintiff settled the Texas Case with PPI in April/May 2017 while the appeal of the judgment was pending.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Porter Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 14-17; SAC, \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Ninth Circuit Ruling And Remand\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In May 2016, the Ninth Circuit reversed this Court's previous grant of Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

The Ninth Circuit found that the Policy documents were ambiguous as to which entities were insured and that the policy should be interpreted as a \"layman would read it and not as it might be analyzed by an attorney or an insurance expert.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Ninth Circuit concluded that, when the extrinsic evidence is considered, Plaintiff \"sufficiently established that it was an insured so as to trigger a duty to defend under California law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3 (internal citation omitted). Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit held that \"because there was potential coverage for the underlying suit, Colony had a duty to defend it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Ninth Circuit, however, explicitly noted that \"Colony raises other coverage defenses.
