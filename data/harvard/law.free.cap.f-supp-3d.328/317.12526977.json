While there is nothing wrong with an employer making that decision, Wells Fargo appears to want it both ways: it wants to limit its employees to an arbitral forum, but then wants to be able to get a court to intervene when it disagrees with the outcome of the arbitration. In this instance, Wells Fargo has petitioned this Court to vacate an award resulting from an arbitration between Wells Fargo\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Respondents Livia Sappington, Ewa Kelly, and Patrick LaBorde.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition to Vacate in Part Clause Construction Award (\"Petition\") [Dkt. 1]; Notice of Motion to Vacate in Part Clause Construction Award (\"Notice of Mot.\") [Dkt. 4]. Specifically, Wells Fargo seeks vacatur of the portion of the award that construed Kelly's and LaBorde's contracts with Wells Fargo to permit class-wide arbitration of their claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Having opted to require its employees to arbitrate their disputes, Wells Fargo now has to live with the arbitrator's decision. For the reasons discussed below, Wells Fargo's request to vacate the arbitration award is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   All of the Respondents had employment agreements with Wells Fargo, and Kelly's and LaBorde's employment agreements (the \"Agreements\"), which were executed in 2012 and 2013, are identical. Award at 2-4.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Kelly Agreement [Dkt. 5-1]; LaBorde Agreement [Dkt. 5-2]. Their agreements contain a lengthy dispute resolution provision that provides for arbitration of disputes, with carve-outs that exclude certain types of claims from mandatory arbitration. Award at 2-4. The dispute resolution provision requires disputes\n   to be arbitrated either before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), pursuant to its May 1, 1993 rules, or before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Sappington's agreement, executed later in time, contains a shorter dispute resolution provision that does not contain explicit carve-outs and requires covered disputes to be arbitrated before FINRA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   FINRA does not permit arbitration on a class basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 and n.3 (citing FINRA Industry Code Rule 13204(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondents sought class-wide arbitration of their claims before the AAA and FINRA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Wells Fargo sought from this Court a stay of the class arbitration and to compel individual arbitration. Award at 1-2, 5;\n   <em>\n    see Wells Fargo Advisors v. Sappington\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Sappington I\n   </em>\n   \"), 16-CV-878. This Court denied Wells Fargo's request to stay class-wide arbitration and, looking to its decision in an earlier related matter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   determined that it was up to the arbitrator to decide whether class arbitration was available under Respondents' contracts. Award at 2;\n   <em>\n    Sappington I\n   </em>\n   Order. Wells Fargo appealed that decision to the Second Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See Sappington I\n   </em>\n   [Dkts. 40, 41].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While Wells Fargo's appeal was pending, the parties litigated the proper construction of the contracts before the AAA arbitrator (the \"Arbitrator\"). Award at 5. Ultimately, the Arbitrator determined that Kelly's and LaBorde's agreements permitted class arbitration of their claims, while Sappington's did not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Award at 17-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wells Fargo seeks vacatur of the clause construction determination that the Agreements permit class arbitration, contending that the Arbitrator exceeded his powers both by making the determination that he should decide whether the Agreements permitted class arbitration and by looking beyond the four corners of the Agreements when deciding that they did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law in Support of Petition to Vacate in Part Clause Construction Award (\"Pet.'s Mem.\") [Dkt. 6] at 1, 7-21. Wells Fargo also contends that the Arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law in reaching his decision.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, 21-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Wells Fargo moved to vacate the Award, the Second Circuit affirmed this Court's determination in\n   <em>\n    Sappington I\n   </em>\n   that the Arbitrator should determine whether the employment agreements permitted class arbitration, holding that Kelly's, LaBorde's, and Sappington's agreements \"clearly and unmistakably express[ ] [the parties'] intent to let an arbitrator decide whether they agreed to authorize class arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC v.

The Authority to Construe the Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the Award, the Arbitrator acknowledged this Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Sappington I\n   </em>\n   that he had the authority to determine whether the agreements permitted class arbitration, and, rather than reassess the basis for his authority, he adopted this Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Tucker.\n   </em>\n   Award at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Wells Fargo asserts that \"the arbitrator exceeded his powers by deciding issues of arbitrability without a contractual basis for doing so.\" Pet.'s Mem. at 8.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-11; Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Petition to Vacate in Part Clause Construction Award (\"Reply\") [Dkt. 16] at 4-5. Wells Fargo essentially seeks to relitigate the Court's delegation of this question to the Arbitrator. Wells Fargo argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his powers because he lacks the authority to determine the delegated question, and because he failed to conduct his own \"independent analysis\" of this issue: \"although the Court delegated the issue to the arbitrator, the arbitrator was still obligated to verify whether the parties' arbitration agreements 'clearly and unmistakably' delegated the issue of arbitrability.\" Pet.'s Mem. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Arbitrator did not exceed his authority; he did not consider issues beyond those submitted for his consideration and he did not reach issues prohibited by law or the parties' agreements. This Court explicitly delegated the question of class arbitrability to the Arbitrator, and the Second Circuit has since affirmed this Court's decision. Although the Second Circuit affirmed on different grounds, both this Court and the Second Circuit agreed that it was up to the Arbitrator to decide whether class arbitration was permissible under the agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And although the parties briefed this issue before the Circuit's opinion had been published, the Circuit's holding quite clearly forecloses Wells Fargo's argument that the Arbitrator exceeded his powers by deciding the issue that this Court squarely put before him. That the Arbitrator adopted this Court's reasoning rather than conducting his own searching analysis does not mean that the Arbitrator acted outside the scope of his powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Arbitrator's Substantive Determination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In reaching his decision that class arbitration was permitted under the Agreements, the Arbitrator considered relevant Supreme Court and lower court precedent, and he discussed the arguments made by the parties. Award at 7-14. The Arbitrator found that Missouri law permitted him to consider evidence outside the Agreements when interpreting them, in particular the circumstances at the time of their formation\n   and the parties' conduct, even if the Agreements' terms were unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. He highlighted Wells Fargo's arguments regarding the text of the Agreements, including their silence on class arbitration and their use of singular pronouns, as well as Respondents' arguments regarding the breadth of the arbitration clauses, the existence of explicit carve-outs for certain types of claims, and the absence of a class arbitration waiver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14. The Arbitrator then conducted his own review of the legal environment that existed at the time of the agreements' execution, finding that approaches to and the law regarding class arbitration varied across states and Circuits, and that some businesses and employers were advised to use waivers if they wished to preclude the possibility of class-wide arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16. The Arbitrator discussed the differences between Kelly's and LaBorde's agreements and Sappington's, finding that the latter contained deliberate alterations from the former-specifically, a more concise arbitration provision that lacked carve-outs for certain claims and that required arbitration through FINRA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Following from his analysis, the Arbitrator determined that, although the question was close, the Kelly and LaBorde agreements permitted class arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Award at 17. He focused on the comprehensive nature of the agreements, and the expectations that Wells Fargo's employees might have had when signing the agreement regarding their ability to arbitrate claims regarding compensation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Arbitrator emphasized: the arbitration provisions' comprehensive nature; the absence of a carve-out for class or collective wage claims, despite the presence of other carve-outs; the absence of a class action waiver; the likelihood that employees would have expected to arbitrate claims for unpaid compensation and would have been advised to bring them as a class or collective; the substantial likelihood that claims for unpaid compensation would seek class relief; and that case law at the time the Agreements were executed made it likely that a court or arbitrator would have found that the Agreements implicitly permitted class relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. The Arbitrator's view was that interpreting the Agreements to preclude class-wide arbitration would allow Wells Fargo to benefit from a class action waiver without actually including one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. The Arbitrator viewed the differences between the earlier Agreements and Sappington's as additional circumstantial evidence that the earlier Agreements contemplated class arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. The Arbitrator rejected Wells Fargo's argument that focused on the Agreements' use of singular pronouns because \"[p]ractically all contracts are written in the singular when referring to each party's agreements. I would not expect an employment agreement to refer to joint claims with other employees except in the context of a class action waiver, which is contained in none of the agreements at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Wells Fargo argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his powers by \"disregard[ing] the Agreements' contractual requirements, going beyond the four corners of the Agreements and relying on extrinsic evidence and sheer speculation to support his\n   conclusions\" even though \"no one, including the arbitrator, consider[ed] the Agreements ambiguous.\" Pet.'s Mem. at 11. According to Wells Fargo, looking beyond the four corners of an unambiguous contract is inappropriate under Missouri law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13; Reply at 5-7. Wells Fargo thus contends that the Arbitrator improperly considered circumstances surrounding the execution of the Agreements and the legal environment at the time of execution, improperly drew conclusions based on the differences between Kelly's and LaBorde's agreements and Sappington's, looked to modern AAA Rules rather than the 1993 Rules set forth in the Agreements, and improperly invoked public policy. Pet.'s Mem. at 16-21; Reply at 6-7. Focusing on the Agreements themselves, Wells Fargo points to the use of the pronouns \"you\" and \"your\" as evidence that the parties intended to arbitrate only individual claims on a non-class basis. Pet.'s Mem. at 13-16; Reply at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Respondents argue,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that even if the Arbitrator made errors-and they contend he did not-\"legal error is not a valid basis for vacatur in this Circuit.\" Reply at 16 (citing\n   <em>\n    Jock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415902\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/113/#p122\">\n    646 F.3d at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Wells Fargo's argument, except for its extensive discussion of pronoun selection and invocation of the 1993 AAA Rules, is premised primarily on a footnote in the Award stating that the Arbitrator \"do[es] not find the clause under discussion ambiguous.\" Award at 19 n.34. But Wells Fargo ignores-and, for that matter, Respondents do too-the context in which the Arbitrator made that statement. The remainder of the footnote finds that the clause would likely be seen as \"susceptible to an interpretation requiring class arbitration,\" suggesting that the clause in fact\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   ambiguous despite the Arbitrator's stating otherwise.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415902\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/113/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The subsequent footnote asserts that it is \"unnecessary to split hairs over whether this interpretation depends on [a] finding of ambiguity.

But more important, this Court's reading of the Arbitrator's decision is that the Arbitrator in fact found that the Agreements were ambiguous on this point.

Consider the following: \"You and Wells Fargo agree that the availability of class arbitration as to certain claims shall be determined by an arbitrator.\" We therefore are not persuaded that the references to \"you and Wells Fargo\" by themselves reveal any intent to prevent an arbitrator from deciding the specific question of class arbitration.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <em>\n     Sappington I Appeal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516185\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/392/#p394\">\n     884 F.3d at 397-98\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Second Circuit's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Jock\n    </em>\n    discusses both the\n    <em>\n     Stolt-Nielsen\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Concepcion\n    </em>\n    cases on which Wells Fargo relies for its \"manifest disregard\" argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jock\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415902\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/113/#p122\">\n     646 F.3d at 118-27\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
