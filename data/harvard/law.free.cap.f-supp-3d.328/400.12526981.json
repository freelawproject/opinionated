We held therein that, by virtue of the breadth of its enabling legislation, the Pennsylvania Professional Liability Joint Underwriting Association (\"Joint Underwriting Association\" or \"Association\") is a private entity, its assets are private property, and the Commonwealth thus cannot expropriate the surplus funds held in the Association's coffers. We permanently enjoined the Commonwealth from enforcing the legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Act 41 of 2018, No. 41, 2018 Pa. Laws __ (June 22, 2018) (\"Act 41\"), is the General Assembly's answer to\n   <em>\n    JUA I\n   </em>\n   . Utilizing our earlier analysis as a blueprint, Act 41 endeavors to avoid the constitutional infirmities of Act 44. Specifically, it purports to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , fold the nonprofit Joint Underwriting Association into the Commonwealth's Insurance Department (\"Department\"), shift control of the Association from its current member-led board to a board comprised of political appointees, oust the Association's president in favor of a new executive director hired by the Commonwealth's Insurance Commissioner (\"Commissioner\"), and mandate transfer of all of the Association's documents, files, and assets to the Department within 30 days of the Act's effective date. The Association asks the court to enjoin enforcement of the operative provisions of Act 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Joint Underwriting Association commenced this lawsuit with the filing of a verified complaint on June 28, 2018, subsequently filing an amended complaint on July 3, 2018.

Act 85 is wide-ranging in scope, but its principal effect was to amend the General Appropriation Act of 2016 and balance the Commonwealth's budget. Act 85, \u00a7 1.

Defendants ostensibly do not dispute that they are state actors. We must thus assess whether Act 41 deprives the Association of rights secured by the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Association asserts three Section 1983 claims:\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   , that Act 41 violates its right to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment;\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , that Act 41 effects an unconstitutional taking of private property in contravention of the Fifth Amendment; and\n   <em>\n    third\n   </em>\n   , that Act 41 interferes with the Association's contracts\n   with both its members and its insureds, in violation of the Contract Clause. The Association seeks preliminary injunctive relief based on each of its Section 1983 claims. Because we find, as in\n   <em>\n    JUA I\n   </em>\n   , that the Association has shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits of its takings claim, we restrict our analysis to that cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trefelner\n    <em>\n     ex rel.\n    </em>\n    Trefelner v.

From those decisions, we distilled several factors for assessing the public-versus-private nature of a state-created entity and its assets, including \"the nature of the association's function, the degree of control reserved in the state (or the level of autonomy granted to the association), and the statutory treatment, if any, of the entity, in addition to the nature of the funds implicated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Through the prism of these factors, we found both the Association and its funds to be private in nature. As to the Association itself, we determined that it is \"at its core, an insurance company,\" which performs an \"inherently private\" function and is funded exclusively by privately-paid premiums.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. We rejected defendants' suggestion that the MCARE Act subjects the Association to the imperious control of the Commissioner and observed that,\n   <em>\n    per contra\n   </em>\n   , the statute vested all \"powers and duties\" of the Association \"in and [to be] exercised by a board of directors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting 40 PA.

Governor Wolf posits that the legislature's self-serving change in the law permits the parties and the court to circumvent constitutional determinations reached in\n   <em>\n    JUA I\n   </em>\n   with respect to the private nature of the Association's funds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 19 at 10). The General Assembly echoes this premise, reviving its argument from\n   <em>\n    JUA I\n   </em>\n   that a legislature can do what it pleases with entities it creates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18 at 9-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   At its essence, Governor Wolf's position is that, with a legislative vote and the stroke of the Governor's pen, what were private funds yesterday may become public funds tomorrow-with no consideration due the prior owner.

This deference notwithstanding, the repercussive breadth of the Governor's suggestion is troubling, particularly because it is offered with no jurisprudential support. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 19 at 7-10). For purposes of the instant motion, we find that Act 41's attempted\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   transfiguration of the Association's private assets into public property raises a plausible constitutional question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The parties also dispute whether and to what extent the General Assembly may alter the governance structure of the Joint Underwriting Association itself.
