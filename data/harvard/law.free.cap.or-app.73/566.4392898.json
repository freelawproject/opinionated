The court said nothing about minimum terms of incarceration. However, the judgments purport to order that defendant serve a minimum of two and one-half years on each charge pursuant to ORS 144.110(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The state concedes that the minimum terms were not imposed and were included as the result of a scrivener\u2019s error in drafting the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Judgments modified to delete the minimum sentence provisions; affirmed as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
