J.</author>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Petitioners, E. W. Eldridge, Inc. (Eldridge), and EBI Companies (EBI), seek judicial review of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (Board) affirming two opinions of a referee which had held them responsible for separate claims submitted by respondents Terri Becker and Robert Becker for injuries received while in the employ of a subcontractor performing work for Eldridge. The subcontractor\u2019s compensation coverage had lapsed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Claimants were employed as dump truck drivers by D &amp; F Trucking (D &amp; F), a corporation engaged in general subcontract work. In November, 1980, Eldridge let a contract to D &amp; F under which D &amp; F was to deliver and unload quarry materials for Eldridge at a job site in Kelso, Washington. At the time the parties entered the contract, D &amp; F had workers\u2019 compensation insurance for its employes through SAIF, but that insurance apparently lapsed on December 31,1980. D &amp; F obtained workers\u2019 compensation coverage in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">On March 31,1981, claimants both suffered compensable injuries<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arising from the same incident at the Kelso job site. Separate claims were filed with SAIF, EBI and the State of Washington. Each of the claimants\u2019 three claims was subsequently denied, and claimants requested a hearing on their Oregon claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">After the hearing, the referee concluded, in separate orders, that the claims were governed by Oregon Workers\u2019 Compensation Law and that claimants were subject workers of Eldridge under Oregon\u2019s statutory employer law. ORS 656.029; <em>see EBI Companies v. Erzen, </em>73 Or App 256, 698 P2d 534 (1985). <em>Cf. former </em>ORS 656.124 <em>(repealed by </em>Or Laws 1965, ch 285, \u00a7 95). As a result, Eldridge was held responsible for the payment of all workers\u2019 compensation benefits to claimants through its insurer, EBI. The Board affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Petitioners first assign as error the Board\u2019s interpretation of ORS 656.029 as imposing on an \u201cemployer who lets a contract\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>a prime contractor) the responsibility of monitoring \u201cthe person to whom the contract was let\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>subcontractor)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the purpose of assuring that the latter maintains workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage for its employes. A result of the Board\u2019s interpretation is that an <em>uninsured </em>subcontractor\u2019s employe injured on the job is a \u201csubject worker\u201d of the prime contractor for the purposes of workers\u2019 compensation and, thus, is entitled to benefits through the prime contractor\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The version of ORS 656.029 <em>(amended by </em>Or Laws 1981, ch 725, \u00a7 1; Or Laws 1981, ch 854, \u00a7 4; Or Laws 1983, ch 397, \u00a7 1; and Or Laws 1983, ch 579, \u00a7 2a) in effect at the time claimants\u2019 injuries occurred provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">\u201c(1) If any person engaged in a business and subject to this chapter as an employer lets a contract involving the performance of labor and such labor is performed by the person to whom the contract was let, with assistance of others, all persons engaged in the performance of the contract are deemed subject workers of the person letting the contract unless the person to whom the contract is let has qualified either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">\u201c(a) As a direct responsibility employer as provided pursuant to ORS 656.407; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">\u201c(b) As a contributing employer as provided by ORS 656.411.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">\u201c(2) If the person to whom the contract is let performs the work without the assistance of others, that person is subject to this chapter as a subject worker of the person letting the contract unless that person and the person letting the contract jointly file with the insurer or self-insured employer a declaration stating that the services rendered under the contract are rendered as those of an independent contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">It is clear from a reading of the statute that a prime contractor is to be responsible for persons deemed \u201csubject workers\u201d under the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Laws. It is equally clear, however, that the prime contractor may avoid responsibility if certain conditions are met. <em>See EBI Companies v. Erzen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Subsection (1), applicable here, removes responsibility from the prime contractor if the subcontractor qualifies as either a \u201cdirect responsibility employer\u201d or a \u201ccontributing employer.\u201d As the former, the employer is self-insured and warrants that it will be personally responsible for compensation benefits. <em>See </em>ORS 656.407 <em>(amended by </em>Or Laws 1981, ch 854, \u00a7 27). As the latter, an employer furnishes workers\u2019 compensation coverage through an insurance carrier. <em>See former </em>ORS 656.411 <em>(repealed by </em>Or Laws 1981, ch 854, \u00a7 1). At the time it subcontracted with Eldridge, D &amp; F qualified as a contributing employer under ORS 656.029.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Petitioners argue that the language of the statute, \u201chas qualified,\u201d imposes responsibility on the prime contractor to verify a subcontractor\u2019s insurance coverage only at the time a contract is let and that the prime contractor is thus relieved from responsibility if an injury occurs at some later date when the subcontractor has become uninsured. They argue that there is no duty to monitor subcontractors to see that insurance is maintained and that to impose such a duty would be an unfair burden. However, the legislative history of ORS 656.029 and the policy of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law do not support petitioners\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The impetus behind the introduction and passage of ORS 656.029 was the desire to eliminate \u201cphony partnerships\u201d and other business entities organized to evade responsibility under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. Minutes, Senate Committee on Labor, Consumer and Business Affairs, p 7 (Feb. 27, 1979 \u2014 Statement of Senator Kulongoski). Legislators recognized the seriousness of the problem and strove to correct it by enacting legislation which would encourage employers either to obtain insurance on their own, demand proof of insurance coverage from subcontractors or negotiate a waiver of responsibility through the filing of a declaration of independent contractor status. Minutes, Senate Committee on Labor, Consumer and Business Affairs, pp 4-7 (Feb. 27, 1979). Because the primary goal of all workers\u2019 compensation legislation is the protection of employes, we agree with the Board that imposing liability on the party best able to shoulder the burden both financially and logistically, <em>i.e., </em>the prime contractor, achieves this goal and furthers the intent of the legislature. We hold, therefore, that ORS 656.029 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>is to be applied in the light of the circumstances at the time a worker is injured, rather than the time the contract was let.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Petitioners argue that the imposition of a monitoring function on contractors will encourage unscrupulous or careless subcontractors either to cancel their insurance coverage after entering the contract or to let their coverage lapse. We believe, as did the Board, that the referee identified an answer to this objection which may be currently in practice or which at least deals with petitioners\u2019 concerns: The prime contractor need only obtain from the subcontractors it does business with, proof of coverage <em>and </em>assurance that such coverage will be maintained until the contract is performed. The prime contractor is in the best position to require compliance with its demands, as it controls the selection of its subcontractors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This position receives support from one noted commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">\u201cThe purpose of this legislation was to protect employees of irresponsible and uninsured subcontractors by imposing ultimate liability on the presumably responsible principal contractor, who has it within his power, in choosing subcontractors, to pass upon their responsibility and insist upon appropriate compensation protection for their workers.\u201d 1C Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>9-12, \u00a7 49.11 (1980 ed.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The parties did not cite, but our research has disclosed, another section of <em>the </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law which, we believe, reflects the legislative policy that the prime contractor be ultimately liable for workers\u2019 compensation coverage. At the time of claimants\u2019 injury, ORS 656.556 <em>(amended by </em>Or Laws 1981, ch 854, \u00a7 38) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\u201cIf any person lets a contract and the person to whom the contract was let, while performing the contract, engages as an employer subject to ORS 656.001 to 656.794 at the plant of the person letting the contract, upon premises owned, leased or controlled by such person or <em>upon premises where such person is conducting his business, the person letting the contract shall be liable to the Industrial Accident Fund for the payment of all contributions which may be due such fund on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number><em>account of the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The statute plainly made a prime contractor responsible for the payment of a subcontractor\u2019s \u201ccontributions\u201d due the Industrial Accident Fund if certain circumstances existed. Pursuant to ORS 656.504-.505 and 656.508 <em>(amended by </em>Or Laws 1981, ch 854, \u00a7\u00a7 33, 34 and 35), \u201ccontributions\u201d consisted of the monthly payment or premium for workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage. <em>See also </em>Skelton, <em>The 1965 Oregon Workmens\u2019 Compensation Law: A New Model for the States, </em>45 Or L Rev 40, 51 (1965). The legislature\u2019s obvious intention to make the prime contractor liable for a subcontractor\u2019s monthly payments clearly reinforces the conclusion of the Board that the prime contractor should be ultimately responsible for a workers\u2019 insurance coverage in the event the subcontractor is uninsured at the time of the injury, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Petitioners next assign as error the Board\u2019s determination that the contract between Eldridge and D &amp; F was for \u201clabor\u201d rather than for the delivery of \u201cmaterials.\u201d Petitioners argue that the contract entered into between the parties in this case involved a \u201cmaterials\u201d contract and that ORS 656.029 is therefore inapplicable, because it only operates where a contract is let \u201cinvolving the performance of labor.\u201d We agree with the Board that petitioners\u2019 characterization of the contract must be rejected, because the terms and nature of the contract clearly involved \u201cthe performance of labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"> Compensability is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-10\"> These designations are only for the sake of clarity and convenience. We do not purport by this opinion to limit the scope of the statute solely to prime contractor-subcontractor relationships; the issue of whether the statute applies to subcontractorsubsubcontractor relationships is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\"> It would seem that employer-subcontractors normally also would be encouraged to provide coverage to avoid a finding of noncompliance under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, which would subject them to sanctions, such as a penalty. <em>See </em>ORS 656.052, 656.054.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
