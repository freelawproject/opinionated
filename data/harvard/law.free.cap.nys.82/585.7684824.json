Murphy against Andrew D. Dernberg. From a judgment of the County Court reversing a judgment of a Justice\u2019s Court in plaintiff\u2019s favor, plaintiff appeals. Judgment of County Court reversed, and judgment of Justice\u2019s Court affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-13\">This action is brought in a Justice\u2019s Court to recover the balance due for one-half barrel of whisky sold by the plaintiff through his agent to the defendant. The defendant was a hotel keeper, living in the city of Rensselaer, and in January, 1901, purchased the whisky under the following agreement: The whisky was to be delivered to him at Rensselaer, at- the price of $61.88, and he was to pay one half in cash, and the other half in horse hire to the plaintiff\u2019s agent. Nothing was said as to when or where the horses were to be furnished. , At that time the defendant was running a livery stable in connection with his hotel, and the plaintiff\u2019s agent was in the habit of traveling to Rensselaer and the adjacent neighborhood in his business of selling whisky for the plaintiff. The defendant paid one-half or more of such purchase price in cash. About April 1, 1901, the defendant removed to Eagle Mills, which is about 11 miles from Rensselaer, and about '4 miles from Troy, the nearest railroad station, and there continues to keep a hotel and livery stable. Of the other half there was $24.94 unpaid when he so removed, and this action is brought to recover that amount. The plaintiff recovered before the justice. The County Court, on appeal, reversed such judgment, without costs, and ordered a new trial before the same justice. From such judgment of reversal this appeal is taken. Further facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b606-14\">Argued before PARKER; P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARu\">The defendant concedes that he received the whisky from the plaintiff, and agreed to pay one-half the purchase price thereof, viz., $30.94; in hdrse hire. At that time he was keeping a livery stable in Rensselaer, which is a railroad center, and the plaintiff\u2019s agent from time to time needed the use of a horse and carriage m his business of selling whisky through that, neighborhood. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Inasmuch as no time was limited, by the terms of the bargain, in which the horse hire should be furnished, nor prices agreed upon, nor place \u2022specified, the law infers that it was to be furnished and received within .a reasonable time, and at the place where the bargain was made and the defendant then kept his livery stable, and at the usual and reason.able prices charged for similar services., It does not appear that any \u2022demand for such hire had been made by the plaintiff up to the time of the defendant\u2019s removal from Rensselaer, but the decision of the justice is equivalent to a finding by him that a reasonable time to furnish the same had not then expired, and such conclusion should not be reversed on appeal. The defendant, then, while still obligated to furnish the horse hire at Rensselaer, removed himself- and his stable to a place 11 miles distant, and 4 miles distant from any railroad station; thus practically disabling himself from performing the contract on his ;part.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">There is no pretense that he still maintained the ability to perform -at Rensselaer, because, after the removal, when discussing the subject \u2022of the plaintiff\u2019s claim with the plaintiff\u2019s attorney before this action was commenced, the defendant said he was willing to meet the plaintiff\u2019s agent on notice at Troy, but he would not do so for the same prices that he did at Rensselaer. Thus he sought to substitute a new \u25a0\u2022arrangement for the contract in question, and evidently one that the \u2022plaintiff was under no obligation to accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">By thus voluntarily putting it out of his power to pay for the whisky as he had agreed to do, and breaking his contract in such respect, a demand by the plaintiff for the horse hire at Rensselaer was not necessary (Crist v. Armour, 34 Barb. 378; 9 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law [2d Ed.] 210); and the defendant became liable to pay the amount still owing plaintiff in money (N. Y. News Publishing Co. v. National Steamship Co., 148 N. Y. 39, 42 N. E. 514).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The defendant on the trial testified: \u201cI know that the agent of the \u2022plaintiff knew three months before I moved that I was going to move; \u2022that he knew when he sold me the whisky that I was not going to stay in the place where I then wasand from this he argues that no im\u2022plication arises that the contract was to be performed in Rensselaer. But the defendant does not testify that anything was said between the parties on that subject, nor that the agent knew where he was going, nor when he intended to move. Such a statement is altogether too Indefinite to warrant the inference that they contracted with reference to the fact that the defendant was going to \u201cEagle Mills,\u201d and that the performance must be had there instead of at Rensselaer, and, unless \"it raises that inference, it is insufficient to affect the plaintiff\u2019s right to \u25a0demand performance at the place where they were then contracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Moreover, if it be conceded that such evidence is, in effect, that the \u2022agent knew he was going to Eagle Mills, and contracted with ref\u2022erence to his furnishing the horse hire there, the justice was fully justified in disbelieving so incredible a story. ;I conclude that the de-cision of the justice was correct; Concededly, the defendant still owed $24.94 upon the whisky which had been delivered to him. He had put it out of his power to pay for it in \u201chorse hire,\u201d as contemplated by the - contract, and so he was liable to pay for it in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The County Court had no authority to order a new trial, unless the judgment in the court below was against the weight of evidence. See Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3063. Evidently, such judgment is not against the weight of evidence, but, on the contrary, is supported by it. I conclude that the judgment of the County Court should be reversed, and that of the Justice affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Judgment o\u00ed the County Court reversed, and that of the Justice\u2019s Court affirmed, with costs to the appellant in the County Court and in this Court. All concur; KELLOGG, J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
