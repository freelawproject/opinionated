Subsequently an action was brought against Glickman Bros, by certain of that firm\u2019s creditors, strangers to this action, to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien on the premises where the gas fixtures had been hung, and the defendant took title to the said premises, with the appurtenances and improvements thereon, by referee\u2019s deed made pursuant to the judgment of foreclosure and sale in said action on March 22, 1902. The contest at the trial was as to the title to the said gas fixtures .under the contract of sale thereof by the plaintiffs to Glickman Bros, the plaintiffs contending that contract was a conditional one, ownership remaining in the vendors until payment of the purchase price in full, which it was conceded had not been made; and the defendant meeting this contention with evidence that the sale to Glickman Bros, was absolute in its terms. It is urged on this appeal that the plaintiffs did not show their ownership and right to possession of the gas fixtures by a sufficient preponderance of evidence to entitle them to a judgment against the defendant for conversion of the property. There is a square conflict in the evidence upon the subject of the contract between the plaintiffs and their vendees, and a careful examination of the record so strongly \u25a0 suggests that the judgment escapes being contrary to the weight of evidence by the narrowest margin that any evidence improperly admitted over the defendant\u2019s objection must have been materially prejudicial to the defendant. We think the defendant\u2019s exceptions in at least two instances require a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">The trial court admitted in evidence, over the defendant\u2019s objection, a copy of the alleged conditional agreement of sale which was filed in the register\u2019s office on the 22d day of October, 1902, some six months after the date of the execution of the original agreement, \u201cfor the purpose of showing,\u201d as was stated by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, \u201cthat the defendant in this action had notice of the existence of the claim to the gas fixtures in the premises he had purchased after the filing of this paper.\u201d But it appears that this contract was executed and delivered in duplicate, and it is expressly provided in the lien law (Laws 1897, p. 541, c. 418, \u00a7 115, as amended by the Laws of 1898, p. 1019, c. 354), that, when contracts for the conditional sale of household goods are so executed and delivered, the provisions relating to the filing shall have no application; and \u201cgas fixtures\u201d such as were the subject of this contract are \u201chousehold goods\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in the lien law. Iden v. Sommers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>(Super. N. Y.) 18 N. Y. Supp. 189, affirmed, Id. 779; Kerby v. Clapp, 15 App. Div. 37, 40, 44 N. Y. Supp. 116. The filing being unnecessary, it could not operate as constructive notice; and yet it is easy to see how a doubt might have been created in the minds of the jurors as to the defendant\u2019s bona fides; how this paper, with the statement of counsel when it was offered in evidence, might have suggested a design on the part of the defendant wrongfully to get possession of the plaintiff\u2019s property. We think the admission of this paper was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Again, the judgment roll in the action against Glickman Bros, to foreclose the mechanic\u2019s lien was offered in evidence \u201cfor the purpose of showing that the plaintiffs in this action were not made defendants in the action to foreclose the mechanic\u2019s lien under which the defendant got title to the property.\u201d We think the defendant\u2019s exception to the admission of this judgment roll as evidence raises another point of error.. Obviously, the plaintiffs in this action were not proper parties defendant in that action. This is true on the plaintiffs\u2019 own theory of a conditional sale. They at best had only a contingent interest in the property, which they themselves insist formed no part of the realty. The inevitable suggestion to the jury by this evidence, and again by the remarks of counsel, was that the defendant had obtained possession of the plaintiffs\u2019 property by a high-handed proceeding, regardless of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. We think this also was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">It is by no means impossible that this evidence may have had some effect upon the determination of the jury. \u201cIt rests with the respondent to show that it was harmless, and could\" by no possibility have prejudiced the defendant.\u201d People v. Koerner, 154 N. Y. 355, 376, 48 N. E. 730, citing Greene v. White, 37 N. Y. 405, 407; Stokes v. People, 53 N. Y. 164, 13 Am. Rep. 492; People v. Greenwall, 108 N. Y. 296, 303, 15 N. E. 404, 2 Am. St. Rep. 415. The plaintiffs have not sustained this burden. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Judgment o\u00a3 the Municipal Gourt reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b6\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b503-19\"> 4. See Appeal and Error, vol. 3, Cent. Dig. \u00a7 4051.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
