The answer contains a general denial and a plea of payment. Section 531 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that, where a party does not set forth in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged, he must deliver to the adverse party, within 10 days after a written demand thereof, a verified copy of the account. \u201cThe court, or a judge authorized to make an order in the action, may direct the party to deliver a further account, where the one delivered is defective.\u201d In accordance with the provisions of this section, defehdant\u2019s attorney demanded an account from the plaintiff. In response to such demand the plaintiff furnished this paper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-13\">\u201cThe plaintiff herein states the following as the bill of particulars to his . cause of action herein:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\">\u201c \u2018Port Jervis, Jan. 25th, 1889.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-15\">\u201c \u2018Received of Edward 0. Beirne, Forty Dollars out of pay for December, \u201988, of $90.00 drawn this day from paymaster by E. O. Beirne, the balance of $50.00 is credited to my account, leaving due him now $189.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-16\">\u201c \u2018W. H. Sanderson.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-17\">\u201cW. F. O\u2019Neill, Plaintiff\u2019s Attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">Thereupon the defendant moved, under section 531, for a further account or bill of particulars, and the court made the order from which the present appeal is taken. That order was clearly right. The paper served in response to the defendant\u2019s demand was in no sense an account or bill of particulars, but apparently nothing more than a copy of a receipt alleged to have been given to the plaintiff by the defendant. At most it was an evidence of indebtedness, which could be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>upon the trial, but failed to disclose distinctly what was the claim of' the plaintiff as to any of the items of the account save the $go therein mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Order affirmed, with $io costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
