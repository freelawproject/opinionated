The Comptroller had audited and stated the account for taxes for that year, which imposed a tax of $46,102.53, or 1 per centum upon $4,610,252.92. In ascertaining the amount upon which the tax was to be computed, the Comptroller credited the bank with an item of $1,198,687.95, being the interest or dividends on deposits to and including July 1, 1901, which became due and payable on that day, and which remained in the custody and possession of the bank on June 30, 1901. The Attorney General made an application to the Comptroller for a revision and readjustment of such account for taxes, claiming that said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>sum of \u00a71,198,687.95 was properly taxable, and that there should be added to the tax on account thereof the sum of \u00a711,986.88. The Comptroller granted a hearing upon such application and the Attorney General presented his evidence in support thereof. Thereafter the Comptroller made a determination whereby he denied the application on the ground that he had no authority to increase the assessment theretofore made. The purpose of this writ is to review the determination so made. The Bank for Savings in the City of New York has been made a party defendant.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b628-4\">Argued before PARKER, P.

In the revision this section was taken, with some amendments, from section 19, Laws 1889, p. 634, c. 463. The principal changes made by the amendments were, first, to limit the time during which an application could be made to the Comptroller for a revision to one year from the audit of the account, and, second, to permit the application for revision to be made by the Attorney General as well as by the party against whom the account had been stated. The other changes were simply in phraseology, and leave the section without substantial alteration except in the two respects stated. This court has held, under the section as it stood prior to the amendments, that the Comptroller had no power upon a revision to increase the tax. The People ex rel. Syracuse Improvement Co. v. Morgan, 59 App. Div. 302, 69 N. Y. Supp. 263; The People ex rel. Smith, Etc., v. Roberts, 51 App. Div. 152, 64 N. Y. Supp. 627. None of the changes made in the statute are effective, in my opinion, to change the authority of these decisions as to the want of power in the Comptroller under the section to increase the tax upon a revision by him. Manifestly, the two principal changes above mentioned have no relation to the question of the power of the Comptroller. The power, on a revision of the tax, is stated in identical language in the old and in the new section, and is that he \u201cshall resettle the same according to the law and the facts, and charge or credit, as the case may require, the difference, if any, resulting from such revision,\u201d etc., upon the accounts of such corporation.' It was urged in the cases cited that the phrase, he shall \u201ccharge or credit as the case may require,\u201d gave the right'to the Comptroller to increase the tax, but the court decided against that view. There being no change in the statute in this respect, those cases are decisive of the question here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The determination of the comptroller should be affirmed, with $50 costs and disbursements to the respondent bank. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
