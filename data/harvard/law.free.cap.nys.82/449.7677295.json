Jones at three different times since July 1, 1900, presented claims against the said county of Nassau to be audited by the hoard of supervisors of said county for compensation claimed for his alleged services, mileage, and disbursements as supervisor for the period of time extending from January 1, 1900, to April 1, 1901; that said claims contained various illegal charges against said county, and were audited and allowed by said board of supervisors; that such illegal charges are specifically shown in Exhibit A, which is annexed hereto, and said Exhibit A and the allegations therein contained form a part of this complaint, and column (1) of said exhibit consists of copies of hills so presented and audited, and the added columns (a), (b), and (c) specifically point out the illegal charges in the various items of claims so presented; and plaintiff further alleges as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\">\u201c(a) That an annual meeting of said hoard commenced April 11, 1899, and continued to March 30, 1900; that the next annual meeting commenced April 10, 1900, and continued to April 1, 1901, and no other annual meeting's were held during- the period covered by said claims; that said defendant Jones illegally charged for mileage for each day\u2019s attendance at the said two annual meetings of the board, making ill\u00e9gal overcharges for mileage against the county amounting to $152.80, as shown by said column (a) in said Exhibit A; that the amounts specified in said column (a) in said Exhibit A are charges for mileage for more than \u2018once going and returning\u2019 from said defendant\u2019s residence to the place where sessions of the hoard were held at said two annual meetings, he having charged for thirty miles\u2019. travel at eight cents per mile, viz., $2.40 mileage for each day\u2019s attendance at said annual meetings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\">\u201c(b) That said defendant Jones illegally charged $4 a day and disbursements for alleged committee work and for other alleged services, when no such duties were committed to him nor to any committee by the hoard; the illegal charges thus made amounting to $1,942.67, as shown in column (b) in said Exhibit A.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-7\">\u201c(c) That said defendant Jones also illegally charged $4 a day and mileage for alleged attendance at meetings of the hoard, when he was not in attendance, or when no meetings were held; the illegal charges thus made amounting to $102.40, as shown in column (c) in said Exhibit A.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-8\">\u201c(d) That such illegal bills amounted in all to $2,197.87, as shown by said Exhibit A, and were so audited and allowed by said board of supervisors as follows: The first on July 23, 1900, the second on November 22, 1900, and the third on May 3, 1901, as shown by said Exhibit A. Further, that all of the defendants were in attendance and voted as supervisors at each meeting of said board, and in favor of the audit thereof, when egch of said claims was so audited and allowed; and that the illegal charges so audited and allowed by said supervisors were afterwards paid out of county funds to the defendant Jones, or to his assigns, pursuant to such audit, and before the commencement of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-9\">\u201c(3) On information and belief that the said defendant Jones knew when presenting said claims that the sums claimed were in excess of the fees allowed to him by law, and that such claims were collusively audited and allowed by said board to aid said defendant in having such illegal fees paid from the funds of the county; that the said auditing and allowing of said claims in favor of the defendant Jones was a breach of trust and duty on the part of the defendants, and said acts of the defendants were fraudulent as against the plaintiff and other taxpayers of the said county of Nassau.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b470-10\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.

I think that the judgment must be affirmed on the ground that the first cause of action does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendants Cox and Willets, that the second cause of action fails in like respect as to Jones and Willets, and that the third cause of action fails in like respect as to Cox and Jones. I shall state the reasons for my conclusion as to the first cause of action, which are alike applicable to the second and third causes of action, mutatis mutandis.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The first cause of action is well pleaded against Jones, but no facts are stated therein which show, or permit an implication of facts which show, that the other defendants acted within the purview of the taxpayers\u2019 act (chapter 301, p. 620, Laws 1892). If Mr. Jones presented his own fraudulent or illegal bills, that does not establish that an audit thereof b)r the board of which he was a member was \u201ccollusive or otherwise.\u201d The word \u201cotherwise,\u201d as used in the statute, \u201cby collusion or otherwise contracting, auditing,\u201d etc., is to be interpreted by the rule of ejusdem generis. Penfold v. Universal Life Insurance Co., 85 N. Y. 317, 39 Am. Rep. 660; People v. Elfenbein, 65 Hun, 434, 20 N. Y. Supp. 364; Whelen\u2019s Appeal, 70 Pa. 410, 429; The State v. Kelly, 32 Ohio St. 421, 429; Endlich on Construction of Statutes, \u00a7 407. It does not mean any audit, but an audit due to some sinister or improper motive, and in violation of the public trust. The first allegation is that the annual meeting commenced April 11, 1899, and continued to March 30, 1900; that the next annual meeting commenced April 10, 1900, and continued to April 1, 1901, and no other annual meetings were held during the period covered by said claims; that said defendant Jones illegally charged for mileage for' each day\u2019s attendance at the said two annual meetings of the board. I take it that the illegally charged mileage is a violation of section 23 of the county law (Laws 1892, p. 1750, c. 686). The demurrer may be held to admit that Jones charged a daily mileage, and that the-board audited such charges. But there is no allegation that both of the defendants, as members of the board, audited such charges. The mere statement in brackets on the copies of the bills annexed to the complaint that all of the supervisors were present and voting cannot be held as equivalent to such an allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The second allegation\u2014that Mr. Jones presented a bill for committee work or for other alleged services when no such duties were committed to him or to any committee by the board, which was audited by the board\u2014would warrant the conclusion that the pleader intended to charge that Jones and one of the defendants, either Cox or Willets, audited a bill for which they must have known there was no legal basis, but not that all three did this thing, for the reason that two members of the board constitute a quorum (chapter 686, p. 1745, \u00a7 10, Laws 1892), and therefore one of the two defendants, other than Jones may have supposed that the work done by Jones was authorized at a meeting when he was absent. As to the allegation that the defendant Jones illegally charged $4 a day for alleged attendance'\u201cat the meetings when he was not in attendance or when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>no meetings were held,\u201d it may be said: He (Jones) may have made illegal charges for meetings when no meetings were held, and yet one of the other two defendants may have audited the charge believing that it referred to meetings when there was a quorum present although he was absent. If there was a direct allegation that Jones made a charge when he was not in attendance, then it might be contended that both' of the other defendants must have known of the fact, because, Jones being absent, the other two must have been present to constitute a quorum; but the allegation is simply an alternative, as I have shown. The allegations that the acts were fraudulent or collusive or in breach of trust are conclusions, and are not averments of issuable facts. Talcott v. City of Buffalo, 125 N. Y. 280, 26 N. E. 263; Kittinger v. Buffalo Traction Co., 160 N. Y. 377, 387, 54 N. E. 1081; Wood v. Amory, 105 N. Y. 278, 11 N. E. 636; Barhite v. Home Telephone Co., 50 App. Div. 25, 63 N. Y.
