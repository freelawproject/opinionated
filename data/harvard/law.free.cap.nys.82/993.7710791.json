They are more in the nature of evidence than of the facts essential to be pleaded in an action at law. If the action were in equity there could be no doubt that this pleading was proper (First Presbyterian Church v. Kennedy, 72 App. Div. 82, 76 N. Y. Supp. 284; Park &amp; Sons Co. v. Nat. Druggists\u2019 Ass\u2019n, 30 App. Div. 508, 52 N. Y. Supp. 475; Meyer v. Young, 49 App. Div. 639, 63 N. Y. Supp. 143); but, it being an action at law, it would h\u00e1ve been sufficient for the plaintiff to have alleged ownership of the stock, its delivery to the testator for temporary use, and conversion by him (Park &amp; Sons Co. v. Hubbard, 30 App. Div. 517, 52 N. Y. Supp. 481; Schroeder v. Young, 49 App. Div. 648, 63 N. Y. Supp. 110; Wooden v. Strew, 10 How. Prac. 48; Brown v. Fish, 37 Misc. Rep. 367, 75 N. Y. Supp. 460). It does not follow, however, that such allegations, which are briefly and concisely stated in connection with the allegations of ownership, and are germane to the issue, should be stricken out as irrelevant or redundant. They are all relevant to the issue, and the evidence will be admissible upon the trial. They do not tend to confuse the issue or render the pleading unduly voluminous. We fail to see how the defendants are prejudiced by the allegations. If they admit the plaintiff\u2019s ownership, the allegations stricken out become immaterial; and if they put the ownership in issue they can, without embarrassment or prejudice, at the same time put these allegations in issue by one of the forms of denial authorized by the Code, unless of their own personal knowledge they know the allegations to be true, in which event, if the allegations are not put in issue, they will stand admitted for what they are worth. Of course, the plaintiff would not be a competent witness to prove these transaction's with the testator if the evidence should be \"objected to, but she may be able to prove them by others. It is not probable that the plaintiff will secure any advantage by obtaining an admission by the pleadings of any of these allegations \u25a0 which she could not prove. It is scarcely a possibility that the executors were present and heard these statements alleged to have been made by the testator, so that they are not in a position to put them in issue. Motions of this character are not favored by the courts, and should not be granted unless it is apparent that the moving party will be prejudiced by allowing the irrelevant or redundant allegations to stand. Bogardus v. Metropolitan Street Railway Co., 62 App. Div. 377, 70 N. Y. Supp. 1094; Tradesmen\u2019s Nat. Bank v. United States Trust Co., 49 App. Div. 362, 63 N. Y. Supp. 526; Stokes v. Star Co., 69 App. Div. 21, 74 N. Y. Supp. 528; Williams v. Folsom, 57 Hun, 128, 10 N. Y. Supp. 895. In the case at bar we are of the opinion that instead of the defendants being prejudiced by these allegations, they are to their advantage, inasmuch as they limit the plaintiff in her proof, and render unnecessary a bill of particulars. Upon the peculiar facts of this case, therefore, we are of opinion that the motion should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, without costs. All concur ; IN GRAHAM, J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
