The petitioner sought a final order awarding her possession of the premises. The court issued precept, and the record shows that on the return day the plaintiff appeared, and complained of the defendant for nonpayment of rent, and that the defendant appeared, and moved for dismissal of the petition on the ground that the proceeding was res adjudicata. The court granted the motion. The learned Municipal Court justice writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201cThe issues in this proceeding were tried before Justice Tierney in the proceedings of Josephine Sodlickie against Frances Wauroski, and it was decided that the relationship of landlord and tenant did not exist between Maggie Fritztuskie and Frances Wauroski. Final order 20th January, 1903, dismissing the proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">But I think that there were no issues. An issue arises when a question of fact or a conclusion of law is maintained by one party and controverted by another. The procedure of summary proceeding contemplates an answer. Section 2244, Code Civ. Proc. Even when the tenant filed a counter affidavit, McAdam, J., held that it did not constitute a valid plea under the said section. See, too, People ex rel. Allen v. Murray, 2 Misc. Rep. 152, 155, 159, 160, 23 N. Y. Supp. 160, affirmed 138 N. Y. 635, 33 N. E. 1084. While the tenant could have taken objection by motion \u201cto the jurisdiction of the court, the sufficiency of the petition, notice,\u201d etc., I think that she is limited to these and cognate matters (Deutermann v. Nilson [Com. Pl.] 3 N. Y. Supp. 113), and that she could not raise the question of res adjudicata by mere motion upon the proceedings, and without plea upon her part. In Geisler v. Acosta, 9 N. Y. 227, the court held that the plea of res adjudicata could not be disposed of on affidavit of the tenant. If, as the Municipal Court held, this litigation should be regarded as an action for the nonpayment of rent, then I think that the defendant should have raised the question by plea. Section 168 of the Municipal\u2019 Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1542, c. 580) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">\u201cIn pleading a judgment or other determination of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it is not necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but the judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly given or made. If that allegation is controverted, the party pleading must, on the trial, establish the facts conferring jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">This contemplates the joinder of issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">The record does not show that the former proceedings were read in evidence, nor do I see how they could have been so read without issue. These proceedings are returned, however, on the present appeal. Inspection of them simply accentuates my conclusion. They consist of petition by Josephine Sodlickie against Frances Wauroski, and of precept on which is indorsed by Justice Tierney, \u201cFinal order is, therefore, made the 20th of May, dismissing the proceedings.\u201d The mere showing that proceedings to regain possession of the same premises between different parties had been dismissed is not res adjudicata, irrespective of any proof by plaintiff, and beyond counter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>proof by defendant. Lewis v. O. N. &amp; P. Co., 125 N. Y. 341, 26 N. E. 301; Reynolds v. \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co., 160 N. Y. 635, 55 N. E. 305. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Final order in summary proceedings reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
