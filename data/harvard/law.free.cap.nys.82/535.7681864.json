Nothing more appears to have been done, however, toward creating an 8o-foot street; but Borden avenue was actually created and paved as a 6o-foot street.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The plaintiff contends that the filing of a map, or even the pending of proceedings to acquire property to open or widen a street, is not an incumbrance, and cites as authority for this proposition the case of Keating v. Gunther (Sup.) 10 N. Y. Supp. 734, affirmed in 129 N. Y. 659, 30 N. E. 65; Wagner v. Perry, 47 Hun, 516; and Blackman v. Riley, 138 N. Y. 318, 34 N. E. 214. The defendant disputes the application of these decisions to the case at bar, in view of the language of the contract between the parties. The argument in his behalf is clearly stated by his counsel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cIt may very well be that the plaintiff has good title to that 10 feet of property, but the defendant\u2019s objection is that that 10 feet of property lies within the lines of Borden avenue, and that the defendant did not agree to buy that, and does -not want it. There is only one Borden avenue, and that is an avenue 80 feet in width, and the plaintiff voluntarily adopted that avenue as a boundary, and voluntarily agreed to sell to the defendant a parcel of land 125 feet deep, bounded on that avenue; and that agreement is not carried out by endeavoring to make the defendant take a parcel of land 115 feet deep on that avenue, together with 10 feet in the bed of that avenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">This argument seems to me cogent and convincing. In Matter of Fourth Avenue, 11 Abb. Prac. 189, 195, the General Term of the First District was called upon to construe a deed of property bounded on Fourth avenue. In 1807 Fourth avenue was laid out as only 100 feet wide. In 1837 (Laws 1837, p. 291, c. 274, \u00a7 3) an act of the Legislature declared that Fourth avenue should be widened between Thirty-Fourth street and the Harlem river by adding thereto on each side 20 feet of land, so as to make the whole width of that part of the avenue 140 feet. In 1848, the year when the deed was dated, and in 1852, the year when the deed was executed, the widening had not yet been effected; and the question was whether the Fourth avenue mentioned in the deed was a street 100 feet or 140 feet in width. ' The court held that the law implied from the fact of bounding lands on a street or avenue not opened, but directed by law to be opened or laid out for that purpose, the grantor adopts the street or avenue as thus to be opened, and dedicates all within it to the public. Mr. Justice Edwards said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201cThe lots are bounded on the Fourth avenue without restriction or qualification, and it seems to me that the description used can admit of no other construction than that the avenue meant was the avenue as then laid out. The only Fourth avenue then existing, to which the description could apply, was an avenue of one hundred and forty feet width. There was at the time no Fourth avenue of one hundred feet width.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">At the time the parties to this controversy entered into the contract, the only Borden avenue was the Borden avenue laid down on the commissioners\u2019 map. This was 80 feet in width, and the plaintiff could carry out his agreement to convey to the defendant a lot 125 feet deep only by including within the conveyance 10 feet of land which was in the avenue. It is plain that the contract contemplated nothing of this kind, but that its true meaning was that the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>to be conveyed should be on the corner of the avenue, and not in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">I think that the defendant is entitled to judgment in accordance with the terms of the submission. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
