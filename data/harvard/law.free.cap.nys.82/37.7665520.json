Defendants should have been allowed a trial fee in addition to costs, and have had the statutory 20 days to answer, and the ease should have taken its regular place on the calendar.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b57-11\">Appeal from Special Term, New York County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-12\">Action by Louise Diebold against Anna Walter and Emilie Lampe.

By the amendment, which, in effect, states a new cause of action, the plaintiff is enabled to seek a recovery upon a different theory, based on facts not included in the .original complaint. The defendants having been obliged to prepare and attend one trial, we think that the most favorable view to the plaintiff, upon the facts, would be to require her, in addition to' the $io costs of motion, to pay a trial fee, and to allow the defendants 20 days in which to answer the amended complaint; the case, upon service of the answer, to take its regular place on the calendar, and not to be restored to the day calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In these respects, we think the order should be modified, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to 'the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
