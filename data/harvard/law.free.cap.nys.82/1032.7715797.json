With this state of facts before the court the complaint was dismissed, it being held that the allegations of the complaint for \u201cuse and occupa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>tion\u201d were controlling, and that the plaintiff should have declared upon an express contract of rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">It seems to us that the complaint, while open to criticism, fairly alleged that the rental was by the month. Under the liberal rule of pleading now recognized by the Code of Civil Procedure, it is not necessary to state a cause of action in the best possible form. It is enough if the intention of the pleader is expressed with sufficient clearness so that he fairly apprises the adverse party of the issues to be anticipated, and it cannot be said that the defendant was surprised or misled by this pleading. The matter has been in controversy between the parties from the start. The plaintiff has insisted that two months\u2019 rent was due, as would unquestionably be the case if the defendant rented by the month, and the defendant has contended that he was practically evicted from the premises by reason of the offensive cesspool upon the lot, and that he was liable only for the actual time which he occupied the premises. That was the issue between the parties, and the mere fact that the plaintiff alleges a use and occupation of the premises does not limit the scope of the action when taken in connection with the further allegations of the complaint. Clark v. Dillon, 97 N. Y. 370, we think does not conflict with this view. Of course, if the complaint merely alleged use and occupation, the plaintiff could not recover upon a specific contract of rental; but when the plaintiff adds to this language a specification covering the entire two months, and alleges that there was a monthly rent of $14 reserved, and that this amount was payable in advance, and that no part of the same has been paid, we think there is no ambiguity, although some degree of technical inconsistency, in the pleading. It is not difficult to understand that the plaintiff is seeking to recover for rentals due upon a contract, rather than for a technical use and occupation of the premises. It was shown upon the previous trial of this case that the plaintiff was seeking to avoid the payment, not upon the grounds now urged against the complaint, but upon the proposition that he was obliged to give up possession of the premises, which he had occupied continuously for a period of two years, owing to their unsanitary condition. Sherman v. Ludin, 79 App. Div. 37, 79 N. Y. Supp. 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Under the circumstances the defendant is not now in a position to urge this technical defect in the pleadings with any great show of good faith, and, while we cannot see our way clear to comply with the request of the plaintiff for a judgment absolute, we are clearly of opinion that the judgment dismissing the complaint should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
