Proc. \u00a7 460, provides that the court may permit plaintiff to prosecute in forma pauperis, and assign to him an attorney, who must act without compensation. <em>Held, </em>that an order permitting the prosecution of an action in forma pauperis which omits to provide that the attorney must act without compensation is defective.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1015-8\">S. Same\u2014Guardian Ad Litem.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1015-9\">Where, in an action by an infant, by her father, as guardian ad litem, he swore on his appointment that he was worth $250, and, on a motion by him for leave to sue in forma pauperis, it does not appear that his circumstances have changed, the motion should be denied.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1015-10\">Laughlin, J., dissenting.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1015-11\">Appeal from Special Term, New York County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1015-12\">Action by Rudy Sumkow, by Hyman Sumkow, her guardian^ ad litem, against Wolf Sheinker.

Daus v. Nussberger, 25 App. Div. 185, 49 N. Y. Supp. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-18\">There is another objection to the maintenance of this order. The guardian ad litem is the father of the infant plaintiff. When he was appointed he swore that he was worth the sum of $250. There is nothing in this record to show that his circumstances have changed since his appointment as guardian ad litem, and, such being the case,, the motion for leave to sue as a poor person should have been denied. Rutkowsky v. Cohen, 74 App. Div. 415, 77 N. Y. Supp. 546; Muller v. Bammann, 77 App. Div. 212, 78 N. Y. Supp. 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-19\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements,, and the motion for leave to sue in forma pauperis denied, with $10-costs, and the order requiring security for costs reinstated. All concur, except LAUGHLIN, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1015-20\">LAUGHLIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiTT\">I dissent upon the ground that the responsibility of the guardian ad litem does not affect the right of the infant to prosecute the action in forma pauperis. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 458, 459; Feier v. Third Ave. R. Co., 9 App. Div. 607, 41 N. Y. Supp. 821.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
