She also alleges that in consequence of darkness the open space could not be seen, and that it was through the negligence of the defendants that such space was left open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>and unguarded. Issue was joined in the action about the month of October, igoo. On May 8, 1903, the cause not having then been brought to trial, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, conceiving that the action was improperly entitled, and that the liability sought to be enforced was one existing against the United States Mortgage &amp; Trust Company, not in its representative capacity, but primarily, made this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">It would seem that, when the complaint was drawn, it was framed upon what was decided in Schwab v. Cleveland, as Trustee, 28 Hun, 458. It was subsequently held in Keating v. Stevenson, 21 App. Div. 604, 47 N. Y. Supp. 847, that trustees of an express trust in real estate, charged with the duty of keeping premises in repair, are, by virtue of the legal title vested in them, liable personally, at least in the first instance, and not in their representative capacity, for the failure to keep the premises in repair. It was to meet the ruling in the last-mentioned case that this application was made. It was also held in that case that the court at the trial had no power to allow an amendment of the complaint to change the action from one to enforce a liability as charged in the complaint to .a' liability in another and unpleaded relationship, and that furnishes another ground for moving for leave to amend before the cause was brought to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">That the court had the power to grant leave to amend, we think, follows from what was held in Hatch v. Central National Bank, 78 N. Y. 487; and we are of opinion that the facts presented to the court below in the case at bar should have induced it to exercise its discretion to grant, instead of to deny, the motion. No change is sought to be made of a defendant. The corporation is the same. The negligence complained of is attributed to it. No modification whatever of the facts constituting the cause of action is sought, and the complaint, in its entirety, will stand precisely as originally drawn. The amendment is to -correct a mistake in the designation merely of the defendant corporation. It was held in Tighe v. Pope, 16 Hun, 180, that an application to change an action brought against the defendant as administratrix to one brought against her personally is such a change as is authorized by section 723 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and in Munzinger v. Courier Co., 82 Hun, 574, 31 N. Y. Supp. 737, the action was originally brought against the \u201cCourier Company,\u201d and an amendment was allowed so as to change it to one against \u201cGeorge Bleistein, as President of the Courier Company.\u201d There being no question of the identity of the party, no change in the facts constituting the cause of action, and no deprivation of the right of the defendant to insist upon substantial defenses to the merits, there seems to be no good reason why, in furtherance of justice, the amendment should not have been allowed. Stuyvesant v. Weil, 167 N. Y. 421, 60 N. E. 738, 53 L. R. A. 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">The principal objection urged to granting the plaintiff\u2019s application, and that which seemed to prevail with the court below, is that by allowing the amendment the defense of the statute of limitations is cut off. In Quimby v. Claflin, 27 Hun, 611, it was held that a cause of action barred by the statute of limitations should not be allowed to be inserted as an amendment. That was a case in which the court refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>allow an entirely independent, separate, and additional cause of action, barred by the statute, to be inserted by way of amendment in the complaint. The Court of Appeals in that case dismissed an appeal from the General Term, but did not review its decision. It was held, however, in Hatch v. Central National Bank, supra, that a complaint might be amended, even after judgment, although the statute of limitations would apply to 'the claim as set up in the amended complaint, and that an amendment which would prevent the application of the defense of the statute of limitations is allowable. It was also so held in Truman v. Lester, 71 App. Div. 612, 75 N. Y. Supp. 548, citing Deane v. O\u2019Brien, 13 Abb. Prac. 11; Eighmie v. Taylor, 39 Hun, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">We think the order was erroneous, and that it should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and that the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the caption of the summons and complaint should be granted, without costs. All concur, except VAN BRUNT, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
