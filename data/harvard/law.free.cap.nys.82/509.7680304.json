We are of opinion, however, that there is a sufficient allegation of special damage in the statement that the plaintiffs\u2019 hotel property has become depreciated in value by reason of the publication. This is enough to sustain the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
