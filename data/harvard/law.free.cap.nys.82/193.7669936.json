Y. At that time it was dark. He continued working until between 2 and 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, when an accident occurred, and he sustained the injuries for which 'he seeks to recover. The method of unloading boats adopted by the defendant was to lower a bucket attached to the arm of a derrick operated by steam into the hold of the boat; when filled, raise it clear from the boat, and then swing it around a distance of about 60 feet to the ore pile, where the bucket was dumped by releasing a clamp at the bottom, and thus permitting the ore to drop out. The appliance for dumping the bucket consisted of about three feet of chain, which was hooked onto the bottom. At the other end of the chain there was a ring, into which was fastened by splicing a rope about 60 feet in length and three-fourths of an inch in thickness, which extended over the derrick, and was held in hand by the plaintiff, who stood upon the deck of the boat; and upon receiving a signal from a man at the dump it was his duty to pull the rope, which'would cause the ore to discharge from the bucket, which he did. The rope broke at the place where it was spliced or fastened into the ring of the chain, and he was thrown or twisted around in such manner as to be injured thereby. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant in performing the same duty as at the time of the accident continuously for three months immediately prior thereto, and for about two months in the previous year. During all that time the method of unloading boats and plaintiff\u2019s duty in respect thereto had been substantially the same. The rope which\" broke had been in use only one day prior to the accident. It was new; was kept in defendant\u2019s storeroom with a quantity or number of other ropes, which were furnished by the defendant to its employ\u00e9s for doing the work in question. It was purchased of a reliable dealer as a first-class rope, and a first-class price paid therefor. Defendant\u2019s foreman, who was in charge of the gang of men with which plaintiff worked, selected the rope, got it out of the storeroom, and furnished it to be used upon the derrick in question; and one of the men other than the plaintiff spliced it into the ring. This method of obtaining ropes, furnishing them to the men for use upon the several derricks, and attaching them had been in vogue during all the time the plaintiff was in defendant\u2019s employ. There is no suggestion that the rope was not of proper size, but it is urged that at the place where it broke it was. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>rotten or defective, and that such defect could have been discovered by the exercise of ordinary care and prudence, and that, therefore, because of the failure of the defendant to discover such defect, it is liable for.the injuries which the plaintiff sustained. It appears by the evidence that there was an ample supply of good and perfect ropes in defendant\u2019s storeroom from which to have selected one for the derrick in question. In fact, the rope which broke was again spliced into the ring, and used until worn out. There is some evidence tending to show that by looking at the rope where it parted its defective condition could have been discovered, and also that on account of the darkness when the plaintiff went to work he was not in a position to observe such defect. It, however, appears that the foreman who selected the rope was entirely competent; that he had handled ropes and been engaged in such work nearly all his life, and he did not observe any defect. He testified, and his evidence is uncontradicted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-3\">\u201cSome of them [the ropes] would give out almost every day. It was my business to see that they were kept straight, and if anything happened I would depend upon the men to tell me,, and they usually did tell me if anything was wrong.. I did not personally keep watch of each particular rope-all the time to see whether it was, right or not. That I left to the men, and. the men understood that. I never instructed them to that effect, but they always worked that way, and they often did come to me that way, and that was the way I depended on to- know whether they were in good shape or not,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">It is not claimed that the employe who spliced' the rope into the ring of the chain or any other of plaintiff\u2019s, co-employes were incompetent to perform their respective duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Upon, the. facts disclosed, by the evidence In this case, we, think the-plaintiff failed to establish actionable negligence on the part of the defendant. It is well settled that if a master furnishes his servants. with\u00a1 materials of suitable quality and in sufficient quantity to enable them, to safely do a particular piece of work,, he is not liable because of an accident which results from an improper selection or use of .such materials by such servants. Moore v. McNeil, 35 App. Div. 325, 54 N. Y. Supp. 956; McCone v. Gallagher, 16 App. Div. 272, 44 N, Y. Supp. 697; Yaw v. Whitmore, 46 App. Div., 422, <em>61 </em>N. Y. Supp. 731. The las.t case cited was an action brought by an employe against the master to recover damages for injuries which he sustained by the-falling of a derrick,, which- was caused by the. breaking of an iron cable intended to hold the derrick in. place. It. appeared in that case that all, or substantially all, the. cables furnished for that p.urp.o.se were-more or less defective and unsuitable for the purpose- intended, and the judgment entered upon the. verdict of the. jury in plaintiff\u2019s favor was. affirmed; but the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cHad new cables been furnished in sufficient quantity to- secure the derrick, and had the same been apparently perfect In their construction, the defendants, would probably- have done all that c.ould have been required of them; and if, under these conditions, an old and worn cable had been selected and used by whomsoever was charged with the duty of erecting the derrick, his negligence in making the selection would he that of a co-servant, and not of the master. Or if, under like conditions, one of the new cables- had broken, no liability would have attached to the master.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The language quoted is particularly applicable to the facts of the case at bar. New ropes, perfect, purchased from a reliable dealer as first class, and for first-class prices, were furnished by the defendant in this case in abundance. All that was necessary was for the foreman to go to the storeroom and get such as he might need in the progress of the work. If the end of the rope which broke was in such condition that the foreman who selected it and took it from the storeroom ought to have discovered that it was rotten or defective, and he was negligent in not doing so, it was the negligence of-a co-employ\u00e9, for which the master is not liable. It was not the duty of the defendant in this case to watch the ropes upon the several derricks, see that they were at all times in proper condition, determine when they should be changed and new ones supplied. It had the right to delegate that duty to a competent employe, and for the failure to perform that duty the master is not liable. Cregan v. Marston, 126 N. Y. 568, 27 N. E. 952, 22 Am. St. Rep. 854. The most that can be said, interpreting the evidence most favorably to the plaintiff, is that the very end of the rope in question\u2014that part which was spliced into the ring at the end of the chain\u2014was defective. The rest of the rope, as appears by the uncontradicted evidence, was sound, and all right, and was used 'until worn out. It would be extending the liability of a master further than has yet been done to hold that under such circumstances he is liable for an injury to an employ\u00e9 because he failed to discover that the very end of a 6o-foot rope, where it was spliced as in this case, was defective, and in such condition as to cause it to break.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and new trial granted, with costs tO' the appellant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Judgment and order reversed upon questions of law only, the facts having been examined, and no error found therein, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">ADAMS, P.

The plaintiff, a hatch tender, employed in unloading iron ore at the dock of the defendant, was injured by the breaking of a rope used in hoisting a bucket filled with ore. The rope was a new one, used for the first time the night of the accident, but was rotten at the place where it parted. The ropes were furnished by the defendant, and were delivered over to the men by Grotty, its foreman. To him was intrusted the duty of inspecting ropes. They were purchased from a reliable firm, including the one which broke. They were supplied to Grotty either in a coil to cut up into five or six ropes of the requisite length, or were already cut for him. It does not appear how many he had on hand when he procured the one for the use of the plaintiff, nor does it appear whether they were sound or defective. The accident happened in the night. The deck of the boat on which the plaintiff was working was dimly lighted, and there was no opportunity for him to inspect the rope. His conduct, whether blameless or otherwise, was submitted to the jury, and the evidence is ample to free him from want of care. The principles underlying this case, it seems to me, are elementary. The master is bound to fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>nish \u201cgood and suitable appliances\u201d for his workmen. Byrne v. Eastmans Co. of N. Y., 163 N. Y. 461, 465, 57 N. E. 738; Cone v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 81 N. Y. 206, 37 Am. Rep. 491. The care required to be bestowed upon the appliances furnished to his men implies a proper inspection and examination of them by the master. Byrne v. Eastmans Co. of N. Y., supra. This duty may not be delegated by the master, so as to exempt him from liability from its careless performance resulting in the injury. Benzing v. Steinway &amp; Sons, 101 N. Y. 547, 5 N. E. 449; Eastland v. Clarke, 165 N. Y. 420, 429, 59 N. E. 202. The subordinate who performs this work for the master is the alter ego of the latter, not a fellow workman with the other employ\u00e9s. Bailey v. R. W. &amp; O. R. R. Co., 139 N. Y. 302, 34 N. E. 918; Eaton v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 163 N. Y. 391, 395, 57 N. E. 609, 79 Am. St. Rep. 600. The assumption of risks incident to his employment by an employ\u00e9 only arises \u201cafter the master has discharged his duty of reasonable care to prevent them, or such as are quite as open and obvious to the servant as to the master.\u201d Eastland v. Clarke, 165 N. Y. 420, 427, 59 N. E. 202, and cases cited. There is a class of cases where the appliance becomes defective by use, and this fact is well known to the workman, and an inspection will disclose the wearing away to him as well as to any one, however skilled, and when the appliances are accessible to him to supply any which become defective, that the master may be relieved from liability for injuries to the employ\u00e9 caused by such an appliance. That rule, however, does not apply to an appliance defective when furnished, and which was not obvious to the workman. The cases cited in the prevailing opinion do not go to that extent. In Yaw v. Whitmore, 46 App. Div. 422, 61 N. Y. Supp. 731, cited in the prevailing opinion, a derrick used in hoisting stone in making repairs on the Erie Canal, and which remained stationary for five months, was held to be a permanent structure in contradistinction from a portable one. In the present case the appliance was a derrick connected with the dock in unloading iron ore, and remained fixed year by year. In the Yaw Case this court reasserted the principle that the duty is that of the master to furnish adequate machinery and appliances for his men to carry on the work, and, further, that an exception to this general rule exists where suitable appliances are furnished, but become \u201ctemporarily impaired, by reason of the constant use, when the impairment is of such a character to be easily and readily remedied by the servant, a part of whose duty it is to attend to such matters.\u201d Here the rope furnished by the defendant was defective when turned over to the plaintiff. It did not wear out by use, but the master was delinquent in providing an unsafe rope. Its rotten condition was not observable by the plaintiff, for he was carrying on the work at night, with only a lantern for a light, and the defendant employed a foreman to supply the ropes to the men, and that official was supposed to inspect them before handing them out, and a reasonable inspection by him would have discovered this defect. It was not the plaintiff\u2019s duty to inspect new ropes, but that was Crotty\u2019s work. The plaintiff could not make an inspection in the dark of a rope 80 feet long. In the scaffolding cases, which are numerous, the employ\u00e9 usually was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>gaged with other workmen in erecting a scaffold, and with an opportunity to inspect the lumber used, and an abundance of the proper material was at hand. They have no application to a case like the one under consideration. In Oregan v. Marston, 126 N. Y. 568, 27 N. E. 952, 22 Am. St. Rep. 854, the rope, originally sound, became frayed \u2022and unsafe by use, and its condition was visible to the workmen. '\u201cThe rope was swinging before their eyes, and would disclose its approaching weakness on the surface before it became rotten or pulpy 'within, and they were able to know how long it had been used, and so whether prudence required it to be changed.\u201d Page 571, 126 N. Y., page 952, 27 N. E., 22 Am. St. Rep. 854. The court comments on Daley v. Boston <em>&amp; </em>Albany R. R. Co., 147 Mass. 101, 16 N. E. 690, saying, \u201cAnd that case shows clearly the distinctions between the original defect in the rope provided and one occurring from its use.\u201d None of these cases, as I understand them, trench upon the general rule that the duty is primarily upon the master to furnish reasonably safe appliances for his workmen. This duty cannot be delegated, and, while it is competent proof tending to show a compliance with this obligation that he purchased of a reliable firm the appliance claimed to be defective, yet that fact is only a circumstance, and is not by any means conclusive. If he were to be relieved in that way, the duties of inspection would be destroyed, and the underlying principle that the master\u2019s obligation is insistently with him in the first instance would be rendered nugatory, and no liability would attach, however defective the materials might be. The identical rope which caused the injury was furnished at the supply store of the defendant, and whether Grotty made a proper inspection or not was properly submitted to the jury, although his examination was only cursory.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">HISCOCK, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
