The idea of issuing an attachment for $75,000 on a $250 undertaking seems, upon its face, to be abolishing the giving of security .upon the issuance of such summary processes. We think that, as a condition of maintaining the attachment for $50,000, an undertaking in $2,500 should be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-19\">Upon the other points raised upon this appeal, we think that the court acquired jurisdiction, and we see no reason for interfering with its action in issuing the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-20\">The order should be modified as before suggested, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
