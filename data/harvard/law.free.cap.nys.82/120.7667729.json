The goods were insured in four different' companies to the extent of $500 in each. The defendant\u2019s policy of insurance provided that this amount should be paid for loss of furniture and fixtures of the plaintiff \u201cwhile stored on the grade floor of * * * No. 154 Bank street.\u201d During the negotiations for settlement, this clause was apparently lost sight of, and the plaintiff expected to receive and the defendant to pay for loss on all the goods stored in the building, the value of which was considerably above $2,000. An offer of settlement was made of $1,500, and rejected. During these negotiations the defendant requested the plaintiff to give a written statement of the articles on the grade floor, with the result that Mr. Fischer, the owner of the storage place, signed for the plaintiff a letter, dated February 4, 1902, duly sworn to, stating: \u201cThe following goods or fixtures were on the ground floor January 1st, 1902, just before the Are. One large ice box, one large cigar case round corner in shape of an L. All other goods or fixtures were upstairs.\u201d Upon the trial the plaintiff testified that he had written this letter for Mr. Fischer to sign, and at the time thought it was true, but he remembered since seeing part of the onyx of the soda-water fountain lying around the ground floor after the fire. His testimony is: \u201cI saw pieces of onyx lying around that belonged to the soda-water fountain; also a refrigerator\u2014part of the refrigerator and part of the L-shaped cigar case. The cost value of the soda fountain was $1,800\u2014a trifle more. * * * It being secondhand, it was in the neighborhood\u2014 Well, I should judge, $1,000\u2014$900, say. It was about a year and a half old. I saw part of the soda-water fountain on the grade floor, lying all over. I did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>see any part, except on the grade floor. It was worthless. * * * The refrigerator was worth before the fire $150. The cigar case was worth in the neighborhood of $200; * * * between $200 and $250. The actual cost of the cigar case was about $600.\u201d He further testified that the condition of the ceiling above the grade floor was such that nothing could have fallen through, as it was intact, and' he walked over it. The fire insurance broker employed by plaintiff testified that he examined the premises after the loss, and was pointed out the show case, part of the soda fountain, and some other fixtures \u2014he could not tell what; that \u201cthey looked like fixtures on the ground floor. * * * We walked around, and Mr. Hockey showed * \u00bb * five or six parts of fixtures, parts of the soda-water fountain, and a few tilings downstairs, and a lot of marble for the soda fountain on the ground floor. That is all we saw on the grade floor. I should think there was every bit of $2,000 worth on the ground floor.\u201d For the defendant, an appraiser testified that there were two show cases on the ground floor, and that the soda-water fountain was in between the second and third floors, and had fallen down from the fourth floor. The court said: \u201cI am going to charge this jury that they are entitled to one-quarter of the loss. * * * It will go to the jury on the single question of fact as to the value of the goods on the ground floor.\u201d The jury returned a verdict for $500, with interest, and from the judgment so entered the defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b141-6\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

His testimony as to the fountain being on the ground floor was corroborated by others, and, although the defendant\u2019s evidence is to the effect that it was between the second and third floors, this but presented a question of fact for the jury. As to the value of the goods on the ground floor, including the fountain, the actual values named by the plaintiff, taking the highest figures given by him, aggregate $1,400\u2014the fountain being put at $1,000, the refrigerator at $150, and the cigar case $250; and, although the cost price he places at over $2,000, his testimony giving the actual value at the time of the fire of the goods on the ground floor which were destroyed is controlling upon the amount to be recovered. For one-fourth of that sum the defendant' would, under the charge of the court, be liable, which would warrant a verdict for no more than $350, instead of $500. We have not overlooked the insurance broker\u2019s statement that he considered the value of the goods on the grade floor as all of $2,000, but the facts upon which this conclusion was based are not set forth, beyond his testimony that he had known of the plaintiff\u2019s goods before they were placed in storage; nor does it appear whether by this sum he meant the cost or the actual value.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">We think, therefore, that, if the plaintiff will stipulate to reduce the judgment as entered to the sum of $486.49, the judgment, as so modi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>fied, and the order appealed from, should be affirmed, without costs, and, if not, that the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b6\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b140-14\"> 1. See Insurance, vol. 28, Cent. Dig. \u00a7 1359.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
