The item on the credit side was $10,214.61, leaving a balance of $96,384.29, or a little less than the amount mentioned in the complaint. The defendant thereafter moved for a further bill of particulars, and his motion was denied. We think the account served was plainly sufficient, within the meaning of section 531 of the Code, and that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
