At the time the money was deposited a receipt was given, in which it is stated that Harry Rothschild, \u201cfor the defendant above named, has deposited with the chamberlain of the city of New York, this day, the amount of $5,000 * * * as security for said defendant\u2019s appearance * * * pursuant to section 985 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\u201d On the 6th day of January, 1903, the indictments against Schwartz were dismissed on motion of the district attorney. On the 2d of February, 1903, an order was made by one of the justices of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace of the County of New York, directing that, by \u2022the consent of the district attorney, the \u201ccounty treasurer\u201d of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>York refund the money, deposited as aforesaid, to the defendant. Upon this order being presented to the chamberlain, he declined to pay the money, for the reason that he had been enjoined by orders of justices of the Supreme Court\u2014one made in June, 1902, and the other in August, 1902\u2014from transferring or making any disposition of any property belonging to Moses Schwartz. These restraints were contained in orders for- the examination of the chamberlain in supplementary proceedings brought by judgment creditors of Schwartz. The only reason ascribed by the chamberlain for not paying the money is the restraint contained in those orders. On the chamberlain\u2019s refusal to pay, the relator made application for a peremptory writ of mandamus, stating in his moving papers that the $5,000 was his money; that he had deposited it in lieu of bail; and also showing, by an affidavit of Schwartz, that the money belonged to the relator, and not to him, Schwartz. A demand had been duly made on the chamberlain for the money, and an affidavit of Schwartz, setting forth the facts, and containing a request that the $5,000 be paid over to Rothschild, was presented to the chamberlain before application for a writ was made. The application has been denied by the court below, and the relator appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In People ex rel. Meyer v. Gould, 75 App. Div. 524, 78 N. Y. Supp. 279, we held that where money is deposited, pursuant to section 586 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, by a third party, in lieu of bail for one under indictment, and as security for the appearance of the person so indicted, that money is presumed to be the property of the defendant in the indictment, only for the purposes of that particular proceeding; and where the person so indicted executes an instrument admitting that the money so deposited does not belong to him, but to a third person who deposited it, and directing that the money be paid to such third person, a judgment creditor of the defendant in the indictment has no interest in the money. That, however, was a proceeding brought by a creditor in which no question involving the real ownership of the money could have been litigated. It was shown that the money actually belonged to the third party who deposited it, and the fact was not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The case just adverted to is not controlling in this proceeding. Here the chamberlain was enjoined from paying out the money by orders which recite that it appeared to the satisfaction of the justices who issued them that the chamberlain had in his possession personal property of the defendant, exceeding $10 in value. The order of the Court of General Sessions directed the chamberlain to pay the money to the defendant. The injunctions arrested the money in the hands of the chamberlain, and so long as they are operative that officer should not be compelled to incur the peril of determining for himself to whom payment should be made. As remarked by the court below: \u201cWhile the orders stand, there remains a question of fact as to the right of these creditors to reach the fund, and they a're entitled to be heard, but they are not now before the court.\u201d In People ex rel. Meyer v. Gould, supra, the creditor was before the court, and it was admitted that the money belonged to the third party who had deposited it. But it may be said that the injunctions were not opera-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>live in this case because the orders for the examination of the chamberlain in supplementary proceedings were spent. Upon an examination of those orders as they are printed in the record, we find that as to both of them the examinations were adjourned to a time thereafter to be fixed, and it may be urged that that was tantamount to an abandonment of the proceedings. Whatever difference of opinion there may have been at one time respecting the effect of such an indefinite adjournment of the proceeding, it is now provided by section 2454 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which relates to proceedings of this character, that the discontinuance must be made by order of a judge. It does not fall of its own weight for neglect to prosecute it. Riddle &amp; Bullard on Supplementary Proceedings, p. 172 et seq. Bradner\u2019s Practice in Supplementary Proceedings, p. 119. These injunction orders are still -effective, and the chamberlain should not be required to pay over this money until the restraint now imposed upon him is removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">HATCH and LAUGHLIN, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b6\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b578-18\"> 2.

The fact is not disputed but what the $5,000 held by the chamberlain, of the city of New York belongs to the appellant, Rothschild. It was deposited by him with the chamberlain in lieu of bail for one Schwartz. These facts appear not only from the affidavits of Rothschild and Schwartz, but also from the receipt which the chamberlain gave when the money was deposited. But it is said that the application was properly denied because the chamberlain was enjoined by orders of the court from paying the money to Rothschild. The orders referred to were grant- , ed in proceedings supplementary to execution, instituted upon judgments against Schwartz, and the chamberlain was restrained by such orders from transferring or \u201cmaking any other disposition of any property belonging to said Moses Schwartz.\u201d But this money does not belong to Schwartz, and- cannot be reached by his creditors. People ex rel. Meyer v. Gould, 75 App. Div. 524, 78 N. Y. Supp. 279. It belongs to Rothschild, and Schwartz has no interest in it, the indictments under which he was admitted to bail, and in lieu of which the money was deposited, having been dismissed. Such orders, therefore, do not apply to the acts of the chamberlain with reference to this money, and, if they did, they are now quite ineffectual to prevent the chamberlain paying the money, inasmuch as it appears they have been abandoned. One of these orders was granted on the'3d, and made returnable on the 5th, of June, 1902. It does not appear that the proceeding was ever adjourned, or that anything was done thereafter. It is true there appears upon the order the following statement: \u201cThis examination is further adjourned to a time to be hereafter fixed. January 20, 1903.\u201d But the statement is. not signed by any one. It does not appear when or by whom it was made, and, manifestly, is quite insufficient to show an adjournment or that the proceeding has been kept alive. The other order was granted on the 8th of August, 1902, and appears to have been adjourned until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>November 15, 1902, but it does not seem to have been thereafter adjourned. There appears upon this order the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-3\">\u201cN. Y., 9/8/02.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">\u201cAdjourned to December 15, /02. E. H.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">\u201c \u201c \u201c January 16, /03. J. P.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201c \u201c \u201c \u201c 20,/03. J.J. P.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cAdjourned to a time to be hereafter fixed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">\u201cAffidavit of service \u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Who E. H. is, or whether he had any power to adjourn, nowhere appears, and the same is equally true of J. F. and J. J. F.; and what purports to have been the final adjournment does not seem to have been signed by any one. In addition to this, an adjournment to a time to be \u201chereafter fixed\u201d is, as it seetris to me, an abandonment of the original proceeding. Squire v. Young, 1 Bosw. 690; Wright v. Nostrand, 47 N. Y. Super. Ct. 454; Thomas v. Kircher, 15 Abb. Prac. (N. S.) 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">It was not necessary that an order be obtained under section 2454 of the Code of Civil Procedure to terminate the proceeding, in so far as it restrains the chamberlain. A termination in this respect can be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff has neglected to proceed under the order within a reasonable time, o\u2019r has failed to have the proceeding adjourned from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">I think the order appealed from should be reversed, and a mandamus granted directing the chamberlain to pay the money which he holds to Rothschild.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">INGRAHAM, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
