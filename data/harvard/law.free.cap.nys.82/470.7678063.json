I think that this is sufficient allegation of \u201cthe interest of the petitioner, or the person whom he represents,\u201d and statement of \u201cthe facts which, according to the provisions of this title, authorize the application of the petitioner and the removal of the person in possession,\u201d as required by section 2235 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The defendant raises a jurisdictional question, based upon the alleged disability of the executor and trustee to rent the premises. The defendant does not deny, but asserts, the relation of landlord and tenant, and it is clear, even upon his testimony, that he knew at the time of the renting that the agent represented an executor. Therefore I think that he is estopped from denial of the title of his landlord. People ex rel. Ward v. Kelsey, 38 Barb. 269; Tilyou v. Reynolds, 108 N. Y. 558, 15 N. E. 534; Mayor, etc., of N. Y. v. Sonneborn, 113 N. Y. 423, 21 N. E. 121; Woodfall, Landlord &amp; Tenant (Am. Ed.) 214. The question as to the term was sharply contested, but I think that there is no warrant for disturbing the finding of fact in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All\" concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
