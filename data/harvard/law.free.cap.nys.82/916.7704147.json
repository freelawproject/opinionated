The court also granted its certificate that the sum of $90 was reasonable compensation for personal and incidental expenses of counsel. The relators presented the order and the certificate to the comptroller of the city of New York, and demanded payment thereof. The comptroller paid the allowance of $500 as compensation, but refused to pay the allowance of $90 for personal and incidental expenses. Upon such refusal the relators made application for a writ of mandamus, which was granted, and from the order entered thereon, granting the same, the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">The bill for incidental services and expenses is set out in the petition, and made a part thereof. It appears therefrom that services were performed by one Charles Simon, an attorney and counselor at law, under employment by the relators to investigate and confer with various persons, who are referred to in detail in the account, and take their statements concerning the transaction, the subject of investigation upon the trial. From the bill it appears that, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>specified dates for each specified act, Simon made a uniform charge of $5. There are 18 items in all, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $90. Each item is for conference with persons therein named, taking statements, etc., except one, which is a charge for preparing a diagram of the premises where the alleged crime was committed. The charge for this item is the same as for the others. This service constitutes the incidental expense incurred by the relators, and for which the judge has granted his certificate. It is evident from the bill that Simon was employed to look up witnesses and see to the marshaling of evidence for use upon the trial. A case is therefore presented where lawyers assigned to the defense have employed another lawyer to aid them in gathering testimony for use upon the trial, and it is sought to bring this service within the meaning of \u201cpersonal and incidental expenses,\u201d provided for in section 308 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is evident that such expenses are not within the Code provisions. This question was authoritatively determined in Cantwell v. Coler, 61 App. Div. 598, 70 N. Y. Supp. 755, affirmed on appeal on the opinion below in 168 N. Y. 643, 61 N. E. 1132. Therein the application was for a writ of mandamus requiring the comptroller to allow counsel compensation for expert witnesses as to-handwriting, who were sworn upon the trial of an indictment charging murder in the first degree. The court below having granted a mandamus directing the payment of the expenses so incurred, this court, in reversing that order, through Mr. Justice Patterson, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-5\">\u201cThe relators seek to sustain the allowance for witness charges upon the ground that they are incidental expenses.\" They were undoubtedly expenses-of a trial, such as would ordinarily be borne by a party to an action. The personal and incidental expenses for the payment of which provision is made are such as relate to those incurred by counsel on his personal account. The word \u2018incidental,\u2019 as used in the statute, is associated with the word \u2018personal,\u2019 and is used conjunctively. It does not confer authority upon the counsel to make contracts of a special character, involving a large liability to be cast upon the county, for by the section of the Code cited the compensation and the personal and incidental expenses of counsel are made a county charge. The word \u2018incidental,\u2019 as used in the statute, must be construed in accordance with its ordinary meaning, which is: \u2018Of minor importance, occasional, casual, as incidental expenses\u2019; \u2018something subordinate or casual; often used in the plural to mean minor expenses \u2019 (Cent. Diet.). We cannot construe this section of the Code as so enlarging the meaning of the word \u2018incidental\u2019 as to give authority for the allowance as a county charge of such items of expenditures as those now claimed by the relators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">This language is decisive of the present case, and condemns the allowance which has been made. The employment of additional counsel for the purpose of investigating witnesses is not within the meaning of the words \u201cincidental and personal expenses,\u201d as used in the Code. It may be that the relators were necessarily obliged, in the proper conduct of the case, to employ an attorney to consult with persons, in order to learn whether their knowledge would be beneficial to the prisoner upon the trial. So, also, it was essential and necessary for the counsel in the case which we have cited to obtain the attendance of expert witnesses, which he could only procure by making compensation, yet the court held such expense was not embraced within the Code provisions, and could not be allowed. These ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>penses fall in the same category, and therefore the result must be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $io costs and disbursements, and the application dismissed. All concur, except LAUGHLIN, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
