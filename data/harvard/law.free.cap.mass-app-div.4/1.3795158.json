J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AgU\">This is a petition to establish a report in the above entitled action, which was heard by this court sitting <em>in banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b9-13\">The draft report was duly presented to the trial judge who, upon hearing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss said petition, made the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b9-14\">\u201cDismissed (Debtor\u2019s motion to dismiss is considered as a request for ruling of law and as such is GIVEN),*\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b9-15\">and further decided that the Appellate Division has no jurisdiction to review the case. This decision raises. at once the issue of jurisdiction of the Appellate Division over this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-16\">The claim for a report could not be dismissed upon this ground, as otherwise the decision of the trial judge would be final on a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-17\">The petitioner seems to come within the requirements of Rule XXX of the Rules of the District Courts which provides that \u201cWhenever a claim of reports shall be disal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>lowed by a Justice as not conformable to the facts, or for any other cause, * * * the party seeking the same may * * * file with the clerk his petition verified by affidavit setting forth in full his claim for such report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AY_\">All of these preliminary steps have been taken by the petitioner and the trial judge disallowed the claim for a report because of want of jurisdiction in the Appellate Division to review the case. This action, we think, was wrong. <em>Patterson vs. Ciborowski, </em>277 Mass. 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-4\">The trial judge in his disposition of the report fairly states why he disallows the report, but he fails to state, as required by <em>Patterson vs. Ciborowski, </em>277 Mass. 260, \u201cin brief and unmistak\u00e1ble terms the grounds upon which his action is based. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b10-5\">The trial judge does state that he disallows the claim for a report because of lack of jurisdiction, but how he comes to such a conclusion is left in the clouds. He gives no reason for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-6\">In fact, to disallow a report a judge must disallow it because not conformable to the facts or for some other good cause, and the correct procedure for a trial judge to follow is laid down in <em>Patterson vs. Ciborowski, </em>277 Mass. 260; <em>Wilson vs. Checker Taxi Co., </em>263 Mass. 425; <em>Sacks vs. McKane, </em>281 Mass. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-7\">The case of <em>Winer vs. Sharf, </em>1938 \u2014 3 A. D. R. 42, has no application to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-8\">Inasmuch, therefore, as the form of report stated in and annexed to the petition properly raises a question of law, we fail to see any reason against the allowance and establishment of the report and we, therefore, allow it in form as annexed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
