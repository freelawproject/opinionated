The trial judge found for the plaintiff. The defendant claims to be aggrieved by the denial of his motion for \u00e1 directed finding for the defendant, \u201cbecause the automobile of the plaintiff was not properly registered in the name of the owner as is required by Gen. Laws c. 90 \u00a72 and therefore was a trespasser on the highway at the time of the alleged accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The automobile was owned by the plaintiff and was registered by her in the name of \u201cMary Baposa, Williams Street, Dighton, Massachusetts.\u201d The plaintiff testified that her name was Mary Baposa Boderiek and that in her community she was known by both names, Mary Baposa Boderiek and Mary Baposa. Four other witnesses corroborated the testimony of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Subsequent to the date when this ease was argued before us, <em>Bridges v. Hart, </em>1939 Mass. Adv. Sh. 171, containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>an extensive review of the cases, has appeared in the Advance Sheets. From what is said in that case we are of the opinion that the trial judge in the case at bar could have found that the plaintiff\u2019s automobile was legally registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">At the close of the evidence the plaintiff filed a motion to amend the pleadings by adding after the name Mary Raposa Roderick, the words, \u201cotherwise known as Mary Raposa.\u201d The motion was allowed by the trial judge and the defendant claims to be aggrieved thereby. There was no error in the allowance of this motion. Gren. Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 231 \u00a7\u00a751, 138. Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
