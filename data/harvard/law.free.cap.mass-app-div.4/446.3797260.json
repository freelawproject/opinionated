J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Axc\">This is an action of contract to recover damages under an implied warranty, incurred by reason of eating a fried clam dinner, consisting of clam chowder, fried clams, french fried potatoes, rolls, butter, coffee and dessert. The defendant\u2019s answers were a general denial and contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-22\">The trial judge found that the fried clams were unfit for consumption, contrary to an implied warranty that they were fit for consumption, that there was no waiver of the breach of warranty; but that the notices given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>plaintiffs or in their behalf, to the defendant, were not legally sufficient, in that they did not set forth a breach of said warranty with sufficiency, although there was a failure on the part of the judge to state in what particulars the notices given to the defendant were lacking. It is, therefore, necessary for us to examine the notices given by the plaintiffs to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\">The notice is contained in three letters written to the defendant by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney. These letters are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">\u201cAugust 1,1938.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">Manager</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">Stromberg\u2019s Restaurant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcFJ\">2 Bridge Street,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">Salem, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">Dear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">This is to advise you that I have been retained to represent Mr. &amp; Mrs. John L\u2019ltalien of 34 Jap\u00f3nica Street in Salem and Mrs. and Mr. Alphe Morin of 4 Horthey Street in Salem, in their claims for damages sustained by them as a result of your negligence in serving food, namely</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">3 clam dinners (fifty cent special)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">1 fish dinner (fillet of flounder fifty cent special) which was unfit for human consumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">This food was eaten on Saturday, July 23, 1938 between 11 and 12 P. M. at Stromberg\u2019s large restaurant <em>on #2 </em>Bridge Street in Salem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">I suggest that you communicate with me at your earliest convenience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-14\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-15\">SG- LG SAUL, GORDON\u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-16\">\u201cAugust 10,1938</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-17\">Manager</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-18\">Stromberg\u2019s Restaurant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdV\">2 Bridge Street</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAsM\">Salem, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-19\">Dear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-20\">As you will recall, on August 1, 1938, I wrote you advising that I have been retained to represent Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>and Mrs. John L\u2019Italian and Mr. and Mrs. Alphe Morin in their claim for injuries resulting from four dinners which were served them at your restaurant on Saturday, July 23, 1938, between 11 and 12 P.

L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 106, sec. 38, and such notice is a condition precedent to the maintenance of any action; <em>Idzykowski vs. Jordan Marsh Co., 279 </em>Mass. 163, and no particular form of notice is required, so long as it is sufficient. <em>Johnson vs. Kanavos, </em>1937 A. S. 193. <em>Guthire vs. Newberry Co., </em>1937 A. S. 649: Such a notice may be given by an attorney for the plaintiffs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Jamrog vs. Handy, </em>284 Mass. 195, and such notice, given to a servant or agent, may be a constructive notice to a defendant; <em>Jamrog vs. Handy, </em>284 Mass. 195, and, if otherwise sufficient, may be given jointly on behalf of several claimants, as in the case at bar. <em>Johnson vs. Kanavos, </em>1937 A. S. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">But a notice as to defects which amounts only to a complaint is insufficient. <em>Country Club Soda Co. vs. Arbuckle, </em>279 Mass. 121, because such a notice must be in such form as to show an intention to assert a legal right arising from a breach of warranty. <em>Idzykowski vs. Jordan Marsh Co., </em>279 Mass. 163. It also \u201cmust refer to particular sales, must fully advise the seller of the alleged defect and specify with reasonable particularity in what the breach consists.\u201d <em>Jamrog vs. Handy, </em>284 Mass. 195-198.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">In the case at bar, from the aforesaid letters, it fairly appears that these plaintiffs purchased of the defendant and ate, among other food, certain fried clams, which made them sick; and, that they fairly advised the defendant that they ate unfit food served by the defendant and named the food.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In the case last quoted, the defendant claimed that the notice given was insufficient. It stated, however, that the food in question was \u201coff condition\u201d, which it was said could \u201crightly have been found to have given the defendant reasonable notice\u201d that the food in question was not fit for consumption. <em>Jamrog vs. Handy, supra, </em>284 Mass. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">While the letters, above quoted, in no words state that the notice is given as a prerequisite to the bringing of an action, they fairly state a claim for a breach of duty owed by defendant to the plaintiffs, and speak of a claim for damages ; state that the food was unfit for consumption; that the plaintiffs, in whose behalf the notices were given, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>made sick from eating this food bought of the defendant, stating the time it was bought and ending by suggesting a communication with the writer, who states that he has been engaged to represent the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\">The first letter, quoted above, was followed later by a second and third letter. These letters and their contents, we think, furnished sufficient notice and information to the defendant that the buyers were \u201casserting\u201d a \u201cviolation\u201d of their legal rights. <em>Jamrog vs. Handy, </em>284 Mass. 195. It was not necessary to assert in the notice the cause of the unfitness of the food in question. <em>Guthire vs. Newberry Co., </em>1937 A. S. 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Neither do we think because the first letter from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated that their claim for damages sustained by them as a result of \u201cyour negligence\u201d in serving food, necessarily restricted the plaintiff to an action in tort for damages because the notice without these words is a sufficient notice to the defendant, of the actual defective condition of the food relied upon as a basis for these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The letter is otherwise a good notice and is to be so treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">As the trial judge, in the cases of these three plaintiffs, found all the elements necessary to the plaintiffs\u2019 eases, excepting in regard to the contents of the notices, it is unnecessary to discuss these cases further.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Coming to the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for rulings, we do not think there was any error in the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 request 1,</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\"><em>\u201c1. </em>When, under the same conditions, several persons who have eaten the same food become similarly ill, an inference is warranted that the food which all had eaten was unwholesome and was the cause of their illness. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">because the evidence failed to show that all these plaintiffs had eaten the same food and it, therefore, was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>John L\u2019Italien vs. Harriet E. Stromberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-2\">For reasons given above, we think the court should have given plaintiffs\u2019 third and sixth requests, which were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-3\"><em>\u201c3. </em>The written notice here given on behalf of the plaintiff definitely indicated that he was asserting legal rights against the defendant. It referred to particular sales, identified by the fact that they were all made at the same time. It advised the defendant of an alleged defect in the food and specified the breach of warranty relied upon with as much particularity as reasonably could be expected in the case of a sale of food for immediate consumption and complied with the requirements of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\"><em>116. </em>Evidence that the plaintiff fell ill after eating food supplied by the defendant, which tasted bad, is sufficient to warrant an inference that the food was unwholesome and warrant recovery in an action on implied warranty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">It is ordered that a new trial be had to settle only the plaintiffs\u2019 damages.</p>\n<author id=\"b461-9\">Jones, P. <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AbD\">This case is before this Division with three other cases, which although argued in common with this one, are disposed of under the preceding cases of <em>Alphe Morin et als. vs. Harriet E. Stromberg, </em>beginning at page 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The facts in this case are not quite the same as in the cases last mentioned. This, like the three cases referred to, is an action of contract to recover alleged damag\u2019es caused by the eating of certain food bought by the plaintiff, excepting in one particular, viz:\u2014 The notice in this case stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>food eaten by this plaintiff was a food known as \u201cfillet of flounder\u201d, whereas the food actually purchased and eaten was \u201cflounder flakes\u201d. No evidence was introduced showing that \u2018 \u2018 flounder flakes \u2019 \u2019 is the same as <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>fillet of flounder \u2019 \\ The notice failed fully to advise the seller of the alleged defect in the food and specify with reasonable particularity in what the breach consists, <em>Jamrog vs. Handy, </em>284 Mass., 195-198.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\">Advising the seller of injury from the sale and eating of one kind of food and proving the eating of another kind of food is far from the proof required.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Hence, with a reference to the opinion in the preceding cases of <em>Alphe Morin et als. v. Harriet E. Stromberg, </em>above referred to, which, so far. as applicable, is made a part of this, and deciding that no error was committed by the trial judge, we direct the report dismissed so far as applicable to this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
