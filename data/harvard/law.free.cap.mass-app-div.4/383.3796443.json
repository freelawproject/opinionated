In that case .the plaintiff ..lived in Watertown in this Commonwealth. The dog was killed by the defendant\u2019s motor car on a public highway in Maine. The dog was not licensed either in Maine or in this Commonwealth. Pierce, J., writing the opinion, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJb\">\u201cThe general rule supported by the weighty of authority is that an owner of a dog licensed or unlicensed may maintain an action for damages against any per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>son or corporation wilfully or negligently killing or injuring the animal ... We are of opinion the general rule should be followed as one sound in principle. The unlicensed dog was not a trespasser and outlaw upon the public highway. The case in this respect is governed by <em>Carrington vs. Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>222 Mass. 119.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">The decision in <em>Baer vs. Tyler, </em>261 Mass. 138 follows the rule thus laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">There was no prejudicial error in the refusals to rule by the Trial Court. There was evidence to justify the finding that the defendant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In the report as presented to us there is a failure to follow the form set forth in the Rules of the District Courts. On a page following the signature of the Special Justice who heard the case, which signature in effect established the report, there is a reference to certain evidence in the form of questions put to the plaintiff and to a witness by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, which questions were objected to but allowed by the Trial Court. The defendant has no standing before us as to this matter of testimony as the report does not present the questions involved to this tribunal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
