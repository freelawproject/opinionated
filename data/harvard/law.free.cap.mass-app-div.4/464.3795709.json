Western District District Court of Springfield</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b474-4\">Argued September 26, 1939</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Arq9\">Opinion filed October 20, 1939.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Aive\">Present: Hibbard, <em>P. J., </em>Riley &amp; Robbins, <em>JJ.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-8\"><em>M. E. Richmond, </em>for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-9\"><em>L. J.

If the court finds that the plaintiff was a tenant of the defendants and that prior to the date of the accident she agreed with the defendants that her tenancy was terminated and that she was in arrears with her rent, then she was no longer a tenant-at-will but a tenant-at-sufferance at the time of the accident alleged in her declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201c2. A tenancy may be terminated at any time and in any manner which may be mutually agreed upon by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201c3. The defendants owed the plaintiff only the duty not to wilfully nor wantonly injure or cause injury to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201c4. The defendants are not liable in tort for the injuries allegedly sustained by the plaintiff, even though the court finds there was an omission to make any repairs or changes in the stairway of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\">\u201c5. Upon the law and all the evidence, a finding should be made for the defendants because the plaintiff\u2019s writ and declaration is not sufficient and proper as a matter of law so as to allow the plaintiff to maintain her action and to recover thereunder. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The court disposed of the defendants\u2019 requests for rulings as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u201cBequest #1 was denied as being based upon an assumption of fact not found by the court; request #2 was granted; request <em>#2&gt; </em>was denied as inapplicable to the facts found by the court; requests <em>#\u00e1 </em>and 5 were denied on the grounds that the court found to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The defendants claimed to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s refusal to rule as requested, and they filed a brief in support of their contentions. The plaintiff filed no brief and neither side argued the appeal, which was submitted on the defendants \u2019 brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Requests numbered 1 and 3 were denied by the court because as it said \u201cthey were based upon an assumption of fact not found by the court\u201d or were \u201cinapplicable to the facts found by the court.\u201d The evidence set forth in the report which relates to this matter is that the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she was in arrears in her rent at the time of the accident and for some time prior thereto, and that she had \u25a0 agreed with the defendants to move from the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Regardless of the finding of fact, the defendants argued that by law this conversation turned the plaintiff\u2019s tenancy from one at will into one at sufferance. We do not think that the plaintiff\u2019s agreement to move from the premises at some indefinite time in the future can be construed as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>termination of the tenancy at will. It may be that the agreement is good evidence of a waiver of the required notice to quit, but this, in itself, would not constitute the tenancy one of sufferance. In fact, a tenancy at sufferance cannot be created by agreement. <em>Johnson v. Carter, </em>16 Mass. 443, 446. <em>Benton v. Williams, </em>202 Mass. 189, 192. 35 Corpus Juris 1135, Section 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">The defendants cited certain cases in which the alleged negligence was in failure to repair some part of the leased premises. These cases, however, are not applicable to the case at bar, where the negligence was in the maintenance of a common passway.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The defendants\u2019 only other contention is that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy is in contract rather than in tort, and it is sufficient to say that this contention is not sound. <em>Rodde v. Nolan, </em>281 Mass. 493, 497, <em>Oles v. Dubinsky, </em>231 Mass. 447, <em>Looney v. McLean, </em>129 Mass. 33, <em>Flanagan v. Welch, </em>220 Mass. 186, 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The report is to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
