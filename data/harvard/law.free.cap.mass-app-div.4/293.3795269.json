No written findings of facts were made. The plaintiff filed five requests for rulings of which the first, third and fifth were denied. The case was submitted on briefs. The plaintiff, in his brief, argues that there was prejudicial error in the denial of this first request, and possibly of the third and fifth.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The first request is that \u201cthere is sufficient evidence to warrant and support a finding for the plaintiff. \u2019 \u2019 The court denied this request \u201c as I do not so find. \u2019 \u2019 It has been pointed out repeatedly that the better practice is to allow such a request (where it can be) and make findings on the evidence. In this case, however, the court could, and by the denial of this, and the third request, apparently, did find that' the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, and that any negligence of the defendant, or violation of the statute, were not the sole cause of the plaintiff\u2019s damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">We cannot say that there was prejudicial error. <em>O\u2019Toole vs. Magoon, </em>1936 Mass.
