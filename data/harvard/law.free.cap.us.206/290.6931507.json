By far the greater part of this indebtedness was shown by her bonds and other evidences of debt, given for the large sums of money which she from-time, to time had borrowed and used for the above purpose; but a portion of her liabilities though arising under contracts made before that date, had not then been covered by bonds issued for their payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">' \u201cIn addition to the above liability to\u2022 the general public, there was a large indebtedness evidenced by her bonds and other liabilities held by and due to the Commissioners of the-Sinking Fund and the Literary Fund of the State, as created under her laws amounting, the former to $1,462,993.00, and the latter to $1,543,669.05 as of the same date.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-10\">\u201cThe official reports and records showing the exact character and amounts of the public debt thus contracted and how the' same was created, are referred to, and will be produced upon a hearing of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqa\">\u201c(2) That portion of- the territory embraced in what constitutes the present territorial limits of Virginia was- prior to 'that date devoted mainly- to ^agriculture, and to some extent to grazing and manufacturing, which afforded its chief sources of revenue, while that- portion included, in what now constitutes the State df West Virginia had vast potentialities of wealth and revenue in the undeveloped.stores of minerals and timber, which had been known for many years prior to . the date named, and their -prospective values, if made accessible to the markets of the country, were understood to be well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>nigh beyond computation. It was to hasten and facilitate the development of these sources of wealth and revenue'by the construction of graded roads, bridges, canals and. railways, extending through the State from tidewater towards the Ohio River, that the Commonwealth of Virginia, in the first quarter of the Nineteenth Century, entered upon a system of public internal improvements, which.it was contemplated should include the entire territory of the State, and embraced in its design the construction of public works adapted, not to the needs \u00f3f any one portion of the State alone, but of the entire State, as a unit- of interest. The larger part of these works were constructed East of the Appalachian range, as leading up to the undeveloped territory West thereof, but a very considerable portion of them were, at an expense of several millions of dollars, constructed West of said range within the territory now included in the State of West Virginia; and the completion of some of the main lines of improvement beyond the said range and through to the Ohio River, since the first day of January, 1861, has increased to a very great and material extent the values of real estate, including coal and timber, in the- said territory now included in West Virginia, thus carrying into effect the original .scheme of improvement, which could not have been done had not the lines East of said range been first constructed; and your oratrix believes and avers that the property values within the limits of West Virginia have been enormously enhanced in a large measure by reason of these improvements. The money appropriated to the payment of the annually accruing interest on the said debt, prior to January 1, 1861, and to the formation of the Sinking Fund for the ultimate redemption thereof, was derived from taxes imposed upon the property subject to taxation throughout the entire State. The first of this indebtedness to be contracted was a small amount borrowed by the State in the year 1820 and the. debt was thereafter from time to time continued and increased by renewals and new loans until it reached the amount above stated in 1861. - \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>\u201c </em>(3)- The Commonwealth of Virginia was induced to enter upon the construction of this general system of internal improvement, in a. very large measure for the purpose of developing the-aforesaid , resources of the western portion of the State, now constituting' the State of West Virginia, thereby ameliorating the condition of her citizens residing^ therein; and it was with this view that she took upon herself the bur- ' den of the public debt for which her bonds were issued, without which debt such improvements could not have been under-, taken. In corroboration of this view it will appear from an inspection of the legislative records of the State, where the vote carrying the appropriations for such public improvements .was recorded, that in nearly every instance a majority of.those members of the. House and. Senate of the original State, who then represented th\u00e9 counties now composing West Virginia, voted for such appropriations. Indeed.it appears from those, records that a great majority of the acts of the legislature of Virginia under which said indebtedness was \u25a0 created, would have failed of their passage, had the representatives from the counties embraced in what is now West Virginia opposed their enactment, and that a very large proportion of said indebtedness was actually contracted over the votes of a majority of the representatives from the counties and cities embraced in. the limits of the present State of Virginia. .'This Will be found to be true, not. only'.in the legislature for one single-session, but in .the legislatures for many successive years, thus showing it to have been a fixed policy of- the people in that portion of the State now' constituting West Virginia to participate in, support and carry out this general plan of internial improve- \u25a0 ments in the State..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">\u201c (4.) The development of this system of public improvements thus entered upon, .was, from its character and extent, necessarily' progressive, and the same extended with the general growth and' increasing needs- of the State, and was incomplete, as above stated, in 1861, though a very considerable portion of such improvements had, prior to that time, been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>constructed as above stated, in th\u00e9 territory now constituting-West Virginia, in order to meet the needs of the people of that portion of the. State for their local purposes. As early as the year 1816 a Board , of Public Works was created by law for the State, the members of which were elected by the-voters of the State at large, and this Board had in'charge the construction and supervision of all the works of- public improvement in' this State. The annual reports of this Board will be referred to for information as to the character, extent, cost and location of the public works and. internal improvements constructed in the State,prior.to January 1st, 1861. The amounts expanded-upon the construction of these works in what is now West Virginia can only be accurately ascertained by a \u2022examination of the numerous entries in the records of this Board extending through a number of years and showing such expenditures as made from time to time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">\u201c (5.) On the 17th of April, 1861, the people of Virginia, in general convention assembled, adopted an ordinance by which it was intended to withdraw Virginia from the union of the States. From this action a considerable portion of the people of Virginia dissented, and organized a separate government which was .known and recognized by the government of the United States as the \u2018Restored State of Virginia,\u2019 and will be hereafter referred to in this bill as the \u2018Restored State.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">\u201c (6.)

The liability of West Virginia for a just proportion of the public debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia, as. it. existed, prior to the creation and erection of the State of West Virginia, forms part \u00f3f her very political existence, and is an essential constituent of her fundamental law as shown in the said ordinance adopted at Wheeling on the 20th day of August, 1861, in which the ^method of. ascertaining her liability on account of said debt is prescribed.

The ninth section of the ordinance adopted by the people of the <em>\u201c </em>Restored State of Virginia \u201d in convention assembled in the city of Wheeling, Virginia, on August 20,1861, entitled \u201cAn ordinance to provide for the formation of a new State out of a portion of the territory of this State,\u201d provided as follows: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201c9. The new State shall take upon itself a just proportion , of the' public debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia, prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the first day of January, 1861 j to be ascertained by charging to it all state expenditures within the limits thereof, and a just proportion of the ordinary expenses of the state government, since any part of,said debt was contracted; and deducting therefrom the monies paid into the treasury of the Commonwealth from the counties included within the said new State during the same period. All private rights and interests in lands within the proposed State, derived from the laws of Virginia prior to. such separation, shall remain valid and secure under the laws of the proposed State, and shall be determined by the laws now existing in the State of Virginia. . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The consent of the Commonwealth of Virginia was given to the formation of a* new State on this condition. February 3 and 4, 1863, the General Assembly of the \u201c Restored State 'of Virginia\u201d enacted two statutes in pursuance of the provisions of which money and property amounting to and of the value of several millions of dollars were, after the admission of the new State, paid over and transferred to West Virginia. The constitution of the State of West Virginia when admitted contained these provisions, being sections 5, 7 and 8 of Article VIII thereof, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201c.5. No debt shall be contracted by this State, except to meet casual deficits in the revenue, to redeem a previous liability of the State, to suppress insurrection, repel invasion, or defend the State in time of war.\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\"><em>\u201c7. </em>The legislature may at any time direct.a sale of the stocks owned by the State in banks and other corporations, but the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to the liquidation of the public debt; and hereafter the State shall not become a stockholder in any bank. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201c8. An equitable proportion of .the public debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia, prior to the first-day of January, in -the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, shall be assumed by this State; and the legislature shall ascertain the same as soon as may be practicable, and provide for the liquidation thereof, by a sinking fund sufficient to pay the accru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ing interest, and redeem the principal within thirty-four years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The \u201cpublic debt\u201d and the \u201cprevious liability\u201d'manifestly .referred to a portion of the public debt of the original State of Virginia and liability for the money and property of the original State, which had been received by West Virginia under the acts of the General Assembly above cited, enacted while the territory and people afterwards forming the State of West Virginia constituted a part of the Commonwealth of Virginia, though one may be involved in the other; while the provisions of sections 7 and 8 were obviously framed in compliance with the conditions on which the consent of Virginia was given to the creation of the State of West Virginia, and the money and property were transferred. From 1865 to 1905 various efforts were made by Virginia through its constituted authorities to effect an adjustment.and settlement with West Virginia for an equitable proportion of the public debt of the undivided State, proper to- be borne and paid by West Virginia, but all these efforts proved unavailing, and it is charged that West Virginia refused or failed to take any action or do anything for the purpose of bringing about a settlement or adjustment with Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The original jurisdiction of this court was, therefore, in-' yoked by Virginia to procure a decree for an accounting as between the two States, and, in order to a full and correct adjustment of the accounts, the adjudication and determination of the amount due Virginia by West Virginia in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">. But it is objected that this court has no jurisdiction because the matters set forth in the bill do not constitute such a controversy or such controversies as can be heard and determined in this court, and because the court has no power to enforce and therefore none to render any final judgment or decree herein. We think these objections are disposed of by many decisions of this court. <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>6 Wheat. 264, 378, 406; <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>185 U.

S. 379.</p>\n<p id=\"AR-\">In <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>the-Chief Justice said: \u201cIn the second class, -the jurisdiction depends entirely on the character of the parties. In this are comprehended \u2018controversies b\u00e9tween two .or more States, between a State and citizens of another State,\u2019 \u2018and between a State and foreign States, citizens or subjects.\u2019 If these be the parties, it is' entirely unimportant what may be the subject of controversy. Be it what it may, these parties have a constitutional right to come into the courts of the Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">And, referring to the Eleventh Amendment, it was further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD3\">\u201cIt is a part of our history, that, at the adoption of the Constitution, all the States were greatly indebted; and the apprehension that these debts might be prosecuted in the Federal courts formed a very serious objection to that instrument. Suits were instituted; and the court maintained its jurisdiction. Th\u00e9 alarm was general; and, to quiet the apprehensions that were so extensively entertained, this' amendment was proposed in Congress, and adopted by the state legislatures. That its motive was not to maintain the sovereignty of a State from the' degradation supposed to attend a compulsory appearance before the tribunal of the Nation, may be inferred from the terms of the amendment. It -does not comprehend controversies between two or more States, or between a State and a foreign State. The jurisdiction of the court still extends to these cases; and in these a State may still be sued. We must ascribe the amendment, then, to some other cause than the dignity of a State. There is no difficulty in finding this cause. Those who were inhibited from com-' mencing a suit against a State, or from prosecuting one which might be commenced before the adoption of the amendment, were persons who - might probably be its creditors. There was not much reason to fear that foreign or sister States would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>be creditors to any considerable amount, and there was reason to retain the jurisdiction of the court in those cases, because it might be essential to the preservation of peace. The amendment, therefore, extended to suits commenced or prosecuted by individuals, but not to those brought by States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">By the cases cited, and there are many more, it is established that, in the exercise of. original jurisdiction as between States, this court necessarily in such a. case as this has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Michigan, supra, </em>were controversies arising upon pecuniary demands, and jurisdiction was exercised in those cases just as in those for the prevention of the flow- of polluted water from one State al\u00f3ng the borders of another State, or of the diminution in the natural flow of rivers by the'State in which they have their sources through and across another State or States, or of the discharge of noxious gases from works in one State over the territory of-another.</p>\n<p id=\"AOQ\">The object of the suit is a settlement with West Virginia, and to that end a determination and adjudication of the amount due by that State to'Virginia, and when this, court has ascertained and adjudged the proportion of the debt of the original State which it would be equitable for West Virginia to pay, it is not to be . presumed on demurrer that West Virginia would refuse to carry out the decree, of this court. If such repudiation should. be absolutely asserted we can then consider by what means the decree may be enforced. Consent to be sued was given when West Virginia was admitted into the Union, and it must be assumed that the legislature of West Virginia would in the. natural course make provision for the satisfaction of any decree that may be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">It is, however,. further insisted that this court cannot proceed to judgment because of an alleged compact'entered into between Virginia and West Virginia, with the consent of Congress,- by which the question of the liability of West Virginia to Virginia was submitted to the arbitrament and award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>of the legislature of West Virginia as the sole tribunal which could pass upon it. As. we have seen, the constitution of West Virginia when admitted into the Union contained the provision: \u201cAn equitable proportion- of the public debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia prior to the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, shall be assumed\u2019 by this State, and the legislature shall ascertain the same as soon as may be practicable and provide for the liquidation.' of the same by a sinking fund and redeem the principal within thirty-four years.\u201d And it is said that, on May 13, 1862, the legislature of Virginia passed an act entitled \u201cAn act giving the consent of the Legislature of Virginia to the formation and erection of a new State within the jurisdiction of this State,\u201d by which consent was given to the creation of the proposed new State, \u201caccording to the boundaries and under the provisions set forth in the Constitution for the said State of West Virginia, and the schedule thereto annexed, proposed\" by the convention which assembled at Wheeling on the twenty-sixth day of November, 1861;\u201d and that by the act of Congress the consent of' that body was given to all those provisions which thus'became a constitutional and legal compact between the two States. The act of May 13, 1862, was not made apart of the c\u00e1se stated in the bill, and its validity.is denied by counsel for Virginia, but it is unnecessary to go into that, for when Virginia, on August 20, 1861, by ordinance provided \u201cfor the formation of a new State out of the territory of this State,\u201d and declared therein that \u201cthe new State shall take upon itself a just proportion of the public debt of the Com-\u2019 monwealth of Virginia prior to the first day of January, 1861,\u201d to be ascertained as provided, it is to be supposed that the-new State had this in mind when it framed its own constitution, and' that when that instrument provided that its legislature should \u201cascertain the same as soon as practicable,\u201d it referred to the method of ascertainment prescribed by the Virginia ' convention. Reading the Virginia ordinance and the West Virginia constitutional. provision <em>in pari-materia, </em>it follows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>that' what was. meant by the expression that the \u201clegislature shall ascertain\u201d was that the legislature should ascertain as soon \u00bfs practicable the result of the- pursuit of the method prescribed, and provide for the liquidation of the amount so ascertained. And it may well be inquired why, in the forty-three years that have elapsed since the alleged compact was entered into, West Virginia has never- indicated that she stood upon such a compact,, and, if so, why no step has' ever been, taken-by West Virginia to enter upon the. performance of the duty which such \u201ccompact\u201d imposed, .and to notify Virginia that she was ready and willing to discharge such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"AslC\">. ,It is also urged that Virginia had no interest in the subject matter of the controversy because she had been released from all liability on account of the public debt o\u00a3 the old Commonwealth, evidenced by her bonds outstanding on the first day of January, 1861. This relates -to the acts of the General Assembly of. Virginia of March 30, 1871, March 28, 1879, February 14, 1882, February 20, 1892, March 6, 1894, and March 6, 1900. According to the bill, Virginia by the act of March 30, 1871, and subsequent acts, in an attempt to provide for the funding and payment of the public debt, having estimated that the liability of West Virginia was for one-third of the amount of .the. old' bonds, provided for the issue of new bonds to the amount of two-thirds of the total, and for the issue of certificates for the .other third, which showed that Virginia held' the old bonds- so far as unfunded in trust for the holders or their assignees to be paid by the funds expected to be 'obtained from West Virginia as her \u201cjust and equitable pro-' portion of the public debt.\u201d The legislation resulted in the surrender of most of the old bpnds to Virginia, satisfied \u00e1s to two-thirds, and held, as security for the creditors as to one-third. We do not care to take up. and discuss\" this legislation. We are satisfied that as we have jurisdiction, these questions ought not to be passed upon on demurrer. <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>185 U. S. 125, 144, 145. And this also furnishes sufficient ground for not considering at length the objection of multi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>fariousness. The observations of Lord Cottenham, in <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Mackay, </em>1 Mylne &amp;. Craig, 6\u00d33, that it is impracticable to lay down any rule as to what constitutes multifariousness, -as an abstract proposition; that each case must dep\u00e9nd upon its own circumstances;, and much must be left where the authorities leave it, ,to the sound discretion of the court, have been often affirmed in this court. <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Piatt, </em>3 How. 333, 411; <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Relf, </em>2 How. 619, 642. But we do not mean to rule that the bill is multifarious. It is true that the prayer contains, among.other things, the request, \u201cthat all proper accounts may be taken to determine and ascertain the balance due from the State of West Virginia to your oratrix- in her own right and as trustee aforesaid,\u201d but it also prays that the court \u201cwill adjudicate and determine the amount due to your oratrix by the State of West' Virginia in the premises.\u201d And we understand the reference to holding in trust to be in the interest of mere convenience, and that the bill cannot properly be regarded- as seeking in chief anything more than a decree for \u201can equitable proportion of the public debt of the Commonwealth of' Virginia on the first day of January, 1861.\u201d The objections of misjoinder of parties and misjoinder of causes of action may be treated as resting on matter of sur-plusage merely,- and at all events further consideration thereof may wisely be postponed to final hearing. <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>17 How. 491, 492; <em>California </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Company, </em>157 U. S. 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The order will be\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AhVu\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled without prejudice to any question, and leave to answer by the first Monday of next term.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
