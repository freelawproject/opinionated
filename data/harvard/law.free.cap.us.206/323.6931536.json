The motion to remand was denied, and Wisner applied to this court for a writ of mandamus which was subsequently awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">' In the present case the removal was granted and sustained on the ground that there was a controversy between the removing defendant and plaintiff, which could be fully determined as between them without the presence of the other defendants.
