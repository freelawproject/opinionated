James Wesley MOOTY, II, Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b529-8\">No. 01-2641.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b529-9\">United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b529-10\">Submitted Jan. 4, 2002.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b529-11\">Filed Feb. 12, 2002.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b529-13\">Before McMILLIAN, MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, and BYE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b529-15\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">James Mooty pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 2; and to two counts of wire fraud and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343, 2. The district court sentenced him to 20 months imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently, and concurrent 3-year terms of supervised release. Mr. Mooty appeals his sentence, challenging the district court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-18\">The Guidelines provide for a 2-level enhancement where the defendant \u201cknew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in applying this enhancement. The record before the district court at sentencing demonstrated that Mr. Mooty knew, or should have known, that his victims were particularly vulnerable because they lived out of state. <em>See United States v. Moskal, </em>211 F.3d 1070, 1073 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review). The Guidelines provide for an additional 2-level enhancement where \u201cthe offense involved a large number of vulnerable victims.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(2). We believe that application of this enhancement, however, was unwarranted. The record supports a finding that seven victims were particularly vulnerable to Mr. Mooty\u2019s fraudulent activity, and we hold that seven is not, as a matter of law, a \u201clarge number\u201d within the meaning of section 3Al.l(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-19\">Accordingly, we vacate Mr. Mooty\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing without the 2-level section 3Al.l(b)(2) enhancement. We deny Mr. Mooty\u2019s motion to strike an addendum to the government\u2019s brief.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
