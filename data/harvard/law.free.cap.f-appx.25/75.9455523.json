Chatigny, <em>Judge), </em>which dismissed his Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims on summary judgment. The plaintiff, a judicial detention officer with the Connecticut Judicial Department, alleges that he was not promoted on numerous occasions because of race and age discrimination. He also asserts that Thomas White, a judicial employee, retaliated against him in violation of the Equal Protection Clause because the plaintiff filed a complaint for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Having conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we affirm for substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion. <em>See Roberts v. Judicial Dep\u2019t, </em>No. 99CV14(RNC), 2001 WL 777481, 2001 WL 777481, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14354 (D.Conn.
