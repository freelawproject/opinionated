The administrative judge\u2019s initial decision, <em>Raiszadeh v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. SF-1221-00-0014-B-1 (Aug. 1, 2000), became the final decision of the Board on March 19, 2001. <em>Raiszadeh v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. SF-1221-00-0014-B-1, 2001 WL 289250 (Mar. 19, 2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>The Board denied Raiszadeh\u2019s request for correction of four adverse personnel actions he claimed were in retaliation for certain disclosures protected under the WPA. Because the Board properly dismissed the claims over which it had no jurisdiction, and its decision to deny the remaining request for corrective action was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, unlawful, or unsupported by substantial evidence, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Raiszadeh, a chemist, serves as the Radiation Safety Officer (\u201cRSO\u201d) at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Loma Linda, California (\u201cMedical Center\u201d). The four actions for which he seeks correction include: (1) a reassignment, effective April 26, 1998, that placed his position in a different chain of command; (2) the lowering of his performance appraisal for 1996-97; (3) the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (\u201cagency\u2019s\u201d) failure to augment his duties in 1998; and (4) the agency\u2019s failure to grant him a monetary award in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction to the extent that it relied upon the first two alleged adverse personnel actions, finding that they were the subject of a previously settled complaint before the U.S. Department of Labor. The administrative judge also dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the claim that the agency failed to augment Raiszadeh\u2019s duties because that decision did not constitute a personnel action within the coverage of the WPA. The Board exercised jurisdiction over the agency\u2019s denial of a monetary award in 1998, holding that although the denial constituted a personnel action and Raiszadeh made protected disclosures, the disclosures did not contribute to the failure to grant an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">We begin with the administrative judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction to the extent it relied on the first two of Raiszadeh\u2019s alleged adverse personnel actions. On appeal, Raiszadeh asserts that the administrative judge erred by \u201crelying on the Agency\u2019s redacted document that was intended to distort the facts and change the outcome.\u201d A review of the redacted settlement agreement shows that Raiszadeh agreed to \u201c[wjaive any and all claims ... arising from the issues of the Department of Labor Complaint ,... \u201d That complaint included both the 1998 reassignment and the 1996-97 performance appraisal. So long as the settlement agreement is valid and enforceable, the Board is without jurisdiction to hear appeals relating to the underlying issues. <em>See Briscoe v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed.Cir. 1995). Raiszadeh did not provide the Board with an unredacted version of the agreement to support his claim. Because Raiszadeh did not carry his burden of establishing jurisdiction, we conclude that the Board correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">Next, we examine whether the Board had jurisdiction over Raiszadeh\u2019s contention that the agency failed to augment his duties in 1998 as a result of his whistleblowing activities. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation for whistle-blowing activity, Raiszadeh must show both that he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a disclosure protected under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8) and that his protected disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1221(e)(1), 2302(b)(8) (2000). A protected disclosure is a disclosure which an employee reasonably believes evidences \u201c(i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>health or safety.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Raiszadeh testified before the administrative judge that he had suggested to the agency that it combine the Medical Center\u2019s Industrial Hygiene Program (\u201cIHP\u201d) with his Radiation Safety Office and place both offices under his control. Instead, the agency filled a vacancy in the IHP and kept the two programs separate. On appeal, Raiszadeh argues that (1) the administrative judge failed to consider his industrial hygiene\" training and (2) the combination of programs \u201cwas the change that was needed to improve the Medical Center operation.\u201d The Board found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider that action because the agency\u2019s decision not to adopt Raiszadeh\u2019s suggestion did not amount to a \u201cpersonnel action\u201d against him under the statute. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A) (2000). We find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision on this issue. The only action the agency took was to fill a position in another department and otherwise maintain the status quo. Since Raiszadeh did not apply for that position, no action was taken \u201cagainst\u201d him as the statute requires. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(a) (2000). Thus, the Board was correct that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Finally, we examine Raiszadeh\u2019s contention that the agency\u2019s failure to grant him a monetary award in 1998 constituted a violation of the WPA. The Board exercised jurisdiction over that claim, finding that the decision not to grant the monetary award constituted a personnel action and that Raiszadeh\u2019s reports that patients were being unknowingly exposed to high levels of x-rays constituted protected disclosures. The Board nevertheless found that Raiszadeh\u2019s protected disclosures did not contribute to the denial of the \u201cspecial considerations\u201d monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">After reviewing the evidence of record and hearing testimony from witnesses including those who recommended and ultimately denied the award, the Board concluded that the duties for which Raiszadeh sought the award were part of his normal job duties and therefore not \u201cspecial contributions.\u201d The Board found that the agency decided the monetary award question on its own merits and that Raiszadeh\u2019s whistleblowing activities did not contribute to the agency\u2019s decision to deny that award. On appeal, Raiszadeh argues that certain witnesses were lying under oath and the administrative judge failed to consider documents that would disprove their credibility. However, credibility determinations rest with the sound discretion of the administrative judge who saw and heard the witnesses, making such determinations \u201cvirtually unreviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Dep\u2019t of Defense Dependents Schs., </em>814 F.2d 1549, 1554 (Fed.Cir.1987). The facts of this case do not lead us to depart from that rule. The administrative judge\u2019s conclusion that Raiszadeh\u2019s whistleblowing activity did not contribute to the personnel action was supported by substantial evidence. The Medical Center vice president testified that unhke those employees who did a \u201chuge amount of work\u201d and received the monetary award, Raiszadeh\u2019s achievements were \u201cvery generic\u201d and expected of his position. Furthermore, the decision to deny the monetary award came seventeen months after Raiszadeh made his protected disclosures. Based on that record, we cannot say that the Board\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
