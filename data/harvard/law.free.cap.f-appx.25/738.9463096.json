INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b768-18\">Appellants Robert Alan Jones and Bad Ass Coffee Limited Partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>(\u201cBACLP\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered into numerous agreements with Appellee Bad Ass Coffee Company of Hawaii, Inc. (\u201cBACH\u201d). These agreements governed, <em>inter alia, </em>BACLP\u2019s use of the Bad Ass Coffee Company trademark (the \u201cTrademark\u201d) in the states of Hawaii and Nevada. BACH unilaterally terminated several of the agreements thereby affecting BACLP\u2019s continued right to use the Trademark. After the federal district court entered a judgment confirming an arbitration award relating to BACH\u2019s termination of one agreement, BACH sought and was granted preliminary injunctions enjoining BACLP from using the Trademark in Hawaii and Nevada. BACLP appeals from the judgment confirming the arbitration award<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and from the two orders granting the preliminary injunctions. The three cases were consolidated in this appeal. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1291(a)(1), this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AuQJ\">The parties are well acquainted with the copious record in this case. Consequently, this court includes only the background material necessary to fully understand our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Jones was formerly employed by Royal Aloha Coffee, Tea <em>&amp; </em>Spice Company, Inc. (\u201cRoyal Aloha\u201d) d/b/a The Bad Ass Coffee Company. In November 1997, Royal Aloha assigned all of its right, title, and interest in and to the Trademark to BACH.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">In February 1997, Jones and RAJ Limited, a Nevada corporation wholly owned by Jones, brought a lawsuit in Nevada state court naming BACH and several other entities and individuals as defendants. The parties resolved the litigation by entering into a series of cross-referenced agreements: (1) a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d); (2) an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement (the \u201cAPSA\u201d); (3) a Master Distribution Agreement Hawaii (the \u201cMDAH\u201d); (4) a Master Distribution Agreement Nevada (the \u201cMDAN\u201d); (5) a Territory Development Agreement Hawaii (the \u201cTDAH\u201d); (6) a Territory Development Agreement Nevada (the \u201cTDAN\u201d); and (7) an Installment Promissory Note (the \u201cPromissory Note\u201d). These agreements governed, <em>inter alia, </em>the transfer and sale of certain assets from BACH to BACLP. BACLP is a Nevada limited partnership in which Jones is the principal. BACH and BACLP also entered into a Franchise Agreement dated January 1, 1999 (the \u201cFranchise Agreement\u201d). This agreement governed BACLP\u2019s operation of a Bad Ass Coffee Company retail store in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Almost before the ink was dry on the agreements, disputes arose between BACH and BACLP. In early 1999, BACH began sending default notices to BACLP and eventually gave BACLP notice of the immediate termination of the MDAH based on BACLP\u2019s failure to submit monthly sales reports and pay royalties. On March 9, 1999, BACH sent BACLP written notice that it was terminating both the MDAN and the TDAN based on BACLP\u2019s default under the Promissory Note and the APSA. BACH also filed a lawsuit in federal district court against BACLP and Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">An arbitration hearing to determine the propriety of BACH\u2019s termination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>MDAH commenced on August 4, 1999. On September 3, 1999, the arbitrator issued a written award in favor of BACH, concluding that BACH was entitled to terminate the MDAH. The arbitrator also awarded BACH administrative fees and expenses in the amount of $5,800. BACLP filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award in Third Judicial District Court, Salt Lake County, Utah. BACH filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award in federal district court and a notice to remove the Utah state action to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">On September 23, 1999, BACH gave BACLP written notice of the termination of the Franchise Agreement. BACH then filed an amended complaint in its federal suit against BACLP and Jones. The amended complaint contained, <em>inter alia, </em>claims against BACLP alleging: (1) trademark infringement; (2) breach of the APSA, the Promissory Note, and the Security Agreement; (3) breach of the MDAH; (4) breach of the TDAH; (5) breach of the MDAN; (6) breach of the TDAH; and (7) breach of the Franchise Agreement. BACH moved to consolidate the federal suit and the application to confirm the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">On November 4, 1999, the federal district court denied BACLP\u2019s motion to remand the matter to state court, granted BACH\u2019s motion to consolidate, and granted BACH\u2019s motion to confirm the arbitration award. BACLP\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitration award was denied. BACH then filed a Motion for Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees in Connection With Confirmation of the Arbitration Award. This motion was granted on April 13, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">On February 24, 2000, the district court granted BACH\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting BACLP from (1) using or displaying the Trademark in Hawaii, (2) interfering with BACH\u2019s efforts to negotiate with suppliers of its licensed products, and (3) purporting to authorize others to use the Trademark in Hawaii. On October 11, 2000, the district court granted BACH a preliminary injunction enjoining BACLP from using the Trademark in Nevada or purporting to authorize others to use the Trademark in Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">BACLP appeals the judgment confirming the arbitration award and awarding attorney\u2019s fees to BACH. BACLP also ap-. peals the grant of the preliminary injunctions relating to the use of the Trademark in both Hawaii and Nevada. The appeals were consolidated and all are properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">\n<em>Appeal No. 00-4045</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s order confirming the arbitration award using traditional standards. Findings of fact are accepted unless they are clearly erroneous and legal questions are reviewed <em>de novo. See First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 947-48, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). The review of an arbitrator\u2019s award, however, \u201cis among the narrowest known to the law.\u201d <em>Litvak Packing Co. v. United Food &amp; Comm. Workers Local 7, </em>886 F.2d 275, 276 (10th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">BACLP first argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to confirm the arbitration award. Our resolution of the jurisdictional issue involves a two-step inquiry. First, \u201c \u2018there must be diversity of citizenship or some other independent basis for federal jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>P &amp; P Indus., Inc. v. Sutter Corp., </em>179 F.3d 861, 866 (10th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 25 n. 32, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983)). Additionally, the parties must have \u201cagreed, explicitly or implicitly, that any eventual arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>award shall be subject to judicial confirmation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 866-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">BACH asserts that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 provides the basis for federal jurisdiction because the parties are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. BACLP argues that the amount in controversy is only $5,800; the amount awarded in administrative fees and expenses by the arbitrator. To determine the amount in controversy we must look to \u201cthe pecuniary effect an adverse declaration will have on either party to the lawsuit.\u201d <em>City of Moore v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>699 F.2d 507, 509 (10th Cir.1983). The arbitrator concluded that BACH properly terminated the MDAH, the agreement which gave BACLP the right to distribute Bad Ass Coffee Company products in Hawaii. In the memorandum it filed in support of its motion to vacate the arbitration award, BACLP represented to the district court that it had acquired this right for $100,000. BACLP\u2019s argument that the amount in controversy does not exceed $75,000 is disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">BACLP\u2019s position that the parties did not agree to judicial confirmation in federal court is also meritless. The MDAH provides that judgment upon any arbitration award \u201cmay be entered in any Court of competent jurisdiction\u201d but does not identify any specific court. When no court is specified in the parties\u2019 agreement, the Federal Arbitration Act provides that judgment may be entered in \u201cthe United States court in and for the district within which such award was made.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9. The arbitration award was made in Salt Lake County, Utah. Thus, the parties implicitly agreed that judgment on the arbitration award could be entered by the United States District Court for the District of Utah.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">BACLP next argues that the arbitrator erroneously limited the scope of the arbitration when he refused to allow it to introduce evidence it characterizes as \u201caffirmative defenses material to the controversy\u201d between the parties. BACLP further asserts that the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to hear this evidence was contrary to the arbitrator\u2019s own order regarding the scope of discovery. An arbitrator \u201cmust grant the parties a fundamentally fair hearing.\u201d <em>Bowles Fin. Group, Inc. v. Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., </em>22 F.3d 1010, 1012 (10th Cir.1994). \u201c[A] fundamentally fair hearing requires only notice, opportunity to be heard and to present relevant and material evidence and argument before the decision makers, and that the decisionmakers are not infected with bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1013. Even if the arbitrator erroneously excluded material evidence, we will not vacate the award unless the error deprived a party of a fundamentally fair hearing. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(3) (requiring vacatur only when the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to hear pertinent and material evidence constitutes misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">BACLP has failed to show that the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to consider the proffered evidence constituted misconduct on the part of the arbitrator or deprived it of a fundamentally fair hearing. In fact, BACLP admits in its appellate brief that the arbitrator allowed it to present evidence \u201cdirectly connected to payments made against royalties earned by royalty sales.\u201d Additionally, in its Memorandum Concerning Scope and Effect of Arbitration Award, BACLP represented to the district court that one of its counterclaims, evidence relating to which it now asserts should have been admitted by the arbitrator, was properly excluded from the arbitration proceedings. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 App. at 330 (\u201cThis is a claim which was not allowed by the Arbitrator in the Arbitration Proceedings as either a counterclaim, or as an affirmative defense to BACH\u2019s claims in the arbitration. BACH argued in the arbitration that this should be liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>gated in the federal district court and is not included in matters covered by the arbitration provisions of the [MDAH], <em>BACLP agrees with this position . </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The record completely belies BACLP\u2019s specious assertion that the arbitrator\u2019s decision to exclude the proffered evidence constituted misconduct. BACLP\u2019s contention that it was denied a fundamentally fair hearing is baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">BACLP next argues that the district court erred when it failed to make written findings of fact supporting its judgment confirming the arbitration award. BACLP contends that this constitutes a wrongful failure to adhere to Utah arbitration law. BACLP not only fails to cite any ease law supporting its argument, it fails to even identify the Utah law it claims the district court violated. We deem the issue waived. <em>See Rapid Transit Lines, Inc., v. Wichita Developers, Inc., </em>435 F.2d 850, 852 (10th Cir.1970). (\u201c[Appellant\u2019s] citation of but one authority, and that of no pertinence, suggests either that there is no authority to sustain its position or that it expects the court to do its research.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Finally, BACLP argues that the district court erred when it awarded $8,668.75 in attorney\u2019s fees to BACH. These fees were incurred in connection with the confirmation of the arbitration award, not in connection with the arbitration proceeding itself. The Utah Arbitration Act provides that attorney\u2019s fees relating to the confirmation of arbitration award may be awarded by the court unless precluded by the arbitration agreement. <em>See </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78-31a-16; <em>see also Buzas Baseball, Inc. v. Salt Lake Trappers, Inc., </em>925 P.2d 941, 953 (Utah 1996) (holding that the attorney\u2019s fee provision in the Utah Arbitration Act does not conflict with federal law). The parties argue over whether the terms of the MDAH prohibit an award of attorney\u2019s fees relating to the confirmation of an arbitration award. The interpretation of a contract is a legal question reviewed <em>de novo </em>by this court. <em>See Bank of Okla. v. Muscogee (Creek) Nation, </em>972 F.2d 1166, 1171 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">The MDAH contains, <em>inter alia, </em>two provisions relating to the payment of attorney\u2019s fees. Article 17.03 is captioned, \u201cDisputes and Arbitration\u201d and states, \u201c[t]he prevailing Party in any arbitration suit or action to enforce this Agreement, shall be entitled to recover the administrative costs of the arbitration proceeding and the fee for the arbitrators, but not attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Article 17.06 is captioned, \u201cCosts and Attorneys Fees\u201d and states, in part, \u201cif Company or Distributor is required to enforce this Agreement in litigation, the party prevailing in such proceeding shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs and expenses, including reasonable accounting and legal fees.\u201d If we accept BACLP\u2019s argument and interpret Article 17.03 to prohibit an award of attorney\u2019s fees in both arbitration proceedings themselves and all subsequent actions seeking to enforce the arbitration award in litigation, the provision conflicts with Article 17.06 which permits attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded when a party is required to enforce the MDAH in litigation. We decline to adopt BACLP\u2019s construction of the MDAH because it would diminish the effect of Article 17.06. If possible, this court should adopt a reasonable interpretation of a contract that gives effect to all its provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a reasonable interpretation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>possible in this case. We can resolve any potential conflict between Article 17.03 and Article 17.06 by construing the phrase \u201carbitration suit or action,\u201d as used in Article 17.03, to mean only the arbitration proceeding itself and not any subsequent litigation involving the arbitration award. This construction is supported by the wording of Article 17.03. The relevant sentence in 17.03 allows a party to recover only the \u201cadministrative costs of the arbitration proceeding and the fee for the arbitrators.\u201d These expenses would be incurred only in the underlying arbitration proceeding and not in any subsequent litigation involving the arbitration award. Thus, it is reasonable to construe Article 17.03 to likewise apply only to attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Confirmation of an arbitration award is a judicial proceeding; though related, it is separate from the underlying arbitration proceeding. Thus, BACH\u2019s motion seeking confirmation of the arbitration award is more appropriately viewed as an action seeking to enforce the MDAH in litigation than an arbitration proceeding. Additionally, BACH filed its motion to confirm the arbitration only after BACLP first filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award in Utah state court. Thus, BACH was \u201crequired to enforce [the MDAH] in litigation.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that Article 17.03 of the MDAH does not apply to the attorney\u2019s fees awarded by the district court to BACH and that those fees were allowable under Article 17.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Because BACLP does not challenge the reasonableness of the fees awarded by the district court and has not identified any provision in the MDAH that prohibits an award of attorney\u2019s fees relating to the confirmation of an arbitration award, we conclude that the fees awarded by the district court were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">\n<em>Appeal No. 00-4077</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">BACLP raises several arguments relating to the district court\u2019s grant of the preliminary injunction enjoining BACLP from using the Trademark and associated rights in Hawaii. This court reviews the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Power Eng\u2019g Co., </em>191 F.3d 1224, 1230 (10th Cir. 1999). Underlying legal issues are reviewed <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>See id.; Oil, Chem. &amp; Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union, Local 2-286 v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>885 F.2d 697, 703 (10th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">BACLP first argues that the district court made erroneous factual findings and then relied on those findings when it granted the preliminary injunction. BACLP claims the court erroneously found that there were no existing licenses or franchises being operated by BACLP at the time of the execution of the MDAH. BACLP asserts it had been a joint owner and operator of a Bad Ass Coffee Company location in Hawaii since April 1996. To support this assertion, BACLP has identified in the record a signed license agreement entered into between Royal Aloha, as licensor, and Hawaiian Islands Brewing Company, as licensee, on February 1, 1996. BACLP, however, has not submitted any record evidence detailing its relationship with Hawaiian Islands Brewing Company, or any evidence that the license agreement was in effect on the date the MDAH was executed. Although BACLP has included in the record disjointed, incomplete excerpts from the transcript of the preliminary injunction hearing that appear to relate to this license agreement, that testimony does not directly link BACLP to the licensee named in the license agreement. BACLP has thus failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s factual finding is erroneous. <em>See Naimie </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number><em>v. Cytozyme Labs., Inc., </em>174 F.3d 1104, 1113 (10th Cir.1999) (\u201cIf the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant shall include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to such finding or conclusion, and, if the appellant fails to do so, the court is under no obligation to remedy any failure of counsel to fulfill that responsibility.\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">BACLP also claims that the district court erroneously relied on the TDAH to support the grant of the preliminary injunction. BACLP contends that the TDAH was invalid at its inception because BACH was not registered to do business in Hawaii when the TDAH was executed. Even assuming that BACLP\u2019s argument is relevant, BACLP did not raise it before the district court and thus we do not address it. <em>See Crow v. Shalala, </em>40 F.3d 323, 324 (10th Cir.1994) (\u201cAbsent compelling reasons, we do not consider arguments that were not presented to the district court.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">BACLP next challenges the district court\u2019s determination that all of BACLP\u2019s rights to use the Trademark in Hawaii terminated at the time the APSA, the MDAH, and the TDAH terminated. The district court concluded that the APSA, the MDAH, and the TDAH encompassed and defined all the rights and obligations of BACLP and BACH with respect to the Trademark and that any and all rights BACLP had to use the Trademark in Hawaii were contingent upon the continued validity of those documents. The court concluded that BACLP failed to demonstrate that it possessed any rights, separate from the rights created under the terms of the APSA the MDAH, and the TDAH, to use the Trademark in Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">In its order granting the preliminary injunction, the district court set forth the following language from the MDAH:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGM\">12.01 Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason other than as set forth above, [BACLP] will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">(b) Immediately cease and desist from using or displaying the name Bad Ass Coffee or other name or Mark except with respect to the franchises or licenses owned and operated by [BACLP] or its affiliates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">(c) Immediately cease and desist from using or displaying any of the Marks and forms of advertising indicative of the Business, products or operations except with respect to the franehises/hcenses owned and operated by [BACLP] in accordance with the signed Agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-10\">12.02 So long as [BACLP] is not in default under the terms and conditions of its individual location Agreements, [BACLP] may continue as Licensee/Franchisee of Company for its individual locations pursuant to the terms and conditions of the respective Agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">BACLP argues that when it entered into the APSA it was granted \u201cvested rights to open locations under licenses already granted, or under a franchise system if it was approved\u201d and that these rights survived the termination of the MDAH. We have reviewed the provisions in the APSA referenced by BACLP and they do not, standing alone, grant BACLP any independent right to use the Trademark. At most, the provisions leave open the possibility that BACLP could acquire such rights under separate agreements with BACH. BACLP, however, has failed to produce any such agreement. BACLP further argues, however, that it purchased three Bad Ass Coffee Company retail stores in Hawaii pursuant to the refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>enced provisions in the APSA and the sale included the transfer of the goodwill of those businesses. BACLP claims that the trade name of a business is automatically transferred with the goodwill and, thus, it also acquired the right to use the Trademark when it purchased the three retail locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">When an agreement transferring an <em>entire </em>business, including goodwill, is silent as to the transfer of the business\u2019 trademark, this court has held that a buyer who continues to operate the business under the same trademark acquires ownership of the trademark. <em>See Okla. Beverage Co. v. Dr. Pepper Love Bottling Co., </em>565 F.2d 629, 632 (10th Cir.1977). In this case, however, BACLP only purchased three retail locations from BACH pursuant to the terms of the APSA and Bills of Sale<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> executed several months later; BACLP did not acquire BACH\u2019s entire business. Additionally, the APSA is not silent as to the transfer of the Trademark, but specifically provides that the only right to the Trademark transferred pursuant to the terms of the APSA is an \u201cexclusive license contained in the [MDAH] and rights thereunder subject to [BACH\u2019s] on-going rights including ownership to trademarks, service marks, tradenames and applications therefore for the state of Hawaii____\u201d Thus, any right BACLP acquired to use the Trademark pursuant to the terms of the APSA was clearly subject to BACH\u2019s ongoing ownership of the Trademark. BACLP\u2019s argument that it acquired a vested right to use the Trademark pursuant to the terms of the APSA or the Bills of Sale is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">BACLP next challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the lawyer for the bankruptcy trustee in the Royal Aloha bankruptcy proceedings informed all Bad Ass Coffee Company licensees that the executory contracts between them and Royal Aloha had been rejected. BACLP argues that the rejection of the executory contracts did not affect its right to use the Trademark because the Trademark and all encumbrances thereon were transferred to BACH prior to the initiation of Royal Aloha\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. Thus, the rejection of the Royal Aloha agreements did not affect the licensees\u2019 rights to use the Trademark. Even assuming that the rejection of the executory contracts had no effect on a licensee\u2019s right to use the Trademark, we must reject BACLP\u2019s argument simply because it has failed to demonstrate that it was ever a party to any signed license agreement with Royal Aloha.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Finally, BACLP argues that the district court abused its discretion because the grant of the preliminary injunction altered the status quo. \u201cTo obtain a preliminary injunction, the party requesting such an extraordinary equitable remedy bears the burden of showing: (1) a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits; (2) irreparable harm unless the injunction is issued; (3) the threatened injury outweighs the harm that the preliminary injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) the injunction, if issued, will not adversely affect the public interest.\u201d <em>Fed. Lands Legal Consortium v. United States, </em>195 F.3d 1190, 1194 (10th Cir.1999). When the issuance of a preliminary injunction will alter the status quo between the two parties, the movant must show that \u201cthat on balance, the traditional four factors weigh heavily and compellingly in favor of granting the injunction.\u201d <em>SCFC ILC, Inc. v. Visa USA </em>936 F.2d 1096, 1097 (10th Cir.1991). The district court was clearly aware of BACLP\u2019s argument that an injunction prohibiting BACLP from using the Trademark at the three retail locations identified in the APSA would upset the status quo. <em>See Bad Ass Coffee Co. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>Haw., Inc. v. Bad Ass Coffee Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>No. 2:99-cv-00150, slip op. at 11 (D.Utah Feb. 23, 2000) (\u201cTo the extent BACH seeks to disrupt the status quo by enjoining defendants from selling Bad Ass Coffee Company coffee and products from their retail stores, this court applies the higher standard to its analysis of the preliminary injunction.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order contains a comprehensive analysis of the four factors and an explanation of how they weighed heavily in favor of BACH. We can find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s analysis and affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction for substantially those reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">\n<em>Appeal No. 00-J/.179</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">BACLP also appeals from the grant of the preliminary injunction enjoining it from using the Trademark in the state of Nevada. BACLP argues that the termination of the MDAN and the TDAN did not affect its rights to use the Trademark in connection with the retail store located in Las Vegas.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> BACLP contends that those rights were contained in the Franchise Agreement and that the Franchise Agreement did not terminate upon the termination of the MDAN and the TDAN.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">BACLP\u2019s Nevada distribution and territorial development rights were detailed in the MDAN and the TDAN, two of the agreements executed contemporaneously with the APSA. In addition, BACLP acquired the right to operate the Las Vegas store pursuant to the terms of the Franchise Agreement. Subject to a fifteen-day cure period, BACH retained, <em>inter alia, </em>the power to terminate the Franchise Agreement if BACLP \u201cfail[ed] to pay for any Product, or any fees, purchase price, advertising fees, transfer fees, renewal fees or other amounts due to [BACH]....\u201d BACH also retained the right to terminate the Franchise Agreement without allowing BACLP the opportunity to cure if \u201c[BACLP] makes any material misrepresentations relating to the acquisition of the franchise or [BACLP] engages in conduct which reflects materially upon the operations and/or reputation of the BACH franchise business or the franchise System in an adverse manner.\u201d Several months after BACH sent BACLP written notice that it was terminating the MDAN and the TDAN, BACH sent BACLP written notice that it was also terminating the Franchise Agreement. BACH justified the termination, in part, on BACLP\u2019s alleged unauthorized use of the Trademark in Hawaii. BACH also alleged that BACLP \u201cpublished to prospective franchisees in the state of Hawaii certain defamatory statements reflecting materially upon the operations and reputation of the BACH franchise business in an adverse manner.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">BACH then filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction enjoining BACLP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>from using the Trademark in Nevada. In support of its motion, BACH relied on testimony presented in the preliminary injunction hearing relating to the use of the Trademark in Hawaii and an affidavit signed by BACH\u2019s president, Mike Bilanzich, stating that BACLP had not made any royalty payments or delivered monthly accountings pursuant to the Franchise Agreement since August 31, 1999. BACLP filed a memorandum in support of its opposition to BACLP\u2019s motion, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that it submitted all franchise reports and royalty payments in a timely manner until August 31, 1999. It then argued, without any citation to authority, that it was relieved of any responsibility to continue tendering payments because BACH had improperly rejected some payments in an attempt to cause a breach of the Franchise Agreement. BACLP did not present any argument regarding BACH\u2019s allegation that BACLP had published defamatory statements that damaged the BACH franchise system.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The district court concluded that: (1) BACH would suffer irreparable harm unless BACLP was enjoined, (2) the balance of harms weighed in favor of granting the injunction, and (3) the injunction would not adversely affect the public interest. The court granted the injunction after further concluding that the evidence presented by BACH \u201craised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them a fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.\u201d <em>Bad Ass Coffee Co. of Haw., Inc. v. Bad </em>Ass <em>Coffee Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>No. 2:99-cv-00150, slip op. at 4 (D.Utah October 11, 2000); <em>see also Fed. Lands Legal Consortium, </em>195 F.3d at 1194-95. The court stated, \u201c[BACH] has presented evidence of several defaults by defendants under each of the relevant Nevada agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">On appeal, BACLP renews the argument it made before the district court that BACH improperly terminated the Franchise Agreement because BACLP was not in default. BACLP asserts that was justified in failing to tender royalty payments after August 31, 1999 because BACH\u2019s rejection of earlier royalty payments was improper. BACLP also argues, for the first time in this appeal, that the termination of the Franchise Agreement cannot be based on the letter sent to the Hawaii franchisees because the letter did not mention BACH and was not defamatory because the allegations made therein were true. Finally, BACLP argues that the district court erred when it concluded that trademark infringement constitutes an irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">We assume, without deciding, that the Franchise Agreement survived the termination of the MDAN and the TDAN and that the Franchise Agreement conferred on BACLP rights to use the Trademark in connection with its operation of the retail store in Las Vegas. We have considered each of BACLP\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are either unsupported by the record or relevant case law, or are waived because they were not presented to the district court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record amply supports the district court\u2019s finding that BACH presented \u201csubstantial and largely uncontroverted evidence that all of [BACLP\u2019s] rights to use the Trademark in Nevada have been lawfully terminated.\u201d BACLP has presented absolutely no evidence indicating that the district court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous and has not shown that the district court committed any legal error that would necessitate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>a reversal of the grant of the preliminary injunction. Accordingly, finding no reversible error in the district court\u2019s analysis, we affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction for substantially those reasons stated by the district court in its order dated October 11, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">We affirm the confirmation of the arbitration award and the grant of attorney\u2019s fees to BACH, affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction enjoining BACLP from using the Trademark in Hawaii, and affirm the grant of the prehminary injunction enjoining BACLP from using the Trademark in Nevada.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b768-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-9\">.

BACLP does not argue on appeal that the district court improperly enjoined it from using the Trademark pursuant to the terms of either the MDAN or the TDAN. This appears to be a concession that BACH properly terminated the MDAN and the TDAN, resulting in the termination of any rights BACLP had to use the Trademark in Nevada contained solely in those agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b776-8\">. This allegation arose in connection with a letter signed by Jones and sent by BACLP to Bad Ass Coffee Company licensees in Hawaii which stated, \"Our partnership owns the trademark in Hawaii, no amount of lies or unsigned lawyers [sic] letters will change that.
