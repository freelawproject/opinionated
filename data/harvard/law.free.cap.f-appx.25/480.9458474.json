The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 77 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, Pesina-Cardenas\u2019s counsel filed a brief arguing the court should have granted a downward departure based upon cultural assimilation and also moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Pesina-Cardenas has <em>not Bled </em>a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The issue counsel raises is unreviewable because the district court acknowledged that it had authority to depart but found that the facts did not support a departure. <em>See United States v. Correa, </em>167 F.3d 414, 417 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We have independently reviewed the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). Based on that review, we believe the district court should have more clearly informed Pesina-Cardenas that his guilty plea had not yet been accepted before the court informed him of his trial rights. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(3). However, we do not believe what transpired during the plea hearing raises any nonfrivolous issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\">. The Honorable Charles R. Wolle, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
