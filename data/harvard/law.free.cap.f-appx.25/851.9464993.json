Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Cathy Toole\u2019s appeal because she has appealed from a nonfinal order. Toole opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">On September 8, 2000, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied Toole\u2019s claim for benefits as the surviving spouse of veteran James L. Toole, determining that her claim for service connection for her husband\u2019s death was not well grounded. The Board also denied her claims for dependency and indemnity compensation and for dependent\u2019s educational assistance. Toole appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and the Secretary moved for remand. Toole opposed. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims granted the Secretary\u2019s motion, vacated the Board\u2019s decision, and remanded for readjudication of Toole\u2019s claims consistent with the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub.L. No. 106^475,114 Stat.2096.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">This court has jurisdiction over final decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Winn v. Brown, </em>110 F.3d 56, 57 (Fed.Cir.1997); <em>Johnson v. Derwinski, </em>949 F.2d 394, 395 (Fed.Cir.1991); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). \u201cThis court typically does not have jurisdiction over Court of Veterans Appeals [now Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims] remands because they are not final judgments.\u201d <em>Winn, </em>110 F.3d at 57. <em>See also Cabot v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 1539 (Fed.Cir.1986) (remand to administrative agency for additional findings is not appealable even though remand order resolves an important legal issue). In this case, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims rendered no decision on the merits of the case, but remanded for application of the VCAA, an action potentially favorable to Toole. Toole does not challenge the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision to remand for application of the VCAA by the Board. Rather, she appeals the decision on the basis that this court should provide her \u201ca honest decision\u201d and require \u201cindividuals that work for the U.S. Government ... to get sworn in under oaths\u201d so that \u201cthey got to tell the truth then .\u201d Toole asserts that some of her husband\u2019s records are missing and wants this court to compel the production of these records or, in the alternative, to order \u201cthe U.S. Government [to] pay the cost to [have her husband\u2019s] body exhumed\u201d and examined by private physicians. None of these issues was ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>dressed in the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 remand decision, which was based entirely on the subsequent enactment of the VCAA. We agree with the Secretary that this case must be dismissed as nonfinal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The case does not fall within the \u201ccollateral order exception\u201d to the final judgment rule because Toole may later obtain review from any adverse final judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims that falls within our jurisdictional mandate. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). Neither does it fall within any of the other exceptions permitting appeals from remand orders. <em>See Adams v. Principi, </em>256 F.3d 1318 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>Travelstead v. Derwinski, </em>978 F.2d 1244 (Fed.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
