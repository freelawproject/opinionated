Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), this court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Serhan\u2019s contentions challenging his statutory eligibility for suspension of deportation are foreclosed by our decision in <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 518-19 (9th Cir.2001). We do not consider Serhan\u2019s eligibility, if any, for relief under the class action pending in the district court in accordance with <em>Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, </em>167 F.3d 1228 (9th Cir.1999), <em>supplemental opinion, </em>236 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir.2001). Our resolution of this case does not affect any interim or permanent relief awarded to members of the class certified in <em>Barahona-Gomez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Because Serhan\u2019s petition to this court did not address the propriety of the BIA\u2019s summary dismissal of Serhan\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for asylum and withholding of deportation, he waived his right to challenge the summary dismissal. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">We conclude that the BIA properly dismissed Serhan\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision that the IJ lacked jurisdiction to review the order of rescission. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 103.5a(a)(2), 246.1; <em>Farhoud v. INS, </em>122 F.3d 794, 796 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">We deny Serhan\u2019s request for a remand to the BIA to pursue a claim under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. This denial is not on the merits and does not preclude Serhan from pursuing this claim in a motion to reopen before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b681-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
