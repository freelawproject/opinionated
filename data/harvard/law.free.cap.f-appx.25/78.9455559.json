On appeal, he principally challenges (1) a December 1998 order, Sidney H. Stein, <em>Judge, </em>that (a) dismissed his claims against defendants C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Wilson and E. Royce as time-barred, and (b) dismissed his Eighth Amendment claims against all other defendants pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted; and (2) a subsequent decision, William H. Pauley III, <em>Judge, </em>granting summary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants on Stevens\u2019s remaining claims. We see no error in any of these rulings, and we affirm substantially for the reasons stated on the record by Judge Stein on December 2, 1998, and substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Pauley\u2019s order dated September 29, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">We have considered all of Stevens\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment and order of the district court are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
