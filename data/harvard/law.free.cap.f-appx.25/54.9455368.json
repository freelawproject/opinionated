For the reasons given below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Green applied for disability benefits in 1992, claiming his knee and back injury prevented him from working from August 2, 1991 through September 1993. His application was denied, and he filed a notice for reconsideration, which was also denied. Green requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), which took place in June 1993. At the hearing, Green was represented by counsel. By order entered in December 1993, the ALJ denied Green\u2019s application, concluding he was not disabled. The ALJ stated that none of Green\u2019s health problems, either alone or collectively, were severe enough to constitute a listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">Green appealed to the Appeals Council, which remanded the case, asking the ALJ to consider medical records submitted by Green after the June 1993 hearing. The ALJ held another hearing on October 11, 1994. During the hearing, Green\u2019s counsel told the ALJ he could not say whether Green\u2019s doctor considered Green\u2019s pain when making his report. When the hearing ended, the ALJ advised counsel that he had thirty days to question Green\u2019s doctor or any of the other doctors as to whether Green was limited by pain or other problems not previously considered. In July 1995, the ALJ again denied Green\u2019s application for benefits. The ALJ concluded that Green\u2019s only severe impairment during the closed disability period was his left knee injury, which the ALJ found did not meet or equal the impairments listed in the regulations governing benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">Green filed a complaint in district court in February 2000, seeking review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. The district court granted the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding there was substantial evidence in the record showing Green was capable of sedentary work. Further, the district court found the ALJ was required only to take appropriate steps to develop the record, and did not have an obligation to contact Green\u2019s doctor directly. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>found the ALJ could reasonably conclude the expert would have taken Green\u2019s pain into account when making his report without contacting the expert directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u201cIn reviewing district court decisions in disability cases, we undertake our own plenary review of the administrative record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the [Commissioner\u2019s] denial of benefits.\u201d <em>Havas v. Bowen, </em>804 F.2d 783, 785 (2d Cir.1986). Reversal is warranted only if the Commissioner\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Diaz v. Shalala, </em>59 F.3d 307, 312 (2d Cir.1995). The evidence shows Green, while unable to work in his previous profession, is able to engage in sedentary work. The district court thus correctly upheld the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Green also argues the ALJ failed to properly develop the record because the ALJ did not contact Green\u2019s doctor to see if the doctor took Green\u2019s pain into account. \u201cThe ALJ generally has an affirmative obligation to develop the administrative record,\u201d even where a claimant is represented by counsel. <em>Perez v. Chater, </em>77 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir.1996) (citations omitted). Where there are \u201cclear gaps\u201d in the administrative record, the ALJ cannot reject the diagnosis of a treating physician without first attempting to obtain the missing information. Rosa <em>v. Callahan, </em>168 F.3d 72, 79 (2d Cir.1999). When an ALJ fails to adequately complete the record, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further administrative proceedings. <em>Rosa, </em>168 F.3d at 79-81. Here, the ALJ and district court improperly concluded the ALJ had no affirmative obligation to contact Green\u2019s doctor for additional information as to whether Green\u2019s pain was considered in assessing his capacity to perform work.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The error was harmless, however, as we uphold the district court\u2019s opinion on substantial evidence grounds. <em>See Eichelberg v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>57 F.3d 1179, 1186 n. 6 (2d Cir.1995) (holding we may affirm the district court \u201con any ground that finds adequate support in the record.\u201d) (citation omitted). Here, the ALJ did not reject the doctor\u2019s diagnosis, but, rather, accepted it, along with the assertion that Green did experience pain as a result of his knee injury. What the ALJ rejected were Green\u2019s contentions that he suffered \u201cexcruciating pain.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s determination that Green\u2019s statements concerning the extent of his pain were not credible is supported by substantial evidence \u2014 specifically, the reports of other treating doctors as to Green\u2019s capacity to perform work-related activities, Green\u2019s own testimony that he did not seek medical attention after October 1992, and Green\u2019s testimony he did not require prescription medication for pain. Thus, the record before the administrative law judge, which included Green\u2019s complete medical history, does not approach the inadequate nature of the administrative records in those cases where we- have chosen to remand. We therefore affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We have examined the remainder of Green\u2019s arguments and we find them without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
