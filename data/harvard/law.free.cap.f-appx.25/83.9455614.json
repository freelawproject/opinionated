Thereafter, Alcatel moved for a preliminary injunction, and defendants-appellants cross-moved to dismiss the complaint and to compel arbitration. On April 26, 2001, the District Court granted Alcatel\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint, and granted defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration on consent. <em>See Alcatel Space, S.A. v. Loral Space &amp; Communications Ltd., </em>154 F.Supp.2d 570 (S.D.N.Y.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The preliminary injunction entered by the District Court provides that, until further order of the District Court or of the arbitral tribunal, or upon expiration of the strategic alliance agreement, whichever is earlier, defendants shall act in compliance with certain provisions of the agreement or in accordance with their representations to the District Court. 154 F.Supp.2d at 585-86. On appeal, defendants contend that (1) because the injunction purportedly altered the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and provided Alcatel with substantially all the relief it sought from the lawsuit, the District Court should have required Alcatel to make \u201ca \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018substantial\u2019 showing of a likelihood of success\u201d on the merits, <em>see Jolly v. Coughlin, </em>76 F.3d 468, 473 (2d Cir.1996); (2) Alcatel showed neither a likelihood of success on the merits not irreparable harm; and (3) the injunction is overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">We have carefully reviewed the record, and find appellants\u2019 arguments without merit. The District Court applied the correct legal standard and crafted an injunction that preserves Alcatel\u2019s rights pursuant to the strategic alliance agreement until the status of that agreement can be definitively determined in the arbitration proceedings. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court for substantially the reasons stated in its April 26, 2001, opinion and order. <em>See Alcatel Space, </em>S.A. <em>v. Loral Space &amp; Communications Ltd., </em>154 F.Supp.2d 570 (S.D.N.Y.2001).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
