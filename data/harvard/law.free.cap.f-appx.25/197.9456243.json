Winn-Dixie moved to dismiss based on <em>res judicata, </em>claiming that plaintiffs, with the exception of Nesbit, failed to opt out of a race and gender class action settlement in <em>Dorman v. Winn-Dixie Stores, </em>99-72-CIV-J-21B (M.D.Fla.) <em>(\u201cDorman\u201d), </em>which concluded a lawsuit filed in 1996. The motion was granted, and plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider. Before ruling on that motion, the district court ordered plaintiffs to file a motion for class certification, which the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>thereafter denied as untimely. Subsequently, the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration. Plaintiffs appeal the denial of both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Appellants claim that the district court erred in concluding that they failed to opt out of the <em>Dorman </em>settlement and that they failed to plead any claims not precluded by the <em>Dorman </em>judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">According to the district court\u2019s order in <em>Dorman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">Potential class members who wish to exclude themselves from membership in the Settlement Class for purposes of participation in the monetary portion of the settlement must do so in writing by filing with the Clerk of Court <em>a signed and dated handwritten </em>\u201cOpt-Out\u201d Statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">J.A. 279 (emphasis added). The Opt-Out Statement was to contain particular language reciting that an individual is a settlement class member; that he wishes to opt out; and that he understands the consequences for his rights to relief if he chooses to opt out. <em>Id. </em>Appellants concede that they did not comply with these requirements, but now offer three theories as to why their claims are not barred by the <em>Dorman </em>judgment. Under the first two theories, they seek to establish that they did in fact opt out, and under the third, they argue that they pled claims not precluded by the <em>Dorman </em>settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">First, they contend that they actually opted out of the <em>Dorman </em>settlement because Nesbit, the \u201cchairman of the group,\u201d tried to opt out on behalf of himself and the group. However, class representatives cannot opt out on behalf of other putative class members. <em>See, e.g., Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., </em>150 F.3d 1011, 1024 (9th Cir.1998); <em>In re Lease Oil Antitrust Litig., </em>186 F.R.D. 403, 439 (S.D.Tex. 1999). Because none of the individuals, except Nesbit himself, signed the handwritten opt-out statement, as required by the district court in <em>Dorman, </em>their claims are barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">Appellants\u2019 second theory, that the maintenance of their suit in North Carolina was adequate notice of their desire to opt out of the <em>Dorman </em>class action in Florida, also lacks any legal support. <em>See, e.g., Holmes v. CSX Transport, </em>1999 WL 447087, *4 (E.D.La.1999). Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>McCubbrey v. Boise Cascade Home &amp; Land Corp., </em>71 F.R.D. 62 (N.D.Cal.1976), is unavailing. Although the court there did say that <em>filing </em>of a separate lawsuit during the exclusion period was a sufficient opt-out notice, it said nothing about the sufficiency of <em>maintenance </em>of a separate lawsuit, which was initiated prior to the receipt of the proposed settlement, as an opt-out notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Finally, appellants attempt to avoid the preclusive effect of the <em>Dorman </em>judgment by arguing that they pled claims that were not barred by that judgment. The <em>Dorman </em>judgment did not bar alleged racial harassment or hiring claims, but did bar alleged discrimination for discharge or general retaliation claims. J.A. 147-48.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>However, appellants failed to plead properly any claims that were not covered by the <em>Dorman </em>judgment. J.A. 22-23. The district court did not err in rejecting appellants\u2019 attempt, \u201cafter the response time to the dismissal motion had expired and after the motion was submitted to the court,\u201d in a submission \u201caddressing another motion,\u201d to allege claims (such as racial harassment, retaliation and failure to hire) not precluded by the <em>Dorman </em>settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Because appellants did not opt out and because their claims are barred by <em>res judicata^ </em>the district court did not err in dismissing the claims in their entirety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\">. The following claims were covered by the settlement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">unlawful <em>discrimination </em>against associates on the basis of their sex, gender and/or race, including, but not limited to, retaliation against an associate because he or she has opposed practices he or she believes in good faith to constitute unlawful sex, gender and/or race discrimination or has participated in processes designed to obtain relief for alleged unlawful sex, gender or race discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">J.A. 129 (emphasis added). The following claims were <em>not </em>released:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-18\">(a) alleged sexual or racial <em>harassment; </em>(b) retaliation for asserting claims of unlawful sexual or racial harassment, and/or (c) alleged unlawful gender or race discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>tion in not being hired by Stores or one of the retail operating companies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-20\">J.A. 148 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>J.A. 129 (listing these three types of claims and \"retaliation for participation in a process designed to obtain relief for alleged sexual or racial harassment\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-29\">.
