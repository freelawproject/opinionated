Damadio appeals the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, Docket No. DC0752010038-I-1, dismissing his appeal of an alleged involuntary retirement from the United States Park Police. On thorough review, we <em>affirm, </em>the decision of the Board. Mr. Damadio states that his retirement was involuntary because his reassignment was a \u201ca tremendous step backwards\u201d in career advancement and caused him great stress. He also states that the reassignment was intended to cause him to retire.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it was: \u201c(l)arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law; \u00a9obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or \u00a9unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Gibson v. Deparment of Veterans Affairs, </em>160 F.3d 722, 725 (Fed.Cir.1998). The Board\u2019s finding that he had not established that his retirement was involuntary has not been shown to suffer from any of these defects, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-15\">Further, Mr. Damadio has not shown why the court\u2019s refusal to compel production of documents was an abuse of discretion, for he does not identify how documents within the agency\u2019s possession would support his argument that his retirement was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-16\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
