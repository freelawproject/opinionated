We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision, and we review for substantial evidence and legal error the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>sion. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1097 (9th Cir.1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Marcia Peters was not disabled. <em>See id. </em>at 1098. The ALJ did not arbitrarily discredit Peters\u2019 testimony because her testimony regarding her daily activities was inconsistent with her allegation of disabling pain, and her treating physician indicated he was unsure whether Peters was a malingerer. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995). Similarly, the ALJ did not wholly disregard Luper\u2019s testimony. The ALJ properly concluded that Luper\u2019s testimony regarding her mother\u2019s daily activities was inconsistent with Peters\u2019 allegation of disabling pain. <em>See Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989) (holding that where a claimant spends a substantial part of her day performing activities transferable to a work setting, a finding as to this fact may be sufficient to discredit an allegation of disabling pain).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Furthermore, the ALJ provided specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting the opinion of Peters\u2019 treating physician. <em>See Cotton v. Bowen, </em>799 F.2d 1403, 1408 (9th Cir.1986). The ALJ found that Peters\u2019 physician indicated there were no clinical or laboratory test results for any of Peters\u2019 impairments. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 751 (9th Cir.1989) (holding that an ALJ is not required to accept a treating physician\u2019s opinion that is \u201cbrief and conclusory in form with little in the way of clinical findings to support [its] conclusion\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Peters\u2019 treating physician also opined that Peters would not experience substantial difficulty with pain or fatigue if she worked full-time at light or sedentary levels. The ALJ properly concluded that this medical conclusion was inconsistent with Peters\u2019 allegations of disabling pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">Luper\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b696-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
