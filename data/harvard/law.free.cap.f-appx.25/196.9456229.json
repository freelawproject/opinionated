In the sole issue raised by Miggins in this appeal, he contends that the district court erred in denying his Fed. R.Crim.P. 29 motion for acquittal. Miggins contends that the evidence at trial concerning his travel with Charles Bradford Mitchell, who was arrested in possession of 36.5 grams of crack cocaine, was insufficient to support his conviction. This court reviews the denial of a motion for acquittal under a sufficiency of evidence standard. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 29; <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998). In light of that standard, we must conclude that the district court did not err in denying Miggins\u2019 motion. Miggins\u2019 argument amounts to an invitation to this court to reweigh the evidence at trial tending to show that Miggins aided and abetted Mitchell\u2019s illicit trip from New York City to Charlottesville, Virginia. <em>See Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, </em>336 U.S. 613, 619, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>341 U.S. 58, 64, 71 S.Ct. 595, 95 L.Ed. 747 (1951). This court uniformly declines to accept such invitations. <em>See Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 80; <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-20\">Accordingly, Miggins\u2019 conviction and sentence are affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
