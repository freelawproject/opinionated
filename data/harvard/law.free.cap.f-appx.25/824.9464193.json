R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">This is a pro se state prisoner 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights appeal. Mr. Brown seeks damages and injunctive relief on his claim that prison officials are not adequately providing him with medical care. The district court dismissed Mr. Brown\u2019s complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) because his complaint and amended complaint failed to establish the Defendants\u2019 personal participation in the alleged deprivation of his constitutional rights. The district court denied Mr. Brown\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Mr. Brown appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-17\">Mr. Brown failed to allege the essential element of personal participation of any of the Defendants as is required in a \u00a7 1983 civil rights action. <em>See Bennett v. Passic, </em>545 F.2d 1260, 1262-63 (10th Cir.1976). Therefore, after a thorough review of the briefs and the record, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned October 10, 2001 Order and Judgment of Dismissal, we hold that no relief is available to Mr. Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-18\">Appellant\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b852-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
