We have reviewed the appeal, and agree that the Veterans Court\u2019s decision rested either on a factual determination or on an application of law to fact. In either instance, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the merits of that decision. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2); <em>Leonard v. Gober, </em>223 F.3d 1374, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir.2000) (concluding that the court lacked jurisdiction to review a decision by the Veterans Court finding that the claimant had failed to timely file a Notice of Appeal and could not equitably toll the filing deadline). Accordingly, this appeal must be <em>dismissed </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
