The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sentenced him to 87 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and filed a brief raising the issue whether the district court erred in denying Lizarraga-Lopez\u2019s motion for downward departure based on his status as a deportable alien and his willingness to waive deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">At sentencing the district court acknowledged its authority to depart, and thus its discretionary decision not to depart under the circumstances in this case is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Lim, </em>235 F.3d 382, 385 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Moreover, following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-36\">. The Honorable Richard G.
