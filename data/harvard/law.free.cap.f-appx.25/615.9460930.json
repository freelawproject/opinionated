GEIS filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. Araujo appeals the district court\u2019s final judgment dismissing his complaint with prejudice. In addition, GEIS appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its requests for costs. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm. However, we remand the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying fees because the court is required to provide reasons for the denial. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of the case, we do not recount it here except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-21\">Grants of summary judgment are reviewed de novo. <em>Clicks Billiards Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number><em>Sixshooters Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1252, 1257 (9th Cir.2001). The Court must determine, viewing all evidence and ail reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, whether there are any genuine issues of material fact. The district court\u2019s award of costs is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See LSO, Ltd. v. Stroh, </em>205 F.3d 1146, 1160 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">I. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Applying the standard of review set forth above, we cannot say that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Araujo, that there exist any material issues of genuine fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">First, Araujo\u2019s breach of contract claim fails because GEIS\u2019 employment application stated that the employment term was at-will, and no other agreement was subsequently made that would countermand that. <em>See Sheets v. Knight, </em>308 Or. 220, 779 P.2d 1000, 1008 (1989) (absent a contractual, statutory, or constitutional requirement to the contrary, an employer may fire an employee at any time and for any reason).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">As to his claim for defamation, Araujo fails to show any publication by GEIS of false and defamatory information about him to a third person. <em>See Wallulis v. Dymowski, </em>323 Or. 337, 918 P.2d 755, 758 (1996). The only GEIS\u2019 communications regarding Araujo\u2019s termination were made to GEIS\u2019 employees. Such communications are privileged. <em>See e.g. Bickford v. Tectronix, Inc., </em>116 Or.App. 547, 842 P.2d 432, 434-435 (1992); <em>Worley v. Oregon Physicians Service, </em>69 Or.App. 241, 686 P.2d 404, 407 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Araujo\u2019s claim of negligence also fails because the Oregon Supreme Court has rejected the argument that employment gives rise to a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d that would impose a special duty of care on the employer. <em>See Conway v. Pacific University, </em>324 Or. 231, 924 P.2d 818, 826 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">In addition, Araujo\u2019s claim for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress must fail as Araujo cannot prove any of the three required elements. There is no evidence that 1) Erhlich intended to inflict severe emotional distress on Araujo; 2) Ehrlich\u2019s acts did in fact cause Araujo to suffer sever emotional distress; or 3) Ehrlich\u2019s acts constituted an \u201cextraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct.\u201d <em>See McGinty v. Staudenraus, </em>321 Or. 532, 901 P.2d 841, 849 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">Finally, Araujo \u201celects not to brief\u2019 the dismissal of his age discrimination and fraudulent misrepresentation claim but rather \u201csubmits them on the record.\u201d The dismissal of these two claims therefore are not properly before this Court, which \u201cwill not ordinarily consider matters of appeal that are not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief.\u201d <em>International Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craftsman Local Union No. 20, AFL-CIO v. Martin Jaska, Inc., </em>752 F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">Even if this Court were to review those claims, however, Araujo would still not prevail. As to the age discrimination claim, the only reviewable issue would be Araujo\u2019s requests for an evidentiary hearing or certified question as to whether Araujo, in an attempt to toll the statute of limitations, was in fact suffering from a mental disability. Given that the review of such a decision is for an abuse of discretion (S<em>ee U.S. v. Smith, </em>155 F.3d 1051, 1063 n. 18 (9th Cir.1998)), and the fact there is controlling authority ruling out the possibility of tolling based on a mental disability <em>(See Stupek v. Wyle Laboratories Corp., </em>327 Or. 433, 963 P.2d 678, 686 (1998)), Araujo cannot prevail. As to the fraudulent misrepresentation claim, Araujo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>has failed to offer the requisite evidence of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">II. GEIS\u2019 Attempt to Recover Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In denying GEIS\u2019 request for costs, the district court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">Under the circumstances of this action, I conclude that neither [Araujo] nor GEIS should recover costs pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1). I also conclude that a hearing on this issue is not necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">This ruling was an abuse of discretion given that the district court did not provide any reasons for its denial. As this Court has stated, trial courts must state grounds for the denial of costs so that the appellate court will be able to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>See AMAE v. State of California, </em>231 F.3d 572, 591-592 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Subscription Television, Inc. v. S. Cal. Theatre Owners Ass\u2019n, </em>576 F.2d 230, 234 (9th Cir.1978)). In cases where the district court failed to provide reasons, this Court remanded the case for an amplification of the order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Accordingly, the case is remanded to the district court so that the district court can provide grounds for any denial of costs. Therefore, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED and the denial of costs is REMANDED for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Costs are awarded to General Electric Information Services.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
