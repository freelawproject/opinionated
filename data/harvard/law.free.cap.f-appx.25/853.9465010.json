Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Danny E. Lister\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Lister has not responded.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>On April 27, 2001, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals and remanded for readjudication based on the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-475,115 Stat.2096.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">This court has jurisdiction over final decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Winn v. Brown, </em>110 F.3d 56, 57 (Fed.Cir.1997); <em>Johnson v. Derwinski, </em>949 F.2d 394, 395 (Fed.Cir.1991); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). \u201cThis court typically does not have jurisdiction over Court of Veterans Appeals [now Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims] remands because they are not final judgments.\u201d <em>Winn, </em>110 F.3d at 57. <em>See also Cabot v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 1539 (Fed.Cir.1986) (remand to administrative agency for additional findings is not appealable even though remand order resolves an important legal issue). This case does not fall within the \u201ccollateral order exception\u201d to the final judgment rule because Lister may later obtain review from an adverse final judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims that falls within our jurisdictional mandate. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). Neither does it fall within any of the other exceptions permitting appeals from remand orders. <em>See Adams v. Principi, </em>256 F.3d 1318 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>Travelstead v. Derwinski, </em>978 F.2d 1244 (Fed. Cir.1992). Therefore, we must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-17\"> A response was received from appellant's spouse, Jan Lister. We note that a litigant may appear pro se or be represented by counsel. A nonattomey may not represent a litigant before this court. <em>See </em>Fed. Cir. R. 47.3(a); Guide for Pro Se Petitioners and Appellants, U 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
