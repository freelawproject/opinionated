We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-23\">In 1996, St. Louis police officers executed a search warrant on a package at a United Parcel Service facility after a police dog responded to the odor of narcotics. The police discovered inside the package a smaller box containing more than $61,000 in cash. The DEA subsequently initiated forfeiture proceedings pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881. Following procedures prescribed in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1607-1609, the DEA listed the seizure in <em>USA Today </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>three consecutive weeks, and sent notice of the proceedings via certified mail to each individual listed as either the sender or recipient on the two containers. The notice sent to \u201cC. Bass\u201d on Shenandoah in St. Louis was returned to the DEA by the post office and stamped \u201cATTEMPTED, NOT KNOWN.\u201d The currency was forfeited to the United States in 1997 because no claims were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Bass asserts that he lived on Shenandoah in 1996 but did not receive notice because the DEA omitted his apartment number from his address. He claims that the DEA\u2019s failure to provide him with actual notice of the forfeiture violated his due process rights, and that the initial search and seizure of the package violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Upon de novo review, <em>see Madewell v. Downs, </em>68 F.3d 1030, 1036 (8th Cir.1995), we conclude that the DEA\u2019s actions were \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action,\u201d <em>see Dusenberry v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 122 S.Ct. 694, 700-01, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, ---(2002). The DEA had no reason to know Bass\u2019s apartment number, and was not required to track him down. <em>See id; Madewell, </em>68 F.3d at 1047. Bass\u2019s challenge to the seizure of the package, brought under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), fails because he did not allege any direct involvement in the seizure by federal employees. <em>See Buford v. Runyon, </em>160 F.3d 1199, 1203 nn.6-7 (8th Cir. 1998). Finally, we conclude the district court properly denied Bass\u2019s motions to strike and for a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-24\">. The Honorable Thomas C. Mummert, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
