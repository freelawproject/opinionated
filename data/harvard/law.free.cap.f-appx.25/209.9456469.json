The court dismissed Eury\u2019s complaint because he failed to comply with an order directing him to either submit an adequate number of copies of the complaint or pay $5.50 for copying fees. Because Eury may proceed with this action by supplying an adequate number of copies of the complaint or paying the requisite fee, the order in question is not a final, appealable order. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir. 1993). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
