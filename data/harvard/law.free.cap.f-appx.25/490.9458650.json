Consistent with the parties\u2019 plea agreement stipulations, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Duran to 121 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. On appeal, Duran\u2019s attorney has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Duran has not filed a pro se supplemental brief, despite being invited to do so. We affirm Duran\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Counsel\u2019s arguments address the unsuccessful motion to suppress, but Duran waived the right to challenge its denial by unconditionally pleading guilty to the offense. <em>See United States v. Beck, </em>250 F.3d 1163, 1166 (8th Cir.2001). Having found no other nonfrivolous issues for appeal upon our independent review pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm the judgment of the district court, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny counsel\u2019s request for oral argument. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">. The Honorable Ronald E. Longstaff, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
