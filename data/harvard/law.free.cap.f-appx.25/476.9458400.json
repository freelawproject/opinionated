The district court determined Sanchez was a \u201cminor\u201d participant in the crime and thus granted him a two-level downward departure. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b). Sanchez argues he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>was merely a \u201cminimal\u201d participant and is instead entitled to a four-level downward departure. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a). We disagree and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We apply a clearly erroneous standard in reviewing the factual question of whether a defendant should be characterized as a minor or minimal participant for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>236 F.3d 420, 422 (8th Cir.2001). The defendant bears the burden of proving he is entitled to a reduction as a minor or minimal participant. <em>United States v. White, </em>241 F.3d 1015, 1024 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u201cThe propriety of a downward adjustment is determined by comparing the acts of each participant in relation to the relevant conduct for which the participant is held accountable and by measuring each participant\u2019s individual acts and relative culpability against the elements of the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Belitz, </em>141 F.3d 815, 818 (8th Cir.1998). A departure for minor participation in the offense applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 3. We have previously refused to find error in a role in the offense determination when the defendant \u201cseemed to be quite aware of what was happening during the drug sale.\u201d <em>Ortiz, </em>236 F.3d at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Sanchez was charged with, and pled guilty to, a limited conspiracy starting on the day he was arrested, May 10, 1999. The object of the conspiracy was to obtain possession of methamphetamine from a motel room and to deliver it to another person. The district court\u2019s determination that Sanchez was a minor participant in this conspiracy was factually supported by Sanchez\u2019s advance planning and his central role in the conspiracy, including his use of a cellular phone to communicate information concerning the conspiracy. Sanchez\u2019s admission that he knew he was being paid to retrieve drugs, which were later going to be sold, is sufficient \u201cknowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise\u201d for the district court to characterize him as more than a mere minimal participant in the conspiracy. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 4. The district court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-17\">. The Honorable Harold D. Vietor, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
