(\u201cCon Ed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In 1981, a fire at Con Ed\u2019s Echo Bay substation caused oil containing polychlorinated biphenyls (\u201cPCBs\u201d) to spill into a surrounding moat. The Mancusos argue that Con Ed has violated the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251-1387, by discharging pollutants into Echo Bay as a result of this fire. However, Con Ed abandoned the substation 20 years ago and has done nothing at the site since except to conduct a series of cleanup operations under the guidance of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. All the evidence indicates that the cleanup has been effective at reducing the PCB\u2019s to statutorily acceptable levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In <em>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc., </em>484 U.S. 49, 108 S.Ct. 376, 98 L.Ed.2d 306 (1987), the Court held that in order to establish standing under the Clean Water Act a citizen-plaintiff must demonstrate a \u201creasonable likelihood that a past polluter will continue to pollute in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 108 S.Ct. 376; <em>see also Connecticut Coastal Fishermen\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Remington Arms Co., </em>989 F.2d 1305, 1311 (2d Cir.1993) (\u201c[Pjlaintiff must show that defendant\u2019s violations continued subsequent to the date the complaint was filed, or present proof from which a trier of fact could find a continuing likelihood that violations would recur.\u201d). We agree with the district court that there is no reasonable likelihood of future pollution of Echo Bay from Con Ed\u2019s substation. The Mancusos, having thus failed to allege a redressable injury, lack standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The Mancusos premise standing chiefly on violation of their aesthetic sensibilities when they resort to the site for recreation. The Supreme Court has held that \u201cenvironmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons \u2018for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened\u2019 by the challenged activity.\u201d <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Serv. (TOC), Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 183, 120 S.Ct. 693, <em>145 </em>L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (quoting <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 735, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972)). However, the record here demonstrates nothing more than that the Mancusos visited Echo Bay in order to prepare for this litigation. Their aesthetic sensibilities may have been injured in the course of these visits, but the Mancusos do not currently reside, own property, or recreate in, on, or near Echo Bay; they do not \u201cuse\u201d Echo Bay for any purpose other than to obtain evidence to support this lawsuit. Any aesthetic injury experienced as a result of these visits is therefore simply a byproduct of this lawsuit and cannot satisfy even the minimal showing of injury-in-fact needed to meet the standing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
