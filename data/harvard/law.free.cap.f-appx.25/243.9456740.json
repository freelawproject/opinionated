Williams, United States District Judge for the Western District of Virginia, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b273-12\">RYAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">This case arises under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The plaintiff, Vidya V. Sharma, alleges that the defendants Ohio State University (OSU), John Riedl, and Edward John Ray: (1) discriminated against him based on his national origin, in violation of Title VII; (2) retaliated against him for complaints he filed with internal bodies of OSU, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (OCRC); and (3) discriminated against him in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. For the reasons stated below, we shall affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"AhM\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b273-18\">The facts of this case are well-known to the parties and do not merit extensive discussion; it Ml suffice to mention only the most salient details.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-19\">Vidya Sharma was bom in India and moved to the United States in 1963. He has taught economics at OSU-Mansfield since 1970, where John Riedl is the dean/director. Edward John Ray served as the head of the OSU Economics Department and is currently the provost. In his duties as dean/director, Riedl reports directly to Ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-20\">Since Riedl\u2019s appointment in 1986, the relationship between Riedl and Sharma has been strained. The plaintiffs brief recounts an exhaustive history of alleged harassment perpetrated by Riedl, which Ray did nothing to prevent. The allegations largely concern Sharma\u2019s conduct and Riedl\u2019s responses. Riedl asserts that any action taken against Sharma was an appropriate disciplinary response.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-21\">Sharma also alleges that he was routinely denied appropriate salary increases by Riedl, who was responsible for determining Sharma\u2019s salary. Early in his tenure as dean, Riedl had constructed a faculty evaluation system that based salary increases on a professor\u2019s performance. Sharma alleges that Riedl manipulated the system to minimize Sharma\u2019s salary increases. Riedl points out that any performance evaluation score Sharma received was contributed to and approved by the chair of the Economics Department and based on objective data.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Sharma filed complaints with the OCRC and the EEOC on November 5, 1993, December 13, 1994, December 15, 1995, and December 9, 1996. In response, a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter issued on November 17, 1997. He filed suit on February 5, 1998. More than a year later, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment which the district court granted in full. Sharma appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Estate of Dietrich v. Burrows, </em>167 F.3d 1007, 1010 (6th Cir.1999). A grant of summary judgment is proper when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). No genuine issue of material fact exists when \u201cthe record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The party bearing the burden of proof must present a jury question as to each element of its case. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">B. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">As a preliminary matter, we note that there is some confusion in the record concerning whether Riedl and Ray are being sued in their individual or official capacities. The district court assumed at one point in its opinion that the suit against Riedl and Ray was in their official capacities. At another point it considered suits against Riedl and Ray in their individual capacities. The plaintiff\u2019s briefs on appeal do nothing to clarify the matter. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs amended complaint states that both Riedl and Ray are sued in their \u201cpersonal and official capacities].\u201d Giving the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, we will consider his claims against Riedl and Ray in both their individual and official capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">1. Title VII \u2014 Harassment</p>\n<p id=\"AbM\">a. <em>Prima Facie </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Sharma alleges that Riedl harassed him due to his national origin and that Ray did nothing to prevent the harassment. Such action, he contends, exposes Riedl, Ray, and OSU to Title VII liability. Under Title VII, an employer is prohibited from discriminating against any individual \u201cwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">Under Title VII, Sharma cannot recover against Riedl and Ray in their individual capacities. It is well-settled in this circuit that a supervisor or employee cannot be held liable for a Title VII violation unless he otherwise qualifies as an \u201cemployer.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Univ. of Cincinnati </em>215 F.3d 561, 571 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1052, 121 S.Ct. 657, 148 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000); <em>Morris v. Oldham County Fiscal Court, </em>201 F.3d 784, 788 n. 1 (6th Cir.2000). Sharma does not allege that Riedl or Ray meet this test. Thus, Sharma\u2019s Title VII claims against Riedl and Ray in their individual capacities were properly dismissed on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">The claims against OSU, and Riedl and Ray in their official capacities, were also properly dismissed, but on different grounds. The plaintiff in a Title VII case bears the initial burden of proving discrimination by the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). The plaintiff can satisfy this burden by presenting direct evidence of discriminatory actions by the defendant or by showing the existence of circumstantial evidence that creates an inference of discrimination. <em>Talley v. Bravo Pitino Rest., Ltd., </em>61 F.3d 1241, 1246 (6th Cir.1995). Under the latter approach, to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was subject to an adverse employment action; (3) he was qualified; and (4) he was treated less favorably than a similarly situated employee outside of the protected class. <em>Hall v. Baptist Mem\u2019l Health Care Corp., </em>215 F.3d 618, 626 (6th Cir.2000). Once the plaintiff has established a <em>prima facie </em>ease, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Hall, </em>215 F.3d at 626. If the defendant does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove the reason advanced is pretextual. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Sharma failed to prove his <em>prima facie </em>case. It is undisputed that as an Indian-born individual, Sharma is a member of Title VH\u2019s protected class. Moreover, he was subject to an adverse employment action in the form of lesser salary increases. Nonetheless, as the district court found, Sharma failed to present any evidence that he was qualified for pay increases. Even if he was qualified, he failed to prove that the adverse action caused him to be treated differently than similarly situated employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In its discussion of Sharma\u2019s qualifications for increased raises, the district court stated that Sharma\u2019s disagreement with the scores he received demonstrate nothing more than his own subjective belief that he should have been scored higher. We agree. The essence of Sharma\u2019s argument appears to be as follows: that his salary increases are lower under Riedl than under his predecessor; that his salary is not equal to professors on the OSU main campus; that Riedl did not lower the score of other underperforming faculty as much as he should have; that Riedl did not provide department heads information that would allow them to evaluate faculty relative to one another; and that he received only a 25 percent salary increase over 10 years though his evaluation score was higher than a professor receiving a 40 percent increase. Even if true, these arguments do nothing to demonstrate that Sharma was qualified for a higher score. They demonstrate only that Sharma was paid less than some other professors. While Sharma claims that Riedl deliberately underreported Sharma\u2019s scores on his evaluation, he offers, no argument regarding the scores he should have received.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Furthermore, Sharma does nothing to prove that he was treated differently than similarly situated professors. In short, he cannot satisfy the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d <em>prima facie </em>element because he advances no argument on the point. Thus, Sharma fails to satisfy his burden of proving a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination regarding salary. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">b. Pretext</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Even if Sharma satisfied the <em>prima facie </em>requirements of a Title VII violation, he has done nothing to rebut the nondiscriminatory reasons advanced by OSU for the adverse employment action. In his briefs, Sharma devotes considerable effort to alleging a pattern of abusive behavior by Riedl. Presumably he is attempting to demonstrate that Riedl held discriminatory intent. But it is difficult to parse from Sharma\u2019s extensive allegations any response to OSU\u2019s argument that every action taken by Riedl, and presumably rati<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>fied by Ray, was warranted. Sharma claims that Riedl manipulated the evaluation system and that this proves that the evaluation scores given by Riedl were pretext for discrimination. But Sharma offers no support for this contention. Finding none in the briefs or record, we conclude that the district court appropriately granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the Title VII disparate treatment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">2. Title VII Retaliation Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Sharma\u2019s claims of retaliation under Title VII also fail. In order to state a claim for retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">(1) she engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) this exercise of protected rights was known to defendant; (3) defendant thereafter took adverse employment action against the plaintiff, or the plaintiff was subjected to severe or pervasive retaliatory harassment by a supervisor; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action or harassment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\"><em>Morris, </em>201 F.3d at 792 (emphasis omitted). Once the plaintiffs burden has been met, \u201cthe burden of production of evidence shifts to the employer to \u2018articulate some legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason\u2019 for its actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 793 (quoting <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817). If the employer cannot establish a legitimate reason for its actions, the plaintiff prevails. <em>Cline v. Catholic Diocese of Toledo, </em>206 F.3d 651, 658 (6th Cir.2000). If the defendant can establish a legitimate reason for its actions, however, then the plaintiff must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason was pretextual. <em>Gribcheck v. Runyon, </em>245 F.3d 547, 552 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 217, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The record is clear that Sharma has failed to meet his burden of making out a <em>prima facie </em>Title VII retaliation claim. While it is undisputed that the plaintiff filed numerous discrimination complaints and that a series of diminished salary increases suffices as an adverse employment action, these alone are not enough to carry the plaintiffs burden. As the district court found, Sharma has shown no causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Again, the plaintiff demonstrates only that his performance scores and salary were lower than some other professors. Before this court, the plaintiff argued that he was entitled to an inference of causation. But the inference alone will not carry the plaintiffs burden. Finding no support for causation in the record, Sharma fails to state his <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliation. For this reason, the district court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the Title VII retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">3. Section 1983 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Sharma claims that Riedl harassed him due to his national origin and that Ray did nothing to prevent the harassment, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Regardless of whether the defendants Riedl and Ray were sued in their individual or official capacities, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">Sharma cannot state a claim against Riedl and Ray in their official capacities. It is a well-settled principle that the Eleventh Amendment bars suit against a state. <em>Johnson, </em>215 F.3d at 571 (citing <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 350, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979)). State officials acting in their official capacities are immune from suit for damages. <em>Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 70-71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>(1989); <em>McKay v. Thompson, </em>226 F.3d 752, 757 (6th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied sub nom., McKay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1230, 149 L.Ed.2d 139 (2001). Here, Sharma sought only money damages against Riedl and Ray. Thus, in their official capacities they are immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Summary judgment is appropriate even if Sharma were suing the defendants in their individual capacities. As this court has stated: \u201cThe showing a plaintiff must make to recover on an employment discrimination claim under Title VII mirrors that which must be made to recover on an equal protection claim under section 1983.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>201 F.3d at 794. As we stated above, Sharma has failed to meet his Title VII burden and his claims were properly dismissed. For those reasons, summary judgment for the defendants on Sharma\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim is also appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">For the reasons stated herein, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
