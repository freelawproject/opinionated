After three days of trial, the district court entered judgment for RLC, rejecting the Sureties\u2019 successor liability and fraudulent conveyance claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Green Thumb<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and RLC provided landscape maintenance and landscape installation services in the Washington D.C. area for approximately 20 years. In 1995, however, Green Thumb experienced financial difficulties that led it to default on certain obligations. Significantly, it defaulted on performance bonds acquired for several of its landscape installation contracts through the Sureties. National American and Gulf Insurance incurred losses of $640,729 and $1,905,904.95, respectively, as a result of Green Thumb\u2019s default.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Upon learning of Green Thumb\u2019s financial difficulties, RLC negotiated to acquire Green Thumb\u2019s assets. On July 31, 1995, RLC and Green Thumb signed a Purchase Agreement, under which Green Thumb agreed to transfer to RLC its vehicles, equipment, and maintenance contracts \u201cfree and clear of any liens and encumbrances.\u201d J.A.2026, 2027. Recognizing that Green Thumb had liens on many of these assets, the Purchase Agreement allowed Green Thumb to use the \u201csales proceeds [of the Green Thumb/RLC transaetion] to obtain releases of liens in order to convey good title[.]\u201d J.A.2040.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Green Thumb, in fact, had a mounting debt problem. A June 1995 Dunn &amp; Bradstreet report downgraded Green Thumb\u2019s credit rating from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cfair.\u201d The report showed that Green Thumb was party to four pieces of litigation seeking $103,523, and that state and federal taxing authorities had liens against Green Thumb totaling $675,000. Moreover, Green Thumb owed NationsBank approximately $1,523,695.86 on three loans (a line of credit loan, an equipment loan, and a real estate loan). As a result of this debt, NationsBank held liens on much of Green Thumb\u2019s maintenance contracts, vehicles and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">It appears that RLC knew Green Thumb could not meet at least some of its obligations. RLC questioned Green Thumb\u2019s internal balance sheets and projected income/expense analyses. Additionally, RLC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Ken Hochkeppel, noted that it appeared Green Thumb could become insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">RLC sought to insulate itself from Green Thumb\u2019s debt in several ways. First, the Purchase Agreement explicitly stated that RLC would \u201cnot assum[e] any debts, liabilities, agreements, contracts or obligations\u201d of Green Thumb, other than those directly related to its asset purchase. J.A.2036. Second, RLC employees helped Green Thumb obtain releases of various leases and liens relating to the assets RLC sought to purchase, with RLC signing some of the releases itself. Third, RLC purchased from NationsBank two Green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Thumb notes that encumbered many of the assets it sought to purchase. RLC bought the notes for $960,000. RLC and Green Thumb then entered into a Forbearance Agreement related to the NationsBank notes under which Green Thumb agreed to immediately pay RLC $192,595.86, and pay RLC all the interest on its line of credit loan plus $125,000 monthly from September 5, 1995 through December 1995. Beginning January 1996, the principal payments would be reduced to $100,000 monthly.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Upon completing the sale, RLC hired approximately 100 Green Thumb employees, virtually all from Green Thumb\u2019s landscape maintenance division. Additionally, once before the sale\u2019s completion and twice afterward, RLC transferred funds totaling $25,151.56 to Green Thumb so that Green Thumb could meet payroll obligations. Finally, on July 27, 1995 \u2014 shortly before the parties signed the Purchase Agreement\u2014 Green Thumb sent a letter to some of its clients, stating that \u201cGreen Thumb and [RLC] are combining landscape/maintenance operations under the umbrella of [RLC].\u201d J.A. 1595. The letter stated that Green Thumb was \u201cvery excited about what this alliance can offer us all\u201d and referred to the Green Thumb-RLC transaction as a \u201cmerging of our two operations.\u201d J.A. 1595. RLC approved the letter before Green Thumb mailed it to its clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The Sureties filed this action against RLC on July 27, 2000, making claims of successor liability and fraudulent conveyance. On March 13, 2001, the parties began three days of trial, at the end of which the Sureties completed their case-in-chief. The district court then granted RLC\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law on the Sureties\u2019 successor liability claim, and entered judgment under Rule 52 against the Sureties on their Va.Code \u00a7 55-80 fraudulent conveyance claim. After the entry of judgment, RLC moved for sanctions against the Sureties under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11. RLC argued that the Sureties \u201cpursued [RLC] through a chain of actions without uncovering new evidence and without any good faith basis in fact or law.\u201d J.A. 3624-25 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court rejected the motion, holding that RLC failed to comply with Rule ll\u2019s 21-day safe harbor provision. J.A. 3625. Additionally, the court held that the Sureties\u2019 claims \u201cwere not devoid of factual and legal foundation.\u201d J.A.3627.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to grant RLC\u2019s Rule 50 motion. <em>Trimed, Inc. v. Sherwood Medical Co., </em>977 F.2d 885, 888 (4th Cir.1992). Under Rule 50, a court should render judgment as a matter of law when \u201ca party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson, </em>530 U.S. 133, 149, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)). The Court should review all the evidence in the record, but \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097 (citing <em>Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., </em>494 U.S. 545, 554-55, 110 S.Ct. 1331, 108 L.Ed.2d 504 (1990)). Additionally, the Court \u201cmust disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 120 S.Ct. 2097. \u201c[T]he court should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that \u2018evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at least to the extent that the evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 9A C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Wright <em>&amp; </em>A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2529, p. 300 (2nd ed.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">We review the district court\u2019s Rule 52 ruling entering judgment against the Sureties\u2019 fraudulent conveyance claim under the clearly erroneous standard. Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>Holmes v. Bevilacqua, </em>794 F.2d 142, 147 (4th Cir.1986) <em>(en bane). </em>We will reverse the district court\u2019s findings only if its ultimate determinations \u201cwere induced by an erroneous view of the controlling legal standard; or are not supported by substantial evidence; or were made without properly taking into account substantial evidence to the contrary or are against the clear weight of the evidence considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Dwyer v. Smith, </em>867 F.2d 184, 187 (4th Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Moore v. City of Charlotte, </em>754 F.2d 1100, 1104 (4th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">It is well settled that \u201cwhere one company sells or otherwise transfers all its assets to another company, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor.\u201d <em>City of Richmond v. Madison Management Group, Inc., </em>918 F.2d 438, 450 (4th Cir.1990) (quoting 15 W. Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations, </em>\u00a7 7122, at 188 (Rev. Perm. Ed 1983)). This general rule of corporate non-liability serves, in effect, \u201cas a security blanket\u201d that \u201cprotects corporate successors from unknown or contingent liabilities of their predecessors.\u201d <em>Conway v. White Trucks, </em>692 F.Supp. 442 (M.D.Pa.1988), <em>aff'd, </em>885 F.2d 90 (3d Cir.1989). The purchasing corporation \u201cis not liable on the other company\u2019s obligations merely by reason of its succession to such company\u2019s property.\u201d 15 W. Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations, </em>\u00a7 7122, at 227 (Perm. Ed 1999) (hereinafter \u201cFletcher\u201d). However, there are exceptions to this general rule. For example, a purchasing corporation can be liable for the debts and liabilities of a selling corporation if \u201cthe purchasing corporation expressly or impliedly agreed to assume such liabilities,\u201d or if \u201cthe transaction is fraudulent in fact.\u201d <em>Harris v. T.I., Inc., </em>243 Va. 63, 413 S.E.2d 605, 609 (1992) (citing <em>Pepper v. Dixie Splint Coal Co., </em>165 Va. 179, 181 S.E. 406, 410 (1935)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These exceptions to the general rule seek to identify only those transactions \u201cwhere the essential and relevant characteristics of the selling corporation survive the asset sale,\u201d thus rendering it equitable to hold the purchaser liable for the seller\u2019s obligations. <em>North Shore Gas Co. v. Salomon, Inc., </em>152 F.3d 642, 651 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The Sureties do not, and could not, contend that RLC expressly assumed Green Thumb\u2019s liabilities. Indeed, section 8 of the Purchase Agreement explicitly states that RLC does \u201cnot assum[e] any debts, liabilities, agreements, contracts or obligations\u201d of Green Thumb, other than those directly related to its asset purchase. J.A.2036. This language is clear and unambiguous on its face, heavily weighing against a finding that RLC impliedly assumed Green Thumb\u2019s liabilities or that the transaction was fraudulent in fact. <em>See </em>Fletcher at 251-52 (\u201cA contract between the seller and purchaser corporations, with explicit provisions which exclude any liability for the debts and liabilities of the predecessor, weighs against finding that an exception can be implied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Moreover, it is well settled that a court should not resort to extrinsic evidence to interpret a contract when the contract\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous. <em>Hitachi Credit America Corp. v. Signet Bank, </em>166 F.3d 614, 624 (4th Cir.1999). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>A court must give plain and unambiguous contract language its \u201clegal effect according to [its] plain, ordinary and popular meaning.\u201d <em>Florom v. Elliott Mfg., </em>867 F.2d 570, 575 (10th Cir.1989). Here, the plain and unambiguous language of the Purchase Agreement states that RLC would not assume the liabilities of Green Thumb. Its language could not be any plainer or less ambiguous. Such express language weighs heavily against any finding of an implied assumption of liabilities or that the transaction was fraudulent in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Nonetheless, the exceptions to the general rule of non-liability allow courts to look outside the four corners of a contract under appropriate circumstances. Such circumstances do not exist here. We have reviewed the Sureties\u2019 evidence supporting their theories of successor liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After reviewing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the Sureties\u2019 favor, <em>see Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, it is evident that the Sureties failed to advance sufficient evidence to defeat the general rule of non-liability. The strongest evidence advanced by the Sureties in support of their claim is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u2022 RLC was aware of Green Thumb\u2019s financial difficulties and the extent of its debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">\u2022 RLC employees helped Green Thumb obtain releases on some of its hens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">\u2022 RLC paid off, rather than purchased, Green Thumb\u2019s debt to NationsBank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">\u2022 RLC covered Green Thumb\u2019s payroll on three occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">\u2022 RLC hired 100 Green Thumb employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">\u2022 RLC approved the July 27 letter from Green Thumb to some of its clients, which stated that Green Thumb and RLC were \u201ccombining\u201d their operations and forming an \u201calliance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">First, RLC\u2019s awareness of Green Thumb\u2019s financial difficulties cannot help the Sureties\u2019 case. It should be of no surprise that a company selling assets has financial difficulties. Indeed, it is often the case that a company sells assets precisely because of its financial difficulties. If we were to craft a rule suggesting that a company would assume the liabilities of a financially-strapped company simply by purchasing its assets, we would eviscerate the general and long-standing rule of non-liability, as well as drastically chill future asset purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">Second, it is of no moment that RLC employees helped Green Thumb obtain releases on some of its leases and liens. RLC sought to purchase Green Thumb\u2019s assets with clear title; it obviously could not do so until Green Thumb obtained the releases. RLC\u2019s assistance in doing so does not imply an assumption of liability or a fraudulent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">Third, there is no evidence that RLC paid off, rather than purchased, Green Thumb\u2019s debt to NationsBank. The undisputed evidence was that RLC negotiated the purchase with NationsBank and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>entered into a forbearance agreement with Green Thumb. Nothing in the record suggests a pay-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Fourth, RLC\u2019s decision to cover Green Thumb\u2019s payroll on three separate occasions is of little note. Indeed, one may argue that, by doing so, RLC helped Green Thumb remain viable longer than it otherwise would have, thereby giving it greater opportunity to obtain funds with which to pay its debts. And, while it is true that RLC hired 100 Green Thumb employees, it hired only employees who worked on Green Thumb\u2019s landscape maintenance contracts, which RLC purchased from Green Thumb. It did not hire employees from Green Thumb\u2019s landscape installation business, which Green Thumb retained. Finally, while the July 27 letter is suspect, the Sureties fail to provide any evidence that any creditor relied on the letter to believe that RLC acquired Green Thumb\u2019s liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The Sureties fail to advance sufficient evidence to defeat the general rule of non-liability. Their strongest evidence fails to even suggest that \u201cthe essential and relevant characteristics of [Green Thumb] survive[d] the asset sale[.]\u201d <em>North Shore Gas Co., </em>152 F.3d at 651. The heavy weight that must be accorded the plain language of the Purchase Agreement simply cannot be circumscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. Green Thumb is not a party to this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\">. The Purchase Agreement further required RLC to pay Green Thumb a \"Base Purchase Price\u201d of $1,564,000 either (1) at closing, or (2) the earlier of (a) the date on which title to any item of equipment could be validly conveyed free of all liens and encumbrances, or (b) August 31, 1995. J.A.2027-28. RLC also pledged to pay ten percent of gross receipts from the maintenance contracts in four annual installments. However, RLC could set off any amounts due Green Thumb against any amounts Green Thumb owed RLC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\">. All parties agree that Virginia law applies to this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b149-9\">. The same analysis underlying the fraud-in-fact theory of successor liability applies to the Sureties' fraudulent conveyance claim.
