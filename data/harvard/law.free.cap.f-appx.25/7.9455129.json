The lawsuits were brought on behalf of listed species of whales, and in one case, also on behalf of listed species of sea turtles. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\"><em>Strahan v. New England Aquarium </em>challenges the practices of whale watch vessels operated by the New England Aquarium and the Dolphin Fleet of Provincetown, Inc. <em>Strahan v. Hurst </em>challenges United States Coast Guard operations. In both cases, defendants filed motions for summary judgment and Strahan sought extensions of time for responding. Roughly three months after the last extension expired, and in the absence of any further filings by Strahan (must less any document supporting an opposition to defendants\u2019 motions), the district court dismissed the two suits for lack of prosecution under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) and on the alternative ground that the motions for summary judgment were well-founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">A summary judgment motion cannot be granted based on an adverse party\u2019s failure to respond. <em>See Carmona v. Toledo, </em>215 F.3d 124 n. 9 (1st Cir.2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e) (if adverse party fails to respond, \u201csummary judgment, <em>if appropriate, </em>shall be entered\u201d) (emphasis added). However, there is some authority that, notwithstanding this rule, a case can be dismissed at the summary judgment stage under Rule 41(b) if the court determines that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to respond constitutes a failure to prosecute. <em>See, e.g., Custer v. Pan American Life Ins. Co., </em>12 F.3d 410, 415 (4th Cir.1993); <em>Lediju v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Sanitation, </em>173 F.R.D. 105, 110 (S.D.N.Y.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">In the instant case, Strahan\u2019s failure to meet the extended deadlines for filing oppositions fell against a recent background of missed deadlines and delay on his part. Contrary to his suggestion, a warning is not an absolute requirement before dismissal. <em>See Robson v. Hallenbeck, </em>81 F.3d 1, 3\u20144 (1st Cir.1996). Strahan had the opportunity to explain his defaults by way of a motion to reinstate. He filed such a motion but did not proffer any valid excuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">Arguably, Strahan\u2019s conduct rose to the level of a failure to prosecute under Rule 41(b). However, we need not decide whether the dismissals can be upheld on this basis alone. The district court did not purport to dismiss the two cases solely on this ground but rather made an independent determination that summary judgment was warranted. Upon review of the record, we, too, are persuaded that the dismissals were otherwise justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">Summary judgment was warranted in <em>New England Aquarium </em>based on Strahan\u2019s failure to comply with Loc. R. 56.1, which justified the court in deeming admitted the facts presented in the movants\u2019 statements of undisputed facts. <em>See Ruiz Rivera v. Riley, </em>209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 2000). Strahan suggests on appeal, without record citation, that the record contains \u201cseveral scientific studies\u201d sufficient to create a material issue of fact. However, the presence of Loe. R. 56.1, requiring Strahan to file a response to guide the court, removed any requirement that otherwise might exist that the district court ferret through the record before ruling on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions. <em>See Jaroma v. Massey, </em>873 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1989). In any event, Strahan fails to specifically identify any of these studies or explain how they enhance his claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The dismissal in <em>Hurst </em>was warranted based on Strahan\u2019s failure to comply with the sixty-day notice requirement before filing suit. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540(g)(2)(A)(i) (providing that a citizen may not bring suit under the ESA prior to sixty days after written notice of an alleged violation has been given to the Secretary and the alleged violator). Strahan sent his notice of intent to sue on March 19, 1998, and the complaint was filed only twenty-eight days later. This court has interpreted the sixty-day notice requirement in environmental statute citizen suits strictly. <em>See Water Keeper Alliance v. United States Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>271 F.3d 21, 29 (1st Cir.2001).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\">. We also reject Strahan\u2019s suggestion that summary judgment was improper because he was provided inadequate opportunity for discovery. Strahan does not articulate what discovery he sought or needed, and, thus, provides no basis to question the district court\u2019s handling of discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b38-8\">. We recognize that the notice mailed in <em>Hurst </em>purported to be a \"continuation\u201d of notices sent between 1989 and 1992. However, in the interim, Strahan litigated <em>Strahan v. Linnon, </em>94cv11128, involving a substantially identical \"takings\" claim. In 1997, <em>Linnon </em>was resolved in the Coast Guard\u2019s favor. <em>See Strahan v. Linnon, </em>967 F.Supp. 581 (D.Mass. 1997). <em>Hurst </em>is based, in part, on events that post-date <em>Linnon. </em>However, to the extent that the second suit could go forward and is not precluded by the first, new notice and a full sixty-day period was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
