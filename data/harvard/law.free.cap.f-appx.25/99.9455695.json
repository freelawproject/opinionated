On appeal, Conyers argues the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of an allegedly illegal stop and seizure. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact on a denial of a motion to suppress for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). We construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). Conyers\u2019 conviction arose from an incident in which police officers approached Conyers and two unidentified men who appeared to be drinking in public on the steps of a residence. Conyers looked at the officers and reached toward the small of his back, which the officers interpreted as Conyers\u2019 effort to hide a firearm or other dangerous object. When Conyers was asked to stand, the officers found ammunition and a firearm behind him. We have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs and are satisfied that to the extent the encounter was an investigatory detention under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), the officers had reasonable suspicion to act as they did. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 8, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (examining police conduct in the context of the totality of the circumstances). Thus, the district court properly denied Conyers\u2019 motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">We therefore affirm Conyers\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
