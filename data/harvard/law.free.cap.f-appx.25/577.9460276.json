Corporation appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the United States in plaintiffs\u2019 action under Internal Revenue Code 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7433 and 7432. We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-18\">Appellants argue that the district court erred in: (1) holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 7433 claims, including alleged violations of the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders; (2) finding that Bjerke had failed to address the statute of limitations argument regarding \u00a7 7432; (3) holding that Federal Contractors and L.J.C. Corporation failed to oppose the government\u2019s motion arguing that both entities could not maintain an action for damages under \u00a7 7433; and (4) failing to consider the destruction of certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b606-20\">Section 7433 is limited to actions taken in connection with the collection of taxes. A taxpayer cannot seek damages under \u00a7 7433 for improper assessment of taxes. <em>Miller v. United States, </em>66 F.3d 220, 223 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Shaw v. United States, </em>20 F.3d 182, 184 (5th Cir.1994). Bjerke argues that the liens issued against him are invalid because the IRS failed to send a statutory notice of deficiency to Bjerke\u2019s correct address. A claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>IRS failed properly to notice deficiencies addresses the merits of an assessment. Therefore, the district court did not have jurisdiction over such a claim. <em>See Huff v. United States, </em>10 F.3d 1440, 1445 (9th Cir.1993); <em>Elias v. Connett, </em>908 F.2d 521, 527 (9th Cir.1990). In addition, the notice of deficiency requirement under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6212 falls under chapter 63 of the tax code which is entitled \u201cassessment.\u201d This illustrates that the failure to send a notice of deficiency is part of the assessment process. <em>Cf. Miller, </em>66 F.3d at 222 (\u201cBecause the statutory requirements of \u2018notice and demand\u2019 [for payment after the IRS has made an assessment pursuant to \u00a7 6203] are under \u00a7 6303, chapter 64, Collection, \u2018notice and demand\u2019 is a collection procedure.\u201d); <em>Ludtke v. United States, </em>84 F.Supp.2d 294, 303 (D.Conn.1999) (holding that the lien procedures are a collection practice because the lien procedures are listed under Chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code entitled \u201cCollection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Bjerke\u2019s argument that alleged violations of the bankruptcy court\u2019s automatic stay are cognizable under \u00a7 7433 also fails. Section 7433 only authorizes suits for violations of the title in which it appears \u2014 Title 26. Thus, violations of the bankruptcy code are not cognizable under the terms of the version of \u00a7 7433 in effect at the time Bjerke brought his action. Bjerke argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court has jurisdiction over the IRS\u2019 alleged violation of the bankruptcy court\u2019s stay and discharge under \u00a7 7433 because the IRS\u2019 actions violated \u00a7 6325 of Title 26. We will not consider this claim because it was not presented to the trial court. <em>Singleton v. Wulff </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976); <em>EEOC v. Dinuba Med. Clinic, </em>222 F.3d 580, 585 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Summary judgment was properly granted for defendants on the other claims as well. Bjerke\u2019s \u00a7 7432 claim, which is based on allegedly invalid post-petition liens occurring in 1996 and 1997, fails because he has alleged exhaustion only of his complaints about liens occurring prior to 1994. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7432(d)(1) (requiring exhaustion). L.J.C. Corporation and Federal Contractors\u2019 claims fail because both \u00a7\u00a7 7432 and 7433 allow only the \u201ctaxpayer\u201d to sue. <em>See Allied/Royal Parking L.P. v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 1000, 1003 (9th Cir.1999) (discussing \u00a7 7433). To the extent they could have brought wrongful levy claims under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426, such claims are barred because they were not brought within the nine months of the allegedly wrongful levies. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6532(c)(1), 7426(h). Because all plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7\u00a7 7432 and 7433 claims fail, summary judgment was properly also granted on plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">TV</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Because we have concluded that the district court properly granted summary judgment on all claims for the reasons given above, we need not reach the other arguments raised by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b606-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
