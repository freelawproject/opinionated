Although Hernandez eventually obtained expungement of his convictions under California\u2019s rehabilitative statute, Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4, the Board held that the expunged convictions could nevertheless serve as the ground for denying Hernandez suspension of deportation. We have upheld the Board\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cconviction\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A) as allowing the INS to ignore state rehabilitative expungements for immigration purposes. <em>Murillo-Espinoza v.
