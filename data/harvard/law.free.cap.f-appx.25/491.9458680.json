The district court dismissed Murphy\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-24\">Upon our de novo review, see <em>Cooper v. Schriro, </em>189 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam), we affirm the dismissal as to the police officers because Missouri offers an adequate postdeprivation remedy for their alleged conduct, <em>see Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 530-36, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (random and unauthorized property deprivations do not violate Due Process Clause if state provides adequate postdeprivation remedy); <em>Orebaugh v. Caspari, </em>910 F.2d 526, 527 (8th Cir. 1990) (per curiam) (Missouri provides adequate postdeprivation remedy for property seizures). We reverse, however, as to Head, Barrett, and the City, because a postdeprivation remedy will not satisfy the Due Process Clause in situations where the deprivation was authorized. <em>See Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 530-36, 104 S.Ct. 3194; <em>Lathon v. City of St. Louis, </em>242 F.3d 841, 842-44 (8th Cir.2001) (authorized decision on behalf of City not to return plaintiffs property is not action for which postdeprivation process will suffice, because availability of state law remedies bears relevance only where challenged acts of state officials can be characterized as random and unauthorized).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Accordingly, we remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
