The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 78 months in prison and five years supervised release. Padilla appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and the denial of his request for a downward departure. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-22\">At trial, two witnesses testified that Padilla sold them resale quantities of methamphetamine, and introduced one of them to other methamphetamine sources. Another witness testified that Padilla and an alleged conspirator provided a reseller with methamphetamine which was stored for later distribution. The jurors were free to accept or reject any witness\u2019s testimony in whole or in part. <em>See United States v. One Star, </em>979 F.2d 1319, 1321 (8th Cir.1992). Examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict and giving the verdict the benefit of all reasonable inferences, <em>see United States v. Robinson, </em>217 F.3d 560, 564 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 999, 121 S.Ct. 497, 148 L.Ed.2d 468 (2000), we conclude the evidence supports Padilla\u2019s conspiracy conviction. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>91 F.3d 1160, 1162 (8th Cir.1996) (evidence of multiple sales of resale quantities of drugs is sufficient to make submissible case of conspiracy to distribute); <em>United States v. Dugan, </em>238 F.3d 1041, 1044-45 (8th Cir. 2001) (appellate court does not reweigh evidence or judge credibility of witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-23\">The district court\u2019s discretionary decision to deny Padilla\u2019s request to depart downward is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Saelee, </em>123 F.3d 1024, 1025 (8th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we affirm and deny Padilla\u2019s pending motion for new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-24\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-20\">. The HONORABLE RICHARD G.
