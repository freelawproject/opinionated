Daniels, Sr., appeals from the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board dismissing his appeal for lack df jurisdiction. <em>Daniels v. United States Postal Serv., </em>88 M.S.P.R. 630 (2001) <em>(\u201cDaniels II\u201d). </em>Because the Board did not err in dismissing the appeal, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">On February 13, 1999, Mr. Daniels began serving a ninety-day initial probationary period as a Mail Handler at the United States Postal Service (\u201cthe agency\u201d). The agency terminated Daniels on May 4, 1999, before the expiration of the probationary period, purportedly for \u201cfailure to meet the requirements of [his] position.\u201d Letter from Yolanda Briseno, Human Resources Specialist, U.S. Postal Service, to Stephen M. Daniels (May 4,1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Daniels challenged his removal by filing a complaint at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) alleging unlawful race and age discrimination, and an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board alleging unlawful discrimination against a veteran under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d) of 1994, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301. As a result of a settlement of his EEOC complaint, Daniels was reinstated to his position in the agency and partially compensated. Daniels continued to pursue his appeal to the Board, seeking his remaining lost income and benefits as well as the same employment status as others hired at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">After a hearing at which Daniels and his supervisor, Ms. Linda Moore, testified, an administrative judge of the Board found that, although the agency\u2019s purported ground for termination (poor performance) was not plausible, Daniels had not proved a <em>prima facie </em>case of a USERRA violation and therefore denied his appeal. <em>Daniels v. United States Postal Serv., </em>No. DA-3443-99-0480-I-2 (MSPB Nov. 11, 2000) <em>(\u201cDaniels I\u201d). </em>The full Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that Daniels\u2019 allegations did not raise a claim that his military service was the motivating factor in his termination and thus did not raise a USERRA claim. <em>Daniels II, </em>88 M.S.P.R. at 632-33. Daniels timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">The scope of our review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it was: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Jennings v. MSPB, </em>59 F.3d 159, 160 (Fed.Cir.1995). The Board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to those actions specifically enumerated by law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a) (2000); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3(a) (2001). The scope of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Bolton v. MSPB, </em>154 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed.Cir.1998). Daniels has the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">On appeal, Daniels argues that the Board gave insufficient weight to the friction between him and Moore, friction that he attributes to his military experience training supervisors, documenting training procedures, and other events. For example, Daniels informed Moore that his performance evaluations were overdue and that the length of shifts at the \u201cdumper\u201d machine presented a safety hazard. According to Daniels, as a result of his military experience, he was able to identify discriminatory practice, poor supervision, and the need for proper documentation of training. Daniels reasons that those abilities were the cause of his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">USERRA prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of military service, stating in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-13\">A person who ... has performed ... uniformed service shall not be denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that ... performance of service ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311 (1994). An employee claiming discrimination under USERRA bears the initial burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee\u2019s military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action. <em>Sheehan v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed.Cir.2001) (citations omitted). Daniels has not met that burden. Rather, his allegations amount to disagreement with the agency concerning workplace operations, including how new employees should be trained, how supervisors should do their jobs, and how long shifts should last. The fact that those disagreements may have been influenced by his military experience is not sufficient to constitute discrimination under USERRA. Daniels was not terminated because of his military service. We therefore conclude that the Board did not err in determining that Daniels had not alleged a USERRA claim sufficient to confer jurisdiction to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">We have considered Daniels\u2019s remaining arguments and find them unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Because the Board\u2019s dismissal of Daniels\u2019s appeal was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
