The district court sentenced Smith to consecutive eighty-five-month terms of imprisonment. Smith appeals, challenging his eighty-five-month sentence on Count 4 and the validity of his guilty plea. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal based upon Smith\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal his sentence. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-27\">In his plea agreement, Smith waived the right to appeal his sentence on any ground whatsoever. The district court accepted Smith\u2019s guilty plea at a hearing conducted in accordance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. We have reviewed Smith\u2019s plea agreement and the Rule 11 colloquy and find that Smith made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal his sentence on Count 4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>See United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402-03 (4th Cir.2000) (providing standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Although Smith contends that the waiver is unenforceable because his sentence violates the rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that he should have been sentenced under the one-year statutory maximum for marijuana offenses set forth in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(4), 844 (West 1999), we do not agree. Smith\u2019s eighty-five-month sentence falls within the ten-year statutory maximum sentence applicable to offenses involving less than fifty kilograms of marijuana that were committed by a person, like Smith, who has a prior conviction for a felony drug offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that prescribed statutory maximum for single conviction under \u00a7 841 for undetermined amount of marijuana is five years). Because the sentence on Count 4 does not exceed the statutory maximum, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Smith\u2019s appeal of his sentence and dismiss this portion of the appeal. <em>See United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Smith also challenges the validity of his guilty plea on the ground that the district court, by relying on his admissions at sentencing as to drug amounts, violated the term of the plea agreement that provided that truthful information from Smith would not be used to enhance his guideline range. Contrary to Smith\u2019s assertion, the admissions on which the court relied served to reduce the amount of drugs for which Smith was held accountable from the amount attributed to him in the presentence report. We therefore find that Smith is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Accordingly, we affirm in part and dismiss in part. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
