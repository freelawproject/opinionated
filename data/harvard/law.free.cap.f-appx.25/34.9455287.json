Platt, <em>Judge, </em>on remand following the resolution of the appeal from his conviction, <em>see United States v. Ben Zvi, </em>168 F.3d 49, 61 (2d Cir.) <em>(\u201cBen Zvi </em>I\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 872, 120 S.Ct. 176, 145 L.Ed.2d 148 (1999). In <em>Ben Zvi I, </em>which encompassed appeals by Ben Zvi and his sister <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Luiz Ben Zvi (\u201cLuiz\u201d), this Court (a) reversed, on statute-of-limitations and multiplicity grounds, both defendants\u2019 convictions on certain counts of domestic and international money laundering; (b) left standing, <em>inter alia, </em>Ben Zvi\u2019s convictions on one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud, international money laundering, and tax fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, two counts of international money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), and two counts of tax fraud in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1); and (c) remanded for resentencing on the unreversed counts. On resentencing, the district court sentenced Ben Zvi principally to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release, and ordered him to pay restitution in the amount of $6,624,512. On this appeal, Ben Zvi contends (1) that his prosecution on the two unreversed international money laundering counts was barred by the statute of limitations; (2) that his money laundering convictions should be reversed as a result of material false testimony; (3) that the district court erred in increasing his Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) offense level on the ground that he played a leadership role in the offense; and (4) that the court erred in taking into account amounts alleged in the time-barred money laundering charges when it sentenced him on the timely counts. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the appeal lacks merit, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Ben Zvi\u2019s first two contentions are barred by the mandate rule. That principle \u201ccompels compliance [by the district court] on remand with the dictates of the superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or <em>impliedly </em>decided by the appellate court.\u201d <em>United States v. [Luiz] Ben Zvi, </em>242 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(\u201cLuiz Ben Zvi\u201d) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in <em>Luiz Ben </em>Zvi); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Fernandez, </em>506 F.2d 1200, 1202-03 (2d Cir.1974). Thus, where an appellate court has already fully considered the underlying merits of a conviction and has remanded merely for resentencing, the trial court generally is foreclosed from reconsidering the merits of the conviction. <em>See Luiz Ben Zvi, </em>242 F.3d at 95. The mandate rule also bars the district court from revisiting an issue that could have been, but was not, raised in the initial appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Stanley, </em>54 F.3d 103, 107 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 891, 116 S.Ct. 238, 133 L.Ed.2d 166 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Our mandate in <em>Ben Zvi I </em>stated that \u201c[w]e remand the case to the district court to reconsider sentencing\u201d as to both Ben Zvi and Luiz, \u201cincluding forfeiture as to Roz Ben Zvi, and [the] order of restitution.\u201d <em>Ben Zvi I, </em>168 F.3d at 61. Thereafter, Luiz appealed from the new judgment entered against her following the <em>Ben Zvi I </em>remand and sought to challenge the underlying conviction on her unreversed count; we rejected that challenge because \u201c[o]ur mandate in <em>Ben Zvi I </em>\u201d was \u201cunambiguously limited in scope\u201d to sentencing and \u201ccannot reasonably be construed to authorize consideration by the district judge of issues relating to the underlying merits of the conviction,\u201d <em>Luiz Ben Zvi, </em>242 F.3d at 95. Accordingly, we held that the district court did not err on remand in Luiz\u2019s case in \u201cnot considering the timeliness of the wire fraud conspiracy charge, as authority to do so was lacking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Ben Zvi\u2019s case, as in Luiz\u2019s case, the district court on remand was limited to considering sentencing, including forfeiture and restitution. The authority granted to the district court under the mandate did not extend to considering whether the unreversed international money laundering counts were time-barred or whether Ben <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Zvi\u2019s conviction on any unreversed count should be reversed for material false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We also reject Ben Zvi\u2019s argument that the mandate rule should not bar reconsideration of the merits of the two unreversed money laundering counts because the attorney who represented him in <em>Ben Zvi I </em>rendered ineffective assistance by failing to make the present statute-of-limitations challenge to those counts on that appeal. In order to succeed in that argument, Ben Zvi would have to show (a) that counsel\u2019s failure to advance the present contention in the initial appeal constituted professional performance that was below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (b) that if the contention had been advanced, the outcome of that appeal would likely have been different, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). He has not met either prong of this test. The pre-indictment stipulation into which Ben Zvi entered with the government may reasonably be read as precluding his present statute-of-limitations contention. The reasonableness of that interpretation means that Ben Zvi has shown neither that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient nor that those counts would likely have been reversed had the contention been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We also reject Ben Zvi\u2019s argument that there was an absence of findings and evidence that he was a \u201cleader\u201d or \u201corganizer\u201d and that the district court thus erred in increasing his offense level pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.1 based on his leadership role. The court found that his offenses involved at least four knowing participants and at least seven \u201c \u2018unknowing\u2019 participants whose activities were <em>organized or led </em>by the defendant with specific criminal intent and [whose] services were peculiar and necessary to the criminal scheme,\" Memorandum and Order dated July 18, 2000, at 2 (emphasis added), and that the conspiracy and money laundering activity was \u201cotherwise extensive,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court\u2019s findings were supported by the evidence at trial, which the court expressly credited; they were not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Brinkworth, </em>68 F.3d 633, 641 (2d Cir.1995); and they were sufficient to support the role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Finally, we reject Ben Zvi\u2019s contention that the district court violated the principle of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or otherwise erred, in considering amounts alleged in the time-barred money laundering counts when calculating his sentence. <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply where, as here, the sentence imposed is below the statutory maximum. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garcia, </em>240 F.3d 180, 183 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 2615, 150 L.Ed.2d 769 (2001). And the sentencing court is required to take into account relevant conduct, <em>see </em>Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.3, which may include conduct for which prosecution is time-barred, <em>see United States v. Silkowski, </em>32 F.3d 682, 688 (2d Cir.1994). We see no error in the court\u2019s calculation of Ben Zvi\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">We have considered all of Ben Zvi\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
