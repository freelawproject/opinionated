We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand for further administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>This is the second round of appeals involving Reed\u2019s application for disability insurance benefits. In the first round, the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) concluded that Reed was not disabled after rejecting Reed\u2019s testimony as not credible. The district court upheld the credibility finding, but remanded the case for further administrative proceedings to consider additional evidence. The ALJ held a supplemental hearing and concluded that Reed was not entitled to disability insurance benefits because he became disabled after December 31, 1993, the date upon which his insured status expired. The ALJ again disregarded Reed\u2019s testimony concerning his pain and limitations. The district court affirmed and held that the prior adverse credibility determination should be given <em>res judicata </em>effect in this round of proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">On appeal to this court, Reed argues that the district court erred by affirming the ALJ\u2019s rejection of his testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ disregarded Reed\u2019s testimony on the ground that his \u201cstatements concerning his impairments and their impact on his ability to work are not entirely consistent with the paucity of objective findings in the record, but they are consistent with his diagnosis of somatoform disorder.\u201d We agree with Reed\u2019s contention that the ALJ improperly discredited his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Although an ALJ may disbelieve or disregard pain testimony, the \u201creason for rejecting the ... testimony must be clear and convincing and supported by specific findings. It\u2019s not sufficient for the ALJ to make only general findings; he must state which pain testimony is not credible and what evidence suggests the complaints are not credible. He must either accept [Reed\u2019s] testimony or make specific findings rejecting it.\u201d <em>Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 918 (9th Cir.1993) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Here, the ALJ\u2019s blanket statement that Reed\u2019s testimony is not consistent with the objective findings is not a clear and convincing reason supported by specific findings. Indeed, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion is particularly puzzling given the fact that he found that the testimony is consistent with a diagnosis of somatoform disorder. That Reed suffers from somatoform disorder means that he experiences physical symptoms for which there are no demonstrable organic findings and for which there is a strong presumption that the symptoms are linked to psychological factors. <em>See </em>STEDMAN\u2019S MEDICAL DICTIONARY 510 (26th ed.1995). Thus, one cannot expect Reed\u2019s allegations of physical limitations and pain to be confined to objective physical examination to the extent they are psychologically enhanced. If Reed, in fact, suffers from psychologically-enhanced symptoms, they can form a proper basis for determining disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">We therefore remand this case to the district court for further remand to the Commissioner of Social Security for consideration of Reed\u2019s application for benefits consistent with this memorandum disposition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In deciding what weight to give to Reed\u2019s testimony, the ALJ should con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>sider the psychological evaluations of Dr. Glaus and Dr. Dixon, but should not give <em>res judicata </em>effect to the adverse credibility determination in the previous proceeding. If the ALJ determines that Reed\u2019s allegations concerning his impairments should be disregarded, the ALJ must support this decision with specific findings which are, in turn, supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Reed shall have and recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b563-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">. Reed's subjective allegations about the intensity and effects of his impairments are relevant to determine whether he has the residual functional capacity to perform work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\">. After Reed filed this appeal, the Commissioner filed a motion to remand the case to the district court with instructions to remand for further administrative proceedings. The Commissioner agrees that the district court erred in holding that the prior credibility determination is binding as <em>res judicata </em>in this proceeding. In light of our decision to remand, the Commissioner\u2019s motion is rendered moot and is denied on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
