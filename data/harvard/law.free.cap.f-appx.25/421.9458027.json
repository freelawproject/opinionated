Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b449-17\">Albert James Keenum, a pro se Michigan prisoner, appeals from a district court order dismissing his civil rights action filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-19\">Seeking monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, Keenum sued the Michigan Department of Corrections, alleging that he was transferred to a new facility and assigned a new security level without first receiving notice. The district court concluded that Keenum\u2019s claims were frivolous and dismissed the case. Keenum has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-20\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Keenum\u2019s complaint as frivolous. This court reviews de novo a district court judgment dismissing a suit as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(b). <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 866-67 (6th Cir. 2000). A complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable or rational basis either in law or in fact. <em>Id. </em>at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-21\">Keenum\u2019s claims lack an arguable or rational basis in law. A prisoner does not have a constitutional right to placement in any particular prison, <em>Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 245, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983), or in a particular security classification. <em>Montanye v. Haymes, </em>427 U.S. 236, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 49 L.Ed.2d 466 (1976). While Keenum also argues that the transfer has adversely affected his ability to act as a legal advisor to other inmates, he has no independent right to help other prisoners with their legal claims. <em>Smith v. Campbell, </em>250 F.3d 1032, 1037 n. 1 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Thaddeus-X v. Blatter, </em>175 F.3d 378, 395 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc); <em>see also Shaw v. Murphy, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>582 U.S. 223, 121 S.Ct. 1475, 1479-80, 149 L.Ed.2d 420 (2001) (holding that prisoners do not possess a special First Amendment right to provide legal assistance to fellow inmates).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Accordingly, this court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
