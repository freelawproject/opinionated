Niss contends that his father Stanley Niss wrote the story outline, screenplay, and motion picture Pendulum (collectively the \u201cPendulum properties\u201d). Niss farther argues that he is entitled to the renewal copyright in the Pendulum properties, as the sole heir of his father, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 304(a)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Columbia claims that it owns the renewal copyrights because the Pendulum properties were \u201cworks for hire.\u201d Columbia asserts that the Pendulum story outline and screenplay were created at the \u201cinstance and expense\u201d of MGM, which transferred to Columbia by contract all rights it had in the Pendulum properties. And Columbia argues that Niss produced the motion picture at its \u201cinstance and expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">For substantially the reasons stated in Judge Preska\u2019s careful and thorough Order and Memorandum of December 21, 2000 and Judgment of December 22, 2000, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
