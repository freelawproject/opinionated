Because no statute was improperly retroactively applied to Villasenor, he was not denied due process, and his sentence did not violate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we conclude that Villasenor\u2019s deportation was valid and therefore AFFIRM his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Villasenor, a citizen of Mexico, was accorded lawful permanent resident status in 1990. In June 1996, he pled guilty to robbery. Villasenor was not deportable at the time of his plea. He was sentenced to 180 days custody and five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">In April 1996, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (codified in relevant part at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182 (1996)). Section 440(d) of AEDPA rendered aliens convicted of aggravated felonies, regardless of the length of their sentence, ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Villasenor pled guilty after AEDPA was enacted, but because his crime was not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for which he could be deported the change in eligibility requirements in AEDPA did not affect him.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-15\">Then in September 1996, after Villasenor\u2019s guilty plea, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (codified in relevant part at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101, 1182, 1224,1229,1230, and 1252 (1996)). Section 321 of IIRIRA reduced the sentence required to trigger \u201caggravated felony\u201d status for a crime of violence from five years to one year imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (1996). Moreover, \u00a7 304 of IIRIRA repealed \u00a7 212(c) relief entirely, replacing it with a procedure called \u201ccancellation of removal.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b (1996). Consistent with AEDPA, \u00a7 304 of IIRIRA provided that cancellation of removal is not available to an alien convicted of any aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) (1996). These changes did not affect Villasenor either, as he was sentenced to a term of less than one year imprisonment, and thus was still neither an aggravated felon nor deportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-16\">In June 1997, Villasenor\u2019s parole was revoked and he was sentenced to two additional years in custody. By the time he was released in 1999, Villasenor had served over one year in prison, thereby rendering his offense an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the 1996 amendments. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>commenced deportation proceedings against him, and the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) ordered that he be deported. Villasenor appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), but the BIA affirmed on the basis that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 \"U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">In September 1999, Villasenor was indicted for attempted reentry into the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He moved the district court to dismiss the indictment on the basis that his deportation was invalid because the IJ had not informed him of his right to seek a discretionary waiver of removal. He also submitted a declaration that he believed he would not be deported when he entered his guilty plea, and that if he was deportable, he believed at that time he had the right to seek a discretionary waiver. The court denied the motion, and Villasenor entered a conditional guilty plea to the \u00a7 1326 charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Villasenor now appeals his conviction. He argues that his \u00a7 1326 conviction cannot stand because it was based on an unlawful deportation, because in his deportation hearing the IJ improperly applied AEDPA and IIRIRA retroactively to deny him \u00a7 212(c) discretionary relief. He further argues that his Due Process rights were violated by the application of AEDPA and IIRIRA, as well as by the use of his deportation as an element of a \u00a7 1326 violation. Finally he challenges his sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We will consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">AEDPA AND IIRIRA WERE PROPERLY APPLIED TO VILLASENOR</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Villasenor first claims that AEDPA and IIRIRA were improperly retroactively applied to him. We review the district court\u2019s determination whether a statute applies retroactively <em>de novo. See Means v. Nortern Cheyenne Tribal Court, </em>154 F.3d 941, 943 (9th Cir.1998), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Enas, </em>(en banc) 255 F.3d 662 (9th Cir.2001). We hold that neither AEDPA nor IIRIRA was improperly applied to Villasenor.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">A. <em>Application of AEDPA to Villasenor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) rendered aliens convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182 (1996). It became relevant for Villasenor only upon his service of one year of custody for his robbery conviction, because that is when he became an aggravated felon ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. That was not until 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">The issue for our review is whether application of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) to a defendant who had not been convicted of an aggravated felony at the time AEDPA was passed, but subsequently became an aggravated felon, is appropriate. It clearly is. That is straightforward prospective application of a statute, which is certainly lawful. Because there is no genuine retro-activity here, application of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) to Villasenor was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">\n<em>B. Application of \u00a7 S21 of IIRIRA to Villasenor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">IIRIRA \u00a7 321 reduced the sentence required to trigger \u201caggravated fel-. on\u201d status from five years to one year imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (1996). In <em>Aragoru-Ayon v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 847 (9th Cir.2000), this Court held that Congress clearly expressed its intent that \u00a7 321 was to be applied retroactively to crimes committed before IIRIRA\u2019s enactment. <em>See </em>206 F.3d at 853. This squarely governs Villasenor\u2019s case. The robbery that Villasenor committed before IIRIRA was enacted became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>an aggravated felony when Villasenor served a year in prison for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\n<em>C. Application of \u00a7 SOU of IIRIRA to Villasenor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">IIRIRA \u00a7 304 repealed \u00a7 212(c) relief entirely and replaced it with a procedure called \u201ccancellation of removal\u201d. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229b (1996). Because Villasenor was not deportable until he became an aggravated felon in 1998, he was never eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief, <em>see supra. </em>Therefore, passage of this section did not affect him at all. When Villasenor became deportable in 1998, he became eligible for whatever relief from deportation was available to aliens in his position at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Villasenor argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) controls his case. He is mistaken. In <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 212(c) relief remains available for aliens, like St. Cyr, whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who <em>would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect. See </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. at 2287-93. Villasenor is not similarly situated to St. Cyr. He was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of his plea, because he was not then deportable. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>St. Cyr </em>does not govern Villasenor\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">VILLASENOR\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WERE NOT VIOLATED</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Villasenor next claims that his due process rights were violated by the application of AEDPA and IIRIRA to him, as well as by the use of his deportation as an element of his \u00a7 1326 offense. Aliens in deportation proceedings must be accorded due process. <em>See United States v. Lara-Aceves, </em>183 F.3d 1007, 1011 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1095, 120 S.Ct. 836, 145 L.Ed.2d 702 (2000), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). We review the district court\u2019s determination whether a statute denies a defendant due process <em>de novo. See United States v. Hanousek, </em>176 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir. 1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1102, 120 S.Ct. 860, 145 L.Ed.2d 710 (2000). Villasenor\u2019s due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">\n<em>A. Application of AEDPA and IIRIRA Did Not Violate Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Villasenor claims that he was denied due process when AEDPA and IIRIRA were retroactively applied to him. Because there was no retroactive application of AEDPA or IIRIRA \u00a7 304, <em>see supra, </em>we will address this claim with respect only to \u00a7 321 of IIRIRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">This due process claim fails. Villasenor argues that he has a due process right not to be deemed ineligible for discretionary relief from removal based on the expanded definition of aggravated felony found in IIRIRA \u00a7 321. The critical flaw in this argument is that aliens have no legal entitlement to suspension of deportation. \u201c[T]he Attorney General\u2019s suspension of deportation [is] \u201can act of grace\u201d which is accorded pursuant to [his] \u2018unfettered discretion\u2019, <em>Jay v. Boyd, </em>351 U.S. 345, 354, 76 S.Ct. 919, 925, 100 L.Ed. 1242 (1956), ..., and [can be likened, as Judge Learned Hand observed,] to \u201ca judge\u2019s power to suspend the execution of a sentence, or the President\u2019s to pardon a convict,\u201d 351 U.S. at 354 n. 16, 76 S.Ct. 919 ... <em>INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, </em>519 U.S. 26, 30, 117 S.Ct. 350, 352-53, 136 L.Ed.2d 288 (1996). No due process rights attach to this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">Villasenor has no constitutionally protected right to discretionary relief from removal, so he cannot, at least in these circumstances, claim a substantive due process violation based on Congress\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>sion in IIRIRA to make a broader class of aliens ineligible for this relief. In any event, Villasenor fails to show that Congress\u2019s decision to apply its expanded definition of aggravated felony to convictions predating IIRIRA was irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">\n<em>B. Use of Deportation as Element of \u00a7 1326 Offense Did Not Violate Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Villasenor argues that he was denied due process when his deportation, which was based on a retroactive application of AEDPA and IIRIRA, was used as an element of his offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Again, because only IIRIRA \u00a7 321 was applied retroactively, his claim will be addressed only with regard to that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Villasenor cites no authoritative opinion supporting this argument. In fact, the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 838, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 2155, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987), assumed that a valid deportation proceeding could be used as the predicate for a \u00a7 1326 offense. Moreover, the retroactive application of IIRIRA \u00a7 321 in Villasenor\u2019s case was perfectly appropriate, <em>see supra, </em>and such application neither renders suspect his deportation, nor the use of that deportation as an element of the \u00a7 1326 charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Although Villasenor concedes that an alien does not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel during a deportation proceeding, he argues that \u00a7 1326 unconstitutionally authorizes the use of the uncounselled deportation as an element of the \u00a7 1326 offense. He also argues that using a deportation as a predicate for a \u00a7 1326 offense offends due process because deportation proceedings use relaxed rules of evidence and summary procedures. However, in <em>Lara-Aceves, </em>183 F.3d at 1011, this Court held the use of a deportation proceeding to support a \u00a7 1326 charge comports with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">VILLASENOR DOES NOT HAVE A VALID <em>APPRENDI </em>CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Villasenor finally challenges his sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This argument fails as a result of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir. 2000), as <em>amended on reh\u2019g </em>(Feb. 8, 2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001), and we summarily reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Because AEDPA and IIRIRA were properly applied to him, his due process rights were not violated, and his sentence does not violate <em>Apprendi, </em>Villasenor\u2019s appeal of his deportation fails. Villasenor\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b587-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-17\">.
