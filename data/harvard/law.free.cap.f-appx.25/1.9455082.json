After according the briefs and arguments full'consideration, the court has determined that the issues occasion no need for a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-20\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant Commeree\u2019s Americans with Disabilities Act claim because the record establishes that Commeree was not \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d within the meaning of the Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112; <em>see also </em>Congressional Accountability Act, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311, 1331 (extending the ADA to congressional employees). Like the district court, we base this conclusion in part on the March 21, 1996 letter from Commeree\u2019s doctor to Lawrence Stoffel, Superintendent, Senate Office Buildings. Commeree cannot object to our reliance on this letter as he himself submitted it-in triplicate \u2014 to the district court in response to Appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-21\">Reviewing de novo Appellant\u2019s retaliatory dismissal claim, we find that Commeree failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Crv. P. 12(b)(6). The record indicates that Appellees fired Commeree because he refused either to return to his job or to accept a position better suited to his abilities. This is a legitimate rationale for terminating an employee: Contrary to appellant counsel\u2019s assertion at oral argument, the law does not generally grant employees the right to continue to receive payment for jobs they decline to perform. Commeree points to nothing in the record to suggest that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>legitimate rationale for his termination was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">In all other respects, we affirm substantially for the reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">ORDERED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. <em>See </em>D.C. Rule 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
