She contends that we should reverse the district court\u2019s order, and direct that her application for benefits be granted. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">Buckmaster is a male to female transsexual who filed an application for SSI benefits, claiming that she is disabled due to various psychological disorders. Her application was denied initially and upon reconsideration. After a hearing, an Administration Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) determined that Buckmaster was not disabled and, therefore, not entitled to disability insurance benefits. The Appeals Council declined review.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">Buckmaster sought review in the district court. The district court affirmed the ALJ in most respects, but held that the ALJ had failed to address Dr. Sally J. Grosscup\u2019s finding of a major depressive disorder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court remanded the case for further consideration of Dr. Grosscup\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">On appeal to this court, Buckmaster argues that the ALJ improperly disregarded, and the district court failed to properly credit, the medical opinions of Drs. Grosscup, Kurlycheck, and Rogers. Additionally, Buckmaster contends that the ALJ misapplied the statute\u2019s durational requirement for disability. Finally, Buckmaster contends that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the vocational expert were legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>deficient. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\n<em>The Medical Opinions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Buckmaster\u2019s first argument is that the ALJ improperly disregarded the medical opinions of Drs. Grosscup, Kurlycheck, and Rogers, and that the district court erred by failing to credit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The ALJ may reject a treating or examining physician\u2019s uncontradicted medical opinion only for \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reasons. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995). \u201cEven if the treating [or examining] doctor\u2019s opinion is contradicted by another doctor, the Commissioner may not reject this opinion without providing specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record for so doing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201c \u2018[W]here the Commissioner fails to provide adequate reasons for rejecting the opinion of a treating or examining physician, we credit that opinion \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.) <em>(quoting Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1038, 121 S.Ct. 628, 148 L.Ed.2d 537 (2000). There are three medical opinions at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">A. <em>Dr. Sally J. Grosscup</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Dr. Grosscup, a licensed psychologist, diagnosed Buckmaster as having a major depressive disorder, transvestite fetish, and schizotypal personality disorder. Dr. Grosscup also concluded that Buckmaster \u201cis not ... capable of seeking and maintaining ... a normal employment situation due to [her] extreme discomfort with people, [her] bizarre presentation and potentially psychotic state.\u201d The ALJ rejected Dr. Grosscup\u2019s conclusions and diagnoses. We affirm the district court\u2019s holding that this rejection was legally erroneous because it was not based on clear and convincing reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Buckmaster contends that the district court should have credited the opinion as true. We agree with Buckmaster. An improperly rejected medical opinion becomes true as a matter of law. <em>See Harman, </em>211 F.3d at 1178; <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834. On remand, the ALJ must accept Dr. Grosscup\u2019s conclusions and diagnoses.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">\n<em>B. Dr. Diane E. Rogers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">Dr. Rogers was Buckmaster\u2019s treating psychologist. Therefore, her opinion may be rejected only for \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reasons. <em>See Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Dr. Rogers diagnosed Buckmaster as having a personality disorder, major depression, anxiety . disorder, and gender identity disorder. Dr. Rogers concluded that Buckmaster had been disabled during the entire two years that she had treated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">The ALJ rejected Dr. Rogers\u2019 opinion for two reasons. First, the ALJ found that Dr. Rogers\u2019 opinion, expressed in her February 20, 1997 letter, was \u201cinconsistent with the longitudinal history recorded in her counseling record [specifically, her May 16, 1996 mental status report].\u201d A review of the February 20, 1997 letter and the May 16, 1996 mental status report, however, does not reveal any inconsistency. Although the ALJ quoted a portion of the May 16, 1996 mental status report stating that Buckmaster is \u201ccapable of learning new tasks, understanding and remembering information and to do work-related activities,\u201d the report also stated that Buckmaster suffered from anxiety, depression, sleeping and eating difficulties, loneliness, boredom, isolation, lack of energy, and social withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">The ALJ\u2019s second reason for rejecting Dr. Rogers\u2019 opinion was that Dr. Rogers misstated the findings of Dr. Kurlycheck. According to the ALJ, Dr. Rogers stated in her February 20, 1997 letter that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>was in agreement with Dr. Kurlyeheck\u2019s diagnosis of major depression; but, commented the ALJ, Dr. Kurlycheck never diagnosed major depression. This comment mischaracterizes Dr. Rogers\u2019 letter. She did not state that she was in agreement with <em>Dr. Kurlycheck\u2019s </em>diagnosis of major depression. What she said was that she concurred \u201cwith all of the major conclusions and observations made by Dr. Kurlycheck.\u201d Then, in a separate paragraph, she summarized her <em>own </em>four diagnoses, one of which was major depression. The fact that the four diagnoses described in Dr. Rogers\u2019 letter are <em>her </em>diagnoses, and not Dr. Kurlycheck\u2019s diagnoses, is also supported by Dr. Rogers\u2019 testimony at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Because the ALJ failed to provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Dr. Rogers\u2019 opinion, on remand that opinion must be credited and accepted as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>C. Dr. Robert T. Kurlycheck</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Dr. Kurlycheck conducted a clinical interview and administered psychological tests to Buckmaster. Dr. Kurlycheck diagnosed Buckmaster with, <em>inter alia, </em>gender identity disorder, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and personality disorder. Dr. Kurlycheck also found that Buckmaster had \u201cmarked\u201d limitations regarding: (1) her ability to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and to perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods, and (2) her ability to get along with co-workers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">As noted by the district court, the ALJ did not expressly discredit Dr. Kurlycheck\u2019s opinion. Indeed, the ALJ acknowledged Dr. Kurlycheck\u2019s opinion that \u201c[t]his individual\u2019s ability to seek and maintain gainful employment is seriously compromised.\u201d However, the ALJ did not offer any explanation for not incorporating Dr. Kurlycheck\u2019s assessment of Buckmaster\u2019s limitations in the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert. Despite acknowledging Dr. Kurlycheck\u2019s opinion, the ALJ seemed to ignore it. Because the ALJ failed to give clear and convincing reasons for not accepting Dr Kurlycheck\u2019s opinion, that opinion, on remand, must be credited and accepted as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">The Durational Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">In order to be considered disabled, Buckmaster\u2019s disability must have \u201clasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.905(a). The ALJ found that Buck-master failed to meet the durational requirement because her limitations were not present for any continuous 12-month period. In stating this conclusion, the ALJ misapplied the durational requirement. Even if a disability has not lasted for 12 months, the durational requirement is satisfied if the disability can be <em>expected </em>to last for 12 continuous months. In addition, the ALJ ignored the opinions of Drs. Grosscup, Kurlycheck, and Rogers, all of whom stated that Buckmaster\u2019s limitations had lasted or were expected to last at least 12 continuous months. Because the ALJ misapplied the legal standard, and ignored the medical opinions of Drs. Grosscup, Kurlycheck, and Rogers without giving clear and convincing reasons for doing so, we remand with instructions that the ALJ accept those opinions and conclude that Buckmaster satisfies the 12-month durational requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">\n<em>Hypothetical Questions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">Buckmaster contends that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the vocational expert were legally deficient. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>agree. \u201cHypothetical questions posed to a vocational expert must set out all the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant, including pain and an inability to engage in certain activities. If the assumptions in the hypothetical are not supported by the record, the vocational expert\u2019s opinion that a claimant is capable of working has no evidentiary value.\u201d <em>Russell v. Sullivan, </em>930 F.2d 1443, 1445 (9th Cir.1991) (citation omitted). Here, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions were legally deficient because they did not incorporate the limitations assessed by Drs. Grosscup, Kurlycheck, and Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Specifically, both Drs. Grosscup and Kurlycheck independently found that Buckmaster was either \u201cmarkedly limited\u201d or \u201cmoderately limited\u201d with respect to (1) her ability to work in coordination with or proximity to others without being distracted by them, (2) her ability to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and to perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods, (3) her ability to interact appropriately with the general public, (4) her ability to get along with coworkers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes, and (5) her ability to maintain socially appropriate behavior and to adhere to basic standards of neatness and cleanliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">On remand, the ALJ must include the limitations expressed by both Drs. Grosscup and Kurlycheck, and the diagnoses provided by Dr. Rogers, in his hypothetical questioning of the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">\n<em>Remand For Further Proceedings Is Appropriate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Buckmaster argues that, in light of the ALJ\u2019s errors, we should remand for an immediate payment of benefits, rather than for further proceedings. We disagree. Remand for an immediate payment of benefits is warranted only if \u201c(1) the ALJ has failed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting [a medical opinion], (2) there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a determination of disability can be made, and (3) it is clear from the record that the ALJ would be required to find the claimant disabled were such evidence credited.\u201d <em>Harman, </em>211 F.3d at 1178 <em>(quoting Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1292).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">As explained above, the first element of this test is satisfied because the ALJ improperly rejected medical opinions which should be credited as a matter of law. However, even if such opinions are credited, it is not clear from the record that Buckmaster will be entitled to benefits as a matter of law. Indeed, \u201c[i]n cases where the testimony of the vocational expert has failed to address a claimant\u2019s limitations as established by improperly discredited evidence, we consistently have remanded for further proceedings rather than payment of benefits.\u201d <em>Harman, </em>211 F.3d at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">We therefore remand this case to the district court for remand to the Commissioner of Social Security for further consideration of Buckmaster\u2019s application for benefits. Buckmaster shall have and recover her costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b566-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-18\">.
