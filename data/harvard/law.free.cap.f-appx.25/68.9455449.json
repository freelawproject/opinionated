McAvoy, <em>Judge, </em>granting summary judgment dismissing their complaint, which alleged denials of substantive due process, procedural due process, equal protection, and First Amendment rights to freedom of religion, in connection with the medical treatment received by Robert Fernicola. On appeal, Robert and Donna Fernicola contend that summary judgment was inappropriate because there existed genuine issues to be tried and because the district court denied them adequate discovery. As to these two plaintiffs, we see no error in the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment, and we uphold that decision substantially for the reasons stated in Judge McAvoy\u2019s Decision &amp; Order dated September 23, 2000. Nor do we see any abuse of discretion, see, <em>e.g., Grady v. Affiliated Central, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 553, 561 (2d Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 936, 119 S.Ct. 349, 142 L.Ed.2d 288 (1998), in the district court\u2019s discovery rulings, given the frailty of their claims and the record indicating that plaintiffs had abused the discovery process.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">As to Anthony and Jake Fernicola, children of Robert and Donna Fernicola, the appeal is dismissed. While Anthony and Jake apparently signed the notice of appeal, they neither signed the brief filed by their parents nor filed a brief of their own. As Robert and Donna are not attorneys and are, respectively, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>neither can prosecute this appeal on behalf of any other person. Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654 provides that \u201c[i]n all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel ...,\u201d this does not empower a <em>pro se </em>nonlawyer litigant to represent his or her child, <em>see, e.g., Cheung v. Youth Orchestra Foundation of Buffalo, Inc., </em>906 F.2d 59, 61 (2d Cir.1990) (\u201cnon-attorney parent must be represented by counsel in bringing an action on behalf of his or her child\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">We have considered all of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed as to Robert and Donna Fernicola; the appeal is dismissed as to Anthony and Jake Femicola.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
