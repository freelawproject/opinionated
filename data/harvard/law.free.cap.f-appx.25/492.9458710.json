After de novo review, <em>see United States v. Lurie, </em>207 F.3d 1075, 1076 (8th Cir.2000), w\u00e9 affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-17\">Wilks sought \u00a7 2241 relief because the Bureau of Prisons denied his request to remove the Sex Offender Public Safety Factor from his Custody Classification Form. We agree with the District Court that the stigma Wilks faced as a result of his classification, without more, failed to implicate a protected liberty interest upon which he could base his procedural due process claim. <em>See Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976) (noting that prison classification and eligibility for rehabilitative programs in federal system are matters delegated by Congress to discretion of federal prison officials and thus implicate \u201cno legitimate statutory or constitutional entitlement sufficient to invoke due process\u201d). Wilks, who is due to be released early based on good-time credits he has earned, conceded that his completion of a drug-treatment program would merely make him eligible for \u2014 not guarantee \u2014 an even earlier release. <em>Cf. Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 487, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (concluding that because nothing in state code required parole board to deny parole in face of misconduct record, and because misconduct record did not inevitably affect duration of inmate\u2019s confinement but was just one of many considerations in parole decision, the mere possibility that disciplinary committee\u2019s misconduct finding would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>influence later parole decision was \u201ctoo attenuated to invoke the procedural guarantees of the Due Process Clause\u201d). Further, even if the classification implicated a protected liberty interest, we would hold that \u2014 because the classification was based in Wilks\u2019s case on actual convictions \u2014 the review he received when he challenged it administratively met minimum procedural due process requirements. <em>Cf. Neal v. Shimoda, </em>131 F.3d 818, 831 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that state prisoner received due process when prison notified him that his classification as a sex offender was based on his prior sex-offense conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">We decline to consider Wilks\u2019s collateral challenge to the prior sex-offense convictions upon which his classification was based, and we deny his pending motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-13\">. The Honorable Ann D.
