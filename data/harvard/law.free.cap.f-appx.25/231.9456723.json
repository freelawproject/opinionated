The defendant\u2019s allegedly false statements were made in an affidavit submitted in response to a summary judgment motion in a civil proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-15\">The defendant makes the following contentions on appeal: (1) that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction for perjury because the statements at issue were literally true; (2) that because the statements were literally true, the evidence was also insufficient to support a conviction for aiding and abetting or for conspiracy to commit perjury; (3) that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the defendant\u2019s affidavit was signed under oath; and (4) that the district court erred in admitting testimony by the federal judge who handled the civil action. Finding none of these assignments of error persuasive, we shall affirm the challenged judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b260-17\">The defendant, Howard Nicholas Johnson, was the president of an entity called the Foundation for Advancement, Education and Employment of American Indians. William Preston Campbell was engaged in soliciting donations to the foundation in return for a percentage of the amounts donated.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-18\">In 1992, an international businessman by the name of John Mousourakis was introduced to Messrs. Johnson and Campbell by his attorney, Norm Rollins, an acquaintance of Campbell. Mr. Mousourakis was having federal income tax problems, and Mr. Johnson suggested that if Mr. Mousourakis gave the foundation several parcels of real estate he owned in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Mr. Mousourakis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>would be eligible for a \u201ccarry-back\u201d tax deduction that could be used to reduce his 1990 tax liability. It was agreed that Mousourakis would convey the property to the foundation, which was allegedly to hold the property in escrow pending receipt of a favorable ruling from the IRS concerning the carry-back deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">After the delivery of the deed, part of the property was conveyed to a third party. Having consulted with several accountants and attorneys, Mr. Mousourakis became increasingly dubious about the availability of a carry-back deduction. He then began tape-recording his telephone conversations with the defendant. In 1994, no favorable ruling having been received from the IRS, Mr. Mousourakis brought a federal action against the foundation for breach of contract and misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Mr. Mousourakis promptly moved for summary judgment. In support of the motion, he submitted an affidavit that included the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201c3. That I was induced to donate to the Defendants in this matter by their assurances that I would be able to carry back my tax deduction for the properties described in this action at 100% of the donated volume [sic] or that they would be returned to me. I was further promised that all properties were to be held in escrow pending the production of a \u2018Private Letter Ruling\u2019 from the IRS to this effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">* * <em>i'fi </em>&gt;;&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">\u201c5. That the property was valued by the Defendant at the sum of $210,000.00 by Malcolm Crossland, the in-house counsel of Defendant. ... That I have respectfully made demand of Defendant for the return of our property or its value of $210,000.00, which Defendant has consistently promised but not carried out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">In response to the motion for summary judgment, Messrs. Johnson and Campbell submitted their own affidavits. Mr. Johnson\u2019s submission was titled \u201cAFFIDAVIT OF H. NICHOLAS JOHNSON.\u201d The first paragraph stated, \u201cMy name is H. Nicholas Johnson. I reside at 1259 Windsor Drive, Gallatin, Tennessee 37066.\u201d The affidavit then continued, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">\u201c6. The statements contained in Paragraph 3 of John Mousourakis\u2019 Affidavit are categorically denied. I never told him he would be would be [sic] able to carry back his deduction for the properties described in this action at 100% of the donated amount or that the properties would be returned to him. Furthermore, I never promised that these properties were to be held in escrow pending the production of a \u2018private letter ruling\u2019 from the IRS to that effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">\u201c7. I have never promised that I would see that their property was returned or its value of $210,000.00.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">The relevant portions of Mr. Campbell\u2019s affidavit were nearly identical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-15\">\u201c5. The statements contained in Paragraph 3 of John Mousourakis\u2019 Affidavit are categorically denied. I never told Mr. Mousourakis nor did I ever hear H. Nicholas Johnson tell him in my presence that he would be would be [sic] able to carry back his deduction for the properties described in this action at 100% of the donated amount or that the properties would be returned to him. Furthermore, I never heard Mr. Johnson, nor did I promise that these properties were to be held in escrow pending the production of a \u2018private letter ruling\u2019 from the IRS to that effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-16\">\u201c6. I have never heard Mr. Johnson promise the plaintiffs that he would see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>that their property would be returned or its value of $210,000.00.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Beneath the affiant\u2019s signature on each affidavit was a jurat bearing the signature and seal of a notary public. The jurat on the Johnson affidavit read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ati\">\u201cSTATE OF TENNESSEE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay5\">COUNTY OF DAVIDSON</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7U\">Sworn to and subscribed before me this 25th day of January 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1e\">/s/ <em>Gregory J. Cullen</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">Notary Public My Commission Expires July 26,1997.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Based on these affidavits, Judge James Jarvis, to whom the civil suit had been assigned, concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact. Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">On March 3,1995, Mr. Mousourakis filed a renewed motion for summary judgment that was supported by transcripts of tape-recorded conversations between himself and Messrs. Johnson and Campbell. In one of these conversations, Mr. Johnson was recorded telling Mr. Mousourakis the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">\u201cWhen we did the deal with you we went ahead and filed it in our books that we did the deal with you, and we also filed an agreement that we had a commitment that if for some reason that didn\u2019t work, then we would restore the property or pay the damages or pay for the property or whatever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Later in the same conversation, Mr Johnson added this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">\u201cAnd you came to us and we told you we would either get it done for you, or we\u2019ll give your property back or give you the money back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Mr Johnson was also recorded assuring Mr. Mousourakis of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-14\">\u201cAnd if your ruling turns wrong, we\u2019ll make it right, and if your ruling turns right you got a home run. So you\u2019re not going to lose. It\u2019s nothing to lose sleep over. You\u2019re in no position to lose. You either get what you got or get your property back____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">The defendant failed to respond to the renewed motion. Concluding that no genuine issue of material fact remained, Judge Jarvis granted summary judgment in favor of Mousourakis for $210,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">On April 13, 1999, a grand jury handed up an indictment against the foundation, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Campbell. A second superseding indictment was filed on October 27, 1999. Count I charged Mr. Johnson and the Foundation with conspiracy to commit perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Count II charged Mr. Johnson with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1621, 1622, citing 11116 and 7 of his affidavit as the false statements at issue. Count III charged Mr. Johnson with aiding and abetting Mr. Campbell in the commission of perjury and Mr. Campbell with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1621,1622.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">On November 12, 1999, a motion <em>in limine </em>was filed seeking to exclude the proposed testimony of Judge Jarvis. The court denied the motion, holding that \u201cJudge Jarvis can testify for the government, and may testify, if he can, that the statements made by the defendant in the ease before him either influenced his decision in that case, or were capable of doing so. * * * However, Judge Jarvis will not be permitted to testify as an expert witness as to his opinion about whether the alleged false statements were material.\u201d The court\u2019s order further stated that the jury would be given a cautionary instruction in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-19\">Following the oral argument on the motion, and after the court had announced its ruling, the court raised the possibility of a stipulation as to materiality. Although such a stipulation would have obviated any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>need to call Judge Jarvis as a witness, defense counsel rejected the suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The same day, Mr. Campbell, without benefit of a plea agreement, pleaded guilty to Count III of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The defendant\u2019s trial commenced on November 16 before a jury. The government presented the testimony of three witnesses: Judge Jarvis, Mr. Mousourakis, and Mr. Campbell. We turn to Judge Jarvis first.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Judge Jarvis was asked to define for the jury the terms \u201cmotion for summary judgment\u201d and \u201caffidavit.\u201d He did so. He also stated that \u201cby definition,\u201d an affiant \u201chas sworn that the contents of [the affidavit] are true.\u201d He then testified, in pertinent part, that the affidavits submitted by Messrs. Johnson and Campbell were \u201cdeterminative\u201d of the summary judgment motion, which he explained meant, \u201cThey decided the issue of whether or not there was a question of fact. They raised a question of fact. And so, therefore, I denied the motion for summary judgment and set the case for trial____\u201d Judge Jarvis also testified that after receiving transcripts of the tape-recorded conversations made by Mr. Mousourakis, and after Mr. Johnson and the foundation failed to respond, \u201c... I granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment because these statements that I had, the transcripts of these statements were in direct contradiction to the statements that [Mr. Johnson and Mr. Campbell] made under oath.\u201d There was no objection at this stage to any of the judge\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Following the testimony, the court gave the following cautionary instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHh\">\u201cLadies and Gentlemen of the jury, you\u2019ve heard the testimony here of Judge Jarvis. You should consider the testimony just as you would consider the testimony of any other witness in the case. He has testified about certain facts. However, he has not testified about the law that is to be applied by you in this case. Remember that the law that you apply in the case comes only from me as the presiding judge in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Mr. Mousourakis was called as the second government witness. He testified that Mr. Johnson and Mr. Campbell had \u201ctold me that under the current, the then laws if you were to donate to the Foundation, you could carry the amount to either two years back or take it now or carry it three years forward. In other words, you can utilize the value or a portion of the value of those properties to reduce your overall tax liability.\u201d Concerning the private letter ruling from the IRS, Mr. Mousourakis testified that if such a ruling could not be obtained. \u201cThey had promised me they would either return the properties back or give us value for the properties.\u201d Mr. Mousourakis explained that he understood that pending an IRS ruling, the land would be held in escrow: \u201cThat was my understanding, that they would be holding them until, as I said, I received my credit or deduction, I\u2019m not sure which is the correct term.\u201d Once he discovered the land had been sold, Mr. Mousourakis testified, \u201cThey said don\u2019t worry about this, we will make good. In other words, we will pay for the value, for the value of that property to you.\u201d Mr. Mousourakis also testified that the defendant\u2019s attorney had appraised the property at issue at $210,000 and that Mousourakis had received a paper from him reflecting this figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">The government\u2019s final witness was Mr. Campbell, who had already pleaded guilty to committing perjury in executing an affidavit nearly identical to the defendant\u2019s. Mr. Campbell testified that despite telling the defendant that he believed his affidavit to be untrue, the defendant \u201cpersuaded me that this was the only avenue that we had in order to \u2014 when I say \u2018we,\u2019 the Founda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>tion, to buy adequate time to make a proper appeal.\u201d Mr. Campbell then testified that he had understood that he was making the statements in his affidavit under oath. The questioning by Assistant United States Attorney Gary Humble continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">\u201cMR. HUMBLE: And your affidavit, and we\u2019ll go back to it now, you say, the affidavit, the statements contained in Paragraph 3 <em>of </em>Mousourakis\u2019s affidavit are denied. When you denied that, was that a true statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">MR. CAMPBELL: When I denied that it was not a true statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">MR. HUMBLE: So Mr. Mousourakis\u2019s allegations were true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">MR. CAMPBELL: They are true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">MR. HUMBLE: Now, you go on to say here that, T never told Mr. Mousourakis, nor did I ever hear H. Nicholas Johnson tell him in my presence that he would be able to carry back his tax deduction for the properties described in this action at 100 percent of the donated amount or that the properties would be returned to him.\u2019 Now, is that a true or a false statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">MR. CAMPBELL: That\u2019s a false statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">MR. HUMBLE: And you knew that was false at the time you signed the affidavit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">MR. CAMPBELL: I did, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">MR. HUMBLE: And you discussed with Mr. Johnson that that was a false statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">MR. CAMPBELL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">MR. HUMBLE: Were you there, in fact, when Mr. Johnson told Mr. Mousourakis words to that effect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-15\">MR. CAMPBELL: That was all discussed that first meeting that we had with Mr. Mousourakis at Norm Rollins\u2019 office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-16\">MR. HUMBLE: Okay. Where you say at the bottom, \u2018Furthermore, I have never heard Mr. Johnson, nor did I promise that these properties were to be held in escrow pending the production of a \u201cprivate letter ruling\u201d from the IRS to that effect\u2019 Was that a true or false statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-18\">MR. CAMPBELL: That was a false statement, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-19\">MR. HUMBLE: Paragraph 6, you say, T have never heard Mr. Johnson promise the plaintiffs that he would see that their property was returned or its value of $210,000.\u2019 Is that true or false?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-20\">MR. CAMPBELL: That\u2019s a false statement, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-21\">Following the government\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. The motion was denied. The defense rested without calling any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-22\">The jury found Mr. Johnson and the foundation guilty on all three counts of the indictment. Johnson was sentenced to five months imprisonment, an assessment of $300, and three years of supervised release. The foundation received no punishment as it was unable to pay any fine. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-23\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b264-24\">A. The Literal Truth Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b264-25\">The defendant first argues that the allegedly perjurious statements in 11116 and 7 of his affidavit were literally true and therefore could not serve as the basis of a perjury prosecution. The defendant also maintains that if the statements were true, they could not serve as the basis of a prosecution for aiding and abetting or conspiracy to commit perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-26\">A witness testifying under oath or affirmation violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 if, with willful intent, he gives false testimony concerning a material matter. See <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>States v. Nash, </em>175 F.3d 429, 438 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 888, 120 S.Ct. 210, 145 L.Ed.2d 176 (1999). It is important to recognize that \u201cthe perjury statute is not to be loosely construed, nor the statute invoked simply because a wily witness succeeds in derailing the questioner\u2014 so long as that witness speaks the literal truth. The burden is on the questioner <em>to </em>pin the witness down to the specific object to the questioner\u2019s inquiry.\u201d <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 360, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The defendant contends that 11116 and 7 of his affidavit directly responded to UK 3 and 5 of the Mousourakis affidavit and, on those terms, were literally true. That is, as the defendant would have it, H 3 of the Mousourakis affidavit contains two statements of fact: (1) that Mr. Mousourakis was assured by the defendant that he \u201cwould be able to carry back [his] tax deduction for the properties described in this action at 100% of the donated [value] or that they would be returned;\u201d and (2) that he was promised that \u201call properties were to be held in escrow pending the production of a \u2018Private Letter Ruling\u2019 from the IRS to this effect.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The defendant claims that the government failed to prove that a tax deduction at \u201c100% of the donated [value]\u201d\u2014 rather than simply a tax deduction of some amount \u2014 was ever promised by the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant asserts that H 6 of his affidavit, denying that Mr. Mousourakis was promised that (1) \u201che would be able to carry back his tax deduction for the properties described in this action at 100% of the donated amount or that the properties would be returned to him;\u201d and (2) \u201cthat these properties were to be held in escrow pending the production of a \u2018private letter ruling\u2019 from the IRS to that effect,\u201d was literally true.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Similarly, the defendant claims that 1\u00cd 7 of his affidavit was also literally true. Paragraph 5 of the Mousourakis affidavit averred, as we have seen, that counsel associated with Johnson had valued the real estate at $210,000 and that \u201cI [Mousourakis] have respectfully made demand of Defendant for the return of our property or its value of $210,000.00 which Defendant has consistently promised but not carried out.\u201d The defendant -maintains that the government failed to prove by competent evidence that a \u201cvalue of $210,000\u201d was ever promised and, therefore, failed to prove that his specific denial of such a promise in 117 of his affidavit was not literally true.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">The defendant\u2019s indictment referenced both 11116 and 7 of his affidavit as containing allegedly perjurious statements. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Mr. Johnson\u2019s conviction must therefore be upheld if a reasonable jury could find that either of the two denials in 116 or the denial in U 7 was not literally true. As to 117, at least, it seems clear to us that a reasonable jury could so find. We deem it unnecessary to decide the question raised as to 11 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">It was in IT 7 that the defendant denied having promised that he \u201cwould see that their property was returned or its value of $210,000.00.\u201d The evidence that this denial was untrue including the testimony of Mr. Mousourakis, who testified that Messrs. Johnson and Campbell \u201chad promised me they would either return the properties back or give us value for the properties.\u201d The government also offered into evidence the tape recordings made by Mr. Mousourakis of his conversations with the defendant. Among the admissions made by the defendant there were the following: \u201cwe would restore the property or pay the damages or pay for the property or whatever;\u201d \u201cwe\u2019ll give your property back or give you the money back;\u201d \u201cyou either get what you got or get your property back.\u201d Finally, Mr. Campbell testified that when in his own affidavit he denied having heard the defendant promise Mr. Mousourakis the return of the property or its value of $210,000, his denial was \u201ca false statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The defendant argues that this evidence failed to establish that the precise figure of $210,000, rather than an unspecified \u201cvalue,\u201d was ever promised. In context, however, the $210,000 valuation figure allegedly having come from the defendant\u2019s own lawyer, H 7 can fairly be read as recognizing that the property had a value of $210,000 but denying any promise to return the property or its value. In any event, a reasonable jury could well interpret Mr. Campbell\u2019s testimony to mean that he personally heard the defendant promise that the specific value of $210,000 would be reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could conclude that 117 of the Johnson affidavit was not literally true. Having concluded that the literal truth defense fails in this case, we will also uphold the defendant\u2019s convictions for aiding and abetting and conspiracy to commit perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">B. A Sworn Affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">The defendant next argues that the government failed to introduce evidence from which a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the affidavit was made under oath. The defendant points out that there was no language in the body of the document stating that the affiant had been duly sworn. He also contends that the presence of a notary\u2019s jurat is insufficient to show that an oath was administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">We are not persuaded. The document at issue is styled \u201cAFFIDAVIT OF H. NICHOLAS JOHNSON.\u201d By definition, an affidavit is a \u201cwritten or printed declaration or statement of facts, made voluntarily, and confirmed by the oath or affirmation of the party making it, taken before a person having authority to administer such oath or affirmation.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>58 (6th ed.1990). The jurat contained at the end of the document states. <em>\u201cSworn to </em>and subscribed before me this 25th day of January, 1995.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is signed by the notary, Gregory J. Guilin, and bears the appropriate seal. These facts are uncontested, and we see no reason why the jury should not have been entitled to take the document at face value.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">C. Judge Jarvis\u2019 Testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">Finally, the defendant contends that the district court erred in letting Judge Jarvis take the stand. The defendant asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that the judge\u2019s testimony invaded the jury\u2019s province as fact-finder, invaded the trial court\u2019s role in stating the law, and unduly prejudiced the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The question before us is whether the district court abused its discretion in holding that the probative value of the evidence to be given by Judge Jarvis was not \u201csubstantially outweigh[ed] by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury....\u201d Fed R. Evid. 403. This discretion in determining the proper balance is interpreted broadly. See <em>United States v. Quinn, </em>230 F.3d 862, 867 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">It is an essential element of a perjury charge that the alleged false statement be material. See <em>United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 512, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995). Materiality is a question for the jury. See <em>id. </em>It was thus the government\u2019s burden to prove that the alleged false statements were material. Absent a stipulation by the defendant (which he refused), testimony by Judge Jarvis represented the most natural means of establishing the crucial facts as to materiality. Mindful of the fact that the district court gave the jury an appropriate cautionary instruction, thereby minimizing any potential prejudice, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\"><em>United States v. Zipkin, </em>729 F.2d 384 (6th Cir.1984), on which the defendant relies, does not compel a different conclusion. In <em>Zipkin, </em>a bankruptcy judge was permitted to testify, over objection, as to questions of law. In the case at bar, by contrast, the district court explicitly ruled that Judge Jarvis could not give opinion testimony, as an expert, on the materiality of Johnson\u2019s allegedly false statements. The judge was to testify, rather, on whether\u2014 as a matter of fact \u2014 he was or could have been influenced by the Johnson affidavit in his decision to deny the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">If defense counsel believed that the testimony actually given by Judge Jarvis went beyond the boundaries established by the district court in its ruling on the motion <em>in limine, </em>it was incumbent on counsel to object at the time. See the Advisory Committee notes to Fed.R.Evid. 103(a), stating that \u201cif the opposing party violates the terms of the initial ruling [on an evidentiary issue], objection must be made when the evidence is offered to preserve the claim of error for appeal.\u201d There was no such objection here, and there was no obvious error which, although not objected to, seriously undermined the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. See <em>United States v. Koeberlein, </em>161 F.3d 946, 949 (6th Cir.1998). <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1030, 119 S.Ct. 1278, 143 L.Ed.2d 371 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-6\">. In <em>Bronston, </em>the defendant was charged with perjury based upon the following answers he gave to questions in bankruptcy proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\"Q: Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks, Mr. Bronston?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">Q: Have you ever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">A: The company had an account there for about six months, in Zurich.\u201d <em>Id., </em>409 U.S. at 354.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Although Bronston had maintained personal accounts in a Swiss bank for five years, his answers were literally true since he did not have a Swiss bank account when he was questioned and since his business did have the account he described. See <em>id. </em>The jury convicted and the Second Circuit affirmed, finding that \"for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, a nonresponsive answer containing half of the truth which also constitutes a lie by negative implication, when intentionally given in place of the responsive answer called for by a proper question, is perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that an unresponsive but literally true answer could not form the basis of a perjury charge. See <em>id. </em>at 360.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b265-16\">.

MARTIN, Jr., Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8Q\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">I would reverse the judgment of the district court because I am satisfied that Johnson\u2019s statements are literally true within the meaning of <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>and because I believe the district court erred in allowing Judge Jarvis to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">As the majority notes, an unresponsive but literally true answer cannot form the basis of a perjury charge. <em>See Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 360, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973). \u201cA jury should not be permitted to engage in conjecture whether an unresponsive answer, true and complete on its face, was intended to mislead or divert the examiner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359. Johnson\u2019s perjury conviction is based on paragraphs six and seven of an affidavit submitted in a prior civil action. According to Johnson, paragraph six di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>rectly responds to paragraph three of the Mousourakis affidavit and, on those terms, was literally true. Likewise, Johnson contends that paragraph seven of his affidavit mirrors paragraph five of Mousourakis\u2019s affidavit and is also literally true.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">At the outset, Johnson, in paragraph six, states that \u201c[t]he statements contained in Paragraph 3 of John Mousourakis\u2019s Affidavit are categorically denied.\u201d In paragraph three of his affidavit, Mousourakis alleges that the defendants assured him (1) he \u201cwould be able to carry back [his] tax deduction for the properties described in this action at 100% of the donated [value] or that they would be returned\u201d; and (2) that he was promised that \u201call properties were to be held in escrow pending the production of a \u2018Private Letter Ruling\u2019 from the IRS to this effect.\u201d In paragraph six of his affidavit, Johnson states (1) \u201cI never told him be would be able to carry back his tax deduction for the properties described in this action at 100% of the donated amount or that the properties would be returned to him\u201d; and (2) \u201cI never promised that these properties were to be held in escrow pending the production of a \u2018private letter ruling\u2019 from the IRS to that effect.\u201d Given the contents of the affidavits, I am satisfied that paragraph six of Johnson\u2019s affidavit directly responds to paragraph three of Mousourakis\u2019s allegations, and must be evaluated in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Although my colleagues in the majority deem it \u201cunnecessary\u201d to consider whether paragraph six of Johnson\u2019s affidavit was literally true, a thorough consideration of the record reveals that the jury did not have a sufficient basis to conclude that paragraph six was not literally true. With respect to value, Mousourakis testified on direct as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">Q. What did they tell you, if anything, if you give us that property what we\u2019re going to be able to do for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">A. They told me that under the current, the then laws if you were to donate to the Foundation, you could carry the amount to either two years back or take it now or carry it three years forward. In other words, you can utilize the value <em>or a portion of the value </em>of those properties to reduce your overall tax liability. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The trial record simply does not reflect that Johnson promised Mousourakis that he would be able to carry back 100% of the donated value.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The majority rests its <em>Bronston </em>analysis and Johnson\u2019s perjury conviction entirely on paragraph seven of Johnson\u2019s affidavit. Similar to the way that paragraph six of Johnson\u2019s affidavit mirrors paragraph three of Mousourakis\u2019s affidavit, I am satisfied that paragraph seven of his affidavit directly responds to paragraph five of Mousourakis\u2019s affidavit. Paragraph five of Mousourakis\u2019s affidavit states that \u201cI [Mousourakis] have respectfully made demand of Defendant for the return of our property or its value of $210,000.00 which Defendant has consistently promised but not carried out.\u201d In comparison, paragraph seven of Johnson\u2019s affidavit states \u201cI have never promised the plaintiff that I would see that their property was returned or its value of $210,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">In rejecting the literal truth of paragraph seven of Johnson\u2019s affidavit, the majority emphasizes three sources of evidence. First, the majority cites Mousourakis\u2019s testimony that Johnson and Campbell \u201chad promised me that they would either return the properties back or give us value for the properties.\u201d Because Mousourakis\u2019s statement fails to mention $210,000 \u2014 the dollar value featured in both affidavits \u2014 I believe that it lacks the specificity to serve as the basis for a perjury conviction. In response to this omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>sion, the majority contends that the reference to value must be examined \u201cin context.\u201d In particular, the majority highlights Mousourakis\u2019s testimony that Johnson\u2019s attorney had appraised the property at $210,000. But while this statement, at best, might establish that Johnson\u2019s lawyer believed the property was worth $210,000, it hardly provides a sufficient foundation for the jury to have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Johnson meant $210,000 when he used the term \u201cvalue\u201d during his conversation with Mousourakis.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The majority also relies on statements from the transcripts of Johnson and Mousourakis\u2019s tape-recorded conversations. Among the purported admissions made by Johnson, the majority quotes Johnson as stating: \u201cwe would restore the property or pay the damages or pay for the property or whatever\u201d; \u201cwe\u2019ll give your property back or give you the money back\u201d; and \u201cyou either get what you got or get your property back.\u201d But these vague assurances do not render paragraph seven literally untrue because, again, they fail to mention the $210,000 figure memorialized in the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Lastly, the majority relies on the testimony of Johnson\u2019s co-defendant, Campbell. In particular, the majority focuses on Campbell\u2019s testimony that his prior statement in his affidavit, in which he denied having heard Johnson promise Mousourakis the return of the property or its value of $210,000, was false. Campbell\u2019s testimony establishes the falsity of his prior statement, but its lack of specificity as to what Johnson actually said prevents it from establishing that Johnson\u2019s statement was not literally true. The government could have pinned Campbell down \u2014 as <em>Bronston </em>requires \u2014 and inquired as to the specifics of Johnson\u2019s statements to Mousourakis regarding value. But the government did not and as it stands, Campbell\u2019s blanket admission of the falsity of his own affidavit does not provide a sufficient factual foundation for a perjury conviction. Even considered as a whole, the statements cited by the majority may provide a sufficient basis for a jury to conclude that paragraph seven of Johnson\u2019s affidavit was incomplete, but they do not provide a sufficient basis for a perjury conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">I would also reverse the judgment of the district court because its decision to allow United States District Judge James H. Jarvis to testify improperly invaded the jury\u2019s fact-finding function and unduly prejudiced the proceeding. While I greatly respect Judge Jarvis as a jurist and friend, the fact that he is a federal judge gives his testimony almost total credibility and severely undercuts the position of the defendant. Moreover, the prejudice inherent in his testimony as a prosecution witness was greatly magnified by his specific testimony because it gave the impression that he believed Jarvis was a liar.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">It was precisely these kinds of concerns that lead us to hold in <em>United States v. Zipkin, </em>729 F.2d 384 (6th Cir.1984), that a district court\u2019s decision to allow a bankruptcy judge to testify on a question of bankruptcy law, notwithstanding the ultimate fact that his testimony was incorrect, constituted reversible error. <em>See id. </em>at 387. In finding such testimony prejudicial, we emphasized that \u201c[a] jury listening to a bankruptcy judge testify as to question of bankruptcy law would be expected to give special credence to such testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because I believe the jury could not help but give Judge Jarvis\u2019s testimony such \u201cspecial credence,\u201d I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">The government apparently called Judge Jarvis to testify regarding the materiality element of perjury, to show that Johnson\u2019s affidavit had \u201ca natural tenden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>cy to influence, or was capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.\u201d <em>Kungys v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 759, 770, 108 S.Ct. 1537, 99 L.Ed.2d 839 (1988). According to the majority, \u201ctestimony by Judge Jarvis represented the most natural means of establishing the crucial facts as to materiality.\u201d But as set forth in the majority\u2019s discussion of the facts, Judge Jarvis\u2019s testimony went beyond demonstrating that Johnson\u2019s affidavit had \u201ca natural tendency\u201d to influence and addressed the actual materiality and falsity of his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In his testimony, Judge Jarvis first defined the terms \u201caffidavit\u201d and \u201csummary judgment\u201d and stated that \u201cby definition,\u201d an affiant \u201chas shown that the contents of [the affidavit] are true.\u201d Judge Jarvis testified that the affidavits submitted by Johnson and Campbell were \u201cdeterminative\u201d of the summary judgment motion. As Judge Jarvis explained, the affidavits \u201cdecided the issue of whether or not there was a question of fact.\u201d Thus, Judge Jarvis\u2019s testimony did not merely address the tendency or capability of Johnson\u2019s affidavit to influence him; such testimony would have preserved the question of whether Johnson\u2019s statements were material for the jury. Rather, Judge Jarvis\u2019s testimony that Johnson\u2019s affidavit was \u201cdeterminative\u201d communicated his conclusion to the jury \u2014 the statements in Johnson\u2019s affidavit were, in fact, material.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Judge Jarvis testified that after receiving transcripts of the tape-recorded conversations between Mousourakis and Johnson, he granted Mousourakis\u2019s motion for summary judgment. According to Judge Jarvis, \u201cthe transcripts of these statements were in direct contradiction to the statements that [Johnson] made under oath.\u201d In explaining his decisionmaking process, Judge Jarvis necessarily communicated that he, as a federal judge evaluating a dispositive motion, believed the transcripts of the tape recordings reflected the truth of what Johnson actually said to Mousourakis, and that the statements to the contrary in Johnson\u2019s affidavit were false. Put more bluntly, Judge Jarvis necessarily communicated to the jury that he believed that Johnson was a liar.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">I do not believe the district court\u2019s cautionary instruction can cure the prejudice caused by Judge\u2019s Jarvis testimony any more than the ultimate falsity of the judge\u2019s testimony in <em>Zipkin </em>could cure the error in that case. While I appreciate Judge Edgar\u2019s sensitivity and efforts to mitigate the prejudice, I do not believe that a simple admonition by the district court that the jury must consider a judge\u2019s testimony like the testimony of any other witness can remove or reduce the \u201cspecial credence\u201d accorded such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Lastly, I am satisfied that Johnson adequately preserved the issue for appeal. First, Johnson filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude the testimony of Judge Jarvis before trial. Second, I believe that allowing Judge Jarvis to exceed the scope of the trial court\u2019s order was an obvious error, which although not objected to, seriously undermined the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See United States v. Koeberlein, </em>161 F.3d 946, 949 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
