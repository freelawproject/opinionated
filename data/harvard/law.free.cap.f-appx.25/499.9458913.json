He argues the court wrongly assessed a 2-level enhancement for being an organizer or a leader of a criminal activity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-28\">The district court did not commit clear error, given the trial testimony of Brown\u2019s accomplice that Brown came up with the idea to rob a bank, selected the bank, recruited his codefendant to participate, instructed the codefendant what to do during the robbery, and devised alibis. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4) (listing factors court should consider); <em>United States v. Peters, </em>59 F.3d 732, 735 (8th Cir.1995) (district court did not commit clear error in applying \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement, as coconspirators testified defendant came up with plan, recruited them to participate, and continued to provide substantial direction during life of plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-37\">.
