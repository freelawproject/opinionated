Paswell seeks review of the April 18, 2001, decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, No. 00-1393, remanding his case to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals for readjudication. We <em>dismiss </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-20\">The board denied as not well-grounded Paswell\u2019s claims for service connection for a left leg disability, compensation for a left foot disability pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151, and an increased evaluation for the residuals of a colostomy. While the appeal was pending, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, 114 Stat.2096, (\u201cVCAA\u201d), was passed into law. The VCAA eliminated the well-grounded claim requirement and modified the Secretary of Veterans Affairs\u2019 duties to notify and assist claimants. Section 7 of the VCAA provides that it applies to claims \u201cfiled before the date of the enactment of this Act and not final as of that date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7(a)(2). Therefore, the court remanded the case to the board for readjudication in light of the VCAA. Paswell appeals the remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-23\">Our jurisdiction over decisions of the court is limited to the review of final decisions, which usually does not include remands. <em>Allen v. Principi, </em>237 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2001). This \u201c \u2018final judgment\u2019 rule ordinarily limits our jurisdiction to appeals from a decision or order that \u2018ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1372 (internal citation omitted). A \u201ccollateral order exception\u201d exists, however, if forcing the appellant to undergo a remand would defeat the right the appellant is asserting. <em>Adams v. Principi, </em>256 F.3d 1318, 1321 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-24\">In this case, the court\u2019s decision is not final. The court\u2019s remand order allows the application of the VCAA that may result in a more favorable decision for Paswell. Moreover, the collateral order exception is not met because his claim would not be defeated by remand of the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
