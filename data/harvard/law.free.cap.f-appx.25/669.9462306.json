Pettibone appeals his conviction and sentence for bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-27\">We review de novo whether the district court correctly held that Pettibone\u2019s confession was voluntary. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>Kelley, </em>953 F.2d 562, 564 (9th Cir.1992). \u201cCoercive police activity is a \u2018necessary predicate\u2019 to finding a confession involuntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565 (citing <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986)). Here, there is no evidence of such coercion. Pettibone\u2019s interrogation lasted approximately an hour, he was not handcuffed during the interview, he was not threatened, and the agent\u2019s suggestion that Pettibone might benefit from cooperating does not rise to the level of coercion. Given the lack of coercion, Pettibone\u2019s alleged intoxication cannot establish involuntariness. <em>See Kelley, </em>953 F.2d at 565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">We also review de novo the voluntariness of Pettibone\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>United States v. Doe, </em>155 F.3d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc). The inquiry into the voluntariness of <em>Miranda </em>waiver is equivalent to the inquiry into the voluntariness of a confession. <em>Derrick v. Peterson, </em>924 F.2d 813, 820 (9th Cir.1990). Accordingly, Pettibone\u2019s argument that his waiver was involuntary is foreclosed for the same reasons that foreclose his argument that his confession was involuntary. <em>Cf.id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Finally, Pettibone argues that, if this court concludes he was promised a \u201cballpark\u201d sentence during his interrogation, then we should impose that sentence. However, as he acknowledges, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward. <em>See United States v. Duran-Orozco, </em>192 F.3d 1277, 1283 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b697-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir.
