The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied Banks\u2019s post-discovery motion to amend his complaint to include claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, and granted AmerenUE summary judgment. Banks appeals. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Banks\u2019s belated motion to amend to include claims which he could have raised earlier, and which would have required additional discovery. See <em>Bell v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>160 F.3d 452, 454-55 (8th Cir.1998). We further conclude that Banks failed to establish a prima facie case of age or race discrimination because he did not show he was qualified <em>for </em>the promotion, see <em>Dotson v. Delta Consol. Indus., Inc., </em>251 F.3d 780, 781 (8th Cir.2001); and that he did not show the alleged harassment was severe and pervasive or based upon his race or age, see <em>Bradley v. Widnall, </em>232 F.3d 626, 631-32 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-23\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-18\">. The HONORABLE JEAN C. HAMILTON, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
