Leisure pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), the district court sentenced him to 20 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. Leisure appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-22\">Leisure first challenges the district court\u2019s compliance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(d) and (f). There was no error: the court questioned Leisure extensively about his competency to plead guilty before determining the plea was voluntary, and properly determined there was a factual basis for the plea. Leisure also challenges the actual voluntariness of his guilty plea and his counsel\u2019s effectiveness, but these challenges are not properly before us. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>927 F.2d 1060, 1061 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 943, 112 S.Ct. 384, 116 L.Ed.2d 334 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-23\">Leisure\u2019s remaining claims concerning the Fourth Amendment, his speedy-trial rights, and his innocence, are foreclosed by his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Arrellano, </em>213 F.3d 427, 430 (8th Cir.2000); <em>Cox v. Lockhart, </em>970 F.2d 448, 453 (8th Cir.1992); <em>cf. United States v. Beck, </em>250 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-24\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-25\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
