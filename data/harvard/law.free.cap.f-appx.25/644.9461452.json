Castaneda-Magana claims that his due process rights were violated by the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) and the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) because they did not allow him to apply for discretionary \u00a7 212(c) relief from deportation. The IJ and BIA held that Castaneda-Magana was ineligible to apply for such relief due to the passage of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. CastanedaMagana\u2019s subsequent deportation served as an underlying element for his \u00a7 1326 conviction. Castaneda-Magana also claims that his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney informed Castaneda-Magana that there was no chance that the BIA\u2019s decision would be overturned by an appeal to the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">With regard to the due process claims concerning the IJ and the BIA, Castaneda-Magana needed to show that he was prejudiced by their decisions which found him ineligible to apply for discretionary \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>United States v. Jimenez-Marmolejo, </em>104 F.3d 1083, 1086 (9th Cir.1996). For Castaneda-Magana to demonstrate prejudice, he needed to demonstrate that there were plausible grounds for granting him discretionary \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Id. </em>Because Castaneda-Magana did not demonstrate such plausible grounds, he was not prejudiced by the decisions of the IJ and the BIA. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his due pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>cess claims based on the decisions of the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">We also affirm the district court as to its denial of Castaneda-Magana\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Although it turned out that counsel\u2019s advice was erroneous in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>INS v. St. Cyr., </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2293, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), in the circumstances of this case, we cannot equate advice that turned out to be erroneous with ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s decision denying Castaneda-Magana\u2019s motion to dismiss his \u00a7 1326 indictment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-12\">.
