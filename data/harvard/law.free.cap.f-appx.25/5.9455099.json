Espada is incorrect that the ALJ should have employed the legal standard applicable to evaluating \u201cmedical improvement\u201d in disability benefits cessation cases. The cessation of benefits in Espada\u2019s case was not based on a finding of medical improvement. Rather, the cessation of benefits was initiated by a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>in the social security laws, namely 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(d)2)(C) and 1382(a)(3)(J). The ALJ correctly employed the applicable standards embodied in 20 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 404.1535 and 416.935 to evaluate Espada\u2019s request for reinstatement of his disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">After determining, based on the medical evidence provided by both treating and consulting psychiatrists, that Espada\u2019s emotional disorder left him unable to perform his past relevant work, the ALJ solicited the testimony of a vocational expert (VE). The VE testified at the administrative hearing that there were other jobs in the national economy which Espada could perform despite his emotional disorder. Thus, the ALJ had specific evidence \u2014 the VE\u2019s testimony \u2014 that there were actual jobs in the national economy which claimant could perform. Therefore, the decision of the Commissioner that claimant was not disabled is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The final judgment of the magistrate judge is affirmed. <em>See </em>Local Rule 27.1.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
