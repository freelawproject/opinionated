Proc. \u00a7 391 (West 2001), both of which concern vexatious litigants, are unconstitutional. Dimov also appeals the denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment in which he asserted that the district court judge should have recused herself. We have jurisdiction under to review the dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">The district court did not err in dismissing Dimov\u2019s complaint challenging the constitutionality of District Court Local Rule 27A and Cal.Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 391. Dimov\u2019s assertion that, because he was adjudicated to be a vexatious litigant by the California state court, Local Rule 27A bars him from bringing a lawsuit pro <em>se </em>in federal court, is based on a misunderstanding of the interplay between the local rule and the California statute. Local Rule 27A\u2019s only reference to Cal.Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 391 is permissive and concerns procedures, not substance. Because Local Rule 27A has never been applied to Dimov, he has suffered no injury traceable to the rule and does not have standing to challenge its constitutionality. <em>See Clark v. City of Lakewood, </em>259 F.3d 996, 1006 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-21\">Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the district court lacked jurisdiction over Dimov\u2019s challenge to Cal.Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 391. <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>D.C. Ct. of App. v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 486, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). Dimov\u2019s federal constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>claims concerning Cal.Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 391 were inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s decision, because the district court could not have found in favor of Dimov on his constitutional claims without holding that the state court had erred in imposing the order declaring him to be a vexatious litigant. Thus, the district court properly dismissed this claim under <em>Rooker-Feldman. See Doe &amp; Assocs. Law Offices v. Napolitano, </em>252 F.3d 1026, 1030 (9th Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Dimov\u2019s filing of his notice of appeal on the same day he filed his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment divested the district court of jurisdiction to consider his motion. <em>See Gould v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>790 F.2d 769, 772 (9th Cir. 1986). Moreover, \u201cwhere the underlying judgment has been appealed, denial of a motion for relief from that judgment is a nonappealable order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we dismiss Dimov\u2019s appeal from the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b695-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
