Moore\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>raising three issues but representing that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Moore has filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting two additional issues. Finding the issues raised are without merit and discerning no other error in the record below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Counsel first contends Moore\u2019s plea was invalid because, during the plea hearing, the district court failed to explain to Moore that if he were to proceed to trial, he had the right not to be compelled to incriminate himself. However, this was explained in Moore\u2019s plea agreement, which was signed by both Moore and counsel. Thus, we find any error by the district court was harmless and that the plea was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h); <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402-03 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Counsel next contends the district court erred by accepting Moore\u2019s plea of guilty to carrying and using a firearm under \u00a7 924(c). Counsel contends there was an insufficient factual basis to support Moore\u2019s conviction on this count. We find this argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Counsel next contends the district court erred by sentencing Moore to eighty-four months of imprisonment under \u00a7 924(c), to be served consecutively to his sentence under \u00a7 2113(d). However, Moore was subject to a seven-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Moore argues the district court erred by considering three prior, uncounseled convictions when determining his criminal history. Because Moore did not raise this claim below, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). To constitute plain error, the defendant must show the error occurred, the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>134 F.3d 235, 239 (4th Cir.1998). Even if there is plain error, this court will not recognize the error unless it seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>We find no error affecting Moore\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Finally, Moore contends he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Claims of ineffective assistance are not cognizable on direct appeal unless counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness plainly appears on the face of the record. <em>United States v. De-Fusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir.1991). We decline to consider Moore\u2019s ineffective assistance claims because we find the record does not conclusively show counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm Moore\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
