We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-20\">Thomas applied for benefits alleging disability due to head and back injuries. His application was denied by the Commissioner and again denied following a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ\u2019s decision became final when Thomas\u2019 request for administrative review was denied. The district court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Thomas filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-21\">In her decision, the ALJ found that although Thomas suffered from severe impairments, he was not precluded from performing a limited number of sedentary jobs. Utilizing a vocational expert, the ALJ identified a significant number of those jobs. The ALJ also found Thomas\u2019 testimony not credible and discounted the opinions of a treating physician and an examining physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-22\">Thomas attributes a number of errors to the ALJ. Central to all of Thomas\u2019 contentions is whether the ALJ erred by finding Thomas not credible and thus improperly rejected his subjective complaints of pain and physical limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-23\">An ALJ must provide specific and cogent reasons for rejecting a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints, and in the absence of affirmative evidence of malingering, the ALJ\u2019s reasons must be clear and convincing. <em>Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1999). The parties disagree whether there is evidence of malingering on Thomas\u2019 part. Because we conclude the ALJ provided clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Thomas\u2019 subjective complaints, we need not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-24\">A finding that a claimant is not credible is a permissible reason to reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>subjective pain testimony. <em>Light v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>119 F.3d 789, 792 (9th Cir. 1997). An ALJ must support her credibility determination by specifying what testimony she finds not credible and identifying what evidence undermines that testimony. <em>See Morgan, </em>169 F.3d at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The ALJ pointed to testimony by Thomas regarding the severity of his condition and found it was contradicted by evidence describing Thomas\u2019 activities. Specifically, the ALJ relied upon descriptions of Thomas as working with a crowbar, working in a garden for two hours, tinkering with cars or in the garden almost daily, driving almost daily, and generally leaving the house as often as necessary. The ALJ found these activities inconsistent with Thomas\u2019 testimony that he becomes fatigued after walking a short distance, has crippling back pain, and spends ninety percent of his day reclining. The ALJ specifically noted that, although Thomas testified he no longer worked on cars, with perhaps the exception of adding oil, the record contained a description of him as tinkering with cars almost daily.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Thomas argues that because his activities do not consume a substantial portion of his day, they cannot provide the basis for an adverse credibility determination. Thomas\u2019 argument misses the point. The relevance of Thomas\u2019 daily activities is not that they indicate his ability to work on a sustained basis, but that they bear on his believability. Thomas testified to a degree of incapacity incompatible with the activities in which he engages. That is, the ALJ could properly find that his testimony was contradicted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The ALJ made detailed findings as to what testimony she found not credible and what evidence undermined that testimony. In doing so, the ALJ provided clear and convincing reasons for her rejection of Thomas\u2019 subjective complaints.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">Having properly found Thomas not credible, the ALJ could discount medical opinions based in large part upon Thomas\u2019 own account of his symptoms and limitations. <em>See Morgan, </em>169 F.3d at 602. Consequently, the ALJ did not err by discounting the medical opinions of Thomas\u2019 treating physician or the examining physician. As the ALJ noted, both physicians relied on Thomas\u2019 own descriptions of his symptoms and limitations in reaching their conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">Similarly, the ALJ did not err in evaluating Thomas\u2019 mental limitations. It is the responsibility of the ALJ to resolve conflicts in medical evidence. <em>See Morgan, </em>169 F.3d at 601. The ALJ considered the conflicting medical opinions and specifically discounted those which relied on Thomas\u2019 subjective reporting while crediting others. Having properly considered the conflicting opinions in this light, the ALJ then found that Thomas did not suffer from any mental limitation requiring accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">Lastly, the ALJ did not err by identifying jobs that Thomas could perform. The ALJ was not required to include in the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert limitations she found not to exist. <em>See Roberts v. Shalala, </em>66 F.3d 179, 184 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b539-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">. Thomas also notes, and the Commissioner agrees, that the ALJ erred in finding that Thomas inconsistently described his sense of smell and whether he needed one or two canes. Nonetheless, the ALJ provided clear and convincing reasons for finding Thomas not credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
