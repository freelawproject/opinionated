Williams\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing whether the magistrate judge fully complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Williams\u2019 guilty plea, and whether Williams\u2019 sentence was imposed within the guidelines range, but stating that in his opinion there were no meritorious issues for appeal. Williams has filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing the district court did not comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a)(1) and the Government should have been required to move for a substantial assistance departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-20\">We have reviewed the record and find that the magistrate judge complied with all the mandates of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Williams\u2019 guilty plea. We further find that Williams\u2019 sentence was proper, and the Government did move for a reduction of sentence based on substantial assistance; that motion was granted. We have reviewed Williams\u2019 allegations of error and find them precluded by his valid appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-21\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
