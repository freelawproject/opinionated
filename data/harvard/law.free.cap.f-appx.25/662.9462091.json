We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s summary judgment, <em>Frost v. Agnos, </em>152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir.1998), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Summary judgment was proper because Holden failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether jail officials acted with deliberate indifference as to his medical needs. <em>See id. </em>at 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">Holden\u2019s contention that he was prevented from meaningful access to the courts lacks merit because Holden failed to show how the alleged deficiencies in the jail library prejudiced his ability to prosecute his suit. <em>See Mayweathers v. Newland, </em>258 F.3d 930, 934 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">Holden\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Caruth v.
