The Board determined that respondent had violated Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, <em>et seq., </em>by terminating employees for engaging in protected activities. Respondent was ordered,- <em>inter alia, </em>to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice and to reinstate the employees and make them whole for loss of earnings and other benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">This action arises out of the discharge of six transitional employees at the USPS\u2019s Mid-Hudson Processing and Distribution Center (\u201cMid-Hudson facility\u201d) for their refusal to work overtime because they had not received at least one hour of advance notice of the need to work overtime. The relationship between the employees and the USPS is governed by a national Collective Bargaining Agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d), which provides for local implementation of the CBA through local memoranda of understanding (\u201cLMOUs\u201d) between local unions and management. On September 30, 1992, the local union for the Mid-Hudson facility entered into such a memorandum, which provided as follows with respect to advance notice of overtime work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-14\">When management determines the need for overtime!,] employees will be given one hour advance notice that they will be required to work, as far as practicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">In early 1993, the local union filed a grievance with respect to this provision, alleging that the USPS had consistently threatened a transitional employee with discipline if she refused to work overtime with less than an hour\u2019s notice. The resulting grievance settlement went a step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>further than the local amendment to article 8.1, providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">At issue in the grievance(s) is the Grievant\u2019s contention that Management is violating article 8.1 of the LMOU by not giving the Grievant one hour advance notice, when they are required to work overtime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">Upon full discussion and consideration, it is determined that the grievance(s) is/are settled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">The reason for this decision is that Management will adhere to article 8.1 of the LMOU and give the Transitional employees advance notice of overtime as far as pract\u00edcale [sic]. Transitional employee [sic] not given prior notice of overtime, and who can not remain for the overtime will not threaten [sic] with discipline for there [sic] actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The ALJ found that after this agreement was signed, there were many instances where transitional employees who refused to work overtime when not given one hour\u2019s advance notice were not disciplined in any way, and that this understanding was abided by through on or about January 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Thereafter, on February 15, 1996, at approximately 12:45 a.m., USPS Acting Supervisor Lori Huschle informed six transitional employees at the Mid Hudson facility that they had to work two hours of overtime after the completion of their shift, which was scheduled to end at 1:30 a.m. Huschle informed the employees that, if they had a problem with this decision, they should speak to either supervisor Jerry Fiber or another person. When the employees later spoke to Fiber, he gave them a \u201cdirect order\u201d to stay overtime and told them to grieve it with the union the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">At 1:15 a.m., fifteen minutes before the overtime was scheduled to begin, during the employees\u2019 break, they complained to the union steward that they had been ordered to work overtime without one hour\u2019s advance notice. Laurie Wagger, a shop steward, took a copy of article 8.1 of the LMOU to show to Fiber and told him that the employees did not have to stay. Fiber disagreed. Wagger then returned to the union office and informed the transitional employees that it was within their rights to leave. All six employees punched out and left the facility at approximately 1:30 or shortly thereafter. The USPS terminated all six employees the next day for then-refusal to work overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">The Union and each of the six transitional employees filed charges with the Board against the USPS in March 1996. The grievances were referred to arbitration and an arbitration hearing was held on June 11, 1997. The arbitration decision, issued on July 21, 1997, concluded that the grievances in this matter were not arbitrable. Thereafter, a trial before Howard Edelman, ALJ, was conducted; he issued his decision September 28, 1998, finding that the USPS had committed an unfair labor practice and ordering, <em>inter alia, </em>the employees\u2019 reinstatement. The USPS appealed to the Board. In support of their appeal, the USPS filed exceptions and a supporting brief, and the General Counsel and the Union filed answering briefs. On September 26, 2000, a three-member panel of the Board issued its decision and order. The Board then filed this petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">In response to the Board\u2019s application for enforcement, the USPS argues that the Board (1) eryed in its determination that the employees actions were protected under the NLRA because the employees engaged in an unlawful work stoppage; and (2) abused its discretion in declining to enforce the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>This court will enforce a Board order \u201cif the Board\u2019s conclusion has a reasonable basis in law, and if its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Sheridan Manor Nursing Home, Inc. v. NLRB, 225 </em>F.3d 248, 252 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">We conclude that the Board\u2019s determination is entitled to deference. It is well established in this circuit that \u201cactivities involving attempts to enforce the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement may be deemed to be for concerted purposes.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Interboro Contractors, Inc., </em>388 F.2d 495 (2d Cir.1967). As such, activities to enforce terms of a collective bargaining agreement are protected under the Act\u2019s prescription of the right \u201cto engage in ... concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157; <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 158(a)(1) &amp; (3). The central inquiry is whether the employees relied on a reasonable interpretation of their contractual rights. <em>See NLRB v. City Disposal Sys., Inc., </em>465 U.S. 822, 840, 104 S.Ct. 1505, 79 L.Ed.2d 839 (1984). In light of the local amendment to article 8.1 and the prior grievance settlement with respect to that provision, there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that the employees\u2019 actions were taken in reliance on a reasonable interpretation of their contractual rights. As such, the Board\u2019s conclusion that the USPS violated Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act by terminating the employees for the exercise of that contractual right is reasonable. We note that the USPS did not present evidence that it was not practical to give one hour\u2019s notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Because it was not raised before the Board, we reject as untimely the USPS\u2019s contention that the employees engaged in a \u201cwork stoppage\u201d in violation of the national CBA and federal law, both of which prohibit government employees from striking. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (\u201cNo objection that has not been urged before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the [reviewing] court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">We review the Board\u2019s decision not to defer to an arbitration award for abuse of discretion. <em>See Liquor Salesmen\u2019s Union Local 2 v. NLRB, </em>664 F.2d 318, 323 (2d Cir.1981). Under <em>Spielberg Mfg. Co., </em>112 NLRB 1080, 1082 (NLRB 1955), the Board may decline to enforce an arbitral award unless \u201cthe proceedings appear to have been fair and regular, all parties had agreed to be bound, and the decision of the arbitration panel is not clearly repugnant to the purposes and policies of the Act.\u201d In this case, the Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s findings, including his express finding that the arbitrator \u201cignored <em>City Disposal, </em>its progeny, and the parties\u2019 collective-bargaining agreement,\u201d and that \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s decision is wrong, repugnant to the Act, and should not be differed.\u201d In light of the Board\u2019s reasonable determination that the employees were unlawfully discharged and the conclusion that the arbitration award was \u201crepugnant to the Act,\u201d the Board did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for enforcement is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
