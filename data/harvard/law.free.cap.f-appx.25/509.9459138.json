The Benefits Review Board did not err in adopting the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact as they were rational, supported by substantial ev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>idence, and in accord with the law. Medical evidence supported the specific findings regarding the extent of the work-related injury and resulting disability. Based upon our independent review, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s disposition, and that it committed no errors of law. <em>See Marine Power &amp; Equip. v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>203 F.3d 664, 667 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
