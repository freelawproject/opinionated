The Government appealed his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in granting a downward departure based on the impact Barth\u2019s conviction had on his daughter and her family. This Court agreed with the Government, and vacated Barth\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Barth, </em>2001 WL 117499 (4th Cir. Feb.12, 2001) (No. 00-4172) (unpublished). At resentencing, Barth moved for a downward departure based upon his post-sentence rehabilitation and his family circumstances. The district court found that it did not have the authority at resentencing to consider a downward departure based upon post-sentencing rehabilitation. The court further found, as it did at the initial sentencing, that a downward departure based on family circumstances was not warranted. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-16\">In <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 67 (4th Cir.1993), this Court found that at resentencing upon a remand the district court may only consider relevant evidence \u201c \u2018that it could have heard at the first hearing\u2019 \u201d with respect to any particular issue. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Cornelius, </em>968 F.2d 703, 705 (8th Cir.1992)). Thus, we find the district court properly ruled that it was without authority to consider a downward departure based on post-sentencing rehabilitation. We will not review the district court\u2019s decision not to depart based on family circumstances. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238-39 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
