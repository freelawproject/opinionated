Aiken, United States District Court Judge for the District of Oregon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">John Butler appeals the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment as to his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims stemming from a police dog-bite incident. The district court held that the claims were time barred. Butler contends that the one-year statute of limitations, as applied to his federal claims, violated his right to equal protection. He also argues that defendants waived the statute of limitations or, alternatively, that they are equitably es-topped from asserting it. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Butler, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the district court properly applied the relevant substantive law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. We do note that Butler\u2019s suit was filed within six months of the denial of his state administrative claims but more than a year after the dog-bite incident from which his claims arose. We proceed to Butler\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">We find no equal protection problem with the application of California\u2019s one-year statute of limitations<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to Butler\u2019s federal claims. The fact that California has chosen to create administrative filing requirements for state claims,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that claimants may in some circumstances have slightly more time to file state claims than they do to file federal ones, shows no discrimination against federal causes of action of the kind <em>Wilson v. Garcia </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> sought to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-15\">We also conclude that the defendants did not waive the statute of limitations by failing to raise the issue as an affirmative defense in their answer. Strict adherence to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) is not required so long as no prejudice results.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Butler does not assert that prejudice resulted, and we find no evidence of prejudice in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-16\">We reject Butler\u2019s second waiver argument, as well as his argument for estoppel. At best, the warning in the letter denying Butler\u2019s administrative claims was confusing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The letter may indeed be susceptible to more than one interpretation. Precisely for that reason, however, it fails to support Butler\u2019s argument that it therefore would lull someone into thinking that th\u00e9 statute of limitations for the federal claims was longer than the statute for state claims. Confusion does not establish reasonable reliance. Moreover, Butler\u2019s attorney does not argue that he actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>was lulled into relying on the possible interpretation of the letter that he advances. He merely argues that the letter was confusing and subject to multiple interpretations. Accordingly, we reject Butler\u2019s second waiver argument and his argument for estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b597-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-11\">. <em>Clicks Billiards, Inc. v.
