(HMR) move to consolidate appeal nos. 01-1191, -1218, - 1332 with their recently filed appeal (undocketed) and for leave to file a corrected opening brief. Amgen opposes in part and moves to \u201creinstate the district court\u2019s March 27, 2001 order granting Amgen an extension of time in which to file its second notice of cross-appeal\u201d and to resume the briefing schedule. HMR opposes in part and replies. Amgen replies. We also consider whether Amgen\u2019s second notice of appeal was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-26\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts declared, inter alia, that claims 4-9 of one of Amgen\u2019s patents were not infringed. In appeal no. 01-1191, Amgen timely ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>pealed the district court\u2019s judgment. Am-gen\u2019s notice of appeal designated review of the district court\u2019s judgment that claims 4-8 were not infringed. After the expiration of the time to appeal, Amgen filed a motion in the district court for an extension of time to file a second notice of appeal to include claim 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The district court granted Amgen\u2019s motion for an extension of time. On June 4, 2001, this-court vacated the district court\u2019s order granting an extension of time because the district court did not make any findings regarding \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) (\u201cThe district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal if: (i) a party so moves no later than 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires; and (ii) that party shows excusable neglect or good cause\u201d). This court remanded \u201cfor the limited purpose of allowing the district court to provide reasons whether or not Amgen demonstrated excusable neglect.\u201d On October 9, 2001, the district court stated its reasons for granting the motion for an extension of time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court stated that it had granted the extension to prevent \u201ca possible anomaly,\u201d i.e., that its reasoning for finding noninfringement applied equally to claims 4-8 and claim 9 and that if this court were to reverse its determination regarding claims 4-8 but not reach claim 9 because of Amgen\u2019s typographical error, the defendants would be able to practice the invention covered by claim 9 even though the district court\u2019s reasoning had been overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Under the applicable regional circuit law, we review the district court\u2019s Rule 4(a)(5) determination for an abuse of discretion. <em>Mirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc., </em>212 F.3d 624, 627 (1st Cir.2000). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit applies the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of and factors concerning \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d as stated in <em>Pioneer Inv. Serv. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, </em>507 U.S. 380, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993). <em>See Virella-Nieves v. Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp., </em>53 F.3d 451, 454 n. 3 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">In <em>Pioneer Inv., </em>the Supreme Court defined \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d in the context of Fed. Bankr.Proc. Rule 9006(b)(1) first by noting that Congress, by using the term \u201cneglect,\u201d indicated that courts \u201cwould be permitted, where appropriate, to accept late filings caused by inadvertence, mistake, or carelessness, as well as by intervening circumstances beyond the party\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Pioneer Inv., </em>507 U.S. at 388, 113 S.Ct. 1489. Regarding the term \u201cexcusable,\u201d the Supreme Court stated that such an \u201cequitable\u201d determination would include factors such as \u201cthe danger of prejudice to the [other side], the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395, 113 S.Ct. 1489. The requirement that the neglect be \u201cexcusable,\u201d the Supreme Court explained, would deter parties from \u201cfreely ignoring court-ordered deadlines.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">Here, applying the <em>Pioneer Inv. </em>factors, the \u201cdanger of prejudice\u201d to HMR is minimal because Amgen had already clearly indicated its intent to appeal the judgment of noninfringement. The length of the delay was minimal and had little impact on judicial proceedings, except to allow all arguments to be presented by Amgen. The reason for the delay was simply a typographical error, and although argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>ably within the reasonable control of Am-gen, it was not an attempt to \u201cignor[e] court-ordered deadlines.\u201d Also, there was no indication that Amgen was not acting in good faith in seeking the extension. Applying these factors to the district court\u2019s order, we discern no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Further, we note that HMR\u2019s appeals of the district court\u2019s orders granting Am-gen\u2019s motion for an extension of time (01-1332 and an undocketed appeal) are unnecessary, as the appropriate procedure to challenge an asserted untimely appeal is, by motion or otherwise, to challenge the appeals as untimely. Thus, HMR\u2019s appeals regarding the extension are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">(1) HMR\u2019s appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s grants of Amgen\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file a second notice of appeal, are dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">(2) HMR\u2019s motions to consolidate and file an amended opening brief are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">(3) Amgen\u2019s motion to resume the briefing schedule is granted. Amgen\u2019s opening brief is due within 30 days of the date of filing of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">(4) A copy of this order shall be transmitted to the merits panel assigned to hear these appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-6\">. We construe that order as a grant of an extension of time to file a notice of appeal. Thus, Amgen\u2019s motion to \"reinstate the district court's March 27, 2001 order\u201d is unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b953-12\">. The dismissed appeals include HMR's appeal of the district court\u2019s March 27 order (appeal no. 01-1332) and HMR's appeal of the district court's October 9 order (appeal number not yet assigned). When the appeal of the October 9 order is received by this court, it will be docketed and sua sponte dismissed pursuant to this order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
