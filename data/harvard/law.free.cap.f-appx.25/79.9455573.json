Although plaintiff correctly notes that nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ther the magistrate judge\u2019s report nor the district court\u2019s order discussed certain factual assertions of retaliation he made after filing his complaint, the lack of such discussion provides no basis for reversal. The undiscussed assertions were not within the scope of the complaint; and plaintiff failed to show any causal connection between plaintiffs actions and the alleged additional acts by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
