The facts of this case are set forth in the concurrently published opinion in <em>United States v. Portillo-Mendoza, </em>2001 WL 1631857 (9th Cir. 2001), in which we remanded the case for resentencing. Here we consider the other challenges Portillo-Mendoza raises to his conviction. None are meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Section 1326(a)(2) attaches penalties to any previously deported alien who \u201centers, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States.\u201d Portillo-Mendoza was charged with entering, attempting to enter, and being found in the United States. He maintains that this indictment was duplicitous. An indictment may charge conjunctively actions that are separate ways of committing the same crime and that a statute describes in the disjunctive. <em>See United States v. Urrutia, </em>897 F.2d 430, 432 (9th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Hobson, </em>519 F.2d 765, 773 (9th Cir.1975). The indictment was not duplicitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Section 1326 applies to aliens who have \u201cbeen denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or [have] departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1). The Order to Reinstate Portillo-Mendoza\u2019s prior deportation is a \u201cremoval\u201d as defined by the statute and regulations. <em>See, e.g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8(a). As an alien who had been previously deported, Portillo-Mendoza was not entitled to a hearing before an Immigration Judge. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Appellant was removed subsequent to his conviction. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2 application notes. The 1999 administrative action concluded with a final order announcing that Portillo-Mendoza was \u201csubject to removal/deportation from the United States\u201d pursuant to the reinstatement of the previous order. This \u201cWarrant of Removal\u201d was a new, dated removal that was issued subsequent to Appellant\u2019s DUI convictions and pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231 and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Congress authorized and mandated all of the sentencing guidelines applied in this case. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101; U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. statutory provision. Portillo-Mendoza\u2019s other challenges to his sentencing enhancement are foreclosed by the Supreme Court decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-42, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and our recent decision in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 412 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">We REVERSE and REMAND for re-sentencing for reasons set out in our accompanying opinion. The District Court is AFFIRMED in all other respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b571-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
