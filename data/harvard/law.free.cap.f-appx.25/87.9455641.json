Upon the parties\u2019 cross-petitions, we deny Union Carbide\u2019s petition for review and grant the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">King worked for Union Carbide from 1973 until 1994, when he was laid off by the Company. Union Carbide re-hired King on June 29,1998 as a mechanic in the maintenance department, representing Union Carbide\u2019s first hiring in more than 10 years at its Charleston, West Virginia plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">On his first day back at Union Carbide, June 29, a Union Carbide administrator explained to King the benefits to which he was entitled. The administrator explained that he would not receive a vacation for six months, but was entitled to holidays during his 120-day probationary period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">On July 21, King learned that he had a \u201ccontinuous service date\u201d of July 31, 1977. A continuous service date, or \u201cCSD,\u201d is a date determined by Union Carbide that affects various employee benefits, including an employee\u2019s entitlement to retirement and vacation benefits. Additionally, the collective bargaining agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) in effect mandated that employees receive a paid CSD holiday every year. J.A. 337, pp. 29-30, Article 11.1. Employees who worked on their CSD would be paid at double-time-and-a-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">Upon learning on July 21 that his CSD was July 31, King initiated several conversations to determine whether, as a new employee, he could take July 31 as a CSD holiday. Because Union Carbide had not hired anyone in almost 10 years, the issue was relatively new to the Company and, apparently, not easily resolved. First, King asked Derrick Peaks about his enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tlement to a CSD holiday. Although Mickey Games, who was Union Carbide\u2019s General Maintenance Supervisor, was King\u2019s supervisor, Peaks filled in for Games while Games took vacation. Peaks did not know the answer to King\u2019s question, so he spoke with Carla Abshire of Union Carbide\u2019s Human Resources department. Abshire told Peaks that she would investigate the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Second, once Games returned from vacation, King asked him about King\u2019s entitlement to a CSD holiday. Like Peaks, Games called Abshire, who told Games that she already was investigating the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Third, King called Abshire several times before July 31 to discuss the matter. She could not provide a definitive answer, stating that she still was investigating the matter. Thus, without a definitive answer, King worked on July 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Fourth, on August 3, King asked Danny Lawrence whether he was entitled to a CSD holiday. Lawrence was King\u2019s new supervisor after Union Carbide assigned King to a project in another area of the facility. \u2022 Like Games and Peaks, Lawrence called Abshire, who told Lawrence that she was investigating the matter. Additionally, Lawrence told King to \u201clay off this. Everyone in the Plant knows about it. Don\u2019t make no more trouble until you get a hundred and twenty days in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Finally, once Union Carbide transferred King back to Games on August 17, King told Games that the CSD issue had \u201cgotten blown out of proportion\u201d and that he wanted the matter to settle down. Games replied that King\u2019s frequent questioning caused the matter to be blown out of proportion and that King should have just \u201clet the system work.\u201d When Games accused King of raising the CSD issue with Lawrence immediately upon his transfer, despite knowing that Games already asked Abshire to investigate the matter, King called Lawrence a \u201cfucking liar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Jeff Means, the Maintenance Superintendent, fired King on August 28. Means testified that he fired King for two reasons: (1) the purportedly disruptive manner in which King pursued the CSD issue, and (2) King\u2019s attitude toward safety issues and overtime. As to the second proffered reason, Union Carbide specifically points to three warnings King received during his first two weeks of employment about his failure to wear safety glasses when required. Additionally, King purportedly complained about Union Carbide\u2019s overtime policy, stating that he \u201cmight be stuck out there every night.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Means also pointed to an earlier conversation King had with Games as proof of King\u2019s poor attitude. Before even beginning his new job with Union Carbide, King complained to Games about the Company\u2019s purportedly low pay scale. When Games told King that Union Carbide would not raise his pay scale, King complained that Union Carbide was already \u201cfucking\u201d him. Games relayed this conversation to Means, who then sought to retract Union Carbide\u2019s offer of employment to King. Means changed his mind, though, upon the advice of Union Carbide\u2019s Human Resources department.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">In March 1999, Union Carbide decided that it should have allowed King to take July 31,1998 as a CSD holiday or paid him double-time-and-a-half for working that day. Thus, it sent him a check covering the unpaid amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">Upon the institution of this action, an ALJ held that Union Carbide committed an unfair labor practice by firing King. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings after receiving Union Carbide\u2019s exceptions. The Board rejected Union Carbide\u2019s contentions that King was not engaging in concerted activity and that, even if he was, the manner in which he engaged in that activity stripped him of the protections of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d). The Board applied for enforcement of its order and Union Carbide petitioned for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We must affirm the Board\u2019s factual findings if they are \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); <em>see also Medeco Sec. Locks, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>142 F.3d 733, 742 (4th Cir.1998); <em>Fieldcrest Cannon, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>97 F.3d 65, 69-70 (4th Cir.1996). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Alpo Petfoods, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>126 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1997) (internal quotation omitted). If such evidence exists, we must uphold the Board\u2019s decision \u201ceven though we might have reached a different result had we heard the evidence in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250 (internal quotation omitted). Moreover, we affirm the Board\u2019s interpretations of the NLRA if they are \u201crational and consistent\u201d with the NLRA. <em>NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., </em>494 U.S. 775, 787, 110 S.Ct. 1542, 108 L.Ed.2d 801 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Section 7 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157) of the NLRA guarantees employees \u201cthe right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations ... and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d Section 8(a)(1) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1)) makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7.\u201d An employer violates Section 8(a)(1) if it terminates an employee for engaging in \u201cconcerted activity.\u201d <em>NLRB v. City Disposal Systems, Inc., </em>465 U.S. 822, 833 n. 10, 104 S.Ct. 1505, 79 L.Ed.2d 839 (1984); <em>NLRB v. Waco Insulation, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 596, 599-601 (4th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of unlawful termination based on concerted activity, the NLRB General Counsel bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence \u201c(1) that the employee was engaged in protected activity, (2) that the employer was aware of the activity, and (3) that the activity was a substantial or motivating reason for the employer\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Medeco, </em>142 F.3d at 742. An employer successfully may rebut the General Counsel\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case with evidence that the employer \u201c \u2018nonetheless would have taken the same employment action for legitimate reasons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ultrasystems Western Constructors, Inc. v, NLRB, </em>18 F.3d 251, 257 (4th Cir.1994)). However, if the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons are \u201cnon-existent or pretextual,\u201d the employer\u2019s defense will fail. <em>USF Red Star, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>230 F.3d 102, 106 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">It is important to note that the NLRA \u201cdoes not require that an employer cease its legitimate business practices or suspend its proper disciplinary prerogatives.\u201d <em>Consolidated Diesel Co. v. NLRB, </em>263 F.3d 345, 352 (4th Cir.2001). Rather, \u201c[w]e must balance the employees\u2019 protected right against any substantial and legitimate business justification that the employer may give for the infringement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Medeco, </em>142 F.3d at 745). \u201c[I]t is only when the interference with \u00a7 7 rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>outweighs the business justification for the employer\u2019s action that \u00a7 8(a)(1) is violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While there is some \u201cleeway for impulsive behavior,\u201d an employee\u2019s concerted activity loses the NLRA\u2019s protection if the conduct is \u201cflagrant,\u201d <em>Dreis &amp; Krump Co. v. NLRB, </em>544 F.2d 320, 329 (5th Cir.1976), or \u201cso egregious that it exceed[s] the scope of whatever protection it might otherwise have been entitled to under the Act.\u201d <em>Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>276 NLRB 1323, 1326 (1985) (\u201cconcerted activity loses its protection under the Act when actions are malicious, defamatory, or insubordinate\u201d). <em>See also City Disposal, </em>465 U.S. at 837, 104 S.Ct. 1505 (\u201cThe fact that an activity is concerted, however, does not necessarily mean that an employee can engage in the activity with impunity. An employee may engage in concerted activity in such an abusive manner that he loses the protection of \u00a7 7\u201d). Thus, the employer\u2019s interest \u201cin operating his business in a particular manner\u201d must be weighed against the employee\u2019s right to engage in concerted activity. <em>NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., </em>373 U.S. 221, 227-29, 83 S.Ct. 1139, 10 L.Ed.2d 308 (1963); <em>NLRB v. Lester Brothers, Inc., </em>337 F.2d 706, 708 (4th Cir.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The Board held that (1) King engaged in concerted activity by inquiring into whether he was entitled to a CSD holiday; (2) Union Carbide knew that the CSD holiday was covered by the Agreement; and (3) King\u2019s concerted activity was a substantial or motivating reason in Union Carbide\u2019s decision to terminate him. On appeal, Union Carbide challenges these findings on two grounds: (1) that King did not engage in concerted activity, and (2) that, even if King engaged in concerted activity, King\u2019s conduct in pursuing the activity was so egregious that it took him outside the scope of \u00a7 7. We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">In support of its first argument, Union Carbide argues that Kang merely asked about his CSD in general, rather than about his entitlement to a CSD holiday. This difference is critical, according to Union Carbide, because a CSD is established by corporate policy, not by the Agreement. Thus, any inquiries relating to the CSD could not be considered concerted activity. In support, CSD points to Article 15.1(C) of the Agreement, which defines a CSD as \u201cCompany service time utilized for benefits purposes as defined by [Union Carbide] Corporate Policy[.]\u201d J.A. 337, page 42, Article 15.1(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">However, the task of determining whether an activity is concerted and protected lies with the Board in the first instance because the task \u201cimplicated [the Board\u2019]s expertise in labor relations.\u201d <em>City Disposal, </em>465 U.S. at 829, 104 S.Ct. 1505. Thus, we give considerable deference to the Board\u2019s finding that an employee engaged in such activity. <em>Id.; NLRB v. Local Union No. 103 Int'l Ass\u2019n of Iron Workers, </em>434 U.S. 335, 350, 98 S.Ct. 651, 54 L.Ed.2d 586 (1978). Substantial evidence exists to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that King did more than merely inquire about his CSD in general; King\u2019s queries focused on whether he was entitled to a CSD holiday on July 31. King\u2019s inquiries to Peaks, Garnes, and Lawrence all centered on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Moreover, there can be no dispute that the Agreement, rather than Union Carbide corporate policy, provided King with the entitlement to a CSD holiday. Article 11.1 of the Agreement states that \u201c[t]he following are recognized holidays: ... Company Service Date.\u201d J.A. 337, page 30, Article 11.1(A). Accordingly, substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>supports the Board\u2019s decision that King\u2019s conduct constituted concerted activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Next, Union Carbide claims that the manner in which' King pursued his concerted activity places him outside the scope of \u00a7 7. Union Carbide explains that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYv\">[djuring the course of events, King requested [that] no fewer than three managers check into his CSD. Furthermore, he himself called Carla Abshire, ... three or four different times to check on his CSD. Indeed, when all was said and done, there, were three Human Resources Liaisons and one division head involved in the issue of King\u2019s CSD. King simply refused to cease agitating and let the system work. Moreover, King twice lied about who he had approached about the CSD issue and even called a supervisor a \u201cfucking liar.\u201d King had been repeatedly counseled by management that he needed to pursue the CSD issue through the proper channels, so as to avoid unnecessary disruption to productivity, yet he persisted in disregarding that instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Appellant\u2019s Br. at 27 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">As explained above, an employee can lose the protections of \u00a7 7 if the manner in which he engages in concerted activity is flagrant, egregious, or abusive. The Board held that King\u2019s conduct did not rise to that level because \u201cthere is no question in this case ... that Mr. King performed his job in a very satisfactory if not an outstanding manner\u201d and King\u2019s language was \u201cnot language sufficient to remove him or his conduct from the protections of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Neither King\u2019s conduct nor choice of language rises to the level of being flagrant, egregious, or abusive. King reportedly used foul language only once while in the employ of Union Carbide. While King\u2019s choice of words on that occasion may have been poor, \u201can employee\u2019s use of obscenity [is] protected where it constituted a spontaneous outburst during the heat of a formal grievance proceeding or contract negotiations, or was provoked by an employer\u2019s unfair labor practice.\u201d <em>Caterpillar, </em>276 NLRB at 1326. King\u2019s offensive remark occurred during a conversation with Garnes about his CSD holiday. <em>See also NLRB v. Waco Insulation, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 596 (4th Cir.1977). Additionally, King\u2019s repeated attempts to determine whether he was entitled to a CSD holiday were not so flagrant or egregious as to leave him unprotected. King merely pursued, albeit aggressively, his right to a CSD holiday at a time during which Union Carbide failed to provide him with a determinative answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Union Carbide\u2019s petition for review and grant the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED, AND CROSS-APPLICATION FOR ENFORCEMENT GRANTED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">Petition for review denied and cross-application for enforcement granted by unpublished opinion.
