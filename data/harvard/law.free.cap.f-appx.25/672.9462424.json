We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review summary judgment de novo, <em>Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1018 (9th Cir. 1991), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-16\">The district court properly found that Skinner\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim alleging inadequate mental healthcare was barred by the three-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 4.16.080(2). Skinner was aware since at least January 1993 that the mental treatment for sexual deviancy available during his incarceration was allegedly inadequate because it was not \u201cAfro-centric.\u201d Thus, Skinner\u2019s claim was untimely filed in February 2000. <em>See Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 258, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-20\">Skinner\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b700-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
