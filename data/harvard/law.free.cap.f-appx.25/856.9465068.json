Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Truitt A. Segers\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because he has appealed from a nonfinal order. Segers has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-24\">On May 31,1998, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied Segers\u2019 claim for a light staph epidermidis and light gaffkya species, concluding that Segers\u2019 claim was not well-grounded. Segers appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and the Secretary moved for remand based on the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-475, 115 Stat.2096 (VCAA). The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims granted the Secretary\u2019s motion, vacated the Board decision, and remanded for readjudication based on the VCAA. In its remand order, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims noted that Segers did not oppose the remand in his \u201canswer\u201d to the Secretary\u2019s motion, but that if a remand were granted, Segers requested expedited consideration by the Board and that his case be completed \u201con or before a date set by the Court.\u201d In denying that request, the court concluded that Segers did not present \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d to warrant an order directing that Segers\u2019 claim be adjudicated by a date certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-25\">In his informal brief, Segers asserts that statements in support of his claim \u201cwere withheld and would have made a material difference in the decision(s) made had they been made a part of the record.\u201d However, as noted by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in its remand order, Segers \u201cis free to submit additional evidence and argument necessary to the resolution of his claim\u201d on remand. Segers does not challenge the court\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>his request for expedited consideration on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">This court has jurisdiction over final decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Winn v. Brown, </em>110 F.3d 56, 57 (Fed.Cir.1997); <em>Johnson v. Derwinski, </em>949 F.2d 394, 395 (Fed.Cir.1991); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). \u201cThis court typically does not have jurisdiction over Court of Veterans Appeals [now Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims] remands because they are not final judgments.\u201d <em>Winn, </em>110 F.3d at 57. <em>See also Cabot v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 1539 (Fed.Cir.1986) (remand to administrative agency <em>for </em>additional findings is not appealable even though remand order resolves an important legal issue). This case does not fall within the \u201ccollateral order exception\u201d to the final judgment rule because Segers may later obtain review from an adverse final judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims that falls within our jurisdictional mandate. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). Neither does it fall within any of the other exceptions permitting appeals from remand orders. <em>See Adams v. Principi, </em>256 F.3d 1318 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>Travelstead v. Derwinski, </em>978 F.2d 1244 (Fed. Cir.1992). Therefore, we must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
