We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s summary judgment upholding the Commissioner\u2019s final decision, <em>Macri v. Chater, </em>93 F.3d 540, 543 (9th Cir.1996), and we review for substantial evidence the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings, <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 1995). We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">In our review for substantial evidence, we must consider the administrative record as a whole, <em>see Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1989), and because the record as a whole includes contradictory evidence provided by the Commissioner, substantial evidence does not support the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. The matter is remanded to the District Court with instructions to vacate the summary judgment previously entered and remand the matter to the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration for further proceedings to fully develop the record, which will include a proper accounting that reconciles the information provided to Perry in her SSA-1099\u2019s to the amount of benefits she was entitled to and paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b534-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
