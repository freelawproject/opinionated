In the initial decision, the administrative judge (AJ) found no evidence that M\u00fcado ever made CSRS contributions. The AJ' determined that M\u00fclado was not entitled to a CSRS annuity because his service between 1946 and 1947 was less than five years and his subsequent service was pursuant to excepted indefinite or temporary appointments. <em>See R\u00f3sete v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>48 F.3d 514 (Fed.Cir.1995) (upholding OPM\u2019s interpretation that an indefinite appointment is excluded from to dismiss appeal as frivolous when appeal presents no arguably meritorious issue for consideration). Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">(1) Mi\u00fcado\u2019s petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">(2) Mifiado\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-18\">(3) If M\u00fclado files another document with this court and, upon review, it is determined that the arguments are frivolous, this court w\u00fcl consider the imposition of monetary sanctions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
