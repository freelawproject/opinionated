Ann S. Azdell and Donald B. Fish-man (Azdell) respond. The Director replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">On October 20, 2000, the Merit Systems Protection Board determined that OPM\u2019s implementation of a new scoring formula in 1996 for administrative law judge (ALJ) examinations did not meet the basic requirements set forth at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.103(a) and (b) and violated the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. The Board ordered OPM to rescind and cancel all scores assigned under the 1996 scoring formula, to reconstruct the ALJ register and all certificates of eligibles that were issued while the 1996 scoring formula was in effect, and to provide priority consideration for future ALJ vacancies to class members who were adversely affected by the 1996 scoring formula. On July 13, 2001, the Board denied OPM\u2019s motion for reconsideration and affirmed its October 20, 2000 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(d), OPM may obtain review of a final Board order if OPM determines \u201cthat the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management and that the Board\u2019s decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule regulation, or policy directive.\u201d The statute further provides that \u201c[t]he granting of the petition for review shall be at the discretion of the court of appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">OPM states that the Board\u2019s \u201cerroneous decision\u201d will have a substantial impact upon the civil service for two reasons. First, OPM argues that the Board\u2019s conclusion that it possesses jurisdiction to review OPM\u2019s implementation of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act \u201cpresents a serious and substantial question of law that will have a recurring importance.\u201d Second, OPM asserts that \u201cthe Board\u2019s conclusion that OPM\u2019s 1996 scoring formula violates 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.103 constitutes an improper interference with OPM\u2019s administration of the competitive examination system for administrative law judges.\u201d Azdell agrees that \u201cthe Board\u2019s final decision concerns an interpretation of civil service law and that its decision will have an impact on personnel management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">\u201c[I]t is the duty of this court independently to assess whether an exercise of our discretionary jurisdiction is warranted because the decision below will have a substantial impact on civil service law.\u201d <em>Devine v. Sutermeister, </em>724 F.2d 1558, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1983). Given the ramifications of the Board\u2019s decision on the conduct of competitive examinations for ALJ positions, we conclude that it is appropriate for this court to review the Board\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">OPM\u2019s petition for review is granted. Once docketed, OPM\u2019s petition for review will be consolidated with the earlier petition for review, no. 01-3057, filed by Murray M. Meeker, F. William Roggeveen, Jay E. Levine, and William S. Colwell.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
