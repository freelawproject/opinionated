We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, <em>Moore v. Reno, </em>185 F.3d 1054 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Reynosa contends the district court erred by dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition because he can no longer file a timely \u00a7 2255 motion, and the one-year statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) renders 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 an inadequate and ineffective remedy to test the legality of his detention. Reynosa also contends that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction with respect to his underlying offense. Because Reynosa\u2019s procedural contention is without merit, we need not consider his jurisdictional contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">Reynosa\u2019s inability to bring a motion under \u00a7 2255 because of the statute of limitations, does not render that remedy inadequate or ineffective. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>210 F.3d 1058, 1060 (9th Cir .2000) (applying statute of limitations to federal prisoners); <em>Moore, </em>185 F.3d at 1055. Reynosa neither appealed his conviction and sentence nor filed a section 2255 motion within the applicable one-year time period. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Reynosa\u2019s petition therefore was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
