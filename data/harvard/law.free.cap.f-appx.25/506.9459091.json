The BIA first rendered its decision on the basis of erroneous facts not in the record, but then reconsidered its decision, on Campos\u2019 motion, and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision denying \u00a7 212(c) relief, in its discretion, on the basis of the facts in the record. Because the discretionary denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief is not reviewable under IIRIRA, we lack jurisdiction over Campos\u2019 petition for review. IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E) (\u201cThere shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision under \u00a7 212(c) ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-17\">Campos also raises a due process claim based on the fact that the BIA initially considered facts not in the record in its decision. This court retains jurisdiction over constitutional claims despite the limitations on judicial review in IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E). <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). We deny Campos\u2019 constitutional claim on the merits, however, because Campos cannot show prejudice from the BIA\u2019s error in light of the fact that the BIA reconsidered his application in the absence of the unsupported facts it had considered earlier. <em>United States v. Nicholas-Armenta, </em>763 F.2d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201c[D]ue process challenges require a showing of prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-18\">Accordingly, we deny Campos\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
