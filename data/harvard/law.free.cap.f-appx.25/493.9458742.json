Lengesso originally brought a complaint against South Dakota State Prison (SDSP) and its warden, Mike Durfee State Prison (MDSP) (fka Springfield State Prison) and its warden, and MDSP Mental Health Services (MHS). In his amended complaint, Lengesso named six individual defendants, alleging the following. Prior to his transfer to MDSP, he informed three SDSP staff members of his concern for his safety (fear for his life) because of problems he had with another inmate at MDSP. Upon his arrival at MDSP, he also informed three MDSP staff members of his concern for his safety. He alleged that his complaints were totally disregarded \u2014 other than his being directed to MHS where he was offered medication for his \u201cparanoia\u201d \u2014 and that he was assaulted by another inmate nine days after his transfer. For the reasons discussed below, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-19\">We review 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) dismissals de novo. <em>See Cooper v. Schriro, </em>189 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam). We conclude Lengesso stated an Eighth Amendment claim for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>protect, as he alleged facts showing defendants knew of, yet disregarded, a serious risk to his safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Construing his pro se complaint liberally, <em>see Martin v. Sargent, </em>780 F.2d 1334, 1337 (8th Cir. 1985), and accepting the allegations as true, <em>see Estate of Rosenberg v. Crandell, </em>56 F.3d 35, 36 (8th Cir.1995), it appears that Lengesso informed defendants of the risk of assault by another inmate, that his requests for safety were completely ignored, and that he was then assaulted, <em>see Webb v. Lawrence County, </em>144 F.3d 1131, 1135 (8th Cir.1998) (Eighth Amendment imposes duty on part of prison officials to protect prisoners from violence at hands of other prisoners, because being subject to violent assaults is not part of penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses); <em>Prater v. Dahm, </em>89 F.3d 538, 541 (8th Cir.1996) (Eighth Amendment imposes duty on part of prison officials to protect prisoners from attacks; duty to protect requires only that prison officials take reasonable measures to abate substantial risks of serious harm of which they are aware). On remand, Lengesso should be permitted to proceed against the three named SDSP staff members and the three named MDSP staff members; the remaining defendants should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
