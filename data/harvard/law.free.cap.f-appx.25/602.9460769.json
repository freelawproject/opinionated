It now appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of its insured, Holland America Cruise Lines (\u201cHolland America\u201d). The district court awarded Holland America $1,083,383.25, but denied its request for attorneys\u2019 fees. Holland America cross-appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its request for attorneys\u2019 fees. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>On January 20, 1993, a major storm caused Holland America\u2019s centralized nationwide reservation facility in Seattle to lose power from approximately 11:00 a.m. through 4:30 a.m. the following day. Because its computer was down, Holland America\u2019s agents were unable to book any reservations and instead instructed callers to call back at another time.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Holland America maintained a business interruption insurance policy that required Fireman\u2019s Fund to pay 75 percent of covered losses less a $100,000 deductible. The insurer invoked an arbitration clause to have \u201cAppraisers\u201d establish the amount of the loss on the claim. The Appraisers agreed that Holland America suffered $1,855,514 in lost revenue and expenses during the power outage, but when \u201cmakeup\u201d reservations were taken into account the cruise line\u2019s actual loss was only $411,003. Based on the latter figure and applying the deductible formula, Fireman\u2019s Fund paid Holland America $233,252.25 consistent with the policy terms. Ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ordered Fireman\u2019s Fund to pay an additional $1,083,383.25, plus pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Ins. Co. of North Am. v. NNR Aircargo Serv. (USA), Inc., </em>201 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir.2000). A business interruption insurance policy is designed to protect the \u201cearnings which an insured would have enjoyed had there been no interruption of business.\u201d <em>Keetch v. Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co., </em>66 Wash. App. 208, 831 P.2d 784, 786 (1992). Construction of an insurance policy is a question of law for the courts, and the policy should be construed as a whole and given a fair, reasonable, and sensible interpretation. <em>Kitsap County v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>136 Wash.2d 567, 964 P.2d 1173, 1177 (Wash.1998). \u201cUnder the indemnity principle of insurance, an insured receives only that amount that will indemnify actual loss, not an additional windfall above this amount.\u201d <em>Dombrosky v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>84 Wash.App. 245, 928 P.2d 1127, 1136 n. 4 (Wash.Ct.App.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">The district court erred by awarding Holland America a substantial windfall, thereby overcompensating it for its loss. Holland America should not be awarded damages for losses it never sustained. To do otherwise would frustrate the purpose of business interruption coverage, which is limited to protecting the earnings the insured would have enjoyed had there been no interruption. <em>Keetch, </em>831 P.2d at 786. It would also violate the basic principle <em>of </em>insurance law that, absent bad faith on the part of the insurer, an insured is entitled to compensation only for losses actually suffered. <em>Dombrosky, </em>928 P.2d at 1136 n. 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">Holland America cross-appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its request for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to <em>Olympic Steamship Co. v. Centennial Ins. Co., </em>117 Wash.2d 37, 811 P.2d 673 (Wash.1991). We review the district court\u2019s decision regarding the award of , attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Roy Allan Slurry Seal v. Laborers Int\u2019l Union, </em>241 F.3d 1142, 1145 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">In <em>Olympic Steamship, </em>the Washington Supreme Court held that an insured has the right to recoup attorneys\u2019 fees where \u201can insurer refuses to defend or pay the justified action of the insured.\u201d 811 P.2d at 681. The insurer in <em>Olympic Steamship </em>precipitated the lawsuit by denying coverage to the insured. By awarding fees, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>court sought to address the disparity of bargaining power between \u201can insurance company and its policyholder.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Holland America\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Olympic Steamship </em>has been limited to situations where the insurer unsuccessfully denied coverage, not where the extent or value of coverage was in dispute. <em>See, e.g., Dayton v. Farmers Ins. Group, </em>124 Wash.2d 277, 876 P.2d 896, 898 (Wash. 1994); <em>Solnicka v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>93 Wash.App. 531, 969 P.2d 124, 125-26 (Wash.Ct.App.1999). Fireman\u2019s Fund did not refuse coverage, and paid Holland America $233,252.25 prior to this lawsuit. This amount was reasonable because it was based on the Appraisers\u2019 determination of Holland America\u2019s actual loss after make-up reservations, minus the amount deducted under the formula in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The district court\u2019s higher award in favor of Holland America is REVERSED, and the district court\u2019s denial of Holland America\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees is AFFIRMED. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">. The district court also held that Fireman\u2019s Fund was not entitled to an offset for funds Holland America received from Lexington Insurance Company. Fireman\u2019s Fund does not dispute this ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b632-6\">MCKEOWN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AnG\">Dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">I dissent with respect to the reversal of the district court\u2019s award of damages to Holland America. The panel majority resolves this case by relying on the principle that an insured should receive \u201conly that amount that will indemnify actual loss, not an additional windfall above this amount.\u201d <em>See Dombrosky v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>84 Wash.App. 245, 928 P.2d 1127, 1136 n. 4 (Wash.Ct.App.1997). Whatever weight we should give this policy beyond its limited application by Washington state courts, the majority\u2019s reliance on this principle overlooks our primary obligation to construe the contract itself and enforce it accordingly. Our starting point should be the contract entered into by these sophisticated parties, rather than the relative monetary outcome or equities. Any evaluation of loss is limited to the Period of Restoration, which concludes when the business is up and running after the business interruption \u2014 not at some later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The Period of Restoration \u2014 which the parties agree creates the relative scope of indemnity \u2014 is defined as \u201cthe length of time, commencing with the date of damage or destruction, which will be required, with the exercise of due diligence or dispatch, to repair, rebuild or replace the damaged or destroyed property.\u201d This language is straightforward and directly supports the larger award of damages in this case. The remainder of the language in the definition is intended to give the insured broader, not lesser, protection in two instances that are inapplicable here: (1) when the policy expires before the above defined period has ended; and (2) when the insured is able to partially restore operations before the damaged property is completely restored. The final phrase of the definition merely ensures that the above two conditions of coverage will not be read to cover any losses incurred beyond the already-defined Period of Restoration. It, too, is inapplicable to this case, and does not support a reading that would expand the relevant period of restoration beyond the time it took to fully repair Holland America\u2019s power supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">To the extent that the contract language supports an alternative reading, Washington law is clear that ambiguous terms must be construed against the insurer. <em>See Witherspoon v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>86 Wash.2d 641, 548 P.2d 302, (Wash.1976) (\u201cIt is fundamental that ambiguities in the policy must be construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured.\u201d). Likewise, we have underscored the importance of this rule. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>Kunin v. Benefit Trust Life Ins. Co., </em>910 F.2d 534, 540 (9th Cir.1990) (quoted in <em>Emter v. Columbia Health Serv., </em>819 P.2d 390, 394 (Wash.Ct.App.1991) (\u201cinsurer ... should not be allowed to take advantage of the very ambiguities that it could have prevented with greater diligence\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Fireman\u2019s Fund has made too much of the language defining Period of Restoration in order to avoid liability under the contract. The real problem with the policy lies in its definition of Loss of Revenue, which fails to incorporate any sort of mitigation or \u201cmake-up\u201d component. Although Washington courts have upheld explicit setoff clauses in policies to prevent double recoveries, <em>see Keenan v. Indus. Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>108 Wash.2d 314, 738 P.2d 270, 272-73 (Wash.1987), the panel majority would have us expand this notion to include <em>implied </em>mitigation provisions into poorly-drafted policies. Because courts should neither override contract language nor usurp the insurer\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the scope of coverage is clear and unambiguous, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
