Cunningham, an Ohio resident represented by counsel, appeals a district court order denying her application for attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B). The parties have waived oral argument and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. RApp. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">In 1993, Cunningham applied for social security disability insurance benefits and for supplemental security income benefits. After exhausting her administrative remedies, Cunningham filed an appeal with the district court seeking a review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying benefits. Upon de novo review of a magistrate judge\u2019s report, the district court affirmed the denial of benefits in part and remanded a portion of the Commissioner\u2019s decision for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">Cunningham then petitioned the district court for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA. Upon de novo review of a magistrate judge\u2019s report, the district court denied the request for fees. It is from this decision that Cunningham appeals. On appeal, Cunningham asserts that the district court abused its discretion -in denying her attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision not to award attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA for an abuse of discretion. <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 559, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988); <em>United States v. $515,060.42 in U.S. Currency, </em>152 F.3d 491, 506-07 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"AkF\">The EAJA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-16\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses ... incurred by that party in any civil action ... brought by or against the United States ... unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-17\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). Eligibility for a fee award in a civil action thus requires that: 1) the claimant was a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d 2) the government\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d and (3) no special circumstances would make an award unjust. <em>Commissioner, INS v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 158, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-18\">As the district court noted, the Commissioner\u2019s decision was substantially justified and therefore Cunningham was not enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tied to attorney\u2019s fees. The government was successful in defending the Commissioner\u2019s decision as to the onset date of Cunningham\u2019s alleged disability. Further, the district court did not find Cunningham disabled. Rather, it remanded the request for benefits to the Commissioner for further development of the record as to three specific issues. As the government was successful in estabhshing that Cunningham was not disabled between 1993 and July 31, 1997, the government\u2019s position was substantially justified and the denial of attorney\u2019s fees under the FAJA was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
