We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Cervantes contends that the district court erred by denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, despite an uncontested enhancement for obstruction of justice. We review for clear error, see <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>80 F.3d 368, 370 (9th Cir.1996), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">While conduct leading to an obstruction of justice enhancement \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct,\u201d there are \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d in which adjustments for both obstruction of justice and acceptance of responsibility may apply. See U.S.S.G. 3E1.1 cmt. n. 4 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The district court found that Cervantes\u2019s post-arrest conduct was inconsistent with an acceptance of responsibility, citing his failure to appear for a court hearing and felonious conduct after absconding from pre-trial supervision. Granting the requisite deference to the district court\u2019s findings, see <em>United States v. Hopper, </em>27 F.3d 378, 381-82 (9th Cir.1994), we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that Cervantes\u2019 case was not so extraordinary as to warrant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See Thompson, </em>80 F.3d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b704-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
