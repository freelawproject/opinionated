The error claimed by the defendant must therefore be that the facts found are inconsistent with the ultimate conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence, or that the judgment could not have been rendered without violating the plain rules of reason. <em>New Haven Rendering Co. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>89 Conn. 252, 253, 93 Atl. 528. To test this claimed error we necessarily turn to the facts found.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">The collision occurred in the intersection of Wind-ham and Valley streets in the populous part of the city of Willimantic. Windham Street runs north and south <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>and intersects Valley Street, which runs east and west at right angles. Each street is about thirty feet wide. At about the time of the collision the plaintiff\u2019s automobile was being operated in a southerly direction on the west side of Windham Street at a speed of from ten to twelve miles an hour. A stone wall and terrace on the west side of Windham Street shut off a clear view of Valley Street west of the intersection of the two streets so that the driver of plaintiff\u2019s car could not see the defendant\u2019s car until plaintiff\u2019s car was close to the intersection, and defendant\u2019s car was about fifty feet west of the intersection. When plaintiff\u2019s car was a short distance from the intersection of these two streets the driver saw defendant\u2019s car approaching easterly upon the south side of Valley Street about fifty feet away. The plaintiff\u2019s car then entered the intersection and proceeded on the west side of Wind-ham Street until it had crossed the center line of the intersection, the front wheels of the car being then on the south line of Valley Street, and its rear wheels being south of the center line of Valley Street. At this point defendant\u2019s car, coming from the west on the south side of Valley Street, ran into plaintiff\u2019s car, striking it on its right side at a point just back of the rear door and causing the damage for the recovery of which plaintiff sues. At the time of the impact the entire left half of Valley Street back of plaintiff\u2019s car was open and unobstructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">If the two cars had been arriving at this intersection at approximately the same time it would have been the duty of the plaintiff to give the defendant\u2019s car, which was approaching the intersection from plaintiff\u2019s right, the right of way. Public Acts of 1923, Chap. 246, \u00a7 1. But the situation was not such.. When plaintiff arrived at the intersection, the defendant was nearly fifty feet to the west of it; the plaintiff\u2019s car had en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tered the intersection and had proceeded some distance through it when the defendant\u2019s car entered it. The trial court finds that \u201cthe plaintiff had no reason to believe, as he approached, entered, and was proceeding through the intersection, that he must stop his car to avoid collision with the defendant\u2019s car.\u201d This conclusion is one of fact and could reasonably be drawn from the subordinate facts. Under these circumstances the plaintiff and not the defendant had the right of way. <em>Neumann </em>v. <em>Apter, </em>95 Conn. 695, 701, 112 Atl. 350. The plaintiff had the right to assume that the defendant would grant him the right, of way, and would have his car. under such control that the plaintiff, while in the exercise of reasonable care, could proceed through the intersection without danger of defendant\u2019s car colliding with him. <em>Laufer </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Traction Co., </em>68 Conn. 475, 37 Atl. 379; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Vergason, </em>95 Conn. 431, 436, 111 Atl. 625; <em>Woodhull </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>100 Conn. 361, 124 Atl. 42; <em>Rohde </em>v. <em>Nock, </em>101 Conn. 439, 126 Atl. 335. The plaintiff\u2019s duty, in continuing on in his course, was to operate his car as a reasonably prudent person with the knowledge that he had the right of way would operate his car under like circumstances. <em>Rohde </em>v. <em>Nock, supra. </em>In that case the defendant arrived at the intersection first; in this case the plaintiff not only arrived at the intersection first, but the front part of his car was nearly through it when the defendant\u2019s car entered it. The situations in the two cases are reversed, but the same principle is applicable-</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff could not with reasonable diligence have prevented the collision is fully supported by the subordinate facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
