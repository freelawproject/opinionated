The jury rendered its verdict in favor of the defendant upon its counterclaim, which the trial court set aside on the ground that the reckless operation by the driver of defendant\u2019s truck was the proximate cause of the collision with plaintiff\u2019s car, and that the proof of defendant\u2019s damages was insufficient to support the verdict. There was a clear conflict in the evidence between the plaintiffs and defendant^ claims as to how the collision occurred. Whether the negligence of the servant of defendant materially contributed to the damage done to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>defendant\u2019s truck was a fair question of fact for the jury to resolve. The proof of the damage to defendant\u2019s truck, together with interest thereon in amount, was sufficient to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">There is error; the Superior Court is directed to enter its judgment upon the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
