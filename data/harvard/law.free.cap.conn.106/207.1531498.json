About a week before he went to the hospital for it, he wrote and signed three papers, and called upon a servant employed in the house where he was living with his married sister and her family to sign them as a witness, without, however, disclosing their contents. Later the same day he gave her a key to his trunk, then in the house, telling her that in it was a sealed envelope addressed to the plaintiff, and another addressed to one Armstrong; and he instructed her that, as the finding states it, \u201cin the event of hfs death\u201d she should open the trunk and deliver the envelopes to those to whom they were addressed. While this particular finding is not attacked, the plaintiff seeks to have incorporated in the finding a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>that Sargent\u2019s instructions were that the envelopes were to be delivered \u201cupon his death,\u201d and an examination of the evidence in that connection discloses that the servant gave as his actual words: \u201cIf I go to the hospital, in case I die, that envelope is to be given to her.\u201d We see no occasion to change the finding in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Sargent died as a result of the operation. The trunk had meanwhile remained in the dining room of his home. The servant opened it after his death, finding there the two envelopes Sargent had referred to. That addressed to the plaintiff was inscribed: \u201cTo be opened in case of death only. Grace\u2014personal.\u201d This the servant delivered to the plaintiff, and, on opening it, she found the bank-book representing the savings account and two of the papers witnessed by the servant. One of these was an order upon the bank, signed by Sargent and directing the payment of the amount due upon the book to the plaintiff, substantially in the form outlined in the book for such orders, except that, after the date and above the name of the bank was written: \u201cIn case of death.\u201d The other paper read: \u201cI hereby this day in case of death leave victrola and sewing machine to be given to Mrs. Grace Daginella.\u201d The plaintiff was in no way related to Sargent and he had known her only a short time.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The trial court has expressly found that Sargent had no intention when he signed the papers to make a present gift to the plaintiff, but was seeking to make a disposition of the property testamentary in its nature. For this finding the appellant seeks to substitute one to the effect that Sargent intended a present gift of the amount on deposit in the banks. The circumstances surrounding Sargent\u2019s conduct on the day the papers were executed strongly suggests the unlikelihood that, if he survived the operation, he intended to deprive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>himself of all rights to the use of the fund for his own purposes. The very expression, repeatedly used by him, \u201cin case of death,\u201d in itself connotes a contingency without the happening of which the gift was not to take effect; it is almost antithetical to the suggested interpretation, \u201cupon my death,\u201d for death is certain. <em>Fischer </em>v. <em>Fischer, </em>75 N. J. Eq. 74, 77, 71 Atl. 488. That Sargent did not mean a present gift is indicated also in the paper referring to the victrola and sewing machine by the conjunction of the expressions, \u201cin case of death ... to be given to Mrs. Grace Daginella\u201d; the word \u201cleave\u201d in the same document is suggestive rather of a bequest to take effect at death than a present gift; and the use of the phrase \u201cthis day\u201d is as readily referable to an attempt then to make a provision of a testamentary nature as to an intent to make a gift immediately effective. The trunk remained in his possession as long as he lived. The entrusting of the key of the trunk to a servant in the household where he lived in itself suggests that, if he lived, Sargent expected to regain control of it. Certainly the conclusion of the trial court that Sargent was attempting to make a gift testamentary in its nature and did not intend a present gift, instead of being one which could not reasonably be reached, was one which could hardly have been avoided. There is no basis for correcting the finding and it necessarily follows that there was no gift of the money on deposit in the bank. <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>104 Conn. 17, 22, 131 Atl. 742; <em>Main\u2019s Appeal, </em>73 Conn. 638, 640, 48 Atl. 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
