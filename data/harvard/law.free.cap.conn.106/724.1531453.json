The defendant\u2019s assignments of error, that the facts found do not support the court\u2019s conclusions that defendant was negligent and that plaintiff\u2019s negligence did not proximately contribute to the injuries she sues to recover for, are, upon the finding uncorrected, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">Error is assigned because of the allowance of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>amendment by the court after the trial, and upon its own suggestion. Neither finding nor record shows that the amendment was allowed after trial, nor that it was allowed over defendant\u2019s objection and exception, nor that defendant did not have full opportunity to have made objection to its allowance. In the absence of a finding we cannot consider this ground of appeal. The finding that plaintiff suffered a crossing of the eyes as part of her injuries is assigned as error because not alleged in the complaint. The evidence came in without objection; it is too late to question it. Moreover, it was, as we think, fairly responsive to the allegation that plaintiff \u201csuffered a displacement of facial features which caused a disfigurement for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
