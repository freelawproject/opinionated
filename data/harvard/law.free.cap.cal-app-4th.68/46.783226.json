Under the Oakland Police and Fire Retirement System (Fire Retirement System), a retiree\u2019s pension is a fixed percentage of the <em>current </em>compensation \u201cattach[ed] to the . . . rank\u201d the retiree held upon retirement. Thus, as the salaries of active firefighters increase, so do the pensions Oakland (City) pays to its retired firefighters. This is a so-called \u201cfluctuating\u201d pension system.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">The federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) currently requires the City to pay firefighters time and one-half for every hour they work in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>excess of 204 hours per 27-day pay period. The City must pay this \u201covertime\u201d premium even though the firefighters work more than 204 hours as part of their \u201cnormal\u201d schedule. The primary question in this case is whether such federally mandated overtime pay is \u201cattached to the rank\u201d the retirees held at the time they retired, and must therefore be included in calculating their pensions. We agree with the trial court that such premium pay is not \u201cattached to the rank\u201d the retirees held at retirement, but is instead \u201cattached\u201d to the individuals within a rank. Consequently, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The Fire Retirement System is a creature of the Oakland City Charter (Charter) (Charter, art. XXVI). All sworn City firefighters hired on or before June 30,1976, are members of the Fire Retirement System. Those hired after that date are members of the separate, state-created Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The Charter specifies that, under the Fire Retirement System, a retiree\u2019s pension is a fixed percentage<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the \u201ccompensation attached to the average rank held\u201d at the time of retirement. (Charter, \u00a7 2608.) The Charter defines the terms \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201ccompensation attached to the average rank held\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">\u201c \u2018Compensation\u2019 as distinguished from benefits under the Labor Code of the State of California, shall mean the monthly remuneration payable in cash, by the City, without deduction, for the time during which the individual receiving such remuneration is a member of the Police or Fire Department, but excluding remuneration paid for overtime and for special details or assignments as provided in Sections 91 and 97 of the Charter.\u201d (Charter, \u00a7 2607, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">\u201c \u2018Compensation attached to the average rank held\u2019 shall mean the compensation attached to the lowest rank held during the three years immediately preceding retirement plus one thirty-sixth (1/36) of the difference between it and the compensation attached to any higher rank held during that period of each month . . . the higher rank was held.\u201d (Charter, \u00a7 2607.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">A. <em>FLSA Premium Pay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">In 1985, the United States Supreme Court held that the FLSA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.) applies to local governments. <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>San Antonio Metro. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>Transit Auth. </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 528 [105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016].) The FLSA requires the City to pay its fire protection employees at the \u201covertime\u201d rate (one and one-half times their regular rate of pay) if they <em>actually </em>work more than 204 hours during a standard 27-day work period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 207(a)(1), 207(k); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 553.230(c) (1998).) Hours paid for vacation, illness, leave or similar reasons do not count toward the 204-hour maximum of hours <em>actually </em>worked. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(e)(2); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 553.221 (1998).)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The City normally schedules most firefighters<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to work one 24-hour shift every third day. Thus, a firefighter may be scheduled to work nine 24-hour shifts in a twenty-seven-day work period. If a firefighter works this full schedule, he or she will work 216 hours (9 x 24) in the 27-day work period, and will be entitled to 12 hours of pay at time and one-half. However, as a practical matter, more often than not firefighters do not work nine full shifts in a twenty-seven-day period. This is because most pay periods include a mandatory day off, vacation time, sick leave or some other event that brings the firefighter\u2019s number of total hours actually worked below the 204-hour maximum. Retirees\u2019 own analysis of the data the City provided shows that from 1992 to 1995 the average number of times a firefighter received FLSA premium pay\u2014i.e., the average number of times a firefighter actually worked more than 204 hours in a 27-day pay period\u2014ranged from a low of 2.21 times per year in 1995 to a high of 2.57 times in 1992. This is only a fraction of the 13.5 27-day pay periods during each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Moreover, the City\u2019s analysis of the 1992-1995 statistical data shows the amount and frequency of FLSA premium pay varied widely from individual to individual and from rank to rank. For example, among the lowest rank (\u201cfirefighter\u201d), the percentage who received <em>no FLSA premium pay at all </em>ranged from a low of 7 percent in 1995 to a high of 21 percent in 1993; the average number of times an entry-rank firefighter received premium pay ranged from 2.09 times per year to 2.40 times per year; and the number of <em>actual </em>premium hours individual entry rank firefighters worked in a given year ranged from a low of 0 to a high of 48.5 hours. Similarly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>percentage of engineers who received no premium pay ranged from a low of 8 percent in 1992 to a high of 27 percent in 1993; the average number of times an engineer received premium pay ranged from 1.75 times per year to 2.48 times per year; and the number of actual premium hours individual engineers worked each year ranged from a low of 0 to a high of 39.2 hours. With respect to the higher ranks, the percentage of lieutenants who received no FLSA premium pay ranged from a low of 9 percent in 1994 to a high of 25 percent in 1993; the average number of times a lieutenant received premium pay ranged from 1.19 to 1.83 times per year; and the number of premium hours individual lieutenants worked each year ranged from 0 to 30.6 hours. Finally, the percentage of captains who received no premium pay ranged from 13 percent in 1994 to 26 percent in 1992; the average number of times a captain received premium pay ranged from 1.93 to 2.16 times per year; and the number of premium hours individual captains worked each year ranged from 0 to 47.2 hours.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Because of the variability in the data, the City\u2019s economic expert, Jerald Udinsky, Ph.D., opined in a declaration that the \u201caverage\u201d annual number of times all firefighters received FLSA premium pay from 1992 to 1995 (2.5) was not a meaningful predictor of the experience of <em>most </em>firefighters. According to Dr. Udinsky: \u201cThe use of an average is meaningful in terms of predicting what the experience of the vast majority [of] individuals will be only if the amounts and frequency are regularly distributed in a small range around the average. The average then is useful as a proxy for the expected/ predictable experience because most individuals\u2019 actual experience will not differ dramatically/significantly from the average. The data [concerning firefighters\u2019 receipt of FLSA premium pay from 1992-1995] is distributed over a wide range, and in an irregular pattern. For example, if 91% of the individuals received FLSA Premium Pay between 2 and 3 occasions a year, the [average of 2.5 times per year] would accurately predict the frequency of receipt of such pay by employees in the Fire Department. However, the data I reviewed reveals that the 2.5 occasions . . . [is] not even close to the actual experience of the vast majority of Fire Personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">B. <em>Procedure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Retirees filed a petition for writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) seeking to force the City to include FLSA premium pay in calculating their pensions. After a hearing, the trial court issued a writ commanding the City to include 30 hours of FLSA overtime pay per year in determining the \u201ccompensation attached to the average rank held.\u201d This translated into an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>additional 15 hours of \u201cstraight\u201d pay per year in calculating the compensation attached to each rank.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">After the City lost at the first trial, it filed a motion for new trial. The new trial motion relied on the Udinsky declaration, which highlighted the variability of FLSA premium pay from individual to individual and from rank to rank. The trial court granted the motion for new trial. The court stated a new trial was warranted because it was convinced \u201cfrom its review of the entire record that it should have reached a different decision on the issue of whether [FLSA premium] pay is \u2018compensation attached to the rank.\u2019 \u201d The court noted its original decision was \u201cpredicated on FLSA premium pay being dependent upon a person\u2019s rank\u201d while the evidence showed such pay was dependent upon \u201chours actually worked by individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Following a second hearing, the trial court issued its judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate. In its statement of decision the trial court concluded the City pays FLSA premium pay to firefighters for working their normal work schedule, and thus such pay is not \u201covertime\u201d pay (which the Charter expressly excludes from the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d). (Charter, \u00a7 2607; see <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Public Employees Retirement System, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 1470 <em>(City of Sacramento).) </em>However, the court found that although FLSA premium pay <em>is </em>compensation, it is <em>not </em>\u201ccompensation attached to the average rank held\u201d for the purpose of determining a retiree\u2019s pension. In short, the court concluded FLSA premium pay is not \u201cattached to the rank,\u201d but instead depends upon \u201can individual\u2019s work hours during each work period.\u201d Thus, FLSA premium pay is not included in the base compensation the City uses in calculating a retiree\u2019s pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">After the trial court denied their motion for new trial, retirees filed this appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Ordinary mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) is the appropriate procedural mechanism for resolving the dispute in this case. <em>(McKeag </em>v. <em>Board of Pension Commrs. </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 386, 392 [132 P.2d 198]; <em>Kern </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 848, 850 [179 P.2d 799].)  A traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 is a method for compelling a city to perform a legal, usually ministerial duty. <em>(Pomona Police Officers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Pomona </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 583-584 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 205].)  When a court reviews an administrative decision pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, it merely asks whether the agency\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, or whether the agency failed to follow the procedure and give the notices the law requires. <em>(Los Angeles Lincoln Place Investors, Ltd. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 53, 59 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 600].) In reviewing a trial court\u2019s judgment on a petition for writ of ordinary mandate, we apply the substantial evidence test to the trial court\u2019s factual findings. However, we exercise our independent judgment on legal issues, such as the interpretation of statutory retirement provisions. <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Common Council </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 684, 689 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 161]; <em>Saathoff </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 697, 700 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 352]; <em>Ghilotti Construction Co. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 897, 903-904, fn. 1 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 389]; <em>City of Sacramento, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1478.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">A. <em>The Trial Court Properly Found FLSA Premium Pay Is Not \u201cAttached to the Rank\u201d the Retirees Held at Retirement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The trial court agreed with retirees that FLSA premium pay was not \u201covertime\u201d and thus constituted \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of the Charter. However, the trial court went on to hold that because FLSA premium pay is highly variable from individual to individual, it is <em>not </em>compensation \u201cattached to the . . . rank held.\u201d Because we agree FLSA premium pay is not compensation \u201cattached\u201d to a rank, we affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The parties agree the Charter creates a so-called \u201cfluctuating\u201d pension plan in which pensions increase or decrease as the compensation paid to active employees increases or decreases. <em>(Eichelberger </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 182, 185 [293 P.2d 1]; <em>Newhouser </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 322, 327 [93 Cal.Rptr. 166]; <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 508, 511, fn. 1 <em>(Dunham).) </em>The primary purpose of a fluctuating pension plan is to guarantee the pensioner a fairly constant standard of living despite inflation, and to maintain equality of position between the retired member and the person (or persons) currently holding the rank the pensioner attained before his retirement. <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 128, 132 [287 P.2d 765]; <em>Dunham, supra, 7 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 514; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 204, 215-216 [3 Cal.Rptr. 127].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Retirees point out that if we include FLSA premium pay in calculating their pensions it would serve to \u201cmaintain equality of position\u201d between active firefighters and retired firefighters, since most active firefighters currently receive some FLSA premium pay. However, the mere fact that including FLSA premium pay would arguably serve one of the purposes of a fluctuating pension system does not answer the primary question before us: did the City intend to treat FLSA premium pay as compensation \u201cattached\u201d to a rank?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We construe the Charter in the same manner we construe a statute. \u201cOur sole objective is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. [Citation.] We look first to the language of the charter, giving effect to its plain meaning. [Citation.] Where the words of the charter are clear, we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the charter or from its legislative history.\u201d <em>(Domar Electric, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 161, 171-172 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 521, 885 P.2d 934]; <em>First Street Plaza Partners </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 650, 663 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 626].) Nevertheless, \u201c[a]ny ambiguity or uncertainty in the meaning of pension legislation must be resolved in favor of the pensioner, but such construction must be consistent with the clear language and purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>(Ventura County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 483, 490 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 304, 940 P.2d 891] <em>(Ventura County); Grimm </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 33, 38 [156 Cal.Rptr. 240].)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Turning first, as we must, to the language of the Charter, we focus on what the City<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> intended when it stated in the Charter that a retiree\u2019s pension will be based on the compensation \u201cattached\u201d to the average rank held at the time of retirement. (Charter, \u00a7 2608.) Of the many definitions that appear for \u201cattach\u201d in the Oxford English Dictionary the most apposite to this case is: \u201cTo adhere to, as an appertaining quality or circumstance; to be incident to . . . .\u201d (1 Oxford English Diet. (2d ed. 1989) p. 759.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the precise question we must answer is whether ELSA premium pay \u201cadhere[s] to, as an appertaining quality or circumstance\u201d of a particular rank, or is \u201cincident to\u201d that rank.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">As the trial court pointed out, the evidence demonstrates that \u201cELSA Premium Pay is dependent upon an individual\u2019s <em>actual </em>work hours during each work period.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, ELSA premium pay does not \u201cadhere\u201d to a rank as an \u201cappertaining quality or circumstance.\u201d Instead, although all firefighters of all ranks are <em>eligible </em>to receive ELSA premium pay, they do not receive such pay merely because they hold a particular rank. In sum, receipt of ELSA premium pay has nothing to do with \u201crank,\u201d and everything to do with a particular firefighter\u2019s schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">1) <em>The City of Sacramento Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\"><em>City of Sacramento, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 1470 is retirees\u2019 primary authority for their position that ELSA premium pay should be included in calculating their pensions. However, as we explain below, <em>City of Sacramento </em>involved PERS. PERS is a fixed (not fluctuating) plan that calculates a retiree\u2019s pension on the basis of the compensation \u201ceamable\u201d in a fixed period before retirement. This, of course, is not equivalent to compensation that is \u201cattached\u201d to the rank the retiree formerly held.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In <em>City of Sacramento </em>the court considered whether ELSA premium pay was \u201ccompensation\u201d for the purpose of calculating firefighter retirement pay under the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law (PERL), the statutory system that created PERS. (229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1478.) Under the PERL, determining what items constitute \u201ccompensation\u201d is essential to computing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>employee\u2019s ultimate pension benefits. PERS calculates the pension to equal a certain fraction of the employee\u2019s \u201cfinal compensation,\u201d based on the employee\u2019s age and length of service. (Gov. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 21252.01, 21252;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1478.) At the time pertinent to <em>City of Sacramento, </em>the PERL defined final compensation as the \u201c \u2018highest average annual <em>compensation eamable </em>by a member during the three consecutive years of employment immediately preceding the effective date of his retirement.\u2019 \u201d (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 20024.01, italics added; 229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1479.) Under the PERL, \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d is not based on an individual\u2019s efforts, but is defined as \u201c \u2018the <em>average monthly compensation </em>as determined by the board upon the basis of <em>the average time </em>put in by members in the same group or class of employment and at the same rate of pay. . . .\u2019\u201d (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 20023, italics added; 229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1479; see Gov. Code \u00a7 20636, subd. (g)(1).) \u201cCompensation\u201d includes \u201c \u2018any special compensation for performing normally required duties such as holiday pay, bonuses (for duties performed on regular work shift)\u2019 \u201d but excludes overtime. (Gov. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 20022, subd. (a)(8), 20025.2; 229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The <em>City of Sacramento </em>court first concluded that, under the specific definition for overtime the PERL established, ELSA premium pay was not \u201covertime\u201d and thus was not excluded from the PERL\u2019s definition of \u201ccompensation.\u201d (229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1479, 1484-1487; see fn. 7, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The <em>City of Sacramento </em>court then turned to Sacramento\u2019s second argument: that ELSA pay was \u201cserendipitous, nonrecurring and irregular between individual firefighters\u201d and was therefore akin to certain \u201clump-sum payments\u201d the PERL excluded from the definition of compensation. (229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1487; see <em>Santa Monica Police Officers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 96 [137 Cal.Rptr. 771] [lump-sum payment for unused sick leave and vacation excluded from \u201ccompensation\u201d for retirement purposes].) The <em>City of Sacramento </em>court concluded checks for ELSA premium pay were not \u201clump-sum payments\u201d that distort the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>legislative scheme, as they were paid regularly and could not accumulate over time. (229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1487-1488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Retirees attempt to analogize the present case to <em>City of Sacramento </em>and argue, in effect, that the analysis in that case should determine the result in this case. What retirees fail to acknowledge is that <em>City of Sacramento </em>and the present case involve completely separate and dissimilar statutory schemes. The present case involves a fluctuating pension plan under which the key question is whether FLSA premium pay is \u201cattached\u201d to the rank the retirees formerly held. As we have indicated, the Charter does not define the meaning of \u201cattached\u201d in this context, and we are forced to resort to more general sources to determine the meaning of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">By contrast, <em>City of Sacramento </em>considered a fixed retirement plan where the key question was whether FLSA premium pay is part of the \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d by a member. Moreover, the PERL specifically defined \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d as \u201c \u2018the <em>average monthly compensation </em>as determined by the board upon the basis of <em>the average time </em>put in by members in the same group or class of employment and <em>at the same rate of pay. . . </em>.\u2019\u201d (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 20023, italics added; 229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1479; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 20636, subd. (g)(1).) If we had a similar definition in this case, we would agree that FLSA premium pay is part of the \u201caverage monthly compensation\u201d calculated on the basis of the \u201caverage time\u201d firefighters work. However, the language of the Charter does not permit us to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Instead of calculating retirement benefits on the basis of the \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d by those in the retiree\u2019s former rank, the Fire Retirement System calculates retirement benefits on the basis of the compensation \u201cattached\u201d to the rank the retiree held upon retirement. In our view, by using the term \u201cattached\u201d the City intended a more restrictive view of compensation than the one the PERL employs. Had the framers of the City Charter wanted to model the Fire Retirement System on PERS or similar fixed pension systems they could have done so. The term \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d has been used in various state retirement statues since the 1930\u2019s. (See <em>Ventura County, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 502-504.) Because the City chose <em>not </em>to use that term in the Charter, it is reasonable to conclude it intended to define the scope of compensation in a manner different from the extant state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">As we have stated, in the context of the City\u2019s Fire Retirement System, \u201cattached\u201d means the compensation must \u201cadhere to\u201d the rank \u201cas an appertaining quality or circumstance.\u201d That is, the employee must be entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the compensation by virtue of the rank, and not his individual efforts over and above what are required to obtain the rank. Viewed in this light, the trial court properly concluded that FLSA premium pay is not \u201cattached\u201d to the \u201caverage rank held\u201d at retirement. Consequently, the City need not include FLSA premium pay in calculating retirees\u2019 pension benefits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">2) <em>Cases Interpreting Other Fluctuating Pension Plans.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In addition to <em>City of Sacramento, </em>retirees cite cases that address whether specific forms of payment are compensation \u201cattached\u201d to a rank. Retirees claim that, in those cases, the courts concluded pay items were compensation \u201cattached\u201d to a rank even though the pay item was \u201cvariable\u201d\u2014meaning some members of a rank received the item while others did not. As we explain below, none of those cases specifically address the issue we consider here (whether FLSA premium pay is \u201cattached\u201d to a rank), and, in our view, they do not compel a different result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Retirees rely primarily on <em>Dunham, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 508. In <em>Dunham, </em>Berkeley had a fluctuating police retirement plan in which benefits were based on the \u201c \u2018average salary attached to the respective rank or ranks held during the three years immediately preceding the date of retirement. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 511.) After the plaintiffs in the case retired, Berkeley established a new \u201cSenior Patrolman\u201d and \u201cCareer Incentive [P]rogram\u201d which increased the salaries of police who met certain longevity and training requirements. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 512.) The retired plaintiffs contended they were entitled to the benefit of these new programs in calculating their retirement benefits. Berkeley responded that the Senior Patrolman and Career Incentive classifications were <em>new </em>ranks, created after the plaintiffs retired, and thus they were not the \u201crank or ranks\u201d the retirees held before retiring; consequently, they were irrelevant to calculating the plaintiffs\u2019 pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division Four, found the new classifications did not create \u201cnew\u201d ranks, but instead added salary classifications within each rank. The court stated: \u201c[RJegardless of the nomenclature adopted by the city, the new classifications are not separate ranks, but restructuring of ranks.\u201d (7 Cal.App.3d at pp. 513, 515.) Since almost all of the then-current police employees participated in the new incentive programs, the court found the programs \u201cmay reasonably be termed a system of general pay raises.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 513-515.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Importantly, the <em>Dunham </em>plaintiffs introduced evidence that, while employed, they had undergone the same training for which current police employees were receiving extra compensation, and thus would have been entitled to extra compensation under the programs. The <em>Dunham </em>court found that because the plaintiffs \u201cperformed the services, including training, required of them . . . they are entitled to their deferred compensation which, under the pension plan, is to be based on the benefits now received by their active counterparts.\u201d (7 Cal.App.3d at p. 516.) The <em>Dunham </em>court made it clear that the plaintiffs\u2019 pension would be based on the salary of an active employee who had the same number of years of service the plaintiff had completed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 516.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">There are two things to note about <em>Dunham. </em>First, that case involved the definition of \u201crank\u201d; it did not focus on what it means for compensation to \u201cattach\u201d to a rank. Instead, the <em>Dunham </em>court concluded Berkeley could not avoid its obligation to increase the pensions of its retired police by creating bogus \u201cranks\u201d to disguise a general pay raise. (See <em>Dunham, supra, 1 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 513, 515.) By contrast, the present case does not involve a dispute over the meaning of \u201crank,\u201d but instead focuses on what it means for compensation to be \u201cattached\u201d to a rank. Moreover, unlike Berkeley, there is nothing to indicate the City pays FLSA overtime pay to its firefighters in an effort to disguise a general pay increase which would otherwise inure to retirees\u2019 benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Secondly, the <em>Dunham </em>court concluded the retired police had undergone the same training for which current police employees were receiving extra compensation. Thus, the <em>Dunham </em>court could say with assurance that the retired police would have received the increased pay had they been employed under the current pay structure. The same is not true here. There was no evidence the schedules the retirees actually worked when they were employed would have made them eligible for FLSA premium pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In this regard, the present case is similar to <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 236 [15 Cal.Rptr. 576] <em>(Baldwin). </em>In <em>Baldwin, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>court rejected a pensioner\u2019s contention that she was entitled to benefit from a new 5 percent pay increase added to her former position after she retired. San Diego paid the extra compensation to employees who worked on all legal holidays without compensating time off or who worked most of their hours between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 243-244.) However, the pensioner did not introduce evidence that, while employed, she worked all legal holidays or worked most of her hours during the night shifts. Thus, there was no evidence \u201cthe pensioner had performed, while she was employed, the extra services now being compensated.\u201d <em>(Dunham, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.3d at p. 514; <em>Baldwin, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.2d at p. 245.) Thus, the <em>Baldwin </em>court concluded the pensioner failed to show she was entitled to benefit from the 5 percent increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Similarly, in this case, there was no evidence the retirees \u201chad performed, while [they were] employed, the extra services now being compensated.\u201d That is, there was no evidence the retirees\u2019 actual work schedules while they were employed required them to work hours in excess of the FLSA m\u00e1ximums. But even if retirees could introduce such evidence, it would merely prove that FLSA compensation was based on their individual efforts and schedules, and that such compensation does not \u201cadhere\u201d to a rank as an \u201cappertaining quality or circumstance.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">As the City points out, the cases which have found that certain pay increases or premium pay \u201cattached\u201d to a rank involved situations where an employee either did or did not get the extra pay based on meeting certain criteria. <em>(Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.2d at pp. 213-215 [longevity and merit pay]; <em>City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.2d at p. 35 [same]; <em>Estes </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 538, 541, 546 [57 Cal.Rptr. 536] [\u201chazardous duty pay\u201d awarded to all employees who complete one \u201ctour of duty\u201d each month].) Thus, although there was variability, it was limited to whether an employee did or did not get the particular pay item. In each case the court could determine whether the retired plaintiff met the criteria necessary to receive the additional pay. By contrast, FLSA premium pay is variable not only in whether an employee gets it, but in how much the employee gets. As the evidence showed, the amount of FLSA pay each individual firefighter received varied widely. (See Facts, <em>ante, </em>pp. 50-51.) Thus, unlike longevity or merit pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>which can be said to \u201cattach\u201d to a rank (albeit based on the retiree\u2019s meeting certain criteria), FLSA premium pay \u201cattaches\u201d to an individual firefighter\u2019s schedule, not to his rank.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">B. <em>Exclusion of the Splendido </em>Declaration.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The judgment is affirmed.

Under the exemption, public agencies employing firefighters may select a \u201cwork period\u201d of at least seven but not more than twenty-eight days. If a public agency selects a 27-day work period for its firefighters, as the City has done, the agency must pay time and one-half for all hours the firefighter <em>actually </em>works in excess of 204 hours per work period. (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 553.230(c) (1998); <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Public Employees Retirement System </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1470, 1480 [280 Cal.Rptr. 847].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\">For our purposes, \u201cfirefighters\u201d refers to all City firefighters, engineers, lieutenants, captains, fire boat operators, and fire boat engineers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The ranks of inspector, fireboat engineer and fireboat operator experienced similar variability during the 1992-1995 period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b70-10\">The 15-hour figure is derived from the court\u2019s finding that each active employee received FLSA premium pay an average of 2.5 times per year, that on each occasion they worked 12 hours of \u201covertime,\u201d and thus on each occasion were entitled to 6 hours of extra pay (2.5 x 6 = 15).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">We are less certain the trial court was correct when it concluded FLSA premium pay was not \u201covertime\u201d within the meaning of the Charter. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court relied on <em>City of Sacramento, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 1470, 1484-1486. However, the <em>City of Sacramento </em>court was construing PERS law, and relied on a specific PERS statute that defined \u201covertime\u201d as employment \u201cin excess of the hours of work considered <em>normal </em>for employees on a full time basis.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 20025.2, italics added.) Because a firefighter may be entitled to FLSA premium pay even if he is merely working \u201cthe hours of work considered normal for [similar] employees on a full time basis,\u201d receipt of FLSA premium pay does not mean he is working \u201covertime\u201d within the meaning of PERS. As the <em>City of Sacramento </em>court put it: \u201c[B]ecause the City\u2019s firefighters are normally required to work 192 hours during the 24-day work period [which means they would normally be entitled to 10 hours of FLSA premium pay], the FLSA premium is not \u2018overtime\u2019 under section 20025.2 and is therefore not automatically excluded from \u2018compensation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Sacramento, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1486-1487.)</p>\n<p id=\"Az7\">Unlike the PERS legislation, however, the Charter does not have a provision that expressly defines \u201covertime.\u201d Thus, if we were to define the term more colloquially as \u201ctime beyond or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>in excess of a set limit\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internal. Diet. (3d ed. 1961) p. 1611), we might conclude FLSA premium pay <em>is </em>\u201covertime\u201d since it is paid for hours of work performed \u201cin excess of a set limit.\" However, we need not resolve that issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\">We note the charter provisions at issue appear to be part of the charter the Oakland electorate enacted in November of 1968. <em>(Madsen </em>v. <em>Oakland Unified Sch.

(See 16 Cal.4th at pp. 490-491, 503-504.) In that context, and relying on the specific definitions in the CERL, the Supreme Court concluded it is not necessary for certain payments to be made to <em>all </em>members of a rank in order for them to qualify as \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d (16 Cal.4th at pp. 490-491, 499, 503-505.) The court concluded that, in the context of the CERL and the PERL, \u201c \u2018compensation eamable\u2019 is the average pay of the individual retiring employee computed on the basis of the number of hours worked by other employees in the same class and pay rate\u2014that is the average monthly pay, excluding overtime, received by the retiring employee for the average number of days worked in a month by the other employees in the same job classification at the same base pay level.\u201d (16 Cal.4th at p. 504.)
