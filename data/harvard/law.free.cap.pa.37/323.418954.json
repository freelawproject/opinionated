S. Riddle, deceased, surviving executor of Henry Shippen, deceased, as settled by D. A. Finney, administrator of said Riddle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-11\">The account in controversy was filed January 13th 1852. On the 20th of February 1852, exceptions were filed by the administrator of H. Shippen, and an auditor appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-12\">On the 18th of April following an additional exception was filed, claiming that the estate of the deceased executor should be charged with the amount of a judgment of R. Clapp <em>v. </em>David Phipps, which the executor had taken as part of the purchase-money of land belonging to Henry Shippen\u2019s estate, which he had sold, and which was lost by the insolvency of Phipps; and also with a sum of money which Edward Shippen, one of the heirs, had been allowed to collect and retain out of the purchase-money of certain lands in Jefferson county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-13\">The report of the auditor (in which the estate of the deceased executor was charged with both these items), was filed January 3d 1857, to which exceptions were filed by Finney, the administrator of Riddle, and on the same day an issue was directed to determine the liability of Riddle\u2019s estate for these sums, as charged by the auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-14\">The issue was in the name of Arthur Cullom, administrator, <em>de bonis non cum test, annexo </em>of Henry Shippen, deceased, <em>v. </em>D. A. Finney, administrator of J. S. Riddle, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-15\">The declaration was in <em>assumpsit, </em>on a wager on the affirmation of the defendant that his exception was true, to which were added the proper plea and replication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-16\">On the trial, as also by the report of the auditor, it appeared that the executor of Shippen had sold to one Clapp four thousand and five hundred acres of land in Venango county for $1 per acre, and had bound themselves in the contract of sale to take in part payment a transfer of a balance of $1754.88, due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>to Clapp, on a judgment which he held against one David Phipps, in Yenango county, guarantied by Clapp. It appeared further, that the property of Phipps had been sold by the sheriff without producing money enough to reach Clapp\u2019s judgment; and that he was insolvent \u2014 that the heirs of Henry Shippen had brought ejectment against Clapp for the purchase-money, and failed to recover (see the case reported in 8 Casey 265), and that an issue was tried in Crawford county between the heirs of Shippen <em>v. </em>Clapp for this $1754.88, which was decided in favour of the defendant, and the allegation was, that this money was lost to the estate of Henry Shippen by the neglect or misconduct of Riddle, the acting executor. It was conceded that no part of the money due under this contract with Clapp had ever come into his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">On the first point, the court (Galbraith, P. J.) charged the jury, in substance, that the estate of Riddle was answerable in the Orphans\u2019 Court, although the matters alleged were somewhat in the nature of a <em>devastavit; </em>that the estate of Riddle was liable to that of Shippen for the amount of the judgment, if the acts of Riddle were such as to release Clapp from his legal obligation to pay that part of the price of the land sold to him that was included in the Phipps judgment, and it was thereby lost; that the question of negligence in this case was partly a matter of law and partly of fact; that the jury should take the whole evidence on this point into consideration, and if they found that the conduct of Riddle was such as to release Clapp from his guarantee, and the debt was lost by reason of his neglect to exercise due diligence in the collection of the claim, his estate would be liable. If they were of the opinion that due diligence was exercised, their finding on this exception should be for the defendant in the issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-7\">On the second point, the court charged that as Edward Shippen was a legatee, and would receive more than the sum in his hands, that might be adjusted in settling with him on the final distribution ; that although Mr. Riddle had never received the money, still, as it was a proper item in the administration account, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict on this point, and that their verdict should be found for plaintiff or for defendant without any sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-8\">The points (nineteen in number) were all answered by the court below, the substance of which is given above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-9\">Under this charge, the jury found in favour of the plaintiff, whereupon the auditor\u2019s report was confirmed by the court, from which decree of confirmation the defendant in the issue appealed, but took no writ of error to the judgment on the feigned issue.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-10\"><em>J. W. Family </em>and <em>D. A. Finney, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtV\">argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>that there had been no negligence on the part of Riddle; but if that were admitted, it was a technical devastavit, a tort over which the Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction: Torr\u2019s Estate, 2 Rawle 256; Crowell\u2019s Appeal, 2 Watts 296; Weiting and Wife <em>v. </em>Neisley, 1 Harris 650. Executors, as accountants, are only answerable in the Orphans\u2019 Court for the legal assets of an estate; Riddle is, therefore, not answerable here for that which never was in the hands of Shippen, but which at most is only unliquidated damages as a punishment for fraud, negligence, or tort.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-6\">The gr\u00e9at error of the court below was, in holding that Riddle\u2019s estate is answerable for his acts with regard to Clapp, irrespective of negligence. The responsibility of executors is well defined; they are not so rigidly held: Montgomery <em>v. </em>Warchop, 4 Dow. P. C. 109; Thompson <em>v. </em>Brown, 4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 620; Johnston\u2019s Appeal, 12 S. &amp; R. 324; Konigmacher <em>v. </em>Kimmel, 1 Pa. Rep. 257; Dillbaugh\u2019s Estate, 4 Watts 179; Twaddle\u2019s Appeal, 5 Barr 15; Eyster\u2019s Appeal, 4 Harris 376.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">The presumption is that trustees do their duty until the contrary be shown, but the jury were allowed to presume negligence without any proof of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">The administrator of Riddle was only bound to settle Ship-pen\u2019s estate as far as Riddle had done it, and then transfer the assets to Shippen\u2019s administrator, who alone has power to collect the money in the hands of Edward Shippen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-9\">The verdict of the jury should have been framed so as to exclude the interest charged by the auditor. Interest is not allowable in contested claims sounding in damages: 1 Peters\u2019 C. C. 95; Eckert <em>v. </em>Wilson, 12 S. &amp; R. 398; Hester <em>v. </em>Rockhill, 2 W. &amp; S. 365; Fox <em>v. </em>Wilcox, 1 Binn. 194.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-10\"><em>G. Church, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APG\">argued that on this appeal the regularity of the issue cannot be examined; that can only be done on a writ of error. The facts established by the issue are final and conclusive: Wallace <em>v. </em>Elder, 5 S. &amp; R. 146. The Act of 10th April 1848 has settled this point. Even on writ of error there\" is nothing that requires correction. The whole question has been passed on in Riddle <em>v. </em>Clapp, which establishes Riddle\u2019s liability. The record of that case was evidence: 7 Barr 24, 228. Nor was Clapp incompetent as a witness in the issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-11\">The case of the appellee does not rest solely on the negligence of Riddle, though he was guilty of legal negligence. But he was Shippen\u2019s executor, and had no right to make that estate an agent to collect Clapp\u2019s judgment. He had power to sell Ship-pen\u2019s land, but not to barter or exchange it: Miles <em>v. </em>Richwine, 2 Rawle 199; Waldron <em>v. </em>McCombs, 1 Hill 111; Bloomer <em>v. </em>Waldron, 3 Hill 361; State <em>v. </em>Bell, 7 Gill &amp; Johns. 444; Billington\u2019s Appeal, 3 Rawle 54; 9 W. &amp; S. 131; 2 Jones 162; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Bonsall\u2019s Appeal, 1 Rawle 383; Dillbaugh\u2019s Estate, 4 Watts 439.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-6\">When land is sold by an executor he is responsible for the price: 4 Barr 149; 2 Jones 67, 71; 10 P. L. Journ. 216.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-7\">Each executor is answerable for his own acts: Boyd <em>v. </em>Boyd, 1 Watts 368; McNair\u2019s Appeal, 4 Rawle 157; Stell\u2019s Appeal, 10 Barr 183; 5 Barr 508; Bulkley\u2019s Appeal, 3 Barr 425; Stewart\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. R. 422; 3 Pa. Rep. 204; Hall <em>v. </em>Boyd, 6 Barn 179, 267; 1 S. &amp; R. 241; Huger\u2019s Estate, 18 S. &amp; R. 68; Nye\u2019s Estate, 8 W. &amp; S. 254; Konigmacher <em>v. </em>Kimmel, 1 P. R. 214; Long\u2019s Estate, 6 Watts 46; Johnston\u2019s Estate, 9 W. &amp; S. 107.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-8\">An accountant cannot be allowed for payments made to distributees ; that would be distribution and not administration: Thomas <em>v. </em>Reagh, 5 Rawle 266; 8 Watts 254; 5 Barr 97; 10 Barr 144; 6 W. &amp; S. 190.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-9\">The question of interest was not involved in the issue. It was matter of law for the Orphans\u2019 Court, and not in the Common Pleas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-10\">But if liable in the former for the principal, the interest follows as a matter of course: 1 Binn. 194; 10 Barr 408; 1 S. &amp; R. 241; 7 S. &amp; R. 268; 5 Barr 91; 2 Rawle 305.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AnRH\">November 1860,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b326-12\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abh\">The case of Shippen\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Clapp, 5 Casey 265, as we have said in Cullum <em>v. </em>Clapp, determined, that the sale made by the executors of Shippen (of whom I. Stuart Riddle was one) to Ralph Clapp was a valid one. The opinion in Cullum <em>v. </em>Clapp affirmed the decision of the court below, by which a credit of $1754.88 was allowed to Clapp, upon the judgment entered up against him, on his bond and warrant of attorney to the executors of Shippen. This credit was given, because the executors of Shippen took the control of the judgment against Phipps, as stated in the articles of agreement of the same date with the bond, and because when, in the hands of Mr. Riddle, it was collectable, and the money was lost through his neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">The present case is an appeal by D. A. Einney, Esquire, acting-administrator of I. Stuart Riddle, from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Crawford county, upon the administration account of said Riddle as surviving executor of Judge Shippen, as settled by Mr. Einney as acting administrator as aforesaid. Two questions arose upon this account, and were the subject of exceptions to the report of the auditor, and also of a feigned issue directed to the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford county at the request of the accountant. The rulings of the court upon the trial of that issue, and the ultimate decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court, are assigned for error here. No writ of error has been taken to the judgment in the feigned issue, and therefore, in considering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>assigned errors, we are governed <em>hy </em>the principles laid down in Hallowell\u2019s Appeal, 8 Harris 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The two questions submitted to the jury in the feigned issue were, whether: 1st. The accountant should be charged with the amount of the Clapp judgment and interest; 2d. Whether he should be charged with amount of money paid Edward Shippen.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The first and real question was substantially the same as that decided in Cullum <em>v. </em>Clapp, and we have examined with great care the different rulings of the learned judge, and cannot find that any injury has been sustained by the accountant by any of them. Two juries, supported by the approval of two courts, have found exactly in the same way, and it is not our business or province to say their findings are erroneous. Both establish the fact: 1st. That the heirs or devisees of Judge Shippen have lost the sum of $1754.88, with interest; 2d. That this amount was lost through the neglect or default of I. Stuart Riddle, one of the executors, and whose account is now before us. Taking this for granted, this sum of money so lost to his <em>cestui que trusts </em>is a proper charge against him, and we see no error in the final decision of the court below upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Upon the second question \u2014 there appears to have been no particular stress laid upon it, as Mr. Riddle\u2019s estate can eventually lose nothing by it. The paper-books give no clear account of it; but, looking at the plaintiff\u2019s 5th point, and the defendant\u2019s 13th point, we think the court were right in their answers, and the verdict finds the facts as stated by the plaintiff. It was, therefore, a proper charge against the accountant, and will be allowed on the settlement of a distribution account, as a part payment to Edward Shippen of his share of his father\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
