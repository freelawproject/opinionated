On these notes the plaintiff claimed contribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-12\">The defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge the jury, that joint notes will be presumed to be paid with joint funds where there are any to pay with; and that as Fife &amp; Wall had been joint owners of the mill and partners in the mill business, the law will presume a payment with joint funds, and that possession in such cases creates no presumption of liability for contribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-13\">The court below (Hampton, P.

In entering judgment on the verdict against all the defendants, without a judgment against the widow and heirs on the plea of <em>nul tiel record.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-7\"><em>C. </em>Hasbrouck, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1b\">The original judgment was void. There was no affidavit as required by the Act of 1836, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, as also by Act of 21st March 1806, to authorize its entry on the record. The submission is dated June 26th 1852; the award endorsed is July 2d 1852, filed July 10th 1852: White <em>v. </em>Shriver, 2 Watts 471; Massey <em>v. </em>Thomas, 6 Binn. 336; Stokely <em>v. </em>Robinson, 10 Casey 316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">The submission did not authorize an award for defendant. It was confined to the claim of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-9\">The award being for defendant, and not under \u00a7 6 of the Act of June 16th 1836, nor approved by the court, the judgment entered was not <em>quod recuperet </em>as recited in the <em>scire facias: </em>Ramsay\u2019s Appeal, 2 Watts 230.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-10\">The judgment on the plea of <em>nul tiel record </em>was in favour of plaintiff as administrator, and by inference in favour of the widow and heirs, yet on the verdict it is general against all the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-11\">This plea was by all the defendants, and should have been passed on as to all; if submitted as to the widow and heirs, the judgment on the verdict was erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-12\">The instruction prayed for as to the notes, was in accordance with the law governing contracts as between partners.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-13\"><em>Penny &amp; Sterrett, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9Tm\">The judgment in this case can be sustained on authority: Cook <em>v. </em>Gilbert, 8 S. &amp; R. 567; Herman <em>v. </em>Freeman, 8 S. &amp; R. 9; Gallup <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 8 Watts 424.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-14\">It does not appear that the parties intended to be governed by the Act of 1836 in this submission. It is not referred to. The award can be sustained, if necessary, under the Act of 1705: Herman <em>v. </em>Freeman, 8 S. &amp; R. 9; Book <em>v. </em>Edgar, 8 Watts 31; McAdams <em>v. </em>Stittnell, 1 Harris 90; Gallup <em>v. </em>Reynolds; 8 Watts 424.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-15\">The instruction as to the notes was correct. To say that the law presumes joint notes to have been paid with joint funds, without evidence that the person alleging payment had such joint funds, would require a plaintiff to prove negatively that he had none, before he could make out a <em>frimd facie </em>case. As to the disposition made of the plea of <em>nul tiel </em>record, it was strictly by the administrator alone, but the objection is valueless after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>verdict and judgment on the merits: Baxter <em>v. </em>Graham, <em>5 </em>Watts 418.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6e\">January 7th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b398-7\">Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsqD\">There are two answers to the first assignment of error, either of which seems to show its invalidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">1. The judgment offered in evidence was not void, even if there was an omission to file the affidavit required by the Act of 1836. It is true the agreement and submission are not entitled, as a matter of right, to entry on the docket by the prothonotary, without the affidavit; but when entered no case has said that the judgment was void. It may be voidable, but until it is avoided, it stands as a valid judgment. If the defendant is not content with it, as was said in Herman <em>v. </em>Freeman, 8 S. &amp; R. 9, he should have moved to strike it off. There being no want of jurisdiction in the arbitrators, or the court, of the subject-matter in controversy, or the parties, everything was right, excepting, as is insisted on, in matter of form. This left the judgment voidable, but not void. And as the record exhibited a judgment in full force and unreversed, the court did right in overruling the plea of <em>nul tiel record. </em>This is considering the award under the Act of 1836.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">2. But I do not see anything that certainly brings the submission within the 1st and 2d sections of that act, or that the judgment should be denied validity, because it was not so. It seems to have been an amicable action, and an agreement that the prothonotary should enter judgment therein, for whatever sum the arbitrators named should report. Substantially, this was done. The arbitrators filed their award, and the prothonotary entered judgment thereon. It was competent for the parties to enter on record an amicable action. This will not be denied. It was also competent for them to ascertain, in their own way, what judgment should be entered on it; and what mattered it whether the sum was figured out by themselves, or by persons mutually chosen to do so ? The judgment would be equally binding in either case, it being only a different mode of doing the same thing. This agreement is not referable to any statute in terms. As was said in Gallup <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 8 Watts 424, \u201cit is referable to the agreement of the parties, who were a law to themselves,\u201d who were \u201c competent to settle their differences in their own way.\u201d Taking either view of the matter, the court were right.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">3. There was no error in refusing to charge that the possession of the notes given in evidence created no liability for contribution. They were joint notes of the plaintiff and defendant, given for the purchase-money of the mill; and whether they were partners in operating the mill or not, is not material. The purchase was joint, and not as partners, and the funds of the firm afterwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>were no more applicable to the share each one was bound to pay,, than for any other undivided, debt. The interest each had in the <em>{ </em>mill was his capital in the partnership, and not to be paid for out of the firm funds. There is no error in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">4. There were several pleas to the country in this cause; and it has been holden in such a case that when the plea of <em>nul tiel record </em>is also in, if the parties go to trial generally, this court will presume that the issues were respectively decided by the proper tribunal: Baxter <em>v. </em>Graham, 5 Watts 418. The entry of judgment on the verdict for the plaintiff will in such a case be equivalent to a judgment for plaintiff on the plea: 3 Harris 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
