Joseph Stockton, under which plaintiff\u2019s intestate held, and which were considered material in this controversy, are as follows: \u2014 \u201c I, Joseph Stockton, knowing I must soon undergo a great change in the manner and place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>of my existence, where I shall have no more connection with worldly things,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c I desire to make such a disposition of my worldly property to them as may show to my dearly beloved wife and children my deep sense of the Divine goodness in connecting me in these endearing relations with them,\u201d &amp;c. \u201c Governed by the principle that each of my dear children have equal claims to my affection and remembrance, I make, by these presents, the following distribution of my real and personal estate, viz.:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">\u201cFirst: To my eldest son, David C. Stockton, I give and bequeath my town lot, No. 1, in the borough of Allegheny, with all the buildings, estimated in value at seven thousand dollars, and if he chooses to enter on the possession of it during my lifetime, to have a good and sufficient title for the same; said lot to be held subject to annual ground-rent or annuity of four per cent, on five thousand dollars, or two hundred dollars per annum during the lifetime of both his parents, and upon the decease of either, then only to two per cent., or one hundred dollars, to continue to the death of his other parent, and then to cease for ever. And the said lot is further made chargeable and held bound for the payment of fifteen hundred dollars to my general estate, when my youngest daughter shall be of legal age, viz., on the 12th of January, eighteen hundred and forty-two, without any interest till then, which sum of fifteen hundred dollars, together with five hundred dollars he has already advanced to the building on said lot, amounts to two thousand dollars, and taken from the estimated value of seven thousand, leaves five thousand, the sum supposed to be bequeathed in this legacy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">This was followed by similar devises of real estate to his other children, while to some he gave money legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">\u201cEighth: Should any of my dear children die unmarried, or without issue, then the legacy here left him, or her, or them, is to revert to the general estate, to be again equally divided by the parents or parent surviving, or in case of their decease, then by the surviving children, among themselves, which they are solemnly enjoined to do with all that kindness and justice which children of the same family should ever feel for each other.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-8\">On hearing, it was ordered and adjudged by the court below, that judgment be entered in favour of the plaintiff on the case stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-9\">The defendant thereupon sued out this writ, and assigned for error the entering of said judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-10\"><em>R. &amp; S . Woods, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASc\">contended that the devise to David O. Stockton did not vest in him an estate in fee, but an estate tail.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-11\"><em>Michel &amp; Palmer, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AER\">Although the word \u201cheirs\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>does not appear in the devising clause, yet connected with the preamble, which is explanatory of his intention, the devise is an estate in fee simple, and has been so acted on by all holders of Joseph Stockton\u2019s estate for over thirty years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-5\">On the subject of intention, derived from the introductory words, they cited Schriver <em>v. </em>Meyer, 7 Harris 87; Walker <em>v. </em>Walker, 4 Casey 46.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-6\">The eighth clause of the will does not reduce the estate below a fee simple, for it is only a repetition of the intestate law, and is not inconsistent with the previous grant of the fee: Negley\u2019s Appeal, 9 Casey 91. To construe it an estate tail would defeat the intention of testator, which was that \u201c each of his children should have an equal share of his estate.\u201d The personal estate is absolute, under the cases of Rewalt <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 11 Harris 388; Wheaton <em>v. </em>Shaw, 3 W. &amp; S. 126; Bart\u2019s Appeal, 9 Casey 87; 4 Kent 283; 1 Blackstone 89; Amelia Smith\u2019s Appeal, 11 Harris 9; Hall <em>v. </em>Dickinson, 7 Casey 76. Where there is doubt, the estate should be construed absolute, rather than defeasible: Middlesworth <em>v. </em>Collins, 1 Phil. Rep. 139. David Stockton was married, had issue, and left a widow, so that the contingency of his dying unmarried did not happen: Dean, lessee of Griffett, <em>v. </em>Woodward <em>et al., </em>4 Yeates 316.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A5SY\">January 7th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b464-8\">Lowrie, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abod\">The testator intended to make by his will a <em>distribution </em>of his real and personal <em>estate </em>among his children, and so he expresses himself. He makes the division equal, and if he had failed to create more than life estates, each would have been equal heirs to the reversions, that is, each would have a life estate by the will, and the reversion by descent, which together would be the fee of the whole. This was not the intention. A complete <em>distribution </em>of the whole <em>estate </em>was intended. He is not devising' his estate <em>from </em>his heirs, but dividing it among them, and therefore there can be no leaning against the devise in order to favour the heir. We favour the heirs by treating the will as a final declaration of the share of each. Add to this manifest general intent, that this particular lot was charged with an annuity to the widow, and a considerable sum for the other heirs, and it is quite plain that a fee simple was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">We cannot read the clause, providing for a reversion in case of a child dying unmarried, or without issue, as affecting this interpretation. We suppose it was intended not to reduce or defeat any estate vested in enjoyment under the will, but to dispose of any that might fail to become thus vested by the death of a child before the testator, or perhaps before actual distribution. Some of the shares are payable in money, and certainly no life estate was intended as to them; and if not to them, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>to none. It is hardly supposable that it was intended to provide for the death of a child, it might be the last surviving one, a quarter or half a century after the testator\u2019s own death.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
