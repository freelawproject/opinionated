In 1860 a majority of the original petitioners prayed the court to vacate the whole of the road, or at least that part of it between the crossing of the Greensburg road to the Adamsburg road, near Harmony School-House.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-15\">On this petition viewers were appointed, who reported in favour of vacating so much of the road as lay between the points above mentioned. This report was objected to on the ground that the viewers were bound to vacate the whole road, if any, and could not vacate a part, the proceedings being under the Act of Assembly of June 13th 1836, \u00a7 19. This objection was sustained by the court below, the petition dismissed, and the proceedings set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-16\">Whereupon the proceedings were removed into this court by the petitioners, who assigned for error the dismissing the petition and setting aside the proceedings as above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-17\"><em>Joseph H.

If a particular road have been laid out and opened, the power to vacate can be exercised only when the road shall have become useless, inconvenient, or burdensome; if it have been laid out and not opened, the power to vacate can be exercised only when a majority of the original petitioners for said road, resident in the county, invoke it. The <em>occasions </em>or <em>grounds </em>for calling the power of the court into exercise are thus distinguished, but the <em>power </em>is the same in both cases. And it could scarcely be delegated in larger or more comprehensive terms' \u2014 the power to vacate the <em>whole </em>or <em>any part </em>of <em>any </em>private or public road. This plenary power was lodged with the court for the convenience of the people, and whilst it is to be exercised in the precise manner prescribed, it is not to be abridged or enfeebled by judicial refinements. The occasion contemplated by the statute occurring, that is, on the petition of the majority of the original petitioners \u2014 the power of the court to vacate part of a road laid out, but not opened, is precisely what it is to vacate part of an open road on the happening of the statutory contingency \u2014 and it is plenary in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">In the case of the road in Greenwich township, 1 Jones 186, it was held that a road laid out and half of it opened could not be vacated by proceedings under the 19th section, on the petition of a majority of the original petitioners \u2014 that it was not, in fact, an unopened road \u2014 and so not within that section. The effect of that ruling was simply to put the party to his proceeding under the 18th section as for an open road. But it does not touch this case, for there is no pretence that any part of this road had been opened before the institution of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">We see, therefore, no reason why the 19th section should not be applied to this case, and the decree of the court is, accordingly reversed, and a <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
