Parties disappointed with the jury's resolution of genuinely disputed material facts may move for a new trial, to reduce the jury's damage award or obtain a judgment as a matter of law. We today address an employer's disappointment with the jury's verdict the employer wrongly failed to pay overtime to men working as crane or grease operators on fracking sites. The jury found these men working extraordinary long days albeit earning significant income through non-discretionary bonuses are not exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act requiring their employer pay them overtime. The employer's wide variety of arguments to overturn the jury and justify its \"no-overtime\" pay structure try to avoid the fundamental truth of our jury's obligation to determine credibility of witnesses and apply the established law provided by the trial judge after hearing from counsel. The employer's challenges to the legal issues lack merit. After study, we deny the employer's challenges to the jury's wisdom based on the evidence adduced by the crane and grease operators and apparently believed by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background for the separate trials.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Grease and crane operators on fracking sites sued their employer, Oil States Energy Services, L.L.C., for misclassifying them as exempt from overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or \"Act\". Oil States raised two core defenses: (1) the employees were exempt under the Act's highly compensated exemption because they received annual compensation of over $100,000 a year, their primary duty included office or non-manual work, and they customarily and regularly performed one or more duties of an administrative employee; and, (2) the employees were not covered by the Act but instead covered by Motor Carrier Act because they were employed by a motor carrier under Department of Transportation regulations, their work in whole or part is as a driver/driver's helper/loader/mechanic and their work included driving or loading a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The first four employees proceeding to the jury-Michael Burchik, Wayne Eddy, Jason Lett, and Robert Pickel-worked as crane operators. The jury in this crane operators' trial returned a unanimous verdict awarding each crane operator overtime wages for two years and found Oil States willfully misclassified them as exempt from the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The remaining four employees proceeding to the jury-Mike George, George Bolen, Stephen Soltesz-Haughton, and Jeffery Steffish-worked as grease operators. After approximately six hours of deliberations, the jury in this grease operators' trial returned a unanimous verdict awarding each grease operator overtime wages for two years. The jury did not find Oil States willfully misclassified their grease operator positions as exempt from the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Repeating an array of arguments largely addressed by us either before or during\n   the trials, Oil States now moves for (1) a new trial for both crane and grease operators; (2) remittitur for damages awarded to both crane and grease operators; and, (3) a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law for the grease operators. Oil States has not met its burden to overturn the jury's evaluation of the disputed facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. We deny Oil States' motions for new trial.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Oil States moves for a new trial arguing: (1) the verdicts are against the great weight of the evidence: (2) our erroneous evidentiary rulings affected the verdicts; and (3) errors in the jury charges. Oil States also argue the crane operators: violated our\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   order and Federal Rule of Evidence 407 by eliciting testimony about remedial measures; their counsel made improper arguments in closings; and, unfair surprise at trial with evidence discussed in pre-trial filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We may only disregard the jury's verdict and grant a motion for new trial where \"the great weight of the evidence cuts against the verdict ...\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Granting a new trial \"because the verdict is against the weight of the evidence [is] proper only when the record shows that the jury's verdict resulted in a miscarriage of justice or where the verdict, on the record, cries out to be overturned or shocked our conscience.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our \"power to grant a new trial is limited 'to ensure that [it] does not substitute its judgment of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses for that of the jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After careful review of the trial record and our rulings, we deny Oil States' motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The verdicts are not against the great weight of the evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Oil States argues the verdict in favor of the crane operators is against the great weight of the evidence because: (a) there is no evidence to support a willful violation of the Act; and, (b) the jury's damages award for hours worked exceeded a half-time calculation on total compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Oil States argues the verdict in favor the grease operators is against the great weight of evidence because the grease operators testified \"unambiguously\" they each met the elements of the highly compensated exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Evidence supports the jury's finding Oil States willfully violated the Act in defining the crane operators as exempt from the Act.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A willful violation of the Act \"includes situations when the employer, at the time of its [Act] violation, either 'knew' its conduct was prohibited by the [Act] or 'showered reckless disregard for the matter.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Oil States argues the jury's finding of willfulness in defining the crane operators as exempt from the Act is against the weight of the evidence because evidence Oil States paid each crane operator over $100,000 is \"minimal proof\" to establish the highly compensated exemption to the Act. The crane operators adduced evidence Oil States knew it willfully violated the Act\n   by classifying them as exempt including Oil States describing the position of crane operator as non-exempt in a job posting and in Mr. Lett's termination paperwork.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury also heard testimony from Oil States' former vice president of human resources Jill Curry, based on the crane operator's job description, \"it would be [her] assumption that Crane Operators were nonexempt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury also heard Oil States' current vice president of human resources Terry Woodall testify he believed crane operators are nonexempt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury heard sufficient evidence Oil States \"knew\" or \"showed reckless disregard\" classifying crane operators as exempt violated the Act to support their finding of willfulness. Oil States' argument there can be no finding of willfulness because federal regulations \"deem\" employees making over $100,000 exempt and Oil States paying the employees over $100,000 automatically negates a jury's ability to find a willful violation is not supported by statute, regulation, or caselaw. The crane operators adduced evidence Oil States knew it was not paying overtime to them even though they were not exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The evidence supported the jury's damages to the crane operators.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Oil States argues the jury's damages award to the crane operators is \"too high and resulted in a miscarriage of justice\" because (1) we incorrectly instructed the jury on how to calculate damages; (2) the damages award for Messrs. Pickel, Burchik, and Eddy exceeded the amount of hours they testified to working; and, (3) the jury's damages award improperly included travel time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Damages calculation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Oil States argues we incorrectly instructed the jury on how to calculate damages for the crane operators because Oil States \"intended to compensate [the crane operators] for all straight time hours worked\" when it paid them the salary and job bonuses meaning their recovery should have been a half-time calculation on their total compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties argued in motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   whether the proper damages calculation for bonuses is half-time because they are performance-based or one and a half-times because they are time-based. We found a fact dispute whether Oil States paid bonuses to the crane operators based on performance or simply hours worked and deferred our ruling based on evidence adduced at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At trial, Mr. Burchik testified to be paid a job bonus he had to \"[b]asically work on a job, frack the well. Once that was complete, we was [sic] eligible for a bonus.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Burchik further testified Oil States never withheld his bonus and the amount of his bonus did not vary based on whether he did a good or poor job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Lett testified he received a bonus \"if Oil States charged the oil company a fee for that day\" and the amount of his bonus did not change based on job performance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr.\n   Pickel also testified \"[a]s long as Oil States was able to get paid, then they would pay us [the job bonus].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Mr. Eddy testified his \"job bonus worked exactly the same way as the others described.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Oil States' corporate representative Adam Fowler testified he never recalled reducing, increasing, or refusing a crane operator's bonus based on their job performance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified a crane operator's bonus is paid \"per shift\" and agreed if a crane operator \"worked seven shifts in that week, he gets seven $450 bonuses.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the charging conference, we found no evidence the four crane operators' bonuses were performance-based, and instead the crane operators' bonuses were non-discretionary and to be calculated at one and half times damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Oil States takes umbrage with our ruling, arguing it \"intended\" the bonuses to compensate for hours worked, it does not cite trial testimony supporting its argument the bonuses were performance based. We properly instructed the jury to calculate overtime owed to the crane operators using the salary premium multiplier of one and a half-times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Damages awards for Messrs. Pickel, Burchik, and Eddy are proper.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Oil States argues the adduced evidence does not support the damages award for Messrs. Pickel, Burchik, and Eddy because the jury awarded damages which \"exceeded the maximum possible\" amount of hours they testified to working.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Where a party challenges a jury's damage award as \"grossly excessive, our review is 'exceedingly narrow' and our 'responsibility [is] to review a damage award to determine if it is rationally based.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   While we view facts \"in the light most favorable to\" Oil States, the \"jury's damages award will not be upset so long as there exists sufficient evidence on the record, which is accepted by the jury would sustain the award.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Without citing to crane operators' testimony or elaborating its one sentence argument, Oil States asks us to overturn the jury's award (on which it spent almost 7 hours deliberating).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oil States does not describe the maximum award (i.e., its worst case scenario) based on testimony. Each of these crane operators testified they \"conservatively\"\n   <em>\n    estimated\n   </em>\n   their hours because they attempted to recreate their hours from fragmented records, and in Mr. Eddy's case, he estimated his hours off Mr. Burchik's hours because Oil States did not have Mr. Eddy's records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Oil States does not provide a basis to overturn the jury award. The jury's award of overtime in the amount of $89,194 to Mr. Burchik, $132,844 for Mr. Eddy, and Mr. Pickel for $69,683 is not \"grossly excessive\" because there is sufficient evidence for the jury to find the crane operators worked more hours than their \"conservative\" estimates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Travel time\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Oil States argues the jury's damages award to the crane operators is not supported by evidence because the spreadsheets the crane operators used to refresh their recollections included the crane operators' travel time and \"the jury accepted and used [these travel time estimates] in their damages calculations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We \"presume that the jury followed [our] instructions when arriving at its verdict.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the charging conference, we heard extensive argument on how to instruct the jury on travel time and Oil States agrees we then \"correctly interpreted the law\" in instructing the jury explaining which types of travel time may be counted as overtime hours and which types of travel time does not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The jury heard testimony from each crane operator about their daily routine and travel and had exhibits including their tally books and records. The jury did not see or deliberate using the spreadsheets the crane operators used to reflect their recollections. We have no reason to presume the jury did not follow our instructions and properly compensate the crane operators for time spent traveling. Oil States' previous argument the jury awarded damages beyond what the crane operators estimated in testimony cuts against its present argument the jury relied exclusively on those estimated hours in awarding overtime. Oil States' contradictory arguments reinforce our finding the jury, following our instructions, properly awarded damages based on the testimony they found credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Evidence supported the jury's finding the Act's highly compensated exemption did not apply to the grease operators.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Challenging the jury's award to the grease operators, Oil States argues the verdict is against the great weight of evidence because the grease operators testified \"unambiguously\" they each met the elements of the highly compensated exemption. Oil States cites to portions of the transcript where the grease operators conceded some of their job responsibilities included non-manual labor, they earned over $100,000 per year, and in some instances exercised discretion. But each of the grease operators testified their job duties included manual labor as well. The jury heard testimony from each grease operator swearing their job responsibilities included non-manual labor. Oil States has not shown the verdict resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Highly compensated employees are exempt from overtime under the highly compensated employee exemption as defined in federal law. The three elements of the highly compensated employee exemption include (1) the employee's total annual compensation is at least $100,000 or $100,000 annualized in the event of a partial year of employment; (2) the employee's primary duty includes performing office or non-manual work; and (3) the employee\n   customarily and regularly performed an exempt duty defined under the FLSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Primary duty means \"the principal, main, major, or most important duty that the employee performs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oil States argued the grease operators customarily and regularly performed the exempt administrative duty of exercising discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Employees \"who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skills and energy are not exempt\" under the highly compensated employee exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The grease operators offered sufficient testimony their primary duty was manual work. For example, Mr. Bolen testified to the manual work of \"rigging up\" pressure control equipment and \"stabbing\" equipment to the well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Bolen detailed the step-by-step process of each. Mr. Bolen also testified he worked at the \"shop\" on the site when not working directly on the well. At the shop, Mr. Bolen rebuilt equipment, cleaned equipment, and cleaned work trucks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Barry Blank, an Oil States manager, described the grease operators' tasks as \"[w]e are going to be rigging up. We are going to be stabbing on a well. We are going to be running in hole. We are going to rig down, pull off well. ... Unless they run into a situation where the wire gets stranded ... the job log is not going to deviate. It's fairly boring ... [and] a repetitive situation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   These were non-office and non-manual duties. While Oil States accurately cites testimony showing the grease operators' job responsibilities requiring non-manual work, the jury had sufficient evidence to conclude the grease operators' primary duty did not include office or non-manual work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The grease operators also adduced sufficient testimony for the jury to conclude the grease operators did not exercise discretion or independent judgment as pressure control operators. Mr. Bolen testified he did not have \"any sort of management responsibilities\" as a grease operator.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Bolen also testified \"if there was ever a situation where they came up with a plan that I wasn't, you know, prepared for or comfortable with, I would call my manager.... And they would just let me know what to do.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained, however, only once did situation like that arise where a wireline got stranded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. George also testified his jobs where \"98 percent normal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   And when he ran into an issue, \"[he] always talked to somebody else more experienced\" and \"[i]t was very clear don't try to do anything on your own without\n   permission ...\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Soltesz-Haughton testified on one job, he objected to how the fracking company operated the job and he called his distract manager who told him to \"just kind of go along with it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead of having ability to exercise judgment, Mr. Soltesz-Haughton had to ask to be removed from the job and Oil States sent a different grease operator to handle it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    Other claims and defenses existed for both sides and were either withdrawn or precluded as a matter of law before jury deliberations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    <em>\n     Leonard v.

We properly allowed the crane operators to refresh their recollections using an inadmissible document because they\n    can refresh the recollection with any document regardless of its admissibility because the underlying document is not admitted into evidence or shown to the jury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Before trial we ruled the crane operators \"may testify from their memory as to their hours worked and damages claims because to the extent [the crane operators] at trial claim to recall their hours worked and damages, their testimony raises credibility issues properly subject to impeachment.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     46\n    </footnotemark>\n    During sidebar at trial, Oil States raised a concern the crane operators would refresh their recollection using spreadsheet which counsel helped prepare and we told Oil States its argument is \"pretty good cross-examination.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     47\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Our court of appeals instructs \"[w]itnesses may use any aid to refresh their recollections.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     48\n    </footnotemark>\n    A witness may refresh his or her recollection using a document which is otherwise inadmissible because under Fed.

Unlike\n    <em>\n     Valdez\n    </em>\n    where a witness introduced into evidence the conclusions of another non-testifying person from a document previously ruled inadmissible, the crane operators reviewed a document which refreshed their recollection and they testified to their refreshed recollection. There is no error because neither the underlying inadmissible document nor any hearsay statements from the document was not introduced evidence and we deny Oil States' motion for new trial on this ground.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <strong>\n     b. Excluding GPS spreadsheets prepared by a third party.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Oil States argued we erred by improperly excluded Adam Fowler from\n    authenticating the GPS spreadsheets and testifying to their contents because: (1) counsel for the crane operators represented \"records produced by [Oil States] were admissible as business records and the testimony of records custodians was not needed\"; and (2) because without Mr. Fowler's testimony based on the GPS spreadsheets Oil States could not \"refute\" the crane operators' testimony to their estimated hours worked.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    We properly excluded Mr. Fowler from authenticating and testifying to the GPS spreadsheets because the spreadsheets are third party business records of a company called Fleetmatic and Mr. Fowler could not provide \"adequate verification or other assurance of accuracy of\" the information is those spreadsheets.\n    <footnotemark>\n     56\n    </footnotemark>\n    Oil States does not argue we erred because Mr. Fowler could properly authenticate the third party business records and curiously does not cite a case to explain how our holding erred as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Oil States also argues the parties stipulated to the admissibility of the GPS spreadsheets on the record before jury selection. At the conference, we discussed the stipulations in the pre-trial memoranda. Neither party refers to a stipulation to admit third party business records of Fleetmatics.\n    <footnotemark>\n     57\n    </footnotemark>\n    The crane operators stipulated certain records from Oil States are authentic business records, as well as records from third parties, WEX Inc. and Ford Motor Company but conspicuously absent is a stipulation concerning the GPS spreadsheets from Fleetmatics.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Because Oil States fails to show how we erred in excluding Mr. Fowler from authenticating and testifying because he could provide independent verification of information in the third party business, we deny its motion for new trial on this ground.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     c. Excluding exhibit showing the weight of the truck exceeded 10,000 pounds.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Oil States argues we erred by excluding an exhibit which showed the truck the crane operators testified to using on scale and the weight showed 10,460 pounds. Oil States argues we should have been allowed the evidence because the crane operators showed the same picture of the truck on the scale but without the weight.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Oil States' argument would make sense if the jury decided the weight of the trucks used by the crane operators but they did not. We decided as a matter of law the trucks' gross vehicle weight, not the trucks' actual weight, is the appropriate metric to determine if the Technical Corrections Act applied.\n    <footnotemark>\n     58\n    </footnotemark>\n    Oil States' argument is the crane operators' exhibit showing a truck on a scale somehow converted our pre-trial ruling as a matter of law into a fact question for the jury. It did not. The actual weight of the trucks driven by the crane operators is not relevant evidence and we did not err in excluding Oil States' exhibit showing the truck weighed 10,460 pounds on the scale.

Oil States' counsel raised the issue at sidebar we convened for a different purpose and we told counsel we did not find it prejudicial because our order barred Oil States' testimony comparing the crane operators' pay plan to other alternative pay plans but Mr. Fowler's testimony did not open the door because it only reached the mere fact of reclassification.\n    <footnotemark>\n     60\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Oil States never asked to revisit our exclusion of Ms. Curry's testimony to counter Mr. Fowler's testimony about reclassification of the crane operators to hourly employees.

After the crane operators' trial, Oil States moved to amend its witness list to add, among others, Ms. Totten. We allowed Oil States to add Ms. Totten as a witness but explained Oil States may only identify Ms. Totten as a trial witness limited to her knowledge as disclosed in Oil States' Rule 26 disclosures.\n    <footnotemark>\n     63\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Oil States argues, through discovery, the grease operators were on notice of Ms. Totten's participation in the decision of whether they were exempt employees. Oil States argues Ms. Totten should have been allowed to testify to her involvement in this decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Oil States raised this same argument several times before and during trial. A week before trial, Oil States filed a report of objections to witnesses.\n    <footnotemark>\n     64\n    </footnotemark>\n    Oil States then argued it anticipated the grease operators would object to Ms. Totten testifying to her involvement in the decision whether\n    the grease operators were exempt. Oil States argued, through discovery, the grease operators were on notice of Ms. Totten's involvement in the decision. Before trial, the grease operators moved to preclude Ms. Totten from testifying to her involvement in determining whether the grease operators were exempt employees.\n    <footnotemark>\n     65\n    </footnotemark>\n    We heard oral argument and ordered Ms. Totten \"may not testify to actions taken in determining whether the Plaintiffs were subject to the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     66\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, if a party fails to provide information or identify a witness under Rule 26, the party is not allowed to use the information or witness at trial, unless the failure is substantially justified or is harmless.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    During discovery, the grease operators served Oil States with interrogatories inquiring into which Oil States employees determined the exempt classification of the grease operators. The grease operators specifically requested Oil States provide the names of all employees who participated in determining whether the grease operators were subject to the overtime requirements of the FLSA.\n    <footnotemark>\n     67\n    </footnotemark>\n    Oil States identified five employees.

None of the deposition excerpts disclose Ms. Totten as being involved in this decision. The deposition excerpts identify Ms. Totten as being involved in setting employee salaries and drafting job descriptions. But none of the deposition excerpts disclose Ms. Totten as being involved in the ultimate decision of whether employees are exempt from overtime pay. Oil States cites the deposition testimony of Mr. Woodall for the proposition Ms. Totten is one of the persons responsible for ensuring Oil States complied with the Act.\n    <footnotemark>\n     69\n    </footnotemark>\n    The grease operators asked Mr. Woodall whether Ms. Totten held responsibility for overtime compliance and determining exempt classifications. Mr. Woodall testified, \"Well I would say not-not specifically, but I would charge the entire HR team with responsibilities for understanding that and making sure we're in compliance.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     70\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    When directly asked who participated in determining whether the grease operators were exempt from overtime, Oil States did not disclose Ms. Totten. The deposition discovery cited by Oil States in arguing the grease operators were on notice Ms. Totten participated in the decision making of whether the employees were exempt from overtime does not support Oil States' argument. The deposition testimony supports Ms. Totten participated in determining the grease operators' salaries and participated in drafting their job descriptions. We allowed Ms. Totten to testify to her human resources support in those aspects.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Oil States argues the grease operators opened the door during trial to the introduction of Ms. Curry's testimony on Ms. Totten's involvement in determining whether the grease operators were exempt under the FLSA. First, Oil States designated the testimony it cites to be read to the jury over the grease operators' objection, so the grease operators did not open\n    a door. Second, the testimony cited by Oil States does not tie Ms. Totten to the exempt status decision.\n    <footnotemark>\n     71\n    </footnotemark>\n    Ms. Curry testified human resource managers at Oil States prepared job descriptions, but she did not testify Ms. Totten participated in deciding the grease operators' exempt status.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Oil States failed to disclose Ms. Totten's role in determine the exempt status of the grease operators.

Limiting Corey Courts' testimony.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Oil States argues we improperly limited Mr. Courts' testimony. First, Oil States argues we improperly prevented Oil States from publishing an exhibit to the jury despite the same exhibit being admitted into evidence earlier at trial. Second, Oil States argues we improperly precluded Mr. Courts from testifying to his interactions with Ms. Totten regarding the legality of the grease operators' payment structure. Third, Oil States argues allowing the grease operators to play excerpts of Mr. Courts' video deposition at trial exacerbated the prejudice of limiting Mr. Courts' testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Oil States argues allowing the grease operators to present the video deposition of Mr. Courts, as the corporate designee of Oil States, exacerbated the prejudice of limiting Mr. Courts' testimony, in his individual capacity. At trial, Oil States closed its case in chief presenting the testimony of Mr. Courts in his individual capacity. Waiving their right to cross examine Mr. Courts in Oil States' case in chief, the grease operators explained they wished to adduce excerpts from Mr. Court's video deposition as Oil States' corporate designee under Federal Rule 30(b)(6) in their rebuttal case.\n    <footnotemark>\n     72\n    </footnotemark>\n    Oil States objected on the basis Mr. Courts could testify in person.\n    <footnotemark>\n     73\n    </footnotemark>\n    Under Federal Rule 32(a)(3), we overruled Oil States objection.\n    <footnotemark>\n     74\n    </footnotemark>\n    We explained a party may use the deposition of anyone who provided testimony as a corporate designee for any purpose under Rule 30(b)(6).\n    <footnotemark>\n     75\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Oil States does not identify how the grease operators' presentation of the deposition testimony of Mr. Courts, as Oil States' corporate designee, caused prejudice. The presentation of Mr. Court's video deposition as Oil States' corporate designee did not prejudice Oil States. The grease operators designated Mr. Courts' video deposition testimony during pretrial memoranda. Oil States did not object to the grease operators' designations of Mr. Court's video deposition testimony and did not counter designate excerpts of the video deposition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Oil States argues an excerpt of Mr. Courts' video deposition testimony demonstrates the grease operators' notice of Ms. Totten's involvement in determining the exempt status of the grease operators. In the deposition, the grease operators asked Oil States who is responsible for determining whether an employee receives overtime compensation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     76\n    </footnotemark>\n    Mr. Courts, as Oil States, answered human resources and accounting made this decision.\n    <footnotemark>\n     77\n    </footnotemark>\n    Oil States argues based on this deposition testimony, the grease operators knew who to ask during discovery regarding the exempt classification decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The grease operators asked during discovery who at Oil States helped make exempt\n    status decision. The grease operators specifically asked for the names of all employees at Oil States involved in the exempt classification decision. Oil States did not disclose Ms. Totten as a person involved in this decision. Oil States now argues the grease operators should have pieced together the puzzle of Ms. Totten's involvement during the discovery period through witnesses' general references to the human resources department in deposition testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Oil States argues the video deposition testimony opened the door for Ms. Totten to testify at trial regarding her involvement in the exempt classification decision. Oil States never disclosed her involvement in the decision despite being directly asked to identify all employees involved in the decision. Mr. Courts did not identify Ms. Totten in his video deposition as a person involved in the decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Oil States did not put the grease operators on notice of Ms. Totten's involvement. The presentation of Mr. Courts' video deposition as Oil States' corporate designee did not prejudice Oil States.

Allowing grease operators to testify as to damages.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Oil States asks us to grant a new trial because we allowed the grease operators to testify to their hours and damages.
