The representative also told him that he could forego the credit check if he simply paid a $50 deposit. Santangelo agreed and paid $50 with a credit card. As it turns out, Comcast pulled his credit anyway, and Santangelo's credit score went down by six points that day. As a result, Santangelo filed this lawsuit, alleging that Comcast violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (\"ICFA\"), 815 Ill.

Santangelo also claims that Comcast breached their agreement and was unjustly enriched when it obtained Santangelo's credit score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Comcast now moves for summary judgment as to all of Santangelo's claims. In response, Santangelo has filed his own motion seeking summary judgment as to his FCRA claim.

[it] is obtained for a purpose for which [it] is authorized to be furnished under this section.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f)(1). The parties raise two issues\n   in their summary-judgment motions. First, the parties dispute whether Comcast had a \"legitimate business need\" to obtain Santangelo's TELCO score as permitted by \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F)(i). Second, the parties disagree as to whether Comcast's actions in obtaining the TELCO score were willful under \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legitimate Business Need\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   According to Santangelo, there is no evidence that Comcast had a \"legitimate business need\" to check his TELCO score. Pl.'s Mem. Supp. at 7-12. As Santangelo sees it, this is because Comcast had a policy of offering consumers its services without requiring a credit check-provided that a $50 deposit payment was made.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For its part, Comcast contends that it had a legitimate need for Santangelo's TELCO credit information because it \"obtained [it] to evaluate his eligibility for service\" and to verify his identity. Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 8-10. But this is unsupported by the record. There is no dispute that Comcast offered to provide Santangelo internet service without obtaining his TELCO information, if he paid a $50 deposit. And no reasonable jury could conclude that Comcast needed Santangelo's credit score to determine his eligibility for service when Comcast's own policies and representations to Santangelo indicated otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ali v. Vikar Mgmt.

Pa. Sept. 2, 2008) (defendant business lacked actual evidence that it needed consumer report). Furthermore, Comcast did not need Santangelo's TELCO information to confirm his identify, because it used another Equifax product, Positive ID, to do just that. Pl.'s LR 56.1(a)(3) Stmt. \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Comcast also argues that \"the legitimacy of a business need does not hinge on having a consumer's consent.\" Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 8. This is true enough, but it is beside the point. It is not Santangelo's lack of consent that demonstrates Comcast's lack of a legitimate business need. Rather, it is Comcast's own practice of foregoing a credit check if a potential subscriber agrees to pay the $50 deposit, as Santangelo did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santangelo,\n   </em>\n   162 F.Supp.3d at 698-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Undeterred, Comcast contends that its credit inquiry was legitimate because Santangelo's payment of the $50 deposit did not eliminate the ongoing credit risk Santangelo posed to Comcast. Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 9. According to Comcast, this is because the total cost of services used by Santangelo in the coming months could exceed $50.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This is a puzzling argument. If accepted, it would allow Comcast and other subscription-based service providers to pull a consumer's credit score whenever there was a possibility (however remote) that the subscriber would continue to use the services beyond the time covered by the deposit amount. For Comcast, and providers with similar monthly subscription payment models, this would mean that it could effectively pull a consumer's credit score at will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In any event, the argument is not supported by evidence. First, there is no evidence that Comcast even considered this possibility for Santangelo or any other subscriber. Nor has it provided any evidence that it ever initiated a credit inquiry for a current subscriber because it feared that the deposit that it had required was somehow insufficient. One could imagine, for example, that Comcast might request credit checks of a subscriber on an ongoing basis to consider revoking its services or\n   altering its terms as its prices and packages changed, but again Comcast has provided absolutely no evidence of this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, Comcast states in passing that Santangelo authorized a credit check pursuant to its Subscriber Agreement. Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 10. It is wholly unclear what this has to do with a legitimate business need. Perhaps Comcast means to suggest that Santangelo retroactively consented to the credit check when he agreed to the Subscriber Agreement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 15 (making this argument with regard to its breach-of-contract claim). If so, it is true that one of the authorized purposes for obtaining a consumer report under the FCRA is that it is done \"in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(2). And some district courts have found that authorization in a contract constitutes a consumer's \"written instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc v. Allstate Ins.

La. May 17, 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But Comcast does not mention \u00a7 1681b(a)(2) or further develop the argument, thereby waiving it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Godbole v.

In any event, the Subscriber Agreement appears to be a standard one, and under Comcast's theory, every customer who becomes a subscriber has retroactively agreed to a credit check, even when he or she paid a $50 deposit to Comcast in exchange for Comcast's promise that it would not initiate one. It also is worth pointing out that, when Comcast and a future customer agree that Comcast will take a $50 deposit in lieu of conducting a credit check, the individual is only a\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   subscriber, who has not even been provided a subscription agreement to review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Comcast points to no evidence or case authority that would support such a strained argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For these reasons, Santangelo is entitled to summary judgment that Comcast violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f)(1), because it did not have a \"legitimate business need\" for Santangelo's credit information as required by \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Because Santangelo does not seek actual damages, he must prove that Comcast \"willfully fail[ed] to comply\" with the FCRA to be entitled to any relief, including statutory or punitive damages, as well as reasonable attorney's fees. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(A).

In support, Comcast points to its written policy of allowing those who pay a $50 deposit to avoid a credit inquiry, as well as its training and ongoing communications to representatives regarding this policy. Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 12. For example, a training manual instructed representatives to uncheck the default-checked box in the customer software that would otherwise initiate a credit inquiry with Equifax. Def.'s LR 56.1(b)(3)(C) Stmt. \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   To support its position, Comcast also points to\n   <em>\n    Newlin v.

Ind. Jan. 27, 2015). In that case, like here, Comcast pulled the plaintiff Newlin's credit score from Equifax despite the plaintiff having paid Comcast a $50 deposit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. After a bench trial, the court found that Comcast did not \"knowingly and intentionally\" ignore Newlin's desire to avoid a credit check. Salient for our purposes, the court based its determination on Newlin's failure to \"present any evidence that Comcast had a deliberate policy of ignoring consumer requests pertaining to credit reports, or a deliberate practice of ignoring its own policy with respect to the deposits, or that it was aware of problems with its system but took no remedial action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For his part, Santangelo points out that, unlike Newlin, he has presented evidence that Comcast was aware of problems with its system, but did nothing to remedy it. For this, Santangelo points to the\n   <em>\n    Newlin\n   </em>\n   litigation, which was brought in 2012 and, by December 2014, was nearly finished, with the court issuing its decision the month after the events at issue here. In addition, Santangelo cites to complaints sent to Comcast about the same conduct in 2012 and 2013. Pl.'s LR 56.1(b)(3)(C) Stmt. \u00b6 6, ECF No. 234. In response, Comcast argues that the complaints were few and far between and that, rather than supporting Santangelo's argument,\n   <em>\n    Newlin\n   </em>\n   exonerated Comcast.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Reply at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Both are correct to some extent. There is evidence in the record from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the Comcast representative who initiated the credit check did so in error. But, there is other evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Comcast knew or should have known that it would likely happen based upon prior experiences with similar incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Additionally, Comcast contends that it did not know, and could not reasonably have known, that pulling Santangelo's credit score would violate the FCRA \"because we're entering into a business transaction, we have the right to run risk.\" Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 11. But, as Santangelo points out, there is no evidence in the record that Comcast needed the TELCO score from Santangelo for any such purpose. Of course, Comcast might have enjoyed having Santangelo's credit information notwithstanding their policy. But this is not enough. To obtain or furnish credit information, one must have an authorized purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safeco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573430\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/47/#p57\">\n    551 U.S. at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573430\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/47/#p57\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Comcast also states that it reasonably interpreted the FCRA because its Subscriber Agreement gave it express consent to pull Santangelo's credit report notwithstanding any prior agreement or representations to the contrary.

Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s 56.1(b)(3)(C) Stmt. \u00b6 6, ECF No. 239-3. But this is a dual- edged sword. On the one hand, a reasonable jury could infer from these actions that Comcast believed it had remedied a fairly isolated problem. On the other, a reasonable jury could infer that Comcast realized the risk of an unauthorized credit check and the illegality of such conduct as far back as 2012 or 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   When the record is viewed in its entirety, there is a genuine dispute as to whether Comcast knew or should have known that it was violating the FCRA in December 2014 when its representative caused a credit check to be performed on Santangelo even though he and Santangelo had agreed to the contrary. As such, whether Comcast's violation of the FCRA was willful must be resolved by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Waiver and Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Lastly, Comcast seeks summary judgment on the basis of what it calls \"waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delta Consulting Grp., Inc. v. R. Randle Constr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683218\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1133/#p1140\">\n    554 F.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1140 (7th Cir. 2009) (stating that \"waiver is the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right\"). It also argues that Santangelo's claims are moot because, as Comcast sees it, he caused the injury to himself. Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 18 (citing\n   <em>\n    Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p416\">\n    568 U.S. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p416\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p416\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Chapman v.

Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 18-19. But this is not what the evidence shows. Rather, it is undisputed that Comcast's representative told Santangelo that she could not fix the drop in his credit score. She also said that she could transfer him to someone else who might be able to fix it, but could not guarantee it. Pl.'s LR 56.1(a)(3) Stmt. \u00b6 49. Only then did he hang up the phone with Comcast.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. While it is true that Comcast returned the $50 deposit and interest, it is not entirely clear whether Comcast remedied the decline in Santangelo's credit rating, or how it might have done so. Accordingly, Comcast's motion for summary judgment as to the FRCA claim on this basis also is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment [223] and Defendant's motion for summary judgment [228] are granted in part and denied in part. Comcast's motion is granted as to Santangelo's state-law claims (Counts II through IV) and denied as to his FCRA claim (Count I). Santangelo's motion is granted as to his FCRA claim (Count I) insofar as the Court concludes that Comcast had no legitimate business purpose to check his credit; it is denied in all other respects. The only remaining issue for trial is whether Comcast violated the FCRA willfully. This case is set for status hearing on 10/3/18 at 9:00 a.m. The parties should be prepared at the hearing to set a schedule for pretrial filings and a date for the pretrial conference and trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The following facts are undisputed or have been deemed admitted, unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    \"TELCO\" refers to a type of credit product provided by Equifax that is specific to the telecommunications industry.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Mem.
