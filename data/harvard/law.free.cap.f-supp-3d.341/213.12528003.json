Engelmayer, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This multi-district litigation involves products liability claims regarding a contraceptive product: the Mirenaintrauterine device developed, manufactured, and distributed by defendants Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer Pharma AG, and Bayer Oy (together, \"Bayer\"). The Mirena IUD functions by releasing a synthetic steroid hormone known as levonorgestrel (\"LNG\"). Plaintiffs claim that the hormonal component of Mirena caused them to suffer from a disease known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (\"IIH\"), also known as pseudotumor cerebri (\"PTC\"). IIH is an uncommon disease marked by increased cerebrospinal fluid (\"CSF\") pressure in the skull. If untreated, IIH can cause headaches and vision problems, including, in extreme cases, blindness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Currently before the Court are motions by each side, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), to exclude the other's expert testimony with respect to the issue of general causation-that is, whether Mirena's release of its hormonal component, LNG, is capable of causing IIH. In overseeing this MDL, this Court, heeding the guidance of the United States Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation (\"JPML\"), prioritized discovery and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions and briefing with respect to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs have put forward seven expert witnesses on general causation. Each opines that use of Mirena can cause IIH. These are: two obstetrician-gynecologists (\"OB/GYNs\"), an ophthalmologist, a neuroscientist, a pediatric neurologist, an epidemiologist, and a pharmacologist-toxicologist. In response, Bayer has put forward 12 expert witnesses. Each opines that the available scientific evidence does not reliably permit the conclusion that using Mirena can cause IIH. These are: three epidemiologists, a pharmaco-kineticist, five neuro-ophthalmologists, and three OB/GYNs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Each of these 19 expert witnesses submitted an expert report, was deposed, and was the subject of separate\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   briefing. On April 10-11, 2018, the Court held a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing and heard argument as to the admissibility of each expert's testimony as to general causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court grants Bayer's motions under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   to preclude the testimony of plaintiffs' general causation experts. In light of the possible implications of this ruling for this litigation, the Court denies as potentially moot plaintiffs' motions to preclude the testimony of Bayer's general causation experts. This ruling is without prejudice to plaintiffs' right to renew their motions to preclude Bayer's general causation experts should the litigation proceed past summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Brief History of This Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The JPML's Centralization of Mirena IIH Cases Before This Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 6, 2017, the JPML centralized in this District pretrial proceedings in the 113 cases then pending across 17 districts nationwide in which plaintiffs had alleged IIH injuries caused by the hormonal component of the Mirena IUD. Most of the Mirena/IIH cases were at a relatively early stage of discovery or at the pleading stage, although fact and expert discovery had closed in the 10 longest pending actions.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1, at 2-3 (JPML transfer order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The JPML had previously, in July 2014, denied a motion to centralize the Mirena/IIH actions, at a time when nine such actions, spanning six districts, were pending. Explaining its 2017 decision to centralize the pending cases, the JPML emphasized several factors that made centralized proceedings more efficient. Two are relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   First, the JPML noted the heightened difficulty coordinating discovery and other pretrial proceedings given the increased number and dispersal of pending actions and of participating law firms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. \"The record,\" the JPML stated, \"demonstrates that centralization is necessary to facilitate the efficient conduct of common discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, the JPML noted, general causation had emerged as an important issue common to all proceedings. \"[T]he records in the many actions filed since [2014] demonstrate that discovery and pretrial motions concerning the issue of general causation have been, or will be, at the center of all actions-that is, whether the hormonal component in Mirena is capable of causing intracranial hypertension.\" Dkt. 1, at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (\"Issues concerning general causation [and] the background science ... will be common to all actions.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Organization of This MDL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In overseeing this action, this Court has given priority to the matters that led the JPML to centralize the Mirena/IIH actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Specifically, on June 21, 2017, after appointing plaintiffs' leadership team and reviewing written submissions and eliciting input at an initial conference as to the proper sequencing of proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 51 (transcript of June 13, 2017 hearing), the Court issued an order stating that priority would be given to: (1) \"the process of providing common fact discovery to plaintiff from Bayer,\" and (2) \"resolving whether plaintiffs have admissible evidence sufficient to establish general causation\" by Mirena of IIH. Dkt. 40, at 1 (June 21, 2017). The Court has done so as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Outgoing discovery from Bayer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : On July 27, 2017, after receiving submissions delineating the 14 discovery disputes identified by the parties and inquiring about them at a hearing, the Court resolved these disputes in a series of bench rulings.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 51, at 10-59 (transcript of July 27, 2017 hearing). The Court ordered that Bayer broadly produce written discovery on all common issues, including electronic records from more than 50 Bayer custodians, and including broad production from Bayer's adverse-events database. Both as to custodians and as to search parameters, the common discovery ordered from Bayer extended well beyond the parameters theretofore utilized in the individual cases comprising the MDL. It also substantially exceeded the discovery that Bayer had produced in an immediately prior MDL also relating to the Mirena IUD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MDL No. 2434 (the \"Perforation MDL\"). In that case, overseen by the Hon. Cathy Seibel of this District, the plaintiffs had alleged different injuries: that the hormone-release feature of Mirena had caused the IUD to migrate within the uterus after its insertion, leading to uterine perforation and related migration injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     General causation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : The Court directed that the issue of general causation be litigated in the MDL as a threshold issue. To facilitate that issue's prompt resolution, the Court ordered that all fact discovery relating to general causation-including all document and deposition discovery-be completed by December 8, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 62. Alerted by counsel that each side expected to make\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   challenges to the admissibility of each other's experts on general causation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court set deadlines spanning late December 2017 through late March 2018 for the submission of all expert reports on general causation, depositions of general causation experts, and reciprocal\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   briefing. The Court set for the week of April 9, 2018 a \"Science Day\" tutorial for the Court on the background scientific issues in the case, followed by a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing as to expert testimony on general causation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In prioritizing general causation, the Court was informed by, in addition to the guidance of the JPML, the representations of counsel in this case that the issue of general causation would be common and\n   identical to all potential Mirena/IIH plaintiffs so as make it an appropriate issue for this transferee court to resolve at the threshold.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 51, at 29. The Court was also informed by the experience of the Perforation MDL. There, Judge Seibel held that plaintiffs' proposed expert testimony as to the general causation proposition at issue-that the Mirena IUD's release of the hormone LNG was capable of causing the Mirena IUD to migrate after insertion and cause uterine perforation-was not reliable under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mirena IUD Prods. Liab.

Based on that ruling, Judge Seibel thereafter granted summary judgment for Bayer on all claims, holding that, without any admissible expert testimony, the remaining evidence was insufficient to establish general causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mirena IUD Products Liability Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12180247\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/202/304/#p310\">\n    202 F.Supp.3d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310-28 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Mirena Perforation/SJ\n   </em>\n   \",\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=713%20Fed.%20Appx.%2011\">\n    713 Fed. Appx. 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2017). The possibility of a similar outcome here, this Court determined, counseled deferring other time- and cost-intensive phases of this litigation pending resolution of the anticipated\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For that reason, the Court deferred almost all plaintiff-side discovery until after the anticipated\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions were resolved. The MDL currently encompasses more than 850 plaintiffs, a result of the fact that, since creation of this MDL, nearly 750 plaintiffs have filed new lawsuits that have been received into it. The Court required only that each existing or new plaintiff file a detailed fact sheet (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , as to her Mirena usage, medical history, and symptoms).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 62;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 78 (August 30, 2017) (order approving plaintiff fact sheet). The requirement of filing such fact sheets was intended to enable the litigation to move forward expeditiously in the event that admissible evidence sufficient to establish general causation were to be found, including by expediting selection of plaintiffs for individualized discovery in anticipation of bellwether trials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Expert Witnesses at Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The seven expert witnesses whom plaintiffs propose to call as to general causation are: (1) Dr. Lemuel A.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This section sets out background relevant to all\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions. It addresses: (1) the Mirena product; (2) Mirena's hormonal component, the progestin LNG; (3) the disease IIH and its history and characteristics; and (4) the state of scientific research, prior to the instant\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   proceedings, regarding both the causes of IIH in general and, more specifically, as to whether contraceptives (including Mirena ) that use LNG as a hormonal component can cause IIH.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mirena\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mirena is a commonly used type of long-acting reversible contraceptive (\"LARC\"). There are several different types. Some LARCs are copper intrauterine devices (\"IUDs\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Others are subdermal, hormone-releasing implants. Others, of which Mirena is by far the most predominant, are hormone-releasing IUDs. Of these types of LARCs, hormone-releasing implants are generally considered the most effective at preventing conception, followed by hormone-releasing IUDs, followed by copper IUDs. Statistically, all LARCs are far more effective in preventing conception than traditional contraceptive methods such as the Pill or the male condom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mirena is made of a T-shaped polyethylene frame with a silicon-based steroid reservoir around the vertical stem. It is inserted into the uterus vaginally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mirena Prescribing Information and Label \u00a7 11.1 (Dkt. 135-6) (\"Mirena Label\"). In the uterus, Mirena releases the synthetic steroid hormone LNG, a progestin, at an initial rate of 20 \u00b5g LNG/day, decreasing over its five-year life-span.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mirena Label \u00a7\u00a7 2, 11, 12.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The FDA approved Mirena on December 6, 2000, following studies for safety and efficacy in two large clinical trials in Finland and Sweden. It is currently approved in the United States for up to five years of use.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=713%20Fed.%20Appx.%2011\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 14.1-14.2.

LNG is widely used in gynecology, including in hormonal replacement therapy. Its primary use is in numerous contraceptives. These include (1) LNG-releasing intrauterine devices such as Mirena ; (2) LNG-releasing subdermal implants such as Norplant, which from 1991 to 2002 was marketed in the United States, and Jadelle, which is currently marketed in Europe; (3) in the single-dose hormone contraceptive known as Plan B; and (4) as the progestin component of numerous combined oral contraceptives (which usually include both LNG and an estrogen compound).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The exact mechanism by which LNG prevents pregnancy is unknown.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mirena Label \u00a7 12.1 (\"The local mechanism by which continuously released LNG enhances contraceptive effectiveness of Mirena has not been conclusively demonstrated.\"). However, it is generally understood that LNG, and Mirena by extension, inhibits contraception by bringing about various systemic effects, including blocking ovulation, thickening cervical mucous (decreasing sperm penetration), and altering the endometrium, the lining of the uterus (impairing the implantation of fertilized eggs).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Studies of Mirena and similar LNG IU[D] prototypes have suggested several mechanisms that prevent pregnancy: thickening of cervical mucus preventing passage of sperm into the uterus, inhibition of sperm capacitation or survival, and alteration of the endometrium.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plunkett Rpt. at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court notes here two chemical characteristics of LNG relevant to the pending motions.

The most common is a headache, which occurs in almost all (92-94% of) cases. Many patients (64-87%) also experience a whooshing sound in their ears called pulsatile tinnitus. Other symptoms include papilledema, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, transient visual obscurations, binocular diplopia, and blurred vision. Papilledema, the swelling of the optic nerves due to intracranial pressure, is sometimes called the hallmark symptom of IIH. However, a patient can still be diagnosed with IIH without this symptom, and these symptoms can result from other causes. A papilledema is detected with an ophthalmoscopic or funduscopic examination. Most patients show a degree of visual loss. And, in extreme cases, if untreated, papilledema can cause serious vision loss and even blindness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ball &amp; Clark,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 433, 436-438; Vincent Giuseffi, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Symptoms and disease associations in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri ): A case-control study\n   </em>\n   , 41 Neurology 239, 239-41 (1991) (Dkt. 167-33) (\"Giuseffi\"); Cestari Rpt. at 4-7; Darney Rpt. at 21; Fraunfelder Rpt. at 4; Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 26; Plunkett Rpt. at 24; Salpietro Rpt. at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Ultimately, IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion. While doctors use two largely overlapping sets of diagnostic criteria-the \"modified Dandy criteria\" and the \"Friedman criteria\"-in their diagnoses, IIH is ultimately diagnosed by excluding alternative causes of these symptoms. Fraunfelder Rpt. at 4. Papilledema, for example, can also be caused by brain tumors, meningitis, or intracranial thrombosis,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and headaches can arise from numerous causes. To exclude alternative causes of IIH, doctors use a combination of neural imaging, neurologic examination, and a spinal tap or lumbar puncture, which directly measures CSF pressure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bayer BfArM Resp. at 9-11; Cestari Rpt. at 2-3; Fraunfelder Rpt. at 4; Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 25-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   IIH is an extremely rare disease. It occurs with a frequency of about one case\n   per year out of a population of 100,000.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Giuseffi,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 239; Ball &amp; Clark,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 433 (canvassing studies reporting incidences of IIH of between 0.03 per 100,000 and 2.2 per 100,000); Cestari Rpt. at 3 (0.9 cases per 100,000 population); Fraunfelder Rpt. at 5. As reviewed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , IIH differentially affects certain demographic groups. Relevant here, IIH occurs by far most commonly-and its incidence is far greater-among women of child-bearing age, and in particular among overweight and obese such women.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   IIH is treated in a variety of ways. It is typically recommended that overweight patients with IIH lose weight; medications are often prescribed to assist weight loss. Doctors also often prescribe acetazolamide, a diuretic, to prevent CSF production. Lumbar punctures, which are used to diagnose IIH, can also be used to drain excess CSF. Optic nerve sheath fenestration-the \"cutting into the sheath, or covering, of the optic nerve\"-\"may [also] be used to decrease pressure on the optic disc, thereby preserving vision.\" Fraunfelder Rpt. at 7. Finally, shunts can be placed in the brain or lumbar spine to drain excess CSF into the abdominal cavity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ball &amp; Clark,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 439-40; Cestari Rpt. at 7-8; Moy\u00e9 Rpt at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

These include: (1) being a woman of child-bearing age; (2) being overweight, obese, or having experienced recent weight gain; (3) using certain drugs, such as vitamin A and retinoids; and (4) experiencing endocrine disturbances caused by diseases such as Addison's Disease and steroid withdrawal.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Ball &amp; Clark,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 434-35; Chen &amp; Wall,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 5-6; Giuseffi,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 239-40; McGeeney &amp; Friedman,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 450-53;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fraunfelder Rpt. at 5; Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 27-28; Salpietro Rpt. at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The first two risk factors are particularly common, as IIH \"predominantly affects obese women of childbearing age.\" Cestari Rpt. at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fraunfelder Rpt. at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   More than 90% of patients afflicted with IIH are women,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Chen &amp; Wall,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 5.

Calculations on this point vary among the scientific literature, but in general, researchers describe IIH's incidence among obese women as between approximately 15 and 22 cases per 100,000 population, and as particularly affecting women who have recently gained weight. This literature also describes IIH's incidence as rising over time in the United States as the nation's population has become more obese.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Anthony B.

Studies and Data, Outside of this Litigation, Bearing on Whether Use of Mirena Causes IIH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court next reviews the state of research, outside of the instant litigation, as to the question whether use of Mirena is a cause of IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In brief, although plaintiffs' experts in this litigation have now so opined, outside of this litigation, no medical organization, regulatory agency, article in peer-reviewed scientific literature, or other research has found that use of Mirena is a cause of IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, writings in several categories exist that bear on this question. First, two published epidemiological studies have addressed the possibility of a causal connection between use of Mirena and IIH. One was principally authored by Dr. Mahyar Etminan; the other, by Reuben M. Valenzuela.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In addition, epidemiological studies have been conducted as to certain other contraceptive products containing LNG. None have found that the use of these products causes IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, published case reports involving patients with IIH symptoms, where the patient had used Mirena or another LNG-based contraceptive, have raised the question of a connection between the use of these products and IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The above-summarized pre-litigation writings figure prominently in the reports of the experts in this case and in the parties'\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   briefing. In particular, to varying degrees, plaintiffs' seven experts draw on these materials to support their claim that using Mirena can cause IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Various of these experts also draw upon case reports made to Bayer of \"adverse events.\" The subset of Bayer's \"adverse events\" database relating to Mirena and IIH was made available in discovery during this MDL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because these materials are foundational sources for the experts who are the subjects of the instant\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions, the Court-before considering any individual expert-reviews the preexisting scholarship and data. The Court first discusses conceptually the categories of studies and other evidence upon which experts may draw in exploring whether a drug can cause a given disease. The Court then reviews the publications that exist, outside of this litigation, regarding Mirena and IIH. Lastly, the Court reviews the publications regarding other (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , non-Mirena) LNG-based contraceptive products and IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Categories of Studies Generally\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In general, three broad categories of human studies can be used to explore a possible causal connection between a drug and a disease or the efficacy of particular modes of treatment of a disease: randomized control trials, epidemiological studies, and studies analyzing anecdotal evidence (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , case reports).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Randomized control trials\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : A randomized control study is widely considered the gold standard of human studies. Such a study consists of a \"true clinical experiment in which an intervention is compared with a standard treatment, no treatment, or a placebo, with allocation to treatment by chance.\" Leon Speroff &amp; Philip D. Darney,\n   <em>\n    A Clinical Guide for Contraception\n   </em>\n   429 (5th ed. 2011) (Dkt. 167-62) (\"Speroff &amp; Darney\"). Such experiments are often used to test possible treatments for a disease. The hallmarks of a classic clinical trial include a contemporary control group, the allocation of participants so as to assure that participant characteristics are distributed evenly across the treatment and placebo groups, and blinded as to both participants and investigators. These features enable researchers,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to control for known and unknown confounding factors. However, in the context of testing the capacity of a drug to cause a disease, randomized control studies are often unattainable in practice. Constraints presented by norms of medical ethics may preclude certain tests. And, in the context of rare ailments, such a study might have to be impracticably large to yield statistically significant results, particularly where confounding factors are present.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 12, 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Epidemiological studies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : Epidemiology is the study and analysis of the distribution and determinants of health and disease conditions in defined populations. The two most common types of epidemiological studies are cohort observational studies and case-controlled observational studies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Cohort studies involve sorting subjects into separate groups based on their exposure (or lack of exposure) to the drug in question. Such studies may be prospective or retrospective. In prospective cohort studies, patients are followed over time to see which persons develop the disease; in retrospective studies, patients are interviewed to determine whether they have been diagnosed with the disease and, if so, under what circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Speroff &amp; Darney,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 429-30. A case-control study, in contrast, involves sorting patients into separate groups based on their having been diagnosed with having (or not having) the disease in question, and comparing these groups.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 430.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Relative to randomized control tests, however, both types of epidemiological studies, when used to test a thesis of general causation, present inherent challenges\n   controlling for potential confounding factors. Addressing such factors calls for intelligent study design and/or rigorous statistical analysis of results.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 431.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Anecdotal evidence/case reports\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : Anecdotal evidence in cases involving claims that a drug caused a disease usually takes the form of \"case reports.\" A case report is a report of an individual incident or episode, generally keyed to a specific user of a drug, \"that serves to bring attention to a possible problem or condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 430.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Individual manufacturers of drugs, such as Bayer, maintain their own adverse events databases. Another database-relevant here because one of the two epidemiological studies of Mirena and IIH, that by Dr. Etminan, drew upon it-is maintained by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (\"FAERS\"). It contains approximately 5 million adverse event reports, medication error reports, and product quality complaints resulting in adverse events that were submitted to the FDA. The database is designed,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to support the FDA's post-marketing safety surveillance program for FDA-approved biologic products. Reports are submitted to FAERS by healthcare professionals, consumers, and manufacturers. Reports from healthcare professionals (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , physicians, pharmacists, and nurses) and consumers (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , patients, family members, and lawyers) are voluntary. If a manufacturer receives a report from a healthcare professional or consumer, however, regulations require it to send the report to the FDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Consistent with the case law reviewed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , scholars, including plaintiffs' experts in this litigation, agree that while case reports often have utility in generating hypotheses about the possible relationship between a drug and a medical condition, such anecdotal accounts-except in extremely rare circumstances-cannot, without more, demonstrate the causation by a drug of such a condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Darney Dep. at 206 (\"[C]ase reports cannot establish causation.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 144 (noting that the \"principal use\" of case reports is \"to generate a hypothesis for epidemiologic ... investigation\"); Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 21 (\"[I]t is the rare case report that demonstrates causality in and of itself\"; case reports are \"essential to the causation process\" because they \"demonstrate what is possible\"); Moy\u00e9 Dep. at 131 (\"[C]ase reports are not even sufficient to show association because there is no comparison group.\"); Plunkett Dep. at 184 (noting case reports \"show[ ] associations, not general cause\"); Wheeler Dep. at 206 (\"[A]dverse event data cannot be used to establish causation\" and \"the proper use of adverse event report data is ... hypothesis generating ....\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Fraunfelder Rpt. at 8 (observing that case reports may serve as \"signals,\" defined as \"reported information on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Animal studies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : Animal studies can sometimes be used to test a causal connection between a drug and a disease.

Animal studies are of limited relevance in this case, in that no such study has assessed whether LNG (however administered) causes IIH.

Those referenced in the expert reports include: (1) Kyleena and Skyla, both of which are IUDs manufactured by Bayer (Skyla, approved in 2013, has an average release rate of 6 \u00b5g LNG/day for up to three years, while Kyleena, approved in 2016, has an average\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   release rate of 9 \u00b5g LNG/day for up to 5 years); and (2) Allergan's Liletta, an IUD releasing 19.5 \u00b5g LNG/day for up to three years. Darney Rpt. at 7; Plunkett Rpt. at 9 n.8, 23-24; Wheeler Rpt. at 2. The parties have not drawn to the Court's attention studies or case reports bearing on a possible connection between these products and IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Bayer's Challenges to Plaintiffs' Expert Witnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The state of research outside of this litigation as to the general causation proposition here-that using the Mirena IUD can cause a woman to develop IIH-presents a challenge for an expert witness here who would so testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   As the above review reflects, to date, no prospective experiments have been undertaken that sought to address that question. Two epidemiological studies have examined that question but neither has found such causation. One such study, Etminan, has been retracted to the extent that it-based on its DPA analysis of reports in the FAERS database-had initially found an increased IIH risk among Mirena users. And the surviving half of the Etminan study (which compared Mirena with oral contraceptives) did not find any such increased risk. The other epidemiological study (Valenzuela) found a correlation between Mirena use and IIH. But it found only that. In language that warned against conflating correlation with causation, the Valenzuela study emphasized that its finding of such a correlation \"does not indicate\" that an LNG-based IUD such as Mirena is an \"independent risk factor\" for IIH. Rather, as Valenzuela recognized, alternative explanations for the correlation between Mirena and IIH are apparent-notably, the confounding factors of overweightness and obesity among reproductive-age women. As to the other contraceptive products using LNG, five studies of combined oral contraceptives have affirmatively found that these products, which contain notably higher amounts of LNG than Mirena, do not cause IIH. And no study has established a causal link between IIH and Norplant, which also contained substantially more LNG than Mirena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In the face of this assembled historical record, with no medical organization or regulator or peer-reviewed scientific literature\n   having found that Mirena or any contraceptive product using LNG is a cause of IIH, an expert witness who would so opine as to Mirena necessarily would break new ground in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Each of plaintiffs' seven expert witnesses reach this conclusion in their reports. None has done so through an experiment, laboratory work, or a new epidemiological study of his or her own. Four of plaintiffs' expert witnesses (Drs. Moy\u00e9, Plunkett, Wheeler, and Fraunfelder) arrive at this result largely by drawing upon existing sources. These include the Valenzuela study plus, depending on the witness, some or all of the following: the repudiated portion of the Etminan study; case reports regarding Mirena; case reports regarding Norplant and other subdural implants; and Norplant's warning label. These experts also draw upon a newly available source of data: the case reports regarding Mirena first added in Bayer's 2017 signal investigation, which was made available to plaintiffs in discovery. To varying degrees, each of these four experts also articulates a theory as to a biological mechanism by which Mirena might cause IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Plaintiffs' remaining three expert witnesses (Drs. Darney, Johanson, and Salpietro) are predominantly \"mechanism\" experts. Their reports each develop a thesis as to how, biologically, use of Mirena may cause IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Bayer, for its part, argues that plaintiffs' experts' proposed testimony is unreliable, measured against the requirements for admission of expert testimony. As to the four experts who rely largely on existing studies and data, Bayer contends,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the alchemy is elusive by which a witness can reliably find such causation where the studies that comprise the expert's central source material have not so found. As to the three \"mechanism\" experts, Bayer contends that their untested theories are based on conjecture, and often on mishandling the scholarship on which they postulate causal mechanisms. Overall, Bayer contends that, rather than reflecting rigorous application to scientific methodologies, the conclusions of each of the seven witnesses amounts to a non-scientific\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Court's analysis proceeds as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Court first reviews the legal standards governing receipt of expert testimony as set out in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and ensuing decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Court then summarizes each witness' proposed testimony and assesses it against these standards. The Court first considers the four witnesses who reach the conclusion that Mirena is a cause of IIH based largely on existing studies and data. These witnesses describe the multi-factor methodologies they use in assessing this evidence as, alternatively, a \"Bradford Hill\" and/or a \"totality of the circumstances\" methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The Court then considers the remaining three witnesses, whose reports, as noted, largely articulate theories about biological mechanisms by which Mirena might cause IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Proposed Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Dr. Moy\u00e9 principally relies on the following materials in applying the Bradford Hill criteria: (1) the Valenzuela study, (2) 36 case reports, drawn from among the 315 adverse event reports as to Mirena and IIH noted in Bayer's 2017 signal investigation, and Bayer's summary of that investigation in its BfArM submission; (3) a single published article involving Norplant, and (4) a review of literature based upon which Dr. Moy\u00e9 develops a theory as to a \"biologic[ally] plausib[le]\" mechanism. Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 39;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-43. He applies the nine Bradford Hill criteria, or factors, to that evidence as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <em>\n    Strength of association\n   </em>\n   : Dr. Moy\u00e9 bases his finding of a \"positive\" strength of association, Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 34, on the Valenzuela cohort study.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-34. As noted, that study reviewed populations in Utah and Denmark. Dr. Moy\u00e9 concludes that that, as to both populations, the Valenzuela data revealed an association between Mirena and IIH. The relative risk ratio (a measure of the likelihood of IIH occurring in patients using Mirena compared to those not using Mirena ) for both populations was, he states, statistically significant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 31 (relative risk ratio for LNG-IUD group in Utah population was 7.69);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32 (relative risk ratio for LNG-IUD group in Denmark population was 3.90). Dr. Moy\u00e9 concedes that those ratios, being derived from Valenzuela, did not control for the confounding factors of age or weight. He terms that shortcoming \"regrettable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. Nevertheless, Dr. Moy\u00e9 concludes, because the relative risk ratios (particularly as to Utah) were substantial, \"it would be unreasonable to assume that the large odds ratios observed in the Utah cohort would be completely adumbrated by adjustment for obesity and age.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32.

Bayer Omnibus Br. at 16-17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his response as to the Utah population, Dr. Moy\u00e9 does not address whether it was inappropriate for Valenzuela to include certain types of patients in the case but not the control group.

Instead, he responds to Bayer's separate argument that the correct proportion of women using Mirena in Denmark at the time is 10%, and not the 3.5% used by Valenzuela. Dr. Moy\u00e9 questions the study on which Bayer's 10% calculation was based.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.

Dr. Moy\u00e9 finds such a dose-response effect because (1) in the Valenzuela study, the average duration of exposure prior to symptom onset was 22 months; (2) in Bayer's 2015 signal investigation and its 2017 response to BfArM, respectively, 77.8% and 62.9% of the cases of IIH (with time-to-onset information) occurred within the first two years of patients' Mirena exposure; and (3) during the first two years of usage, LNG levels are the highest and most variable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.

Dr. Moy\u00e9's examples, however, are not representative of the cases in Bayer's adverse events database, as described in Bayer's BfArM report. That report states that, of the 68 patients whose Mirena had been removed and for whom further information was available, 31 (or 46%) \"did not recover,\" 23 (or 34%) had \"improved,\" and 14 (or 20%) had \"recovered.\" Bayer BfArM Response at 49.

He opines that it supported that Mirena causes IIH. However, as noted earlier, that study is not an epidemiological study. It discusses a collection of adverse event reports involving Norplant. Wysowski and Green concluded that, based on the evidence before them, it was \"not possible\" to determine whether \"a causal association exists\" between Norplant and IIH.

However, on inspection, his analysis is flawed by serious methodological deficiencies. These include an unweighted and unmoored application of the nine Bradford Hill factors, a failure to consider known contrary evidence, a contravention of principles which Dr. Moy\u00e9 has acknowledged should guide an epidemiologist's inquiry, a selective use of case report data, a lack of qualification to opine on biological mechanisms by which Mirena might cause IIH, and the citation of the Valenzuela study for propositions that it did not find.

Instead, he finds that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   nine criteria support a finding that Mirena causes IIH. Indeed, he nowhere concedes that any criterion even is only weakly supportive of a finding of causation. By leaving obscure the weight that he attaches to each of the nine Bradford Hill factors and the relationship among them, Dr. Moy\u00e9's approach effectively disables a finder of fact from critically evaluating his work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   To illustrate the point: A finder of fact might, for example, take issue with Dr. Moy\u00e9's assessment of the first factor-the gating factor of strength of association. Dr. Moy\u00e9 finds a \"strong association\" based principally on the Utah component of the Valenzuela study. Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 31. Dr. Moy\u00e9's fellow expert, Dr. Wheeler, however, reaches a different conclusion-he concludes that, based on the Valenzuela and Etminan studies, \"there is no association demonstrated.\" Wheeler Dep. 200. And the Valenzuela study on which Dr. Moy\u00e9 bases his strength-of-association finding stopped well short of finding a strong association. The authors pointedly cautioned that \"[a]lthough use of an LNG-IU[D] seems [to] be associated with an increased risk of PTC, it is possible that this observation occurred because use of an LNG-IU[D] is also associated with other risk factors that are known to be associated with PTC (e.g., obesity and recent weight gain).\" Valenzuela, at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (\"[I]t is also important to consider that the risk analysis does not account for potential confounders.\"). A finder of fact might therefore come to a conclusion other than that of Dr. Moy\u00e9 as to strength of association, perhaps finding, for example, in between Drs. Moy\u00e9 and Wheeler, that there is a statistical association, but only a weak one, between Mirena and IIH. Such a finder would then have to consider whether the other Bradford Hill factors, if now viewed in the context of only a weak statistical association, support a finding of causation. Dr. Moy\u00e9's failure to weigh or explain the relationship among the factors in his analysis, however, would disable such an inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Alternatively, a finder of fact might take issue with Dr. Moy\u00e9's conclusions that other Bradford Hill factors support Mirena's causation of IIH. A finder might so conclude based on concerns about proper methodology (including along the lines discussed below). Or a finder might substantively disagree with Dr. Moy\u00e9 as to particular factors. Such a finder would then need to assess whether to find general causation in the absence of certain factors. Dr. Moy\u00e9's failure to weight factors or explain the relationship among them would preclude this assessment, too. Does Dr. Moy\u00e9's conclusion of causation still stand if the Bradford Hill factor of analogy is not found to favor that result? Or the factor of specificity? Or the factor of consistency? Or all of the above-or yet other factors? Dr. Moy\u00e9's unscientific \"black box\" approach to Bradford Hill review almost entirely prevents the finder of fact, or other experts seeking to validate or check his work, from conducting a meaningful and informed review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   As to his assessment of individual Bradford Hill factors, Dr. Moy\u00e9's mode of analysis, too, departs repeatedly from reliable methodology. Four examples, among others, illustrate the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   As to the Bradford Hill factor of analogy, this factor requires \"substantiation of relationships similar to the putative causal relationship ....\" Thompson,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 268. Dr. Moy\u00e9 elsewhere has acknowledged this requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, Dr. Moy\u00e9 finds that this factor supports concluding that Mirena causes IIH based on an analogy he makes to Norplant. But this analogy is founded on an unestablished hypothesis about Norplant. As noted, a cause-and-effect relationship between Norplant and IIH has never been substantiated. No epidemiological study of the relationship, if any, between Norplant and IIH has ever been conducted. Dr. Moy\u00e9 bases his conclusion that Norplant causes IIH, and hence can be the basis for an analogy, solely on case reports discussing Norplant as reviewed in the study by Wysowski and Green. But these Norplant case reports, as Dr. Moy\u00e9 admitted in his deposition, were all subject to confounding factors such as obesity and weight gain. Moy\u00e9 Dep. at 270-72. And the Wysowski and Green study, on which Dr. Moy\u00e9 relies, clearly stated that this evidence falls well short of establishing a causal relationship between Norplant and IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wysowski and Green,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 541;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence at 218 (Dkt. 167-86) (\"Anecdotal evidence usually amounts to reports that events of one kind are followed by events of another kind.

In his deposition, Dr. Moy\u00e9 admitted that he is unable to opine that Norplant causes IIH, and that it is an open question whether Norplant does so. Moy\u00e9 Dep. at 56.

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    522 U.S. at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    118 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -on an inaccurate account of the scholarship as to whether the analog product, Norplant, causes IIH-is therefore foundationally unsound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   As to the Bradford Hill factor of specificity, this factor inquires into the number of causes of a disease. As Dr. Moy\u00e9 explained: \"The greater the number of causes of a disease (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the more multifactorial\n   the risk factors causing the disease), the more nonspecific the disease is, and the more difficult it is to demonstrate a new causal agent is involved in the production of the disease.\" Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 19. In finding the specificity factor satisfied, Dr. Moy\u00e9 devoted two sentences to his discussion. In the first, he admits that \"[IIH] has multiple causes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. In the second, he states that the alternative causes (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , all but Mirena) \"can either be excluded, statistically adjusted out of consideration, or accounted for in a multi-factorial causation model.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Moy\u00e9's reliance on this conclusory statement as a basis for finding the specificity factor met, too, departs from rigorous methodology. Dr. Moy\u00e9 does not cite any study in which any such statistical adjustment has actually been performed so as to isolate Mirena as a cause of IIH, as distinct from other factors. His conceptual point about the potential to exclude alternative causes is, at best, theoretical. And the one epidemiological study on which Dr. Moy\u00e9 relies in his Bradford Hill analysis, Valenzuela, did not undertake any such statistical adjustment. On the contrary, it pointedly\n   <em>\n    disclaimed\n   </em>\n   any finding that Mirena causes IIH, on account of confounding risk factors prevalent among the dominant population of Mirena users.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Valenzuela at 5 (\"When interpreting the findings presented here, it is also important to consider that the risk analysis does not account for potential confounders.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   As to the Bradford Hill factor of consistency, it tends to require \"similar findings ... generated by several epidemiological studies involving various investigators.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Thompson,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 268;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence at 604 (\"It is important that a study be replicated in different populations and by different investigators before a causal relationship is accepted by epidemiologists and other scientists.\"). Dr. Moy\u00e9 opines that the Valenzuela study \"satisfies the consistency metric,\" because Valenzuela considered two separate populations. Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 41. These studies, however, were conducted by the same investigators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   More problematic as a matter of methodology, neither cohort study in Valenzuela found what was \"important\"-\"a causal relationship.\" Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence at 604. Even accepting Valenzuela as containing \"similar findings\" from multiple epidemiological studies, Dr. Moy\u00e9's finding that the consistency metric was satisfied ignores the very limited point that the studies addressed and on which they were therefore consistent. The studies were consistent only as to the fact of a correlation-subject, as Valenzuela repeatedly pointed out, to potential confounders-between Mirena and IIH. They explicitly disclaimed a finding of causality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Finally, as to the Bradford Hill factor of biologic plausibility, Dr. Moy\u00e9 bases his finding that this factor was satisfied on his conclusion that a mineralocorticoid (MR) theory by which Mirena causes IIH is plausible. He posits that LNG mimics \"the action of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, thereby increasing sodium ion and water flow into the cerebral spinal fluid, and subsequently increasing CSF pressure.\" Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 40;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Moy\u00e9 Dep. 249 (\"Q: As I understand what you have written in your report you rely on the MR theory; is that correct?\" A: Correct. Q: Not the androgen receptor theory? A: [T]hat is correct.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   But, as Bayer rightly argues, Dr. Moy\u00e9-a medical doctor who doubles as a professor of biostatistics-is not qualified to opine about a biological mechanism by which Mirena might cause IIH. Dr. Moy\u00e9 is not educated in the relevant disciplines: pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Moy\u00e9 Dep. 85-86 (\"Q: Do you hold yourself out as a pharmacokinetics expert? A: No. Q: Do you hold yourself out as a pharmacodynamics expert? A: No.\"). He is not trained in gynecology, either. And plaintiffs have not come forward with evidence that Dr. Moy\u00e9 has acquired sufficient practical experience in these areas to make up for his lack of relevant education or training. Before this litigation, Dr. Moy\u00e9 had not conducted research on LNG generally or on its hormonal impact on MR receptors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85, 262. Dr. Moy\u00e9, instead, provides a blanket citation to 40 academic articles, none of which address Mirena, to support his finding of biological plausibility based on an MR mechanism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Simply stated, by any measure, Dr. Moy\u00e9 is unqualified to give an expert opinion as to a biological mechanism of causation of IIH. His lack of qualifications to so opine makes unreliable not only Dr. Moy\u00e9's assessment as to biological plausibility-that the MR mechanism is a biologically plausible one. It also compromises his assessment of the companion Bradford Hill factor of coherence, because Dr. Moy\u00e9 finds that factor met explicitly based on his assessment that the mechanism he had endorsed is a coherent one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moy\u00e9 Rpt. at 41 (\"The mechanism of 1) increased egress of Na+ ion and water flow into the CSF from the choroid plexus producing CSF, and 2) decreased flow [ ]either by decreased activity of carbonic anhydrase, or reversal of the effect of steroid hormones that mimic aldosterone in the MR can reduce the symptoms of [IIH] does not contradict known science.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Common to Dr. Moy\u00e9's misapplications of the above Bradford Hill factors is this: Each of Dr. Moy\u00e9's departures from settled and rigorous methodology favors the same outcome. Each enables him to find that the Bradford Hill factor at issue supports concluding that Mirena is a cause of IIH. At bottom, as the Supreme Court instructed in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , expert testimony \"must be supported by appropriate validation-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , good grounds, based on what is known.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Dr. Moy\u00e9's unidirectional misapplication of a series of Bradford Hill criteria is concerning-it is a red flag. Rather than suggesting a scholar's considered neutral engagement with the general causation question at hand, it suggests motivated, result-driven, reasoning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faulkner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887316\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/46/365/#p381\">\n    46 F.Supp.3d at 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[M]ethodology ... aimed at achieving one result ... is unreliable.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Yet other methodological lapses also preclude, as unreliable under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Moy\u00e9's proposed testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   For one, Dr. Moy\u00e9 ignores scientific standards that he has conceded govern inquiries into general causation. In his deposition, Dr. Moy\u00e9 agreed, for example, with certain widely accepted principles of medical research. One is that case reports do no more than raise the question of a causal connection between a drug and a disease; they cannot establish causation. Moy\u00e9 Dep. at 272. A related principle that he acknowledged is that, to prove general causation, observational studies, such as a case control study or a cohort study, generally are required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 125 (agreeing that a single observational study \"[r]arely, if ever ... persuasively demonstrate[s] a cause-effect relationship\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (agreeing that \"it is important that an observational study be replicated in different populations and by different investigators\n   before a causal relationship is accepted\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Dr. Moy\u00e9's report is unfaithful to these precepts. Dr. Moy\u00e9 finds causation of IIH by Mirena in the absence of any of the sorts of studies that he concedes generally are required. As to studies, he relies solely on the Valenzuela study, a retrospective epidemiological study which stopped well short of finding causation, recognizing that it had not controlled for major confounding variables such as obesity and weight gain that are prevalent both among IIH patients and the population of Mirena users. In his deposition, Dr. Moy\u00e9 admitted Valenzuela's limitations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Moy\u00e9 Dep. at 215 (\"Q: Would you conclude causation with just the results of Valenzuela standing alone? A: No, sir, I would not.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 216 (\"I think an appropriate statement would be to say that it's possible that LNG-IU[D] causes PTC, but this study doesn't show it.\"). And Dr. Moy\u00e9 also appears to rely on case reports for more than merely raising a question about whether a causal relationship between Mirena and IIH existed. In his report, Dr. Moy\u00e9 uses case reports (and a study aggregating such reports) almost exclusively to establish three of the nine Bradford Hill factors: experimental evidence, temporality, and analogy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p267\">\n    303 F.3d at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming exclusion of proffered expert who \"fail[ed] to apply his stated methodology reliably to the facts of the case\") (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    Soldo v.

This is a separate methodological failing. It is most strikingly apparent in Dr. Moy\u00e9's consideration of the analogy factor. Dr. Moy\u00e9 elects to analogize to Norplant. As to Norplant, he draws on isolated case reports canvassed in a study (Wysowski and Green) that disclaimed a finding of causation. He also analogizes to case reports in which, he states, a relationship was indicated between IIH and \"elevated testosterone levels.\" Moy\u00e9 at 42-43. As to this factor, he thus is willing to range outside the area of LNG-containing intra-uterine devices, considering case reports as to other products and other hormones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   In so doing, however, Dr. Moy\u00e9, tellingly, does not consider an analogy between Mirena and other LNG-containing contraceptive drugs: combined oral contraceptives containing LNG. Consideration of those products stood to seriously undermine Dr. Moy\u00e9's conclusion. As noted, five epidemiological studies have uniformly\n   <em>\n    failed\n   </em>\n   to demonstrate a link between such oral contraceptives and IIH, even though LNG-containing oral contraceptives generally contain far higher doses of LNG than Mirena, and IIH. Whatever the scientific distinctions that might have been made between oral and intra-uterine delivery systems for LNG, these studies demanded Dr. Moy\u00e9's consideration. Yet Dr. Moy\u00e9 does not review them. Moy\u00e9 Dep. at 51-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Dr. Moy\u00e9's decision to brush aside these epidemiological studies, while analogizing to a different medical device and a different hormone based exclusively on case reports, departs from reliable, rigorous methodology. \"[A]n expert may not pick and choose from the scientific landscape.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Rezulin Prod.

Rather than selecting case reports through random sampling or by a representative cross section, Dr. Moy\u00e9 appears to draw the case reports that he considers from those presented to him by counsel or from a spreadsheet whose design is elusive. This skewed methodology has obvious potential to yield a skewed sample and result.

Qualifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Dr. Plunkett is a pharmacologist and toxicologist with more than 20 years' experience\n   in those fields. She received her B.S. in 1980 from the University of Georgia and a Ph.D. in pharmacology in 1984 from the University of Georgia, College of Pharmacy. Plunkett Rpt. at 1. She has worked as a Pharmacology Research Associate Training (PRAT) fellow at the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (approximately two years), an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (almost three years), and a consultant for ENVIRON Corporation (almost eight years).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. Dr. Plunkett has also served as a consultant for Integrative Biostrategies and at Plunkett &amp; Associates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Her professional career has consisted predominantly of working as a paid consultant, including substantial service as a compensated expert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plunkett Dep. at 351 (expert work made up about 55% of her income in 2016). In the last five years she has testified approximately 65 times.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plunkett Rpt. at App'x C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Dr. Plunkett has experience \"examining the risks associated with exposure to hormones and the risks associated with altered hormonal status in women.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. However, she is not a medical doctor. She has neither published on IIH nor spoken about the disease to doctors who treat it. Plunkett Dep. at 111-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Proposed Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Dr. Plunkett's proposed testimony can be divided into two parts: (1) a discussion of the pharmacokinetics of LNG-releasing contraceptives, and (2) an application of the Bradford Hill methodology, which she alternatively describes as a \"weight of the evidence\" analysis, with the conclusion that Mirena causes IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Pharmacokinetics of LNG\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Dr. Plunkett's discussion of the pharmacokinetics of LNG informs her application of the Bradford Hill methodology. Because Bayer either concedes or does not substantially contest most of this discussion, the Court highlights only Dr. Plunkett's major points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   First, Dr. Plunkett discusses the difference between \"free\" LNG and total LNG. She asserts that free LNG levels should be used to access a patient's exposure and response to the hormone. The vast majority of LNG in the blood stream is not \"free\" floating. Instead, she states, upwards of 98% of LNG is bound to plasma proteins (specifically albumin and a carrier protein called steroid hormone binding globulin). However, she states, LNG's effects are not generally created by such bound LNG. Rather, they are created by \"free\" LNG activating nuclear hormone receptors. Thus: \"It is the free or unbound LNG levels that correlate best with the biological responses observed in humans, not the total level of LNG in blood.\" Plunkett Rpt. at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Dr. Plunkett also states that, although free LNG levels for Mirena are lower than the levels associated with other LNG-releasing contraceptive devices (such as Norplant), the LNG levels in the blood of patients using such devices overlap with the levels observed in Mirena patients. This overlap, Dr. Plunkett asserts, justifies analogizing Mirena to Norplant and other LNG-containing contraceptive devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Dr. Plunkett notes that LNG is a progestin, which mimics the effects of progesterone. She observes that, relative to other progestins, LNG is androgenic, meaning that it can bind with androgen receptors. However, Dr. Plunkett notes, discerning a mechanism to explain the pharmacological and toxicological effects of progestins like LNG is extremely complicated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Application of Bradford Hill\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Dr. Plunkett applies the Bradford Hill factors, as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <em>\n    Strength of association\n   </em>\n   : Dr. Plunkett frames her discussion of this threshold factor by quoting Sir Bradford Hill himself, to the effect that a scholar \"must not be too ready to dismiss a cause and effect hypothesis merely on the grounds that the observed association appears to be slight,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (citation omitted), and that \"[n]o formal tests of significance can answer\" whether there is a \"cause and effect relationship,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Plunkett then opines that three studies in the scientific literature \"show[ ] that exposure to LNG from LNG intrauterine drug products has been associated with an increased risk of intracranial hypertension.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. These were: (1) Etminan, (2) Valenzuela, and (3) Rai et al.,\n   <em>\n    The Relationship Between the Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System and Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension\n   </em>\n   , ARVO (2015) (\"Rai poster board presentation\"). Beyond citing these studies, Dr. Plunkett does not discuss any of them in more than a sentence. As to the Etminan study, Dr. Plunkett acknowledges that, after Etminan's 2017 letter to the editor that factored in age-adjusted results, the results of his retrospective cohort study \"were no longer statistically significant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, she writes of the three studies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   These human studies are an important piece of the weight-of-the-evidence for LNG exposure with Mirena and PTC, as they have shown a statistically significant risk of PTC when women are exposed to LNG drug products, including intrauterine devices such as Mirena. I used these human studies as part of my weight-of-the-evidence assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20N.C.%20L.%20Rev.%20247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Plunkett's report does not mention or contend with the fact that the Valenzuela study had explicitly disclaimed a finding of a causal connection between IIH and Mirena. Nor does Dr. Plunkett's report note that the Rai poster presentation was a preview of the Valenzuela data presented prior to its 2017 publication and thus was substantively the same study as Valenzuela. In her deposition, Dr. Plunkett conceded those facts. Plunkett Dep. at 136-37, 165-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   <em>\n    Temporality\n   </em>\n   : In finding this factor satisfied, Dr. Plunkett states that she relies on three studies which, she stated, had \"addressed\" temporality (by Valenzuela, Rai, and Alder) and on three case reports drawn from the Bayer database. Plunkett Rpt. at 28. Beyond identifying these materials, however, Dr. Plunkett does not address their contents. The Valenzuela authors, for instance, specifically noted in their publication that they lacked temporal data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Valenzuela,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 4 (\"The analysis was also limited by the lack of temporal data to confirm that exposure to LNG-IU[D] occurred prior to PTC symptom onset or diagnosis.\"). And Rai, as noted, was a precursor to Valenzuela and based on the same data. The third publication she cites, by Alder, was a letter to the editor that discussed two cases of IIH which arose in Norplant users after the Norplant's implantation. The Alder authors disclaimed any causal findings: \"[Norplant] may have contributed to the onset of [IIH], or it may have had nothing to do with it.\" Alder,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1721. Dr. Plunkett's report does not note this disclaimer. As to the three case reports Dr. Plunkett cites, two involved Mirena and one involved Skyla.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Court assumes\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the patients described in these reports developed IIH symptoms after they began use of the LNG-based contraceptive product, Dr.\n   Plunkett's report does not so state.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <em>\n    Biological gradient\n   </em>\n   : Dr. Plunkett quotes Sir Bradford Hill in framing her discussion of this factor, in recognizing the \"difficulty [of] secur[ing] some satisfactory\" data to permit assessment of a dose-response effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In finding a possible such effect with respect to Mirena and IIH, Dr. Plunkett states that she relies on three sources: (1) a 1992 article (V. Brache, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Free Levonorgestrel Index and Its Relationship with Luteal Activity During Long-Term Use of Norplant Implants\n   </em>\n   , 8 Soc'y for the Adv. of Contraception 319 (1992) (\"Branche\"); (2) Bayer's 2015 signal investigation; and (3) the Mirena 2017 signal assessment. The Branche article, according to Dr. Plunkett, had shown that in the first two years of LNG exposure, free LNG levels are higher than they otherwise would be. Plunkett Rpt. at 29. Dr. Plunkett finds that probative of a biological gradient, because approximately 75-80% of the IIH adverse events in Bayer's 2015 signal investigation had been reported during the first two years of Mirena use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. As for Bayer's 2017 signal assessment, Dr. Plunkett notes, it had compared the reporting frequency for IIH in Mirena and Skyla, which releases substantially less LNG than Mirena. The reporting frequency of IIH for each product was the same, which might seem to suggest, Dr. Plunkett acknowledges, the lack of a biological gradient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. However, Dr. Plunkett rejects that conclusion. She notes that there is \"variability in LNG pharmacokinetics with both products, which would affect the levels of LNG in the blood achieved from patient to patient, and confound any attempt to identify a dose-response for LNG exposure and [IIH] in humans.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also ventures that adverse events as to these drugs may have been significantly under-reported, a phenomenon particularly likely as to \"drugs that may have been on the market for many years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She ultimately concludes that \"the available dose-response data provide support for the cause and effect assessment in terms of showing that increased levels of LNG in blood are more likely to be associated with adverse effects generally.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. However, she acknowledges, \"[u]nfortunately, no dose or blood level threshold that is associated with an increased risk of [IIH] has been identified to date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <em>\n    Biological plausibility\n   </em>\n   : Dr. Plunkett embraces the \"androgen theory\" of how LNG might cause IIH.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   She does not, however, articulate a proposed mechanism to support that theory, as had Dr. Moy\u00e9. Instead, she cites literature that she contends found a link between IIH and androgens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32; Plunkett Dep. at 311-16. Although acknowledging that LNG is a progestin, not an androgen, she terms it an \"androgenic progestin.\" Plunkett Rpt. at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   <em>\n    Coherence\n   </em>\n   : Dr. Plunkett does not cite any sources as to this factor, which she addresses in a short paragraph. Instead, she refers to her discussion of the biological plausibility that Mirena causes IIH, in that IIH \"has been linked with androgenic activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. She also cites \"human epidemiological data\" as to Mirena and IIH, apparently although not explicitly referring to the Valenzuela and Etminan studies. \"[T]he data reported\" in those studies, she states, \"are consistent with what is known about the etiology of [IIH].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   <em>\n    Consistency\n   </em>\n   : Dr. Plunkett describes the consistency factor as turning on \"whether the association being investigated has been seen repeatedly by different people, in different circumstances, and/or at different times.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. She concludes that this factor is met, citing, although not further discussing, (1) the Valenzuela and Etminan studies, (2) several Norplant studies reviewed earlier (Wysowski &amp; Green,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ; Sunku,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ; Alder et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ; and R.A. Tang, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Pseudotumor Cerebri Associated with the Norplant Contraceptive Device\n   </em>\n   , Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science 36 (1995), and (3) an analogy to case reports of IIH experienced by patients using Norplant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In her deposition, Dr. Plunkett acknowledged that such case reports could not alone demonstrate causation. Plunkett Dep. 181-82 (\"Absolutely. You need more than the case studies.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <em>\n    Specificity\n   </em>\n   : Dr. Plunkett states that this factor considers \"whether the association is limited to specific types of activities or injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. Dr. Plunkett does not explicitly find this factor met, stating more obliquely that \"considering specificity of the relationship has been part of my overall assessment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. She acknowledges that the scientific literature addressing the relationship between Mirena and IIH described \"confounding factors ... such as obesity [and] female gender.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   <em>\n    Experimental evidence\n   </em>\n   : Dr. Plunkett casts this factor as \"relat[ing] to the ability to collect data in order to analyze the cause and effect relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. In finding it met, Dr. Plunkett relies on publications above regarding Norplant, and on Bayer's 2015 signal assessment data, the latter of which, she stated, contained examples of \"dechallenge.\" She concedes, however, that animal or cell experiments are the evidence typically used in experiments used to find causation, and that none have been conducted regarding LNG and IIH. Plunkett Rpt. at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   <em>\n    Analogy\n   </em>\n   : Dr. Plunkett analogizes Mirena to Norplant. She relies on the publications cited above regarding Norplant. As noted, however, these were not epidemiological studies-they instead discussed case reports-and none found causation by Norplant of IIH. Dr. Plunkett also cites several studies which discuss IIH's etiology and list LNG as associated with IIH. None, however, had found that LNG is causally linked to IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis Under\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Bayer argues that Dr. Plunkett's methodology in applying Bradford Hill is unreliable. Bayer is correct. The application of Bradford Hill in Dr. Plunkett's report has a number of methodological flaws. Some are common with those noted in connection with Dr. Moy\u00e9. Dr. Plunkett's report is also validly called out for independent lapses, as reflected in the Court's assessment, below, of her applications of certain Bradford Hill factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   To begin, in common with Dr. Moy\u00e9, Dr. Plunkett's report does not meet any of the four\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   reliability factors. She has not tested her theory. She has not subjected it to peer review or had it published. She has not identified an error rate for her technique, and, as with Dr. Moy\u00e9's application of the Bradford Hill methodology, there are no standards controlling its operation. Finally, Dr. Plunkett's theory that Mirena is a cause of IIH, far from achieving general acceptance, has not been accepted by any part of the scientific community outside of this litigation. A \"hard look\" is therefore warranted as to her analysis, too. Compounding these problems, Dr. Plunkett, in common with Dr. Moy\u00e9, does not explain the weights she places on the various Bradford Hill factors. Instead, she reviews each in isolation, and opines or\n   (where unable or willing expressly to so state) implies that each has been satisfied. And Dr. Plunkett's handling of individual factors is subject to grave methodological deficiencies. For all these reasons her application of Bradford Hill does not survive\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   The Court begins with Dr. Plunkett's reliance on the discredited portion of the Etminan study. That study is a centerpiece of her application of the first Bradford Hill factor. That factor requires a statistical, or strong, association between the cause under review and its asserted effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   This factor is a necessary, or gating, factor for any Bradford Hill analysis to proceed, such that, if such a statistical association is not found, there is no charter to undertake a Bradford Hill analysis at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence, 599 n.141 (3d. ed. 2011) (\"In a number of cases, experts attempted to use these guidelines to support the existence of causation in the absence of any epidemiologic studies finding an association.... There may be some logic to that effort, but it does not reflect accepted epidemiologic methodology.\"); Restatement (Third) Torts \u00a7 28 cmt. (c)(3) (\"Even when epidemiologic studies find an association between a substance and a disease, further analysis is necessary before a causal conclusion can be drawn....

He did so expressly in his 2016 affidavit and again functionally in his 2017 letter to the editor. As he explained in those writings, once the control group in the FAERS database was limited to reproductive age females, no elevated reporting odds ratio was observed for Mirena (statistically significant or otherwise). This, Dr. Etminan stated, \"suggest[ed] that intracranial hypertension and Mirena use are 'likely\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   related.' \" Etminan Affidavit \u00b6 8 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Notwithstanding these serial retractions, Dr. Plunkett relies on the Etminan study as a whole, including its DPA analysis, as a basis for her finding of a significant statistical association between Mirena usage and IIH.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her report acknowledges Dr. Etminan's letter to the editor stating that the data he reviewed in fact was not statistically significant as to a relationship between Mirena and IIH. Plunkett Rpt. at 27. Her report, however, then proceeds as if Dr. Etminan's repudiation had not occurred. Pressed at her deposition to justify relying on Dr. Etminan's discarded findings, Plunkett vaguely stated that the Etminan study's earlier analysis could be considered as \"part\" of a \"weight of the evidence\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   analysis and that it was \"supportive of [her] overall opinions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plunkett Dep. 146-52;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 152.

But, beyond stating that Dr. Etminan's initial findings could be considered as part of an overall mix, she did not explain on the merits why the repudiated findings warranted rehabilitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Court's assessment, Dr. Plunkett's embrace of these author-repudiated findings is presumptively unsound methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moy\u00e9 Dep. at 283-84 (\"Q: Now, as a matter of epidemiology, would it be appropriate to rely on any part of a paper that was functionally retracted? A: I don't believe so.\"). It is reasonable to expect of an expert who relies upon a study repudiated by its own author to justify coherently this improbable approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Dr. Plunkett did not do so. Defending this component of her analysis in her deposition, Dr. Plunkett embraced anew the results of Etminan's study. She testified that the 1.85 reporting odds ratio used in Dr. Etminan's 2015 disproportionality analysis survived and remained \"a reliable piece of evidence to be used within the weight of the evidence for causation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plunkett Dep. at 138-39. That premise is wrong. In his 2016 affidavit, Dr. Etminan explicitly repudiated the 1.85 reporting odds ratio. He implicitly did so again in his 2017 letter to the editor. There, he made clear that once the subject's reproductive age was taken into account, the reporting odds ratio would change.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Plunkett's uncritical and unwarranted reliance on the Etminan 2015 study in the face of the ultimate red flag-the study author's serial repudiations of it-is not\n   consistent with rigorous dispassionate thinking. It suggests the sort of \"conclusion-driven\" analysis,\n   <em>\n    In re Zoloft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276556\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/787/#p796\">\n    858 F.3d at 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   does not permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   A similar methodological lack of rigor is reflected in Dr. Plunkett's application of Bradford Hill's analogy factor. In finding that the analogy factor supported finding that Mirena causes IIH, Dr. Plunkett, like Dr. Moy\u00e9, centrally analogizes Mirena to Norplant. Plunkett Rpt. at 34-35. But, as Dr. Plunkett conceded in her deposition, she has not concluded that Norplant causes IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plunkett Dep. at 33-34. Nor, as noted earlier, has any existing scholarship reached that conclusion, as various of plaintiffs' other experts conceded.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Darney Dep. at 138. Dr. Plunkett's treatment of the analogy factor, like Dr. Moy\u00e9's, is therefore unsound, insofar as the premise of its analogy is an assumed, not an established, fact. For both of these experts, there is too great an analytic gap between the available data and the conclusion they draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Dr. Plunkett's approach as to the Bradford Hill factor that assesses experimental evidence is also problematic. Like Dr. Moy\u00e9, Dr. Plunkett does not, and given the non-existence of any experiment testing whether Mirena tended to cause IIH, could not point to any such experiment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   To find the experimental evidence factor satisfied, Dr. Plunkett instead, like Dr. Moy\u00e9, turns to examples of purported \"dechallenges.\" Dr. Plunkett does not, however, cite, let alone analyze, any concrete such example. Instead, she cites without comment Bayer's 2015 signal assessment and publications addressing Norplant. Even on Dr. Plunkett's own terms, however, these sources were flawed as a basis for that conclusion, because the \"dechallenge\" examples addressed therein either explicitly were, or potentially were, subject to confounding factors. Bayer's 2015 signal assessment, for example, states that \"[n]o unambiguous case of positive dechallenge could be identified.\" Bayer BfArM Resp. at 49. The writings that Dr. Plunkett cites regarding Norplant are much the same. Sunku's poster presentation recounted two anecdotal examples of dechallenge; in each, the patient was treated with diuretics, supplying an obvious alternative to the removal of the Norplant as an explanation for the resolution of the patient's IIH symptoms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sunku, et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . And Wysowski's study is silent about whether the Norplant removal of the patients that he described coincided with other treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wysowski &amp; Green,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 540. In any event, all the patients addressed by Wysowski for whom weight data was available were overweight, and most were obese.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Like Dr. Moy\u00e9's, Dr. Plunkett's report also departs at points from standards that she acknowledges govern her work. This is exemplified by her discussion of the Bradford Hill factor of temporality. As background, Dr. Plunkett is not a medical doctor. She is not qualified to diagnose IIH or to apply a differential diagnosis to determine what caused a patient's IIH. And in her deposition, she therefore acknowledged that she cannot offer an opinion on why a patient's IIH resolved. Plunkett Dep. at 111, 124, 127-29, 131-35. Rather, she acknowledged that, when considering case reports, she was limited to considering \"what is described by the doctor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126. Dr. Plunkett, however, does not thus confine the analysis in her report. Drawing on Bayer's adverse events database in the course of discussing the Bradford Hill factor of temporality, her report cites three case reports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt, 167-73 (\"Case Report A\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 74 (\"Case Report B\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 75 (\"Case Report C\"). Yet in each, the patient's physician specifically reported that\n   it was\n   <em>\n    unlikely\n   </em>\n   that the patient's apparent \"IIH\" had been caused by the Mirena (or Skyla).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Report A at MIR_JSEU_01057385 (\"Reporter's comment: The event is unlikely related to study medication.\"); Case Report B at MIR_PIEU_157046 (\"original reporter's clinical assessment\" was of \"no relationship\" between the patient's IIH and Mirena); Case Report C at MIR_INDNDA_00473903 (\"The investigator considered the event as not related to study drug and as not related to study conduct.\"). In fact, in Case Report A, the physician did not even specifically diagnose IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Report A at MIR_JSEU_01057384-85. And in Case Report B, the physician stated that the diagnosis was \"very unsure.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Report B at MIR_PIEU_157046. Dr. Plunkett, however, exceeds the boundaries of this source material. In finding the temporality factor met, she goes beyond what the percipient physicians had concluded, notwithstanding her own lack of medical training. This, too, is unsound methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Dr. Plunkett also fails to consider evidence that did not support her opinion. In her discussion of Bradford Hill's biological gradient (dose-response effect) factor, for example, Dr. Plunkett does not consider any data regarding combined oral contraceptives that contain LNG. These contraceptives have total LNG serum levels that are some 20-30 times higher than Mirena. To be sure, Dr. Plunkett asserts in her report and stated in her deposition that the more relevant measure of LNG exposure is the patient's free LNG level, not total LNG serum levels. But Dr. Plunkett does not take the next logical step: to explore the free LNG levels of combined oral contraceptives, which would have permitted her to make a useful comparison between Mirena and these contraceptives, which, as noted, have been found in five epidemiological studies not to cause IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plunkett Dep. 22, 28, 30, 95-96. She instead writes off these products as irrelevant. Dr. Plunkett's decision to liken Mirena to Norplant (as to which no epidemiological studies regarding IIH exist) while ignoring the entire category of LNG-based combined oral contraceptives (which have been studied extensively) is suggestive, too, of an outcome-driven approach, not a search for truth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rezulin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274750\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/531/#p563\">\n    309 F.Supp.2d at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]n expert may not pick and choose from the scientific landscape ....\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   Dr. Plunkett's handling of the Valenzuela study is similarly problematic. Her report cites that study (and its preview in Rai) as support for finding no fewer than three of the nine Bradford Hill criteria: strength of association, Plunkett Rpt. at\n   27; consistency,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274750\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/531/#p563\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; and temporality,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. But the report's citations of that study contain no discussion or analysis of that study. Instead, Dr. Plunkett effectively treats the study,\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   , as affirmatively establishing those criteria. But her report nowhere acknowledges the vital limitation emphasized by the Valenzuela authors: that the study had not controlled for important confounding factors (obesity and recent weight gain) and therefore could not be read as finding causality. Nor did Dr. Plunkett otherwise contend with the fact of these alternative explanations for the IIH symptoms of the patients covered in the Valenzuela study.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plunkett Dep. at 372-75 (admitting she did not know the background rate of IIH among obese women or their relative risk);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Abilify (Aripiprazole) Prods.

Although his report proved methodologically deficient on other grounds, Dr. Moy\u00e9 at least attempts to engage with Valenzuela's caveat about confounding factors, opining that because of the large reporting ratio observed in Valenzuela's Utah population, the correlation between Mirena and IIH was not likely to be confounded. Dr. Plunkett's report makes no such effort. Nor does it advance any scientific argument for why the IIH of the patients in Valenzuela could not equally plausibly be attributed to the non-Mirena factors of obesity and recent weight gain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Finally, Dr. Plunkett's embrace of the \"androgen theory\" of the biological mechanism by which Mirena might cause IIH suffers from severe analytical gaps. As addressed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in connection with Dr. Darney's and Dr. Johanson's proposed testimony, it is not tenable for an expert simply to assume that LNG, a progestin, causes IIH by the same mechanism as androgens (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , testosterone ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brumbaugh v.

Moy\u00e9 and Plunkett, Dr. Wheeler admitted in his deposition that the one study in which an epidemiological relationship between LNG and IIH was demonstrated and not later withdrawn-the Valenzuela study-does not provide evidence of association, given the presence of obvious confounding factors as noted by the study's authors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wheeler Dep. at 200 (\"[T]here's no demonstration of an association. The question is raised, but there is no association demonstrated.\"). Although these proposed experts disagree amongst themselves on whether the Valenzuela study supplies evidence of an association between Mirena and IIH-and although Dr. Wheeler is perhaps to be commended for his candor under oath in disavowing any such association-once Dr. Wheeler conceded the lack of a statistical association, there was no longer a logical charter for him to undertake a Bradford Hill inquiry at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 599, n.141 (3d ed. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   The only other evidence which Dr. Wheeler's report cites in finding Bradford Hill's first factor (\"strength of association\") satisfied are the 115 adverse event reports that he drew from Bayer's 2015 signal assessment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wheeler Rpt. at 39 (\"Additional evidence that Mirena causes or substantially contributes to [IIH] is derived from the collection of 115 cases of women with [IIH] who have a Mirena in place.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35 (\"This is a sizable series of [IIH] patients, especially with any knowledge as to their contraceptive practices.\"). But these case reports-on which Dr. Wheeler relies in his report to satisfy fully five of the nine Bradford Hill factors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-39-are inadequate as a basis upon which to find Bradford Hill's vital first factor, an association demonstrated by epidemiology. As virtually all experts in this case (including Dr. Wheeler) acknowledge, adverse event data primarily serves instead a more limited function-as a tool to generate hypotheses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   And the set of case reports on which Dr. Wheeler relies, without more, certainly do not reveal the required association. An association exists when the rate of a reported condition is greater among the group taking a drug than among the portion of the population not taking that drug. The adverse event reports which Dr. Wheeler cites, however, by definition cannot reveal any such association, because they are silent as to the comparison group: They do not reveal the reporting rate of IIH among the portion of the population not taking Mirena. They do not provide a basis on which Dr. Wheeler can opine as to whether there is an elevated rate at which Mirena patients experience IIH relative to persons without a Mirena inserted-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether there is an association between Mirena and IIH. Dr. Wheeler has not undertaken this inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wheeler Dep. at 221 (\"Q: So you can't tell us whether there is an elevated reporting rate of intracranial hypertension with Mirena users compared to any other group of patients, true?

Ariz. 2001) (\"[I]ndividual case reports and retrospective medical articles summarizing individual case reports are not an adequate basis from which a jury could conclude that Zoloft causes suicide.\"). The adverse event reports made to Bayer reporting an IIH diagnosis were not necessarily filed by a medical professional, as Dr. Wheeler acknowledges. Instead, they were filed by \"someone (clinician, lawyer, nurse, medical student, relative, or consumer themselves).\" Wheeler Rpt. at 21. Of the 115 adverse event reports that Dr. Wheeler cites, 32 were generated by the filing of a lawsuit against Bayer, a fact of which Dr. Wheeler was unaware at the time of his report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   (These 32 appear to have been plaintiffs in the IIH lawsuits later consolidated in this MDL. Today, with more than 850 plaintiffs having joined this litigation since the formation of the MDL and the Court's appointment of lead and liaison counsel for plaintiffs, commensurately more adverse event reports presumably have been recorded by Bayer.) The filing of such lawsuits-and Bayer's required, ministerial act of logging such lawsuits as adverse event reports-is not evidence of causation or association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   Further, even assuming that all 115 case reports on which Dr. Wheeler relied could be credited as true to the extent they reported that the subject both had used Mirena and had experienced IIH symptoms, the observation that the number 115 is \"sizable,\" Wheeler Rpt. at 35, falls short of supporting an epidemiological association between these two facts. More than this absolute number would be needed for this correlation to have such meaning. Such information would include how the 115 reports (as among the broader universe of Mirena users) compared with the incidence of such symptoms in the population generally. It would also include whether the subject cases were subject to confounding factors (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , obesity, recent weight gain) that could supply obvious alternative explanations for the IIH symptoms. In his deposition, Dr. Wheeler acknowledged that Mirena is preferentially prescribed to the precise population with the highest reporting of IIH-obese women of reproductive age.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   Unsurprisingly, then, at his deposition, Dr. Wheeler retracted his report's claim of a statistical association between Mirena and IIH. That claim had been based on\n   two data points-the Valenzuela study and the 115 adverse event reports-neither of which could sustain finding such an association. However, with such an association disclaimed, the vital precondition for embarking on a Bradford Hill analysis was eliminated. This alone warrants exclusion of Dr. Wheeler's testimony under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Independent of his inability to find this gating criterion, Dr. Wheeler's proposed expert testimony report, like that of Dr. Moy\u00e9 and Dr. Plunkett, does not satisfy any of\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   's four core reliability factors: It is untested; it has not been subject to peer review; there is neither an error rate nor are there standards controlling its operation; and his conclusion lacks any acceptance, let alone general acceptance, in the scientific community outside of this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   This requires the Court to carefully scrutinize his methodology, too. Dr. Wheeler's ensuing analysis does not withstand this scrutiny. Rather, as with the two prior experts, Dr. Wheeler's application of the Bradford Hill factors to find that Mirena causes IIH is subject to a series of methodological flaws that independently preclude its admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   These include:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   <em>\n    Lack of weighting or discussion of relationship of factors\n   </em>\n   : Like Drs. Moy\u00e9 and Plunkett, Dr. Wheeler applies the Bradford Hill factors without revealing the weight he attaches to individual factors or addressing the relationship among them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wheeler Rpt. at 35-39. As discussed in connection with Dr. Moy\u00e9, this malleable and vague approach is in tension with first principles under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , because it makes it all too easy for an expert to manipulate the Bradford Hill factors to support a desired conclusion of causation, and far too hard for an ensuing expert to replicate and rigorously test the expert's analytic approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zoloft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276556\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/787/#p796\">\n    858 F.3d at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To ensure that the Bradford Hill/weight of the evidence criteria is truly a methodology, rather than a mere conclusion-oriented selection process ... there must be a scientific method of weighting that is used and explained.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   <em>\n    Generalized assessments of individual factors\n   </em>\n   : In serially reviewing the factors, Dr. Wheeler's report generally pronounces each satisfied. With two exceptions, he does not indicate that the factor was anything more than minimally satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Wheeler Rpt. at 35 (strength of association factor \"is sufficiently demonstrated\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36 (specificity factor \"is sufficiently demonstrated\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (temporality factor \"is satisfied\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 37 (\"[T]here is sufficient information that Biologic Gradient is demonstrated ....\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38 (\"Coherence is satisfied ....\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38 (\"[T]here is sufficient evidence of an Experimental type\" as to experimental evidence factor);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"I conclude Analogy is sufficient to support a causal relationship between LNG-IU[D] and [IIH].\");\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36 (consistency of association is \"particularly well established\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 37 (\"Analysis of Biologic Plausibility definitely favors a causal relationship.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a\n   \"check-box-approach\" to the application of a nine-factor test, too, obscures the expert's weighting of the various factors. For a scholar seeking to replicate and test the expert's work, and to validate or disprove his ultimate conclusion, this minimalist approach inhibits, if it does not preclude altogether, meaningful validation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   <em>\n    Factors conceded to lack evidentiary support\n   </em>\n   : Like Dr. Moy\u00e9, Dr. Wheeler finds that all Bradford Hill factors support a finding of causation, even though, as his deposition testimony revealed, some demonstrably cannot, or cannot non-speculatively, be so viewed. Three examples are illustrative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   As to the first factor, strength of association, as noted, Dr. Wheeler, in his deposition, took back his conclusion that this fact had been \"sufficiently demonstrated.\" Wheeler Dep. at 264-65; Wheeler Rpt. at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   As to the third factor, specificity, Dr. Wheeler's report finds it, too, met, on the basis of the adverse event reports found in 2015 Bayer signal investigation, whose limitations as a basis for positing causation or even epidemiological association are addressed above. Dr. Wheeler's discussion of that factor does not address the alternative demonstrated and/or theorized causes and risk factors for IIH. This is so even though elsewhere in his report Dr. Wheeler acknowledges the confounding factors (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , obesity ) that outside this litigation have prevented all scholars (including the Valenzuela study authors) from isolating Mirena as a cause of IIH.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-24. In his deposition, Dr. Wheeler agreed that the Valenzuela study merely \"raises the question of an increased risk of IIH with Mirena, but does not establish an association.\" Wheeler Dep. at 190;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9099159\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/275/672/#p681\">\n    275 F.Supp.2d at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Opinions merely expressing 'possibilities' do not suffice to support the admissibility of expert testimony.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   And, as to the eighth factor, experimental evidence, Dr. Wheeler's statements are internally contradictory. His report acknowledges the lack of any such actual experimental evidence, explaining that practical considerations made this factor \"impossible to satisfy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. Yet in his tally of the nine factors, Dr. Wheeler, rather than treating this factor as null, ultimately opines that it, too, was supported by \"sufficient evidence,\" in the form of a \"relatively small\" sample of \"dechallenge\" cases reported by clinicians.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   <em>\n    Unsubstantiated assumptions about Norplant and the Norplant/Jadelle labeling\n   </em>\n   : As to two of its foundational factual propositions, both involving Norplant, Dr. Wheeler's report departs from sound methodology by assuming facts that have nowhere been established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   First, on the apparent premise that LNG-based implant Norplant has been found to cause IIH, Dr. Wheeler, in finding various Bradford Hill factors met, repeatedly analogizes Mirena to Norplant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Wheeler Rpt. at 35 (consistency of association);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36 (specificity);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 37 (coherence). However, as reviewed above, no epidemiological study has so found as to Norplant, Jadelle, or any other LNG-based contraceptive. The data that exists as to these different (and higher-LNG) products is limited to case reports that have not been controlled for potential confounders. To the extent that Dr. Wheeler's anticipated testimony is built on an analogy to products that he only assumes to be associated with or causal of IIH, it, like the reports of Drs. Moy\u00e9 and Plunkett, starts from an unsound premise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   Second, and relatedly, on the premise that the Jadelle and Norplant labels bespeak a predicate finding of causation of IIH, Dr. Wheeler repeatedly cites these\n   labels as fortifying his claim of Mirena's causation of that condition and as supporting finding certain Bradford Hill factors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Wheeler Rpt. at 35 (\"[T]he association of [IIH] and LNG was sufficiently consistent with other LNG-containing devices to be included in the Product Information brochure of LNG implants Norplant and Jadelle.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36 (\"[T]he Product Information regarding [IIH] risk with Norplant and Jadelle adds to the finding of sufficient specificity to strengthen a causal relationship between LNG-IU[D] and [IIH].\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, on their faces, these labels, which for Norplant dated to 1993, establish nothing of the kind. They state only that: \"There have been reports of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension in NORPLANT SYSTEM users.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 1997 Norplant Label at 00055901; Fraunfelder Rpt. at 15 (noting similar Jadelle label); Plunkett Rpt. at 9 n.7 (same). This statement reveals only the existence of historical case reports. In his deposition, Dr. Wheeler conceded that he has no idea about the origin of the information about IIH in the Norplant warning label. Wheeler Dep. 163, 266. Absent a factual basis to assume that the manufacturer's decision to include the Norplant or Jadelle labels reflected evidence bearing on causation-as opposed to a prudent means of guarding against legal risk by a manufacturer alerted to case reports-Dr. Wheeler has no basis to rely on these labels as supporting his finding of causation. This pillar of his Bradford Hill analysis, too, is based on unacceptable speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   <em>\n    Speculative androgen theory\n   </em>\n   : In finding the factor of biological plausibility met, Dr. Wheeler opines that it is \"more likely than not\" that IIH is caused by sex hormones including androgens and that it is biologically plausible \"that LNG from Mirena could cause [IIH] as an androgenic side effect.\" Wheeler Rpt. at 37-38 (\"Analysis of Biologic Plausibility definitely favors a causal relationship.\"). Bayer counters that Dr. Wheeler's conclusion to this effect is unduly speculative. Although aspects of Bayer's critique conflate issues of factual persuasiveness reserved for the trier of fact with issues of admissibility under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , the Court is persuaded that Dr. Wheeler's theory is sufficiently grounded in conjecture and guesswork to make his testimony on this point unreliable as a matter of law. In his deposition, Dr. Wheeler was not able to identify any peer-reviewed publication establishing his androgen theory, nor any presentation to this effect at a scientific conference supportive of this theory. Wheeler Dep. at 132. He testified that it was \"too early\" for any support to be published.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143 (\"[T]oo early. Hasn't been done.\"). And while there is scientific evidence that LNG has androgenic effects, LNG itself is a progestin, not an androgen. All of the articles on which Dr. Wheeler relies, however, involve androgens. None involve progestins, let alone LNG.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wheeler Dep. at 140, 147 (sources cited do not involve progestins, LNG, or Mirena );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 142 (LNG a progestin, not an androgen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Under these circumstances, Dr. Wheeler's theory as to the Bradford Hill factor of biologic plausibility relies on too many unsupported leaps. To permit Dr. Wheeler to testify to his theory of causation would invite the jury to guess as to the validity of a novel and untested theory based essentially on his say-so. \"[T]he\n   courtroom is not the place for scientific guesswork, even of the most inspired sort.

In 2010, a case report described a patient who developed PTC while on Mirena, although with a somewhat atypical presentation. In 2015, two important pieces of literature were also published. Etminan et al. generated an ROR for Mirena at 1.78, and also attempted to evaluate the impact of confounders to yield statistically significant results with Bayesian analysis. Etminan et al. also performed a cohort analysis and found that risk of PTC was similar to norgestimate, while norethindrone had a lower risk associated with the use. These findings could suggest a possible class effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-320\">\n   In addition to these useful findings, Rai et al. published an abstract with Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (\"ARVO\"), indicating that they had obtained extremely significant results in a cohort study comparing PTC patients to non-PTC patients. Their symptoms were similar, and the authors ensured that only cases where PTC developed while the patient was using Mirena were counted. They were not significantly different from the non-users in terms of known confounders BMI, age, or recent weight gain.

First, he reviews reports relating to three patients from among the subjects included in Mirena's clinical trials for safety: (1) a 2001 case involving a 23-year-old woman of normal body weight who was diagnosed with diplopia and chronic papilledema but never, it appears, IIH; (2) a case dating to 2008 of a 37-year-old obese woman who was diagnosed with IIH; and (3) a case dating to 2009 of a 17-year-old woman of normal body weight (or possibly slightly overweight) who had first been diagnosed with IIH in 2009, had a Mirena inserted in 2012, and thereafter experienced IIH symptoms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-19. Dr. Fraunfelder's report also lists a number of cases drawn from Bayer's signal assessments that he describes as examples of dechallenges-where IIH symptoms abated after the removal of a Mirena. He identifies four cases of \"unambiguous dechallenge\"; eight of \"positive dechallenge\" (where some recovery by the patient was noted); three where the \"patient was recovering while receiving treatment\"; and five where, among conflicting data, some was suggestive of dechallenge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23. At his deposition, Dr. Fraunfelder admitted, however, that the cases he cited, including those he called \"unambiguous dechallenge,\" were subject to possible confounding variables.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fraunfelder Dep. at 428-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Finally, Dr. Fraunfelder's report notes that over the past several decades, medical literature has increasingly noted an association between LNG and IIH and raised the question whether LNG causes IIH. \"In practice,\" he notes, \"physicians often look to the medical literature when identifying potential causes of disease in patients.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Analysis Under\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   Dr. Fraunfelder's proposed testimony amounts to a blend of disparate items that he contends together show that Mirena causes IIH. Unlike Drs. Moy\u00e9, Plunkett, and Wheeler, Dr. Fraunfelder does not purport to use the flexible Bradford Hill methodology to guide his analysis. Instead, his approach consists of listing factors that he argues support this conclusion. Beyond its non-replicable mode of analysis, Dr. Fraunfelder's handling of individual items has hallmarks of unreliability-some shared with other proposed expert witnesses, others unique to Dr. Fraunfelder. His proposed testimony falls short of\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   's standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   At the outset, like the testimony of the three preceding witnesses, Dr. Fraunfelder's proposed testimony fails to meet any of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   reliability factors. His opinion that Mirena causes IIH has not been tested; it has not been subjected to peer review; it has no known error rate and there are no standards controlling its operation; and it has not been generally accepted by the scientific community. His analysis, developed in the course of litigation, therefore merits a \"hard look.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   Dr. Fraunfelder's handling of virtually every one of the individual items on which he relies is, however, methodologically suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   The Court considers, first, Dr. Fraunfelder's handling of the repudiated Etminan study. In his report, Dr. Fraunfelder-tracking\n   his 2016 report-placed substantial weight on Etminan's disproportionality analysis, effectively brushing aside, or at best scarcely weighting, its author's 2017 repudiation of it. Clinging to a study finding that has been explicitly renounced by its own author is methodologically dubious, to say the least. It suggests a commitment to advocacy over scientific rigor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bextra &amp; Celebrex Mktg. Sales Practices &amp; Prods. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5611640\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/524/1166/#p1176\">\n    524 F.Supp.2d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1176 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (\"[R]ejecting or ignoring\" unfavorable evidence \"is not 'good science' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   Beyond this shortcoming, Dr. Fraunfelder, in seeking to rehabilitate the Etminan study's DPA analysis, overlooks the flaw in that study that ultimately led Dr. Etminan himself to correct his methodology and repudiate its initial finding. As noted above, Dr. Fraunfelder objects to Dr. Etminan's decision in the course of correcting that study in 2017 to exclude patients within the LNG-IUD group as to whom age data was lacking. Dr. Fraunfelder notes that, inasmuch as most women using a Mirena IUD are presumably of reproductive age, excluding Mirena patients for whom age data was lacking may have not been strictly necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   That critique is coherent. But in training his critique on this narrow point, Dr. Fraunfelder misses the bigger picture: The reason why a corrective was necessary lest the Etminan DPA analysis be methodologically unsound. As diagnosed by Dr. Friedman and belatedly admitted by Dr. Etminan, there was a gaping design flaw in the Etminan study's DPA analysis: It did not exclude women of non-reproductive age from the control group. The FAERS database includes data related to all kinds of drugs, most of which (unlike Mirena ) are not earmarked for reproductive-age women, the group all but uniquely at risk for IIH. By failing to limit his control group to reproductive age women (and by using an experimental group that was\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   limited to reproductive age women), Etminan's DPA study was subject to a severe sample bias. This compromised its results. Dr. Etminan's 2017 correctives attempted to redress that defect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Etminan Affidavit \u00b6 6 (\"[A] proper analysis would be limited to women of reproductive age.\"). The result of these correctives was to eliminate the statistical basis for inferring Mirena's causation of IIH. The corrected data showed \"no elevated [risk] for Mirena, suggesting that intracranial hypertension and Mirena use are 'likely not related.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 (\"[N]either of the analyses in the article provide evidence that Mirena use increases the risk for intracranial hypertension.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   Dr. Fraunfelder's expert report does not grapple with this methodological deficiency at the heart of the DPA analysis on which he relies-despite the fact that by the date of his report (December 23, 2017), he had access not only to Dr. Friedman's critique of Etminan's DPA study but also to Dr. Etminan's letter and affidavit repudiating the study's methodology and outcome. And, when confronted at his deposition with the Etminan study's design flaw, Dr. Fraunfelder reaffirmed his reliance on the DPA study as supporting his finding that Mirena use likely causes IIH. To be sure, Dr. Fraunfelder eventually admitted that the Etminan study had less value than he had initially assigned it. But Dr. Fraunfelder continued to make the repudiated study a basis for his opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fraunfelder Dep. at 268 (stating that he relies on Etminan to \"a very small amount\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 318 (\"I think that his first paper has some validity.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 331 (\"I put his paper low on the evidence scale as far as the data I used to form my opinion.\"). As another plaintiffs' expert has recognized, reliance on analysis that has been repudiated by its\n   author is bad science.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moy\u00e9 Dep. at 137-38, 283-84 (agreeing, in response to questions from both plaintiffs' and defense counsel, that Etminan had functionally retracted his DPA analysis and that it would be inappropriate as a matter of epidemiology to rely on a paper that had been functionally retracted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   Dr. Fraunfelder's continued embrace of Etminan's repudiated DPA analysis is, further, methodologically suspect in that Dr. Fraunfelder attaches little to no weight to the other half of Etminan's study: the retrospective cohort portion of its analysis, which has never been retracted. And the retrospective cohort study did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   find a statistically significant difference between the risk for IIH among individuals using Mirena and those using two types of oral contraceptives, EE-norethindrone and EE-norgestimate. Dr. Fraunfelder's selectivity-in which he embraces the spoiled half of Etminan's 2015 study while disregarding the unspoiled half-strongly suggests outcome bias, if not a predetermined outcome. Without a good explanation for this counter-intuitive approach, the Court finds it unreliable and inconsistent with rigorous scientific inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rezulin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970767\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/369/398/#p420\">\n    369 F.Supp.2d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (excluding experts who \"selectively chose [their] support from the scientific landscape\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   This lapse was not anomalous. Dr. Fraunfelder's report elsewhere chooses not to engage with consequential evidence contrary to his outcome. Like plaintiffs' first three experts-who referenced Norplant in applying the Bradford Hill analogy factor-Dr. Fraunfelder's report likens Mirena to Norplant. Dr. Fraunfelder uses these analogies to support both his claim that Mirena, ostensibly like Norplant, causes IIH, and his conclusion-subsidiary to his mechanism opinion-that IIH is related to sex hormones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fraunfelder Rpt. at 5-6. Yet, like Drs. Moy\u00e9, Plunkett, and Wheeler, Dr. Fraunfelder does not consider another analogy that was in plain sight: to combined oral contraceptives. Dr. Fraunfelder's report acknowledges that an association between oral contraceptives and IIH has been \"largely disproven.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. Such contraceptives, too, involve synthetic sex hormones. But Dr. Fraunfelder does not consider what the studies exonerating IIH-heavy oral contraceptives might signify as to whether Mirena causes IIH. Dr. Fraunfelder's decision not to grapple with these studies is all the more dubious given his reliance on lesser evidence (case reports) related to Norplant and mortally compromised evidence (the initial Etminan DPA study) as to Mirena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   In the same vein, in his consideration of the Valenzuela study, Dr. Fraunfelder fails to consider the alternative, and benign, explanations that that study identified for the correlation it found between Mirena and IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rezulin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970767\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/369/398/#p420\">\n    369 F.Supp.2d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A factor that courts have considered in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analyses is whether an expert has accounted adequately for obvious alternative explanations.\");\n   <em>\n    U.S. Info.

Dec. 29, 2015) (explaining that an expert must address \"obvious alternative causes\") (emphasis omitted) ). The Valenzuela study, by its own account, did not control for the widely accepted IIH risk factors of obesity and recent weight gain; for that reason, the study disclaimed any finding that Mirena caused IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   Dr. Fraunfelder's report, however, pays only lip service to Valenzuela's caveat about confounders. It nowhere reveals that the Valenzuela study had not controlled for\n   obesity or recent weight gain, as Dr. Fraunfelder later acknowledged at his deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fraunfelder Dep. at 171-72. Instead, his report treats the correlation Valenzuela found-and the fact that Valenzuela did not rule out Mirena as an IIH cause-as if such were affirmative evidence of causation. It concludes: \"[E]ven considering the possibility of confounding by other risk factors, a causative or contributory role for LNG cannot be excluded from a differential diagnosis, even accounting for the possibility of confounders.\" Fraunfelder Rep. at 12. Despite deploying the Valenzuela study as positive evidence supporting his causation conclusion, Dr. Fraunfelder does not attempt independently to examine the data underlying that study. He does not, for example, attempt to perform a corrected analysis of Valenzuela to try to account for obesity or recent weight gain. And Dr. Fraunfelder's casual treatment of isolated patient case studies does not, and by the nature of case studies could not, close this methodological hole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   Dr. Fraunfelder, finally, makes his mechanism opinion an important component of his expert report. But at his deposition, he repeatedly distanced himself from it-indeed, he repudiated any mechanism opinion as beyond his expertise. The removal of that pillar alone is fatal to Dr. Fraunfelder's weight of the evidence analysis. In any event, had Dr. Fraunfelder not repudiated his mechanism opinion, the Court would have found-as was inescapable-that he is not qualified to offer it.

Proposed Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   Dr. Darney's opinion, unlike those of the four earlier discussed experts, predominantly concerns a mechanism by which IIH is caused. He embraces the \"androgen theory\" by which Mirena purportedly causes IIH-specifically, that androgens may cause IIH and, that, because LNG, while a progestin, has androgenic effects, LNG in turn may cause IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   Before this litigation, Dr. Darney had not published on or addressed any relationship between Mirena and IIH. He has recommended-and continues to recommend-Mirena to his patients, though he states he no longer recommends it to \"those who are androgen sensitive.\" Darney Dep. at 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   Dr. Darney has published on Mirena generally, and has addressed its side effects (some of which are considered androgenic in nature, like a reduction in acne).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   In a 2002 article, for example, Dr. Darney endorsed Mirena: Mirena, he wrote, \"is the most effective form of reversible contraception currently available, even more effective than female sterilization.\" Eleanor A. Drey &amp; Philip D. Darney,\n   <em>\n    Recent Developments in Hormonal Contraception\n   </em>\n   , 3 Reviews in Endocrine &amp; Metabolic Disorders 257, 261 (2002) (Dkt. 167-24). In that same publication, Dr. Darney stated that \"[Mirena ] causes few hormonal adverse effects,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , although he did identify a 2002 clinical monograph in which a colleague suggested, in a different publication, that women using the LNG-based implant Jadelle should have it removed if they experience papilledema.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Darney Rpt. at 22; Irving Sivin, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Jadelle Levonorgestrel Rod Implants: A Summary of Scientific Data and Lessons Learned from Programmatic Experience\n   </em>\n   , Population Council (2002), http://www.respondproject.org/pages/files/4_result_areas/Result_1_Global_Learning/LA_PM_CoP/june2009-launch/Jadelle-Levonorgestrel-Rod-Implants.pdf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   In a 2011 book, Dr. Darney addressed the issue of androgenic effects of LNG-based IUDs: \"Sufficient progestin reaches the systemic circulation from the levonorgestrel-containing IU[D] so that androgenic\n   side effects, such as acne and hirsutism, can occur. However, in one study no change could be detected in the circulating levels of sex hormone binding globulin [\"SHBG\"] and, therefore, marked clinical effects are unlikely.\" Leon Speroff &amp; Philip D. Darney,\n   <em>\n    A Clinical Guide for Contraception\n   </em>\n   239, 253 (2011 5th ed.) (Dkt. 167-62). In the same article, Dr. Darney stated that \"there is little reason to suspect a cause-and-effect relationship\" between Norplant and IIH.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 195.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   In this litigation, Dr. Darney articulates new conclusions. He opines, for the first time, that an LNG-based product may have the capacity to cause IIH. The central thesis of his expert report is that \"[i]n susceptible individuals, relatively high unbound LNG concentrations can cause, or be a substantial contributing factor in causing intracranial hypertension /pseudotumor cerebri (IH/PTC).\" For this purpose, Dr. Darney defines \"susceptible individuals\" narrowly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Darney Rpt. at 5; Darney Dep. at 296.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   This opinion, Dr. Darney states, derives from linking four distinct propositions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-359\">\n   1. Levonorgestrel (LNG) is a potent androgenic progestin (gestagen, progestogen).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-360\">\n   2. Intrauterine delivery, compared to other routes, e.g., oral, subdermal and transdermal, results in wide intra- and inter-individual serum concentrations of LNG.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-361\">\n   3. Individual women vary greatly in their physiologic reactions to LNG, regardless of the route of administration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-362\">\n   4. In susceptible individuals, relatively high unbound LNG concentrations can cause, or be a substantial contributing factor in causing, intracranial hypertension /pseudotumor cerebri (IIH/PTC).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   Darney Rpt. at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   The Court recaps Dr. Darney's proposed testimony as to each of these propositions. The instant\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   litigation focuses on the fourth of these propositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   <em>\n    LNG is a potent androgenic progestin\n   </em>\n   : In support of this first proposition, Dr. Darney describes certain properties of LNG. It is a synthetic progestin that is derived from testosterone. And, like other synthetic progestins derived from testosterone, it has had removed from its chemical structure the element carbon 19, present in testosterone, \"in order to change the major hormonal effect from androgenic to progestogenic [while] retain[ing] varying degrees of androgenic activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   Dr. Darney further states that three factors affect the androgenicity of a sex steroid: its ability to bind to the relevant receptors, its effects on SHBG, and the degree to which it binds to SHBG.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   As to the first factor, LNG, he states, \"is the most potent and androgenic of the progestins used in contraceptives.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Dr. Darney notes that-as is undisputed-LNG can and does bond to androgen receptors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Dr. Darney acknowledges that LNG's affinity for such receptors is still only 22% of that of the androgen standard, dihydrotestosterone (\"DHT\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. LNG's androgen-to-progestin\n   receptor bonding ratio (\"A/P ratio\"), used to judge a progestin's likelihood of causing androgenic effects, is 11. That is substantially lower than of the next most androgenic progestin (which has a 28 A/P ratio), but substantially higher than that of the androgenic progrestin DHT (which has only a 0.02 A/P ratio).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   As to the second factor, Dr. Darney states, \"LNG is known to decrease SHBG over time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Oral administration of LNG alone results in an approximately 50% decrease in SHBG; \"a mean decline of about 30% [in SHBG] was seen up to 6 months after insertion of Mirena in 10 healthy young women.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This result is important, he states, because \"a decrease in SHBG means that a higher proportion of circulating androgens are 'free' and available for binding to androgen receptors resulting in androgenic side effects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   As to the third factor, involving the degree to which LNG binds with SHBG, Dr. Darney states that LNG does so \"with high specificity\" and \"affinity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But, he acknowledges, LNG's affinity to SHBG is only 50% of that of endogenous DHT, and 13% that of (presumably non-endogenous) DHT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Darney asserts that, when LNG binds to SHBG, it prevents endogenous androgens from doing the same, leaving them \"free\" to activate androgen receptors and cause IIH.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Studies involving Norplant, Dr. Darney states, have \"found resultant increase in circulating androgens.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   As a result of these factors, Dr. Darney opines, \"androgenic side effects of LNG can be expected even at low doses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Darney states that concerns about the androgenic effects of LNG have led Bayer to work to develop new synthetic progestins and to release new products, such as Skyla and Kyleena with lower rates of expected LNG release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   <em>\n    Intra-uterine delivery results in wide variations in serum concentration of LNG\n   </em>\n   : In support of his second proposition, that intrauterine delivery \"results in wide intra- and inter-individual serum concentrations of LNG,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, Dr. Darney focuses on the \"profound effects\" of LNG on the structure of the endometrium, the layer of epithelial cells in the uterus. \"These changes include: the appearance of prominent, dilated surface vessels, and cytoplasmic contraction, increased electron density, and plasmolemmal vesicles of the capillaries. Endometrial veins are also increased and dilated ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because LNG can affect the endometrium, Dr. Darney states, it \"provides a much less stable network for drug absorption than subdermal (for implant contraception) or intestinal (for oral contraception ) vasculature networks that are not primarily modulated by sex hormones.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. \"Hence, systemic LNG concentrations from intrauterine delivery systems like Mirena are much less predictable and stable than those from subdermal or oral administration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Comparative studies, Dr. Darney states, show that LNG concentrations vary more when IUDs are used than with other forms of LNG-based contraception.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17. And, the same individual may experience substantial variability with an LNG-based IUD. A Japanese study demonstrated, anecdotally, that some women had higher LNG levels after six months than after one month despite the anticipated decline in the release of LNG.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-372\">\n   <em>\n    Wide range of physiological reactions to LNG\n   </em>\n   : In support of his third proposition, that women vary in their physiological reactions to LNG, Dr. Darney makes several points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   First, he asserts, it is important to consider concentrations of circulating SHBG and the resultant levels of free LNG when assessing LNG's effects (including its androgenic\n   ones). That is because \"only the free or unbound hormone is available for receptor binding and cellular expression.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. The more circulating SHBG there is to which LNG can bind, the less free LNG there is. And because \"LNG is\n   <em>\n    so\n   </em>\n   highly bound to SHBG,\" he states, \"small changes in binding ... may have important implications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   (\"A decrease in the relative distribution of bound LNG from 98% to 96% would result in a doubling of the unbound fraction from 2% to 4% and, hence, greatly increase the probability of untoward hyperandrogenic effects.\"). Second, two factors have been shown to result in a decrease in circulating SHBG levels: (1) the \"relatively high initial release rate of LNG from Mirena\" (which results in an approximate 30% decrease in SHBG levels)\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) obesity (which results in a decrease in baseline SHBG levels up to 50%).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. Third, some women may be more sensitive to sex hormones than others. As to that point, he cites a study involving hirsutism (\"condition of unwanted, male-pattern hair growth in women\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), his clinical observations of acne and hair loss among women using LNG-based contraceptives of all types, and studies comparing LNG-containing IUDs that showed smaller such adverse effects among users of lower-dose IUDs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   <em>\n    In susceptible individuals, high unbound LNG may contribute to IIH\n   </em>\n   : Dr. Darney's fourth and most consequential proposition, that LNG can cause or substantially contribute to IIH in susceptible persons under certain circumstances, is based on twin premises: that androgens cause IIH; and that LNG, as a progestin with androgenic side effects or qualities, similarly does so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   In support of this proposition, Dr. Darney relies on an article by Charles J. Glueck, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, polycystic-ovary syndrome, and thrombophilia\n   </em>\n   , 145 J. Lab. Clin. Med. 72 (2005) (Dkt. 167-34) (\"Glueck\"). Darney Rpt. at 21. Glueck had reviewed case studies of 65 women diagnosed with IIH. Thirty-seven, all obese, had polycystic-ovary syndrome (\"PCOS\"), a condition diagnosed when a patient experiences two of three symptoms: (1) irregular periods, (2) excess androgen, and (3) polycystic ovaries, which become \"enlarged and contain follicles that surround the eggs\" causing abnormal ovary function.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Glueck's study, Dr. Darney opines, \"provides a biologically plausible explanation of the association of PCOS with PTC through thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis,\" conditions which some of the 37 had, as LNG can cause \"androgenic side effects like acne and hirsutism,\n   which are also the most common findings in PCOS women.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   At his deposition, however, while noting that PCOS patients develop IIH at a higher rate than patients without PCOS, Dr. Darney acknowledged that the Glueck study had not concluded that the high levels of androgens in PCOS patients cause IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Darney Dep. at 247. To the contrary, that study hypothesized that a different hormone, estrogen, might cause IIH, or that PCOS-driven morbid obesity might be responsible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Glueck,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 76 (\"The increased prevalence of PCOS in women with IIH may reflect PCOS-driven morbid obesity, which in turn facilitates the development of IIH.\" (internal citations omitted) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[P]aradoxically high levels of endogenous estrogens, common in PCOS and in severe obesity... may play a role in the development of IIH ....\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 72 (\"We speculated that PCOS, associated with obesity and extreme obesity in adolescence and young adulthood, is a treatable promoter of IIH.\"). When confronted with these aspects of the Glueck study, Dr. Darney retreated from his earlier characterization of that study. He asserted that a link between androgens and IIH \"may[ ]be the understanding of the author,\" Darney Dep. at 249, and stated that the study had an \"implication for something [the link between androgens and IIH] that's not yet well understood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 251.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   In the final two pages of his report, Dr. Darney cites a series of other writings. He cites a \"2013 study,\" Ainat Klein, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Hyperandrogenism is associated with earlier age of onset of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in women\n   </em>\n   , 38 Current Eye Research 972 (2013) (Dkt. 167-40). Dr. Darney cites this study for the proposition that circulating androgens \"were clearly linked to an early age of onset of IIH.\" Darney Rpt. at 22. He cites Connar Westgate, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Evaluating the role of testosterone in cerebrospinal fluid secretion\n   </em>\n   , 50 Endocrine Abstracts P325 (2017) (Dkt. 167-66), for the proposition that \"women with increased secretion of CSF also have high androgen levels.\" Darney Rpt. at 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Darney Dep. at 256-58 (discussing Westgate). In fact, as Dr. Darney acknowledged in his deposition, the Westgate abstract did not so establish, or even test the relationship between androgen levels and CSF. It instead recounted an\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   study of the effect of testosterone on rats' choroid plexus cells-the choroid plexus being the area of the brain that produces CSF. From that, Westgate \"speculate[d] that testosterone may have a pathogenic role in IIH though modulation of CSF formation and increasing [intercranial pressure].\" Darney Dep. at 258\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   Dr. Darney, finally, cites sources which some or all of the earlier experts addressed: the Valenzuela study, the notation on the Norplant and Jadelle labels to the effect that there had been reports of IIH among users of these products, Bayer's BfArM response, and certain case studies (as to Mirena, the Martinez and Ros Forteza case studies; and as to Norplant, the Wysowski and Green case study).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. In describing Valenzuela as \"f[inding] a significantly greater risk among women who used or were using Mirena,\" Dr. Darney, like Dr. Fraunfelder, does not acknowledge that the Valenzuela study had not controlled for obesity or recent weight gain, or that it had disclaimed any finding of causation of IIH by Mirena.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. In his deposition, however, Dr. Darney acknowledged these points, Darney Dep. 184, and that a study \"would have to control for [body mass index], female gender, and age, in order to conclude that Mirena is associated with IIH,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 165.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis Under\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   Dr. Darney is the first of plaintiffs' experts who does not base his opinion largely on an assessment of study and case report data bearing on the relationship (if any) between Mirena and IIH. Instead, Dr. Darney articulates a mechanism theory: In an opinion articulated for the first time in his report in this litigation, he opines that \"relatively high unbound LNG concentrations can cause\" IIH in \"susceptible women\" through \"androgenic side effects.\" Darney Rpt. at 5, 21-24; Darney Dep. at 295-96 (defining \"susceptible women\" as women with a history of androgenic side effects, such as acne). This theory, however, does not withstand\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   As a threshold consideration, Dr. Darney's theory that Mirena causes IIH through androgenic side effects does not satisfy any of the four\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   reliability factors. First, he has not tested it in a direct experiment, an epidemiological study, or a clinical trial. And Dr. Darney does not claim that such testing would be impossible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Dr. Darney's androgen-based theory, in the absence of such testing, does not have a known error rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mirena Perforation/Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343001\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/396/#p427\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that expert's \"theory of second perforation has not been tested, and therefore has no known error rate\"). Third, Dr. Darney has not published his opinion in the peer-reviewed literature or anywhere outside of his expert report. On the contrary, Dr. Darney's prior writings minimizing Mirena's side effects, and his longstanding practice of prescribing Mirena, are in tension with his new opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Darney Dep. at 235 (testifying he has not \"written these opinions ... anywhere other than [his] expert report\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 202 (testifying that none of his publications mention a concern about Mirena being associated with IIH);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 94-95 (testifying that resources offered to patients and providers through his research organization do not mention IIH).

While Bayer's critiques are valid, before addressing them, the Court discerns a broader overarching lapse of methodology affecting Dr. Darney's mechanism opinion: Dr. Darney's expert report scarcely addresses IIH. His limited discussion of the disease, Darney Rpt. at 21-23, at no point engages with the threshold issue of what IIH is and how this condition comes about. In venturing a mechanism theory as to Mirena's purported causation of IIH, Dr. Darney does not explain the most fundamental proposition about IIH: that it is caused by the build-up of CSF in the brain resulting in an increase in intracranial pressure. And he does not acknowledge, let alone address, the unresolved debate about whether IIH is caused by CSF's over-production or under-absorption or both, despite the fact that that the debate over this unsettled question is identified by the sources he cites.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Westgate,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at P325 (\"The etiology [of IIH] is poorly understood but involves imbalance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion and absorption.... We hypothesise that obesity and androgen excess may be pathogenic in IIH through dysregulation of CSF secretion.\");\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Glueck,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 72 (\"Our hypothesis: IIH results in part from inadequate drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resulting from thrombotic obstruction to CSF resorption-outflow ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   In theorizing based on a syllogistic construct why a \"potent androgenic progestin\" might cause IIH in \"susceptible individuals\" who have \"relatively high unbound LNG concentrations,\" Darney Rpt. at 5, Dr. Darney gives scant attention to the actual pharmacokinetic process that must underlie the causal sequence that he postulates. He does not identify the androgen receptors in the human body with which LNG supposedly bonds to trigger the biological pathway that, on his theory, causes the over-production and/or the under-absorption of CSF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   He does not explain, once such bonding to an androgen receptor has occurred, the ensuing process that ostensibly triggers this overproduction and/or underabsorption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   Dr. Darney's silences on these points-about the mechanics of IIH, and about the basic operation of the \"mechanism\" and \"pathway\" that he posits link Mirena to this rare disease-are non-trivial lacunas. For a litigation expert who advances a novel conceptual theory as to the cause and the mechanism of a disease, they are failures of methodology. Presented with Dr. Darney's general causation syllogism and no more, a jury would be left, unhelpfully, with Dr. Darney's bare assumption that some such biological pathway must exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   It is true that, where more than a correlation between a product and a disease\n   has been shown, it may be appropriate for an expert as to general causation to opine that a biological pathway exists but is not well understood.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

But this is a far cry from such a case. As reviewed above-and as the Valenzuela study on which plaintiffs heavily rely states as an explicit caveat-scholarship has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   shown more than a correlation, subject to identifiable confounders, between Mirena and IIH. In these circumstances, it is not enough for a mechanism expert to assume\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   a biological pathway between a posited cause and effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   Independent of Dr. Darney's failure to engage with the biology of IIH, Bayer, as noted, faults his report for the speculative \"leaps\" it makes in support of his two central premises: that androgens can cause IIH, and that LNG, a progestin with androgen receptor affinity, can cause IIH. The Court holds with Bayer on both points: For the reasons that follow, as to each premise, Dr. Darney's conclusion lacks a reliable foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   First, as to the premise that androgens cause IIH, Dr. Darney does not cite any article that so concludes. Instead he cites, or refers to without explicitly citing, several articles that speculate or hypothesize about the role of androgens in IIH. These include the Glueck, Klein, and Westgate studies discussed earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   The Glueck and Klein studies identified some possible characteristics of patients already diagnosed with IIH. These studies did not attempt to, nor did they find, any definitive causal link between those characteristics and IIH. And the design of both studies-case series of patients who were diagnosed with IIH, with no control group-would not permit this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   Notably, neither the Glueck nor the Klein study concluded (or even speculated) that androgens specifically cause IIH. The authors of the Glueck study hypothesized that the number of patients with PCOS, a condition often characterized by excess androgen, might indicate a relationship between IIH and obesity or estrogen. At no point did they state that androgens were in fact related to IIH. At his deposition, Dr. Darney conceded that the Glueck study only \"suggests an implication\" of a causal relationship between androgens and IIH. Darney Dep. at 251.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   The Klein study also did not conclude that androgens cause IIH. It found that \"circulating androgens ... originating in either the ovaries or the adrenal cortex, were clearly linked to an early age of onset of IIH.\" Klein,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 975. Based on this finding, the Klein study notes that one might \"speculate ... that in women susceptible to the evolution of IIH, increased circulating androgens might function as a precipitating factor allowing earlier expression of the disease.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). However, the Klein study does not purport to establish such a causal role.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Accutane Prods. Liab.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202496444\">\n    2009 WL 2496444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"[W]hen an expert relies on the studies of others, he must not exceed the limitations the authors themselves place on the study.\");\n   <em>\n    In re Mirena Perforation/Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343001\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/396/#p427\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   Dr. Darney also overstates the findings of the Westgate study. Dr. Darney states that Westgate \"observ[ed] that women with increased secretion of CSF also have high androgen levels.\" Darney Rpt. at 22. But the Westgate study did not so observe. It did not study women specifically, let alone receive or evaluate data on women's\n   (or men's) androgen levels. Westgate studied rats, not women-specifically, choroid plexus cells in rats. At the conclusion of his abstract, Westgate merely \"\n   <em>\n    hypothesise[d]\n   </em>\n   that obesity and androgen excess\n   <em>\n    may be\n   </em>\n   pathogenic in IIH through dysregulation of CSF secretion and hence [IIH].\" Westgate,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at P325 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   Apart from assigning undue weight to propositions that the studies upon which he relies present as mere hypotheses, Dr. Darney fails to explain how the inferences from these studies, or others, separately or concatenated, support that IIH is caused by androgens. The most apposite of the three above studies is Westgate. It at least speculated about a relationship between androgens and IIH. It performed an\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   experiment to test that proposition: an immortalized choroid plexus cell line (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a cell line, not in a live rat) was incubated with testosterone, a potent androgen,\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   and an increase in a measure related to CSF secretion was observed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Westgate,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at P325. But the study did not (and by nature could not) go further to test whether IIH symptoms would ensue.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Westgate study also did not test the effects of other androgens, to assess whether other androgens might behave similarly to testosterone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gaps between this study and the proposition for which Dr. Darney uses it (that androgens cause IIH) are too great, particularly insofar as this proposition is a cornerstone of his overall opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    522 U.S. at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    118 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming that conclusion that exposure to PCBs had contributed to plaintiffs' cancer could not be extrapolated from study of living infant mice which had been given massive doses of PCBs).

Such is the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   As to Dr. Darney's second premise, that progestin LNG is akin to androgens in ways that make it a cause of IIH, it, too, rests on speculation. Dr. Darney theorizes that LNG, because it has stronger androgenic potential than other progestins, can also cause IIH. But Dr. Darney has not identified any article that has tested\n   whether (much less found that) LNG can cause IIH through an androgenic pathway. Darney Dep. at 255-56. The sources he cites for his androgen hypothesis do not involve LNG. They discuss testosterone or other androgens.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p267\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And Dr. Darney testified that he is unaware of any article that tested whether LNG has a role in causing IIH through an androgenic pathway.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p267\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Darney's attempt to catapult from testosterone and other androgens to LNG does not reliably follow, because LNG is far from a clear analog to those androgens. In potentially significant respects, as Dr. Darney concedes, the progestin LNG is different from androgens and from the entire category of hormones. LNG only has 22% of the bonding affinity relative to the standard androgen; and its bonding affinity to SHBG is 50% of that of endogenous DHT, and 13% that of (presumably non-endogenous) DHT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Darney Rpt. at 11.

Proposed Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   Dr. Johanson's report is substantially more technical than any of the reports\n   reviewed previously. For the sake of accessibility to the lay reader, the Court's summary is pitched at a high level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   Dr. Johanson's report begins by discussing the formation, travel, and reabsorption of CSF, and normal versus elevated levels of CSF pressure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9. His discussion of IIH in this respect is brief. Relevant here, Dr. Johanson suggests that IIH is caused by the \"hypersecretion of CSF\"; for this proposition, he cites, in the commentary he appends to a graphic illustrating the CDF circulatory system, the following article: P. Gideon, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Assessment of CSF dynamics and venous flow in the superior sagittal sinus by MRI in idiopathic intracranial hypertension : a preliminary study\n   </em>\n   , 36 Neuroradiology 350, 353 (1994) (Dkt. 167-32) (\"Gideon\"). Johanson Rpt. at 9. The Gideon article, however, expressly does not endorse this proposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gideon,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 353 (\"Our results do not support the suggestion that hypersecretion is an important factor in the majority of patients with IIH.\"). And, as noted, while the issue is unresolved, the bulk of scholarship appears to adopt the alternative hypothesis: that the root cause of excess CSF in IIH patients is impaired absorption of CSF.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vincenzo Salpietro, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Recent insights on pediatric pseudotumor cerebri syndrome pathophysiology: From the \"Unifying Neuroendocrine Perspective\" to the \"Integrated Bioenergetic-Hormonal Mechanism\n   </em>\n   ,\" 13 J. Pediatric Neurology 11, 12 (2015) (Salpietro) (observing that the more generally accepted hypothesis for the cause of CSF production is \"hampered outflow of CSF into the venous system\"). Dr. Johanson acknowledged this in his deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johanson Dep. at 84 (agreeing that hampered CSF outflow is the more generally accepted hypothesis).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   Dr. Johanson's report then discusses the choroid plexus's role in generating CSF. He cites clinical studies that, he states, have demonstrated that the choroid plexus is the source of CSF production. Among these studies are ones that demonstrate that surgically cauterizing and removing choroid plexus cells reduce CSF pressure; and that patients with abnormal choroid plexuses over-secrete CSF. Johanson Rpt. at 10. Dr. Johanson states that, in addition to this clinical evidence, \"[p]harmacologic experimentation reinforces the concept of a high-capacity fluid production at the blood-CSF interface.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, he states, \"it is now widely accepted by neuroscientific and neurosurgical communities that [the choroid plexus] is the focal point of fluid production within the [central nervous system].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   Dr. Johanson then discusses how, in his view, sodium channel and pump activity drive CSF formation in the choroid plexus. At its most basic level, the process is as follows: sodium is diffused into the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus through sodium channels (Step 1), where it is then expelled from the cells into the CSF through a sodium pump (Step 2). This creates a sodium imbalance between the choroid plexus epithelial cells and the CSF. To correct this imbalance, water flows through aquaporin channels, causing the formation of CSF (Step 3). Johanson Rpt. at 14-15. This process is summarized in the chart below, copied from Dr. Johanson's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-408\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   Dr. Johanson then sets out his view of the role of sex hormones and their receptors in this process. He posits that, when the androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone bind to androgen receptors in the choroid plexus, they trigger the sodium mediated mechanism by which CSF is generated. As he sets out, the building blocks of this hypothesis are (1) the fact that \"androgen receptors (AR) have been characterized in CP of female and male mice,\" (2) an analogy to studies of the effect of testosterone on the kidneys of rats, (3) two case reports of the development of IIH in transgender men who were taking high doses of testosterone, and (4) studies involving the effect of testosterone on sodium channels, pumps and aquaporins-the only one involving the choroid plexus being the Westgate study.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johanson Rpt. at 18, 20, 22. However, as Dr. Johanson admitted at his deposition, he is not aware of any peer-reviewed study that has concluded that androgens cause IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johanson Dep. at 113. And, as noted in connection with the discussion of Dr. Darney, the Westgate study did no more than hypothesize about the role of testosterone in CSF formation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Westgate,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at P325 (\"[H]ypothesis[ing] that obesity and androgen excess may be pathogenic in IIH through dysregulation of CSF secretion and hence [IIH].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-410\">\n   Dr. Johanson also opines that two other hormones, estrogen and progesterone, affect CSF production. He suggests that estrogen imbalance with progesterone increases CSF production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19, 21-22. Progesterone, on the other hand, he states, likely inhibits CSF production. In particular, Dr. Johanson suggests that progesterone reduces the transport of sodium into the choroid plexus epithelial cells (Step 1) by \"reducing channel opening time\" and \"lowering channel expression.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. It also inhibits sodium pumps generally (Step 2), and down regulates the aquaporins in multiple tissues and, by analogy, in the choroid plexus too (Step 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   Finally, Dr. Johanson pivots to consider LNG. He proposes the following mechanisms as to how LNG causes CSF production and thus IIH. First, he posits, LNG directly travels to the central nervous system and choroid plexus and bonds to the androgen and MR. This causes CSF production for the reasons described above as to the androgen mechanism and for the\n   reasons described in Dr. Salpietro's report with respect to the MR mechanism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Second, he posits, LNG \"impacts metabolism and upsets endocrine balance\" by increasing androgen, estrogen, and insulin in the blood while decreasing progesterone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In support, Dr. Johanson cites (1) studies suggesting that an early age onset of IIH in women might be associated with testosterone, (2) a study of women with IIH that noted elevated testosterone among some of them, (3) a study that demonstrated lower progesterone in patients using Mirena, and (4) a study that demonstrated stable estrogen levels but an increase in the ratio of estrogen to progesterone among Mirena users three months after Mirena was implanted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   In addition to these hormone-related factors, Dr. Johanson also suggests that LNG induces the secretion of insulin which \"can drive androgen production in the ovaries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. However, as Dr. Johanson later acknowledges, the evidence is mixed in suggesting that LNG increases insulin levels. He also suggests that hormone and insulin-related weight gain (a so-called \"secondary mechanism\") might support his finding that LNG causes IIH because obese patients and those with recent weight gain are more likely to develop IIH.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   Finally, Dr. Johanson points to \"epidemiological evidence\" of LNG's ostensible ability to cause IIH, citing what appears to be a single case of a \"dechallenge.\" He did not, however, review either the Valenzuela or Etminan studies or consider any clinical data showing that Mirena users, given the preferential prescribing practices of that contraceptives, are at an increased risk for IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johanson Rpt. at 38-50 (list of authorities does not include Valenzuela or Etminan); Johanson Dep. at 135. At his deposition, Dr. Johanson admitted that no study, in animals or humans, had tested LNG and found that it dysregulated sodium transport in the choroid plexus or increased CSF production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 119, 173.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis Under\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   As with the previous experts, Dr. Johanson's opinion-that the LNG in Mirena causes the hypersecretion of CSF and thus IIH, based on a mechanism consisting of a series of theorized steps-fails to satisfy any of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   reliability factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   Dr. Johanson first developed this theory in the course of this litigation. In his deposition, he admitted that he had never communicated this theory outside of this litigation and that, before being hired by plaintiffs, he had never even considered whether LNG could cause IIH. Johanson Dep. at 109. Nor has this theory been tested: As to the mechanism he proposes by which LNG would have this effect, Dr. Johanson acknowledges that he has not tested the effects of LNG on choroid plexus ion transporters, even though he stated that it would take only one week to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. Dr. Johanson is unaware of anyone else who has tested this theory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119. He also has not published the theories he articulates in his expert report anywhere, including in a peer-reviewed journal. He is unaware of anyone else who has done so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 109-10, 173-74. And he admits that his theory\n   is no more than a \"plausible working model\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-417\">\n   You can extract data from a lot of literature, a lot of pieces of the puzzle, and I think I very cleverly build it together to make a plausible working model.

At a minimum, because it fails the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   reliability factors, this opinion, like those of the experts addressed earlier, requires the following \"hard look.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   The mechanism that Dr. Johanson theorizes, while complex, can be reduced to the following series of premises and steps: (1) IIH is caused by an overproduction of CSF; (2) the choroid plexus produces CSF through a sodium mechanism; (3) the sodium mechanism that produces CSF is triggered by androgens binding to androgen receptors in the choroid plexus; and (4) LNG binds to those same androgen receptors, triggering the same mechanism. In connection with these propositions, Dr. Johanson adds his views about how certain other hormones (estrogen and progesterone ) activate or inhibit that same sodium mechanism, and how LNG affects those hormones. Dr. Johanson also articulates a secondary, indirect mechanism of causation, under which Mirena causes a patient to gain weight, which in turn causes IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   As the Second Circuit has held, \"it is critical\" that the analysis of an expert \"be reliable at every step.\"\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p267\">\n    303 F.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Bayer disputes as unreliable and conjectural steps one, three, and four of Dr. Johanson's proposed biological mechanism, as well as some of his secondary premises. The Court considers these in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   In support of his theory's first step-that IIH is caused by an overproduction of CSF-Dr. Johanson cites the Gideon study. However, as noted, the authors of that study do not so state. Their study explains that \"CSF production may contribute to the development of [IIH]\" in some individuals, but the study's results \"\n   <em>\n    do not support\n   </em>\n   the suggestion that hypersecretion is an important factor in the majority of patients with IIH.\" Gideon,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 353 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   When confronted with this aspect of the Gideon study at his deposition, Dr. Johanson backtracked. No longer relying on the conclusion of the study, he argued that three outlier data points in that study \"kind of stood out\" so as to favor his conclusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168. He blamed the Gideon study's authors for \"misjudgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But, as noted earlier in connection with similar handling of others' studies by others of plaintiffs' experts, \"exceed[ing] the limitations the authors themselves\" placed on their studies is not good science.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mirena Perforation/Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343001\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/396/#p427\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Accutane Prods.

Specifically, an article Dr. Johanson co-authored recognized that CSF overproduction is the less favored hypothesis in the academy. The article did not indicate that any of the authors embraced that hypothesis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Salpietro,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 12. The article instead stated, as Dr. Johanson synopsized in his deposition, that the molecular physiology basis for elevated CSF pressure in IIH is unknown and that \"the patho-physiology of PTCS [IIH] is still poorly understood.\" Johanson Dep. at 76-78, 82-83. To be sure, Dr. Johanson's earlier article falls short of making his present report a reversal of position for purposes of litigation. But it does bear on the reliability of the view he has adopted in this litigation, particularly insofar as Dr. Johanson's new view does not derive from new or original research. And, as noted, this hypothesis is disputed in the literature, the majority of which has hypothesized an under-absorption theory. Dr. Johanson's report does not seriously engage with this contrary theory, including the writings that he cites in his earlier co-authored article, which question that CSF overproduction is the more probable explanation for IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rezulin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274750\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/531/#p563\">\n    309 F.Supp.2d at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   As to the first step in Dr. Johanson's analysis, the Court-and a jury-would be left only with the non-supportive Gideon study and Dr. Johanson's\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   assertion that an increase in CSF production is the likely cause of IIH. That is too great an analytic leap. His opinion on this critical first step lacks a sufficient evidentiary basis to permit it, under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , to reach a jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.F.M.A.S., Inc. v.

By far the most apposite writing cited by Dr. Johanson for this point is the Westgate study. But, as discussed in connection with Dr. Darney's report, that was an\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   study involving the choroid plexus cells in rats and involving testosterone. Bayer validly argues that extrapolating from a study involving testosterone and rats to the context of non-androgen LNG (a progestin) and humans is too great a leap. The Court agrees. In any event, even if such extrapolation were otherwise a viable basis for permitting such a theory to reach a jury, the Westgate study speculated, but stopped short of concluding, that testosterone may play a role in the production of CSF so as to cause IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Westgate,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at P325 (\"[\n   <em>\n    H\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ypothesis[ing]\n   </em>\n   that obesity and androgen excess\n   <em>\n    may be\n   </em>\n   pathogenic in IIH through dysregulation of CSF secretion and hence [IIH].\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Johanson Dep. 188-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   Dr. Johanson also cited in support of his litigation theory's second step (1) two case reports involving transgender patients who had taken massive doses of testosterone, and (2)\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   studies involving sodium transport in other organs, such as the kidneys.

But this theory, too, does not rest on a base of data that is nearly solid enough to reach a factfinder. As Dr. Johanson admitted at his deposition, he is unaware of any study suggesting that LNG dysregulates sodium transport in the choroid plexus\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   that LNG results in an increase in CSF production or pressure. Johanson Dep. 173 (\"Q: [C]an you identify any study that [ ] found that LNG dysregulates sodium transport in the choroid plexus? A: No. I cannot.\");\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 119. He also testified that he is unaware of any articles that discuss LNG and its androgenic activity in relation to IIH.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 214-15. Relative to Dr. Darney, Dr. Johanson devotes little attention to discussing the androgenic potential of LNG. But, as noted in the discussion of Dr. Darney's similar postulate, LNG's androgenic potential is substantially less than that of testosterone. Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that testosterone could cause the sodium transport posited by Dr. Johanson, it does not non-speculatively follow that LNG has a similar androgenic effect-especially to the degree necessary to cause IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   More generally, despite the central role that the androgen sodium mechanism plays in his mechanism theory, Dr. Johanson cites little evidence in support of this vital step. He relies mostly on citations to Dr. Salpietro's report in this litigation and on the same case reports and case\n   studies the Court has discussed elsewhere in this decision. In some circumstances, experts can permissibly rely on the opinions of other experts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Accutane Prods. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204404176\">\n    2007 WL 4404176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 15, 2007) (allowing expert on specific causation to rely on opinion of general causation expert \"if doctors in his profession normally rely upon the opinions of other experts\"). Here, however, for the reasons reviewed in connection with his report, Dr. Salpietro's report itself falls short of\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   's standards. And, as noted elsewhere, except in the rarest of circumstances, isolated case reports cannot alone prove propositions as to causation. As to his fourth step, too, then, there is too great a gap between the slim evidence cited by Dr. Johanson and the proposition for which he cites it: that LNG binds to androgen receptors in the choroid plexus, causing sodium ion transport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   There are thus infirmities precluding a finding of reliability as to three of the four steps on which Dr. Johanson's theory of Mirena's causation of IIH is based. Beyond that, to the extent that he sought to buttress his conclusion as to this point with clinical data, Dr. Johanson's use of evidence was impermissibly selective. To the extent he dipped into existing scholarship with respect to the relationship between Mirena and IIH, Dr. Johanson did so by citing case reports. In so doing, he elected not to consider the most important scholarship bearing on that point. He did not consider the Valenzuela study (or any part of the Etminan study, including its uncompromised part) at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johanson Dep. at 38 (\"Q: Did you review any of the clinical studies on Mirena and IIH? A: I did not. I have not, no.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 85-86 (\"Q: Did you review the literature showing whether patients who used Mirena have an increased rate of IIH as compared to controls? ... A: No.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 135-36. To be sure, Dr. Johanson's opinion is ultimately about a theorized mechanism of causation. He was not obliged to have considered these epidemiological studies in formulating his opinion. But, having deployed clinical evidence in the form of case reports in support of his ultimate conclusion, it is fair to examine whether he looked holistically, or only selectively, at this body of evidence. His cherry-picking approach is at odds with principles of sound science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   Finally, as noted, Dr. Johanson articulates a secondary, indirect theory of causation. He asserts that LNG has potential to cause obesity, hypertension, and hormonal imbalance. From these effects, he asserts, it may indirectly cause IIH. But this conclusion is flawed by the same sorts of data holes and analytical gaps as his discussion of the several steps addressed above. As to obesity, for example, Dr. Johanson opines that \"weight gain ... can occur with Mirena usage.\" Johanson Rpt. at 27-28. But the articles he cites for that proposition articles do not support it. He cites Nat\u00e1lia Dal'Ava, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Body weight and composition in users of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system\n   </em>\n   , 86 Contraception 350 (2012) (Dkt. 167-21), for the proposition that users of LNG-containing IUDs gained an average of seven pounds per year, and that those taking another progestin, depot-medroxyprogesterone, gained 15 pounds. Johanson Rpt. at 28. But Dal'Ava compared LNG-containing IUDs to copper (non-LNG) IUDs. Dal'Ava found \"no significant difference in body weight change between the two groups of users at 12 months.\" Dal'Ava,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 350. Dr. Johanson also cites Waleska Modesto, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Weight variation in users of depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and a copper intrauterine device for up to ten years of use\n   </em>\n   , 20 Eur. J. of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care 57, 60 (2015), for the proposition that LNG-containing\n   IUDs can lead to weight gain. Johanson Rpt. at 28. But that study also found no significant difference between the weight gain in those using LNG-containing IUDs and copper-containing IUDs. It noted that there was \"no plausible reason why the presence of a [copper-containing]-IUD\n   <em>\n    in utero\n   </em>\n   would influence weight.\" Modesto,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 61. In other words, Modesto,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , ultimately did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   find that LNG-containing IUDs cause weight gain. And in his deposition, Dr. Johanson admitted he would need to do further research into the issue and that he could not offer a clinical opinion that Mirena users gain significantly more weight than other persons. Johanson Dep. at 317-18. He agreed that a clinician would be better suited to assess the indirect mechanism he posited, in which Mirena causes weight gain, which in turn causes IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 321-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   Dr. Johanson's opinion must be sound at every critical step to be admissible.

He received his medical training at the University of Messina and the University of Pavia in Italy, and at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom. Dr. Salpietro works in the field of molecular neuroscience. Dr. Salpietro has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals in recent years.

Proposed Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-440\">\n   Dr. Salpietro's opinion is fundamentally about a mechanism by which Mirena might cause IIH. His report embraces a mineralocorticoid theory of a causal link between LNG and IIH. He posits that, because mineral corticoids may cause IIH and because LNG can bind to mineralocorticoid receptors (\"MR\" or \"MRs\"), LNG in turn may cause IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   Dr. Salpietro's report begins by discussing the basics of LNG, and in particular explains that, as acknowledged by Bayer, LNG binds to MRs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8. Dr. Salpietro also concludes that LNG exerts agonist (rather than antagonist) effects)\\ because mineralocorticoid activation symptoms (increase in body weight or blood pressure) have been reported in case reports regarding LNG-IUD users.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Animal studies conducted by Bayer have, according to Dr. Salpietro, demonstrated that Mirena use results in weight gain. In Bayer's clinical studies of Mirena, patients also reported some symptoms that are associated with mineralocortoid agonism, including edema, bloating, and weight gain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   Dr. Salpietro then turns to discuss IIH. After reviewing its characteristics and symptoms,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14, he notes that \"[t]he pathophysiology of PTCS is incompletely\n   understood,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, that studies have reached conflicting results whether the disease is caused by \"increased CSF production or pressure at the choroid plexus level and/or reduced CSF outflow in the arachnoid membrane and the cerebral venous system,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, and that \"[s]everal studies evidence a probable role for steroid hormones in PTCS,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Prior literature, he notes, has identified various possible causal mechanisms for IIH. These include \"impaired cerebral hemodynamics, including cerebral edema, increased cerebral blood volume, increased CSF production, and/or pressure along with decreased CSF reabsorption or venous flow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. He states, however, that cerebral edema has been excluded as a cause of IIH, and that there is limited evidentiary support for the remaining theories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (\"Another model ... linked PTCS to excessive CSF production; however, measurement of the production CSF rate would require invasive procedures (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , infusion or perfusion techniques) for the patients ... and no evidence from previous research gave conclusive support for this model, except (probably) two ventricular infusion studies which documented elevated CSF secretion in a number of PTCS patients.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"An additional, alternative, pathophysiological model links hampered CSF outflow into the arachnoid villi and the venous system to PTCS pathophysiology. The only possible evidence to support this theory came from a CSF infusion study which demonstrated reduced CSF drainage in PTCS.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   Dr. Salpietro then articulates his theory-namely, that many cases of IIH were related \"to the primary event of raised CSF pressure,\" and that this increase in pressure is caused by \"derangements in transport of electrolytes like sodium (Na+) or potassium (K+).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. He states: \"Activation of the choroid plexus MRs and their downstream pathways more likely than not stimulates the generation of Na+ (sodium) /K+ (potassium)-ATPase pumps, leading to greater movement of sodium ions at the choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPEC) apical membrane into the cerebral ventricles, thereby actively creating an osmotic gradient to drive secretion of CSF.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This mechanism has similarities to the model that Dr. Johanson proposes, although the driver of this mechanism posited by Dr. Salpietro is MR activation, not androgen receptor activation as posited by Dr. Johanson.

However, when questioned on this point at his deposition, Dr. Salpietro disclaimed reliance on case reports to prove his mechanism theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Salpietro Dep. at 137 (\"Q: You cite a number of case reports in your report, correct? A: Yes. Q: Are you relying on those case reports to prove your mechanism theory? A: No.\"). Dr. Salpietro further acknowledged that, while he regards his mechanism model as \"biologically plausible,\" it \"is not proven.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 350, 393.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   In support of this mechanism theory, Dr. Salpietro cites studies that observe MR expression in animal choroid plexus, and other studies that observe the expression of an Na+-K+ -ATPase subunit in rat choroid plexus. Salpietro Rpt. at 19-21. He further notes that studies have shown \"that children and adults with excess of aldosteronism can develop PTCS as a complication.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. One study, he noted, has shown that IIH patients who did not respond to conventional treatment experienced an improvement of their symptoms\n   when treated with an \"aldosterone receptor antagonist.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Salpietro's report, however, acknowledged that there are other possible risk factors for (or causes of) IIH, some of which are more widely accepted and understood than others. These actual or possible risk factors include obesity and weight gain, recombinant growth hormones, excess or low Vitamin A, retinoids, sulfa drugs, amiodarone, lithium, tetracyclines, and quinolones.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   As to an association between LNG and IIH, Dr. Salpietro cites studies that observe that some women taking oral contraceptives containing LNG have experienced symptoms associated with IIH.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28 (noting study in which four of 59 women using oral contraceptives were reported with IIH symptoms; also noting a 1968 study which described a \"high proportion of neuro-opthalmic consequences\" among 129 women taking oral contraceptives). None of those studies, however, have concluded that the oral contraceptives caused IIH.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Salpietro also cites the Norplant case studies discussed earlier (Sunku; Alder; and Wysowski and Green).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29. Dr. Salpietro also cites a case report in which a patient, after exposure to the powerful progestin Depo Provera, experienced IIH,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29, and the Martinez case report, cited earlier, of a woman whose visual disturbances resolved after an LNG-released IUD had been removed and treatment with the diuretic acetazolamide had begun,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Dr. Salpietro also cites the Valenzuela study,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and to Bayer's summary of individual case reports as submitted to German regulator BfArM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   With respect to the mechanism he posits, Dr. Salpietro terms it \"biologically plausible,\" and consistent with various known facts about IIH.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   He acknowledges that there are a limited number of studies in the field.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. In support of the critical step in his mechanism that links LNG to MR activation in the choroid plexus and thus the sodium/potassium mediated increase in CSF, he cites two studies with respect to the effect of progesterone activity on MRs, and to an animal study involving rabbits that found that a combined administration of estrogen and progestin altered CSF dynamics in the choroid plexus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the conclusions of that study, as Dr. Salpietro noted, are cabined and qualified: \"There\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be several kinds of cellular mechanisms involved in the action of progesterone on the choroid plexus function. One mechanism\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be an interaction with aldosterone in terms of competition between progesterone and aldosterone at cellular receptors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31 (citing Lindvall-Axelsson &amp; Owman,\n   <em>\n    Actions of sex steroids and corticosteroids on rabbit choroid plexus as shown by changes in transport capacity and rate of cerebrospinal fluid formation\n   </em>\n   , 12 Neurology Res. 181, 181-86 (1990) ) (emphasis added). Finally, Dr. Salpietro cites to Dr. Johanson's report in this litigation for the proposition that LNG can cause or substantially contribute to IIH though an androgen-mediated mechanism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-448\">\n   At the end of his report, Dr. Salpietro articulates an indirect mechanism by which\n   LNG may cause IIH. He posits a relationship between IIH, LNG, and obesity, in which, because the levels of SHBG are lower in obese women, and because LNG is available to bind to hormonal receptors only when it is \"free,\" the absence of SHBG available results in increased hormonal effects from LNG in obese women.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34. He also posits that use of LNG causes weight gain; and that, because weight gain is a risk factor for IIH, LNG is therefore a risk factor for IIH.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-449\">\n   In his deposition-addressed further\n   <em>\n    infra-\n   </em>\n   Dr. Salpietro admitted that he was not an expert in epidemiology and that he cannot testify about either it or pharmacology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Salpietro Dep. 424 - 25 (\"I have included all this pharmacology and epidemiology ... because I wanted to do a proper job ....

Analysis Under\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-451\">\n   Unlike the preceding six experts, Dr. Salpietro has written prior to this litigation to propose a component of the theory that he now propounds. In 2012 and 2014, he proposed an MR-mediated mechanism for IIH, although Dr. Salpietro did not then connect it to LNG, let alone to Mirena. Dr. Salpietro did suggest a causal connection to IIH of aldosterone, a classic MR agonist, and progesterone. To be sure, as articulated in his 2012 and 2014 publications, Dr. Salpietro's theory as to such a mechanism for IIH was put in far more qualified and tepid terms than in his present report.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Vincenzo Salpietro, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Idiopathic intracranial hypertension : a unifying neuroendocrine hypothesis through the adrenal-brain axis\n   </em>\n   , 33 Neuroendocrinology Lett. 569, 569, 572 (2012) (Dkt. 196-23) (\"Salpietro 2012\") (stating that he was \"working toward\" a \"hypothesis\" of IIH that involves MRs in the choroid plexus, that it is \"conceivable\" that progesterone\"can lead to IIH through stimulation of the MR pathway that leads to active sodium secretion ... at the apical membrane of the choroid plexus,\" but that \"[t]hus far, however, there is not a credible and comprehensive hypothesis ... of IIH despite the different mechanisms proposed\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Vincenzo Salpietro, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension and the underlying endocrine-metabolic dysfunction: a pilot study\n   </em>\n   , 27 J. Pediatric Endocrinology&amp; Metabolism 107 (2014) (Dkt. 196-26) (\"Salpietro 2014\"). And Dr. Salpietro's 2014 writing, which was focused on other IIH co-morbidities, made only a passing reference to progesterone, to which it referred only in a chart.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Salpietro 2014, at 112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   Bayer articulates several objections to Dr. Salpietro's expert conclusion that Mirena is a cause of IIH. At the outset, Bayer does not concede Dr. Salpietro's starting premise, to wit, that MR agonists can bind to MR receptors in the choroid plexus, triggering a biological chain reaction that can leads to an increase in CSF production. This theory, Bayer asserts, is purely a scholar's working hypothesis and has been admitted by Dr. Salpietro himself as unproven. Overwhelmingly, though, Bayer focuses its methodological challenge under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   on two \"leaps\" or \"gaps\" in Dr. Salpietro's proposed application of that\n   thesis to Mirena : first, that progesterone and LNG are MR agonists, and, second, that IIH is caused by an increase in CSF production. Bayer argues that these necessary steps in Dr. Salpietro's ultimate opinion as to Mirena's causation of IIH are no more than speculative working theories and, indeed, that Dr. Salpietro has repeatedly admitted that these are conjectural and unproven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-453\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Bayer is correct. The two \"gaps\" (unsupported assumptions) that it identifies are central to Dr. Salpietro's theory. Each unsubstantiated leap of logic is too great and too consequential to make Dr. Salpietro's ultimate conclusion as to Mirena the product of reliable methodology. And Dr. Salpietro, in his deposition testimony, repeatedly-and at times, memorably-acknowledged that his is no more than a conjectural, unproven working hypothesis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Salpietro Dep. at 409 (\"[W]e are still in the prehistoric age in regard to the research of pseudotumor cerebri.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \"[W]e don't know the genes involved, the pathways involved, and as a consequence we are not able to offer ... etiologically targeted treatments but just symptomatic reliefs.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 89 (\"There is no one in the world who knows the exact cause of pseudotumor cerebri.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-454\">\n   Before addressing the gaps in Dr. Salpietro's mechanism theory, the Court notes that, as related above, Dr. Salpietro has jettisoned the remaining opinions articulated in his report,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , all but his mechanism opinion. These include his opinions as to pharmacology, epidemiology, case reports, and Dr. Conrad Johanson's androgen theory. In his deposition, Dr. Salpietro disclaimed reliance on these opinions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Salpietro Dep. at 424 (\"I would never testify about the pharmacology underlying Mirena or the-or the epidemiology or the gynecology side of this litigation.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 274 (\"There may be several mechanisms involved in the androgenicity of Mirena, but I am not in the position [to] offer you a proper opinion [about Dr. Johanson's androgen theory] because I should read much more about this.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 423 (\"I mean, the only thing I can really offer is my model.

And, following Dr. Salpietro's lead, plaintiffs in their opposition brief did not defend the aspects of his report that embrace these other opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-455\">\n   As to Dr. Salpietro's opinion as to a mechanism by which Mirena ostensibly causes IIH, the Court assumes,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that existing scholarship provides a reliable basis for the starting premise of that opinion: that MR agonists can bind to MR receptors in the choroid plexus, triggering a biological chain reaction that can lead to an increase in CSF production. Like Bayer, the Court focuses its analysis on the two ensuing steps in the reasoning Dr. Salpietro uses to connect that starting premise to his opinion here. The Court gives this analysis a \"hard look,\" because-like the opinions of the preceding six experts-Dr. Salpietro's opinion does not meet any of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   criteria for reliability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-456\">\n   <em>\n    Whether progesterone and LNG are MR agonists\n   </em>\n   : At the threshold, plaintiffs seek to deflect Bayer's critique as to this point by stating that Dr. Salpietro's model does not require LNG and progesterone to be MR agonists. That is flatly incorrect. By its own explicit terms, Dr. Salpietro's model is based on \"\n   <em>\n    activation\n   </em>\n   of the choroid plexus MRs.\" Salpietro Rpt. at 17. He posits a biological pathway which can be triggered by the \"\n   <em>\n    agonistic\n   </em>\n   activity of aldosterone on the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Salpietro 2012 at 57 (\"Aldosterone can stimulate MR; spironolactone can antagonize MR\"), and which is inhibited by spironolactone, \"a classic MR\n   <em>\n    antagonist\n   </em>\n   ,\" Salpietro Rpt. at 18 (emphasis added). And Dr. Salpietro includes in his report the following chart, taken from his 2014 article, that sets forth his unified theory of IIH etiology and which, through its use of arrows, clearly demonstrates his view that the mechanism is triggered by MR\n   <em>\n    agonists\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-457\">\n   Along the same lines, Dr. Salpietro also cites Anny Souque, et al.,\n   <em>\n    The mineralocorticoid activity of progesterone derivatives depends on the nature of the C18 substituent\n   </em>\n   , 136 Endocrinology 5651 (1995) (Dkt. 167-61), for the proposition that \"progesterone has a low agonist mineralocorticoid (MC) activity.\" Salpietro Rpt. at 9. This is not a small point. Dr. Salpietro's model depends on this proposition. It does not logically cohere if progesterone and LNG are not MR agonists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-458\">\n   However, fatally from a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   perspective, the studies that his report cites and that he referenced at his deposition for this proposition do not support that progesterone and LNG are MR agonists. The first study, M. Quinkler &amp; S. Diedrich,\n   <em>\n    Difference of in vivo and in vitro antimineralocorticoid potency of progesterone\n   </em>\n   , 28 Endocrine Res. 465 (2002) (Dkt. 167-50), appears to directly contradict itself. It reports both that the preexisting literature found that progesterone was \"only a weak\n   transactivation activity and is therefore a MR\n   <em>\n    antagonist\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 466 (emphasis added), and that his study affirmed that literature's conclusions by demonstrating that progesterone\"has a low\n   <em>\n    agonist\n   </em>\n   [mineralocorticoid]-activity,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 467. The study also states that \"progesterone is a potent\n   <em>\n    anti-[mineralocorticoid]\n   </em>\n   in vivo,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added), suggesting again that progesterone's effects are\n   <em>\n    antagonistic\n   </em>\n   . At best, the study is equivocal. It is sufficiently inconsistent as to neither support nor undercut the proposition on which Dr. Salpietro relies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-459\">\n   The Souque study paints a more internally consistent, while complex, picture. But in the end, this study does not help Dr. Salpietro's theory either. The study finds that progesterone and several of its derivatives \"behave as antagonists.\" Souque,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 5656. This, of course, is contrary to a core premise of Dr. Salpietro's report. (Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Johanson similarly disagrees with Dr. Salpietro, opining that progesterone is an MR antagonist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johanson Rpt. at 18; Johanson Dep. at 175.) That said, the Souque study does find that one progesterone derivative has \"agonist properties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the proposition that one derivative of progesterone has agonist properties is an insufficient ground on which to find a reliable basis for Dr. Salpietro's thesis. The Souque study's findings emphasize the difficulty, even the futility, of inferring from the behavior of one hormone that of a similar hormone-it underscores that one cannot assume that because one hormone has a certain effect, a similar hormone will necessarily have the same effect. As another study puts the point: \"[T]he relationship between affinity and biological activity or potency is not straightforward or predictable, and appears be cell and promoter-specific, as well as ligand-dependent.\" Africander,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 641. Under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   Dr. Salpietro's analysis must be \"reliable at every step.\"\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p267\">\n    303 F.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the studies he cites for the necessary proposition that progesterone is an MR agonist are \"simply inadequate to support\" that conclusion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p267\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p267\">\n    at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They do no more than make that proposition possibly true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-460\">\n   Conceivably, Dr. Salpietro's opinion on this aspect of his mechanism opinion could have been salvaged had he contended with this nuance. Conceivably, for example, he might have explained, if true, that the chemical structure of LNG is closely akin to that of the MR-agonist progesterone derivative addressed by the Souque study, while it is unlike that of derivatives that are not MR agonists. Dr. Salpietro did not, however, do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-461\">\n   The only evidence, in fact, that Dr. Salpietro musters in support of his thesis that LNG is a MR agonist is his statement that LNG causes \"MR agonism-related side effects.\" Salpietro Rpt. at 10. The side effects that Dr. Salpietro mentions in this regard include bloating or edema, weight gain, and increased blood pressure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. But this statement is problematic because these symptoms may have many causes, and because, with the possible exception of high blood pressure, the evidence that Dr. Salpietro cites does not bear out that LNG causes these symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-462\">\n   Dr. Salpietro supports his opinion that LNG causes edema by citing to patient self-reports of edema and bloating as recounted in a clinical study by Bayer. Dr. Salpietro assumed that the doctors had\n   \"objectively assessed\" the reports of edema. Salpietro Dep. at 336. In his deposition, he admitted that had the study merely documented patients' self-reports, that would influence his view of the study's value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 345 (\"Q: On that study A46796, would it change your opinion if the edema you rely on was reported but then not objectively assessed? Would that impact your view of- A: Yes. Q: Because- A: If it was not a doctor. Q: Yes. A: If it was a self-report, yeah.\") Yet that is what the study documented. Further, as Dr. Salpietro acknowledged, the self-reported edema and bloating was potentially attributable to confounding factors, such as kidney problems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 336.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-463\">\n   Dr. Salpietro supports his opinion that LNG causes weight gain by citing to human and animal studies. At his deposition, however, Dr. Salpietro recognized that he had not read some of the studies he cites, and that others do not support his conclusions. A few examples illustrate the casual nature of Dr. Salpietro's inquiry, and the consequent unreliability of his methodology. Dr. Salpietro cites three animal studies that purportedly show LNG causes weight gain. He read only one of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Salpietro Dep. at 286-87. One of the two he did not read was written in Japanese.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 312. Dr. Salpietro also relies on human studies by Dal'Ava and Napolitano. Those studies, however were focused on body composition, not weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Salpietro Rpt. 35-36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Salpietro Dep. 315, 327-28 (recognizing that Dal'Ava and Napolitano studies did not show a statistically significant increase in weight gain). Dr. Salpietro also cites a study by Silva-Filho involving self-reported weight gain by users of LNG-containing IUDs. However, Dr. Salpietro himself admitted that he did not \"believe much in this because [it] is a self report.\" Salpietro Depo. at 332.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-464\">\n   Finally, Dr. Salpietro supports his opinion that LNG increases blood pressure by citing to two studies. The first describes a single case report of increased blood pressure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.G. Vos, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Hypertension and use of an intrauterine levonorgestrel-releasing device\n   </em>\n   , 70 Neth J. of Med. 431 (2012) (Dkt. 167-65). As the Court has noted repeatedly in this decision, case reports alone do not establish causation.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Salpietro Dep. at 124 (single case report \"very weak\" evidence of connection between LNG and increased blood pressure). The second includes a single sentence stating that increases in blood pressure have been reported with Norplant, and citing to three additional studies. T. Rosenthal, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Chapter 70: Oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and hypertension, in\n   </em>\n   Comprehensive Hypertension Clinical Approaches: Secondary Hypertension 865, 877 (2007). In any event, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that such studies did prove that Norplant causes increased blood pressure, it is too great a leap to assume, on this basis, that LNG is therefore an MR agonist that can trigger Dr. Salpietro's biological mechanism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p267\">\n    303 F.3d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-465\">\n   <em>\n    Whether IIH is caused by CSF overproduction\n   </em>\n   : In accusing Dr. Salpietro of a second \"leap,\" Bayer faults his report and testimony for refusing to address whether IIH is caused by CSF overproduction, as opposed to by under-absorption of CSF. As Dr. Johanson recognized, this is indeed a \"pivotal question\" for an expert proposing to opine on whether Mirena causes IIH. Johanson Dep. at 15-16. The Court reads Dr. Salpietro's report differently from Bayer. In the Court's view, Dr. Salpietro's report, while not a model of clarity, is best read to take the position that IIH is caused by CSF overproduction. As Bayer notes, Dr. Salpietro's mechanism theory would otherwise make little sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-466\">\n   Dr. Salpietro, however, does not cite any direct evidence that LNG causes an increase in CSF production. He articulates that proposition as an assumption, not as a finding based on data or scientific experimentation. Moreover, even if reliable evidence existed that LNG causes an increase in production of CSF, Dr. Salpietro would need to contend with the next logical step in his thesis, which is whether IIH is caused by increases in the production of CSF. As noted earlier, numerous studies suggest that IIH is actually caused by the under-absorption of CSF; Dr. Salpietro's contrary thesis that IIH is the product of overproduction of CSF is decidedly the minority theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , pp. 284-85, 293-94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-467\">\n   Plaintiffs do not contest that Dr. Salpietro's theories lack such support. They argue instead that Mirena's purported MR-related side effects, specifically edema and weight gain, themselves reliably establish that LNG increases production of fluids. For multiple reasons, this is far too threadbare and speculative a basis to support Dr. Salpietro's thesis. First, it is too far a leap to posit that an increase in production of a type of fluid in one region of the body (e.g., the limbs) necessarily means that production of a different type of fluid (CSF) is similarly increased in another region (e.g., the brain). Second, as noted, the scientific evidence Dr. Salpietro cites in support of his conclusions that Mirena causes edema and weight gain does not solidly support these conclusions. Third, as noted, even if Dr. Salpietro had non-speculatively tied an increase in CSF production to use of Mirena, he does not establish that over-production of CSF, as opposed to its under-absorption, causes IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-468\">\n   In sum, Dr. Salpietro's untested mechanism hypothesis, which he admits is \"not proven,\" Salpietro Dep. at 241, 350, is not reliable. It is beset by analytic and evidentiary gaps at multiple steps, which Dr. Salpietro proposes to fill with theories and assumptions, not data. Accepting Dr. Salpietro's never-vetted model would, unacceptably, require the jury to accept \"the\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   of the expert.\"\n   <em>\n    Gen. Elec.

Plaintiffs' Challenges to Bayer's Expert Witnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-470\">\n   As noted, plaintiffs have moved to exclude defendants' 12 expert witnesses. The reports of these witnesses are directed principally to the topic of general causation. In large measure, these reports take issue with the methodology of plaintiffs' experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-471\">\n   In light of this ruling excluding the general-causation testimony of all plaintiffs' experts, the Court does not perceive at this time any reason to resolve plaintiffs' motions to exclude the testimony of Bayer's responsive general-causation experts. The Court expects that this litigation, tracking the Perforation MDL, will likely move next to a defense motion for summary judgment on the issue of general causation. The Court accordingly denies as potentially moot plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions aimed at Bayer's general-causation experts. This ruling is without prejudice: In the event that this case survives such a motion, the Court will then seek counsel's views as to whether to take up\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions with respect to Bayer's experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-472\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-473\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Bayer's motion to exclude the testimony of plaintiffs' seven general-causation witnesses, and denies, as potentially moot, plaintiffs' motions to exclude Bayer's 12 general-causation witnesses.

Bayer noted that, as to each of the populations it studied, the Valenzuela study had used different methods to determine the number of Mirena users in its case (IIH) and control (non-IIH) groups. Among the Utah population, for example, the researchers interviewed all IIH patients to determine whether they had a Mirena implanted when their symptoms began, and did so regardless of when or where the Mirena had been implanted. In contrast, as to the Utah control group, the researchers included only patients who had their Mirenas inserted at the University of Utah during the study period, thereby excluding persons who had Mirenas inserted before the study began or whose Mirena devices were inserted outside the University of Utah system. Bayer argues that this asymmetric methodology-and a similar asymmetry affecting the Denmark study-may produce an undercounting of Mirena usage in the control group, thereby inflating the apparent correlation between Mirena usage and IIH. This, Bayer argues, is relevant to the reliability of the proposed testimony of those plaintiffs' experts who rely on the Valenzuela study.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Bayer Omnibus Br. at 17 n.9.
