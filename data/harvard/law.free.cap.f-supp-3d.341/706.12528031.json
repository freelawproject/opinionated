Plaintiffs are prospective adoptive same-sex couples and individuals who have contacted certain faith-based Michigan adoption agencies and, based upon their same-sex status, been denied the state-contracted-for services to process their papers necessary for consideration for child placement by all adoption agencies. Plaintiffs allege that the refusal of these faith-based agencies to consider them as prospective adoptive parents violates their rights protected by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and also violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that these practices violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments and seek an Order enjoining Defendants Lyon and McCall, in their official capacities, from contracting with or providing taxpayer funding to private child placing agencies that exclude same-sex couples from consideration as foster or adoptive parents or otherwise employ religious criteria in the screening of prospective foster and adoptive parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court has granted the motions of the Intervenor Defendants, St. Vincent Catholic Charities, Melissa Buck, Chad Buck, and Shamber Flore to intervene in this action. (ECF Nos. 31, 34.) The State Defendants and the Intervenor Defendants now move to dismiss the Plaintiffs' Complaint. (ECF Nos. 16, 19.) The Court also accepted and has considered (as appropriate\n   to the stage of proceedings) the Group of 53 Michigan Legislators' Amicus Brief. (ECF No. 26.) The Court held oral argument on July 12, 2018, on both motions to dismiss. For the reasons that follow, the Court DENIES Defendants' motions to dismiss except that the Court GRANTS the motion to dismiss Plaintiff Jennifer Ludolph's claims for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the DHHS is responsible for the approximately 13,000 children who are in the State's foster care system because they have been removed from their families by the State due to abuse or neglect or otherwise have become wards of the State. The State is responsible for finding these children appropriate foster and adoptive families to care for them. (Compl. \u00b6 2.) According to the allegations of the Complaint, the DHHS contracts out public adoption and foster care services to private agencies and pays these agencies with taxpayer funds to perform this government function. Some of these agencies refuse to accept prospective families headed by same-sex couples or to place children with families headed by same-sex parents based upon the agency's religious beliefs. DHHS has not prevented the agencies from engaging in this conduct. (Compl. \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs Kristy and Dana Dumont and Erin and Rebecca Busk-Sutton are two prospective adoptive families that were turned away by state-contracted and taxpayer funded child placing agencies based on those agencies' religious objections to same-sex couples. Plaintiffs allege that these couples are ready, willing, and able to provide a \"forever family\" to children in the foster care system. Plaintiff Jennifer Ludolph was in the Michigan foster care system when she was a teenager and, as a taxpayer, she objects to taxpayer dollars funding child-placing agencies that turn away qualified families because of the agencies' religious objections to those families. The Complaint alleges that all Plaintiffs are Michigan taxpayers who object to their taxpayer dollars being used to pay for public child welfare services that are provided based on religious standards rather than professional child welfare standards and object to the use of taxpayer funds to underwrite and endorse religious beliefs to which they do not subscribe. Plaintiffs allege that their claims concern only the State's provision of taxpayer-funded government services based on religious and discriminatory criteria and do not challenge any private agency's provision of private adoption services or use of non-public funds. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiffs' Allegations Regarding Michigan's Child Welfare System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to the allegations of the Complaint, in a typical case the state Child Protective Services removes a child from a home for abuse or neglect and a court orders that the child be placed into foster care. If a child ultimately cannot be reunited with his or her parents and parental rights are terminated, DHHS seeks to find a permanent family for the child, typically through adoption. DHHS's responsibilities for such children include recruiting and\n   identifying appropriate families to care for the children, either temporarily as foster parents or permanently as adoptive families. According to the allegations of the Complaint, DHHS performs this public function in part by contracting with private agencies that are licensed by DHHS's Division of Child Welfare Licensing (\"DCWL\") as \"child placing agencies\" to recruit, screen, train, and license prospective foster and adoptive parents and to place children in appropriate foster or adoptive homes, as authorized by Michigan statute, Mich. Compl. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 722.11(1)(c), 722.115(3), 722.922. Plaintiffs allege that, although DHHS retains ultimate supervisory responsibility in all cases, much of the on-the-ground foster care and adoption work is performed by taxpayer-funded child placing agencies. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that through rulemaking authorized by statute, DHHS has conferred authority on child placing agencies to make decisions regarding licensing foster parents and certifying adoptive parents, as well as placement of children into foster and adoptive homes. According to the allegations of the Complaint, child placement agencies have an obligation to maintain ongoing recruitment programs \"to ensure an adequate number of suitable and qualified homes\" to meet the needs of the children served by the agency. Under these administrative rules, agencies have substantial discretion in evaluating applicants as well as selecting appropriate placements for children into foster or adoptive homes. (Compl. \u00b6 26, citing Mich. Admin. Code R. 400.12301(1), 400.12701, 400.12304(1), 400.12706, 400.12404, 400.12709.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that after an agency accepts a child's case from DHHS, it immediately begins receiving per diem compensation from the State. For example, the Complaint alleges, some agencies receive at least $40 per day from the State for each adoption case they handle. These payments cease after a child is permanently placed and the agencies receive a lump-sum payment after placement depending on the outcome of the case. (Compl. \u00b6 27.) According to the allegations of the Complaint, to fund the state's welfare system, the Michigan legislature annually makes appropriations for adoption and foster care services and the DHHS utilizes these appropriated funds to pay private child placing agencies under contract with the State to provide foster care and adoptive services. Plaintiffs allege that the DHHS has entered into adoption and foster care service contracts with over 100 private child placing agencies statewide, operating in multiple counties, many of whom are religiously affiliated. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to the allegations of the Complaint, the contracts entered into between DHHS and child placing agencies require the contracting agencies to comply with DHHS's non-discrimination statement, which mandates that agencies \"will not discriminate against any individual or group because of race, sex, religion, age, national origin, color, height, weight, marital status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, political beliefs or disability.\" This requirement, Plaintiffs allege, \"applies to all applications filed for adoption of [DHHS] supervised children, including [DHHS] supervised children assigned to a contracted agency.\" The contracts also require each contracting agency to \"develop and implement a plan for adoptive home recruitment, retention, and support consistent with\" DHHS's licensing standards applicable to the agency's license. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that families interested in fostering or adopting a child out of the foster care system must submit an application for a foster care license or to be\n   certified to adopt. Each private child placing agency maintains a roster of families that it has licensed or certified that it generally uses for family placements for children assigned to its care. According to the allegations of the Complaint, the eligibility requirements for families interested in adopting from the foster care system are provided in the DHHS Adoption Program Statement, also known as Publication 255, which provides the same non-discrimination provision as the contracts with the child placing agencies and also state that \"[t]he eligibility criteria for adoption of [DHHS]-supervised wards must not be more restrictive than the criteria in DHS Publication 255 when a contracted adoption agency is providing DHS adoption services.\" DHHS is contractually obligated to terminate its agreement with a child placing agency if the agency \"[e]ngages in any conduct that may expose [DHHS] to liability\" or \"fails to cure a breach\" of the agreement after receiving notice, and DHHS retains the right to terminate the agreement immediately \"without penalty and for any reason.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, although DHHS is aware that certain child placing agencies have refused to accept same-sex couples for processing necessary to foster or adopt children in the child welfare system, DHHS has not taken any remedial action under its contracts against any agency for failure to abide by the DHHS non-discrimination statement or Publication 255, or the United States Constitution. (Compl. \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Allegations Regarding 2015 Michigan House Bills Nos. 4188, 4189, and 4190\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For years, according to the allegations of the Complaint, some private agencies providing foster care and adoption services under contract with the State have refused to process same-sex couples seeking to qualify as foster or adoptive parents because of the agencies' religious beliefs. Starting as early as 2013, according to Plaintiffs' Complaint, members of the Michigan legislature attempted to introduce legislation that would codify and authorize the practice of permitting agencies to turn away same-sex couples on the basis of religious objection. Those early efforts at passing legislation did not succeed. In the 2015-2016 Legislative session, Michigan House Bills 4188, 4189, and 4190 presented the issue again. According to the allegations of the Complaint, during a hearing before the House on February 18, 2015, the director of clinical services at Intervenor Defendant St. Vincent confirmed that the organization would not work with gay and lesbian prospective parents, explaining that when prospective parents to whom they were religiously opposed approached them: \"If they let us know that they're unmarried, or they're gay or lesbian, we immediately recommend, make a referral to another agency.\" Allegedly the President of another faith-based agency, Bethany, asserted that to require Bethany to adhere to principles of non-discrimination would present them with \"an untenable choice\" of \"choos[ing] between their desire to help children and families and their fidelity to their religious principles.\" The President of Bethany stated that \"House Bills 4188-4190 are necessary\" to \"codify into state law what has been in practice,\" and threatened that \"if statewide policy changes in a way that would force Catholic agencies to choose between violating strongly held religious beliefs or ceasing cooperation with the state, the agencies will cease to cooperate.\" Plaintiffs also allege that the President and CEO of the Michigan Catholic Charities also weighed in on the issue by letter to Governor Rick Snyder stating that Catholic agencies \"handl[e] approximately twenty percent of the active foster care and adoption cases in Michigan,\" and expressed\n   concern that there were objections to \"the religious manner by which faith-based child placement agencies operate.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-43, 45-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to the allegations of the Complaint, the Michigan House of Representatives passed the Bills in March, 2015 and on June 10, 2015, the Michigan Senate passed the bills, which were signed into law the following morning by Governor Snyder as 2015 Public Acts 53, 54, and 55, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20400\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .5a, 722.124c, 722.124f, and 710.23g. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44, 47.) The statutes provide in relevant part that, \"[t]o the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law, a child placing agency shall not be required to provide any services if those services conflict with, or provide any services under circumstances that conflict with, the child placing agency's sincerely held religious beliefs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20722\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .124e(2). Additionally, the statute provides that, \"[t]o the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law, the state or local unit of government shall not take an adverse action against a child placing agency on the basis that the child placing agency has declined or will decline to provide any services if those services conflict with, or provide any services under circumstances that conflict with, the child placing agency's sincerely held religious beliefs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20722\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 722.124e(3). Under the statute, \"services\" are defined to \"include[ ] any service that a child placing agency provides except foster care case management and adoption services provided under a contract with [DHHS].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20722\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 722.124e(7)(b). The Plaintiffs allege that some child placing agencies have interpreted these statutes as permitting taxpayer-funded state-contracted child placing agencies to turn away prospective families for children in foster care based on religious criteria and the State has allowed this practice to occur. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Allegations Regarding Harm to Children Resulting From the Defendants' Authorization of Religious-Based Exclusions by Child Placing Agencies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that there is a shortage of foster and adoptive families in Michigan and that as a result of this shortage, some children in State custody have and may continue to have multiple temporary placements before a suitable permanent home is found while other children may have to be separated from their siblings or placed in foster homes far from their school and community and other children may have to be placed in group homes and may reach the age of majority without ever being placed with a permanent family. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.) Plaintiffs allege that each time a prospective parent who is able to provide a loving and caring family for a child is turned away by a child placing agency because of a religious objection to their sexual orientation (or any other religious objection) the pool of families available for the children in the system diminishes, reducing children's option for placement. (Compl. \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   According to the allegations of Plaintiffs' Complaint, every major professional organization dedicated to children's welfare, including the Child Welfare League of America, the National Association of Social Workers, the National Adoption Center, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Medical Association, affirmatively states that gay and lesbian parents are as likely as heterosexual parents to provide supportive and healthy environments for their children and opposes any discrimination based on sexual orientation in matters of adoption and foster care. Plaintiffs allege that the loss of these potentially\n   qualified families exacerbates the shortage of potential foster and adoptive families, resulting in greater costs to the State welfare system and the result that some children who otherwise would be matched with a loving same-sex family may be denied the family that best matches their individual needs. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing: Fed. R. Civ.

The contracts with these agencies acknowledge an agency's rights that are protected by the religious belief exemption provided in PA 53, which the faith-based agencies rely on to turn away prospective families headed by same-sex couples because of the agency's religious beliefs. (Compl. \u00b6 78.) Defendants admit that, \"as Michigan law requires,\" their contracts with the child placing agencies \"expressly incorporate and protect a CPA's rights under P.A. 53.\" (State Defs.' Mot.

Here, the Plaintiffs have alleged that their injuries were caused by the State Defendants' contractual and actual practice of permitting a child placing agency to refuse to work with a same-sex couple. Thus, Plaintiffs have alleged facts that \"link\" the State Defendants to their injuries by alleging that the State Defendants' conduct enabled the child placing agencies to take the actions that they did with regard to same sex couples. As the Sixth Circuit observed in\n   <em>\n    Parsons\n   </em>\n   : \"The Juggalos' allegations link the 2011 NGTA Report to their injuries by stating that the law enforcement officials themselves acknowledged that the DOJ gang designation had caused them to take the actions in question.

(State Defs.' Mot. 13.) Plaintiffs respond that Defendants cannot rely on the factual assertion that these faith-based agencies will no longer be able to provide services because those allegations are not contained in Plaintiffs' Complaint. In any event, the Plaintiffs argue, the relief they seek is not to work with a particular child placing agency but to be able to work with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   child placing agency on equal footing with all other prospective adoptive couples, regardless of their sexual orientation.

In any event, in this case Plaintiffs have alleged that they suffered stigmatic and practical harm as a result of the State's practice of permitting faith-based agencies to turn them away due to their sexual orientation. And the faith-based agencies concede that their ability to turn away same sex couples and continue to partner with the State is dependent upon the religious belief protection they have been granted by the State. But Plaintiffs are not seeking the services of any particular child placing agency - they are asking that the barriers that they now face to adopting a child based on their sexual orientation be removed and they seek the opportunity to adopt a child based on the same criteria applied to every other family seeking to adopt in Michigan. If they are granted the relief they seek, those barriers will be eliminated and they will be able to pursue adoption on equal footing with other Michigan families. No speculative inferences are necessary here to conclude that the relief requested will result in the Plaintiffs receiving the dignity and equal treatment they seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, relying on\n   <em>\n    Fieger v.

Plaintiffs have met that burden here. Plaintiffs allege that they continue to suffer from their inability to work with any child placing agency of their choosing and that if the Court grants the relief they seek, breaking down the barriers to adoption that they now face, there will be greater opportunity for them to adopt, plausibly suggesting that they will personally benefit in a tangible way from the requested relief. Defendants urge that the facts are otherwise and that Plaintiffs' options will be the same or fewer if the Court grants the requested relief. The Court cannot accept the Defendants' controverting factual assertions at this stage of proceedings. However, as the Court previously remarked, since the elements necessary to establishing standing \"are not mere pleading requirements but rather an indispensable part of the plaintiff's case, each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative enactment attacked. Thus, a taxpayer\n   will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, s 8, of the Constitution. It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute. This requirement is consistent with the limitation imposed upon state-taxpayer standing in federal courts in\n   <em>\n    Doremus v. Board of Education\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"640868\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/429/\">\n    342 U.S. 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"640868\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/429/\">\n    72 S.Ct. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20L.%20Ed.%20475\">\n    96 L.Ed. 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1952). Secondly, the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged. Under this requirement, the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Pedreira\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable and in fact supports a finding of no taxpayer standing here because the explicit legislative directive absent here was demanded there and was found only in the state legislative enactment that expressly \"appropriated sums of money specifically to KBHC.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The teaching of this line of post-\n   <em>\n    Flast\n   </em>\n   Supreme Court precedent is that\n   <em>\n    Flast\n   </em>\n   is alive and well and that if the legislative enactment at issue does not expressly authorize the religiously-challenged expenditure at issue, the\n   <em>\n    Flast\n   </em>\n   test will not be met. Here, Plaintiffs assert that \"[f]unds for child placing agencies come largely from appropriations made by the Michigan Legislature for foster care payments and the Child Care Fund, which must be spent according to relevant child welfare statutes.\" (Pls.'

In support of this assertion, Plaintiffs refer by way of example to the \"FY2018 Appropriations Act,\" which Plaintiffs allege \"made specific appropriations for foster care payments and Child Care Fund.\" (Pls.'

Plaintiffs assert that \"DHHS is empowered to promulgate regulations and oversee spending under the Child Care Fund.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4053267\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/722/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs also refer to paragraphs 38-50 and 76-77 of their Complaint. Absent, however, from any of this supporting evidence is any indication that the state legislature specifically directed that the funds they were appropriating to DHHS to carry out its mission with respect to the State's foster care system be used to further or carry out\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   religious purpose. Indeed, at the hearing on the motions to dismiss, counsel for the Plaintiffs conceded that the funding statute at issue here says nothing about religion. (ECF No. 48, Transcript of July 12, 2018 Hearing (\"Hr'g Tr.\") 53:1-10.) There is no legislative mandate or requirement that the DHHS contract with any particular child placing agency and there is no express legislative mandate that funds appropriated be used to support any particular religious agenda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs have not identified an express legislative appropriation directing that funds be used to further or carry out any religious purpose.

Thus, it is critical to our endeavor to understand what the Plaintiffs have alleged in their Complaint and what they have not alleged. \"Plaintiffs do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   challenge the eligibility of religious organizations to receive government contracts to provide social services.\" (ECF No. 37, Pls.' Intervenor Resp. 13, PgID 832.) Rather, Plaintiffs challenge the State's practice of contracting with child placing agencies and authorizing those agencies to use religious eligibility criteria in the public child welfare system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, Plaintiffs ask the Court \"to invalidate the State's practice of allowing state-contracted, taxpayer-funded child placing agencies to disqualify prospective families headed by same-sex couples based on agencies' religious beliefs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs do not seek to prevent the State from entering into contracts with faith-based child placing agencies for the provision of child welfare services. Rather, Plaintiffs seek to ensure that the State does so on the same terms that it contracts with secular agencies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14, PgID 832-33.) The Plaintiffs have sued the State Defendants, arguing that the State's practice of permitting state-contracted child placing agencies that perform a state function to use religious criteria to exclude prospective adoptive and foster parents constitutes endorsement and promotion of religion and is prohibited by the Establishment Clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, PgID 829.) The Plaintiffs have not sued St. Vincent or any other child placing agency. St. Vincent and the other Intervenor Defendants sought and were granted permission to intervene in this matter only to place their views before the Court. Nor do the Plaintiffs directly challenge the constitutionality of PA 53, which created the religious belief exemption on which St. Vincent and other faith-based child placing agencies have been permitted to rely in employing religious criteria in their state-contracted work. The Plaintiffs have sued only the State Defendants who are responsible (in their official capacities) for the implementation of PA 53 and who enter into contracts with child placing agencies to perform adoption and foster care services for Michigan wards of State. These State-sponsored multi-million dollar contracts expressly recognize a child placing agency's right under PA 53 to refuse to provide services on the basis of their religious beliefs, as relevant here their sincerely held faith-based objection to same-sex marriage. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   State Defs.' Mot. Ex. 1, 2016 Agreement Between DHHS and St. Vincent, \u00a7 2.9(e).) Plaintiffs argue that the State's contracting practices, which are under challenge here, must comport with the Constitution. \"A statute\n   <em>\n    or practice\n   </em>\n   must conform to all [applicable constitutional] requirements to survive scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

(ECF No. 37, Pls.' Resp. to Intervenor Defs.' Mot. 13, PgID 832.)

But, in the case of an individual or an institution, the reverse is not true:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   It is true that religious people (or groups of religious people) cannot be denied the opportunity to exercise the rights of citizens simply because of their religious affiliations or commitments, for such a disability would violate the right to religious free exercise,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDaniel v.

But\n   <em>\n    McDaniel\n   </em>\n   , which held that a religious individual could not, because of his religious activities, be denied the right to hold political office, is not in point here. That individuals who happen to be religious may hold public office does not mean that a State may deliberately delegate discretionary power to an individual, institution, or community on the ground of religious identity. If New York were to delegate civic authority to \"the Grand Rebbe,\"\n   <em>\n    Larkin\n   </em>\n   would obviously require invalidation (even though under\n   <em>\n    McDaniel\n   </em>\n   the Grand Rebbe may run for, and serve on, his local school board), and the same is true if New York delegates political authority by reference to religious belief.

(Intervenor Defs.' Reply at 11, n. 9.) The Court rejects the Defendants' state action argument as discussed at length\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in Section III(E).

The Plaintiffs allege that \"[b]y statute, the State is responsible for the care of the children who are in Michigan's foster care system,\" and that the State has \"delegated its statutory child-welfare responsibilities to private agencies.\" (Compl. \u00b6 4.) There is nothing before this Court on these motions to dismiss to support the State Defendants' counsel's statements at the hearing that adoption and foster care services are not sufficiently \"exclusive\" governmental functions - in fact we know very little about how these child placing agencies actually operate in carrying out their contractual duties or the actual scope of those duties in practice. The Plaintiffs allege that the State Defendants could not turn away a same-sex couple on the basis of religious objections yet they acknowledge that they are permitting their delegated agencies, carrying out a State function, to do exactly what the Constitution forbids them to do. (Compl. \u00b6 9.) The State Defendants submit that their actions are constitutionally permissible because they are merely attempting to \"remain neutral\" by allowing the faith-based agencies to carry out their contractual duties based upon their religious beliefs. The State Defendants submit that this practice is supported by the secular need to provide the greatest availability of families for the State's wards. But these submissions directly contradict the allegations of Plaintiffs' Complaint which claim otherwise. The child placing agencies are, in many ways, the gateway for a family seeking to adopt or foster a child into Michigan's adoption and foster care system. The scope of their duties, and hence any \"government exclusivity\" of the functions they perform, must be the subject of further discovery. For purposes of analyzing Plaintiffs' Establishment Clause claim, the Court must accept the allegations of the Complaint as true and such allegations surely \"implicate\" the Establishment Clause and plausibly suggest \"excessive entanglement\" such that the Court will allow Plaintiffs' Establishment Clause claim to proceed further.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The Plaintiffs' Complaint directly contradicts the rationality of this alleged secular purpose, and alleges that allowing faith-based agencies to turn away same-sex couples actually \"exacerbates the shortage\" of qualified families who are available to adopt or foster and \"means that some children may be denied the family that is best matched to meet their individual needs.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   As stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in the Court's discussion of Plaintiffs' Establishment Clause claim, at this motion to dismiss stage the Court must accept the allegations of Plaintiffs' Complaint, and all reasonable inferences that flow from those factual allegations, as true and cannot credit the contradicting evidence or statements proffered by the Defendants at this point. Defendants argue, however, that in the case\n   of rational basis review, the Court cannot question the State's claimed purpose and therefore cannot credit the allegations of the Complaint for purposes of the Equal Protection analysis. Defendants are correct that this Court's review on a rational basis challenge is highly deferential.

Here, Plaintiffs assert that PA 53 was passed as a direct effort to oppose same-sex couples and to appease the anti-same-sex objections of certain legislators. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-46.) Plaintiffs argue that the stated Legislative purpose for PA 53 contained in the statute, i.e. to increase the likelihood that greater permanent placements could be achieved through allowing faith-based agencies to turn away same-sex couples, is completely irrational and that in fact the loss of potentially qualified same-sex couples exacerbates that shortage. And in fact, according to Defendants, the Legislature operated under the assumption that the faith-based agencies would shutter operations if they were not granted the religious belief exemption and that this would result in a devastating shortage of agencies to do the State's work and harm to the State's wards. Plaintiffs submit, however, that there is good reason to question the base rationality of those assumptions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fulton v.

Although their burden is admittedly high, Plaintiffs are entitled to an opportunity to conduct discovery to support their claim that the State's practice of continuing to contract with faith-based agencies that invoke PA53's religious belief protection to turn away same-sex couples lacks a rational basis and to further develop their Equal Protection claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

For example, Intervenor Defendants point out that every case on which Plaintiffs rely in support of their request for standing based on stigmatic harm involves the actual affirmative conduct of a state actor. (ECF No. 41, Intervenor Defs.' Reply 8-9, PgID 866-67). Here, according to the Defendants' characterization of the Plaintiffs' Complaint, the stigmatic harm allegedly flows from the private child placing agencies refusal to screen same-sex couples and referring them instead to other non-faith-based child placing agencies. According to the Intervenor Defendants, Plaintiffs have cited no case of \"stigmatic harm\" that involves a state actor passively \"allowing\" a private party with whom it has a contract to refuse to work with an individual or entity based on religious objections. Rather, Intervenor Defendants assert, in each case relied upon by Plaintiffs in support of their claim of stigmatic harm the plaintiff alleges that the actions of a government actor, not a private party, caused the stigma.

The State Defendants then argue that the Plaintiffs must satisfy the test for establishing that child placing agencies are \"state actors\" for purposes of the conduct complained of in Plaintiffs' Complaint. The State Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the public function test, the state compulsion test, or the symbiotic relationship test that govern this issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In their Reply, the State Defendants insist that because the child placing agencies \"are not state actors, Plaintiffs' claims fail as a matter of law.\" (ECF No. 30, State Defs.'

But even apart from\n   <em>\n    Brent\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiffs in this case have not sued any child placing agencies. Defendants stubbornly, and inappropriately, insist on rewriting the Plaintiffs' Complaint. Defendants' argument ignores the fact that these Plaintiffs did not file their claims against St. Vincent or any other child placing agency. They filed their claims against two state officials acting in their official capacities. Plaintiffs allege that \"the State caused [their] injuries by authorizing and failing to prevent the agencies' discrimination in the performance of State contracts.\" (ECF No. 28, Pls.' State Resp. 2, PgID 634.)

In reaching this conclusion, the court in\n   <em>\n    Lown\n   </em>\n   also relied on another case that Defendants urge this Court to consider,\n   <em>\n    Rendell-Baker v. Kohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195233\" index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/830/\">\n    457 U.S. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195233\" index=\"442\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/830/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195233\" index=\"443\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/830/\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). But both\n   <em>\n    Lown\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rendell-Baker\n   </em>\n   involved private party defendants who received substantial public funding and the decisions in both cases finding no state action turned on the absence of any allegation or evidence of the state's influence or involvement in the decisions of those private parties. In trying to align themselves with cases of this persuasion, the State Defendants assert that the Court must appreciate that the process of placing a child through the State adoption system involves a \"two-step\" process, and that the alleged discriminatory conduct at issue in this case occurs in the first of those two steps, in which the State claims it has no involvement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   State Defs.' Counsel: Right. Just to explain the referral process. The State does not go forward with any adoption or foster care service until it accepts a referral of a particular child from the State. Once it accepts that referral, the\n   agency is absolutely bound by that nondiscrimination provision that you just read including the prohibition against discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   State Defs.' Counsel: It's two separate processes.

Counsel: Yes, they can. Because where the State gets involved is only when that child referral is made. And if the agency doesn't have a child - or I'm sorry, a family to immediately place the child, they can decline it. And if they do, then they can accept it but they have a family they already know they're working with. It's at that point that the money starts to flow and you have this closer relationship between the State and the CPA but it's separated by the contractual process and PA 53 itself.... Under clear Supreme Court precedent, what the CPA does without the State commanding it to do is not state action that can be attributable to these state defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   (7/18/18 Hr'g Tr. 19:2-8, 19:14-20:4, 20:13-16.) The \"clear Supreme Court precedent\" to which counsel referred and went on to discuss was\n   <em>\n    Blum\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rendell-Baker.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The State Defendants' state action argument must fail, at least at this stage of the proceedings, because: (1) it ignores the language of both\n   <em>\n    Blum\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rendell-Baker\n   </em>\n   suggesting that the test is not whether the state \"commanded\" the action but whether the state \"overtly or covertly encouraged\" or \"influenced\" the challenged conduct; (2) it ignores the allegations of Plaintiffs' Complaint that plausibly suggest that a singular, unified contract governs the relationship between the State and a child placing agency and that contract does not clearly set forth such a bright-line distinction between funding for the recruitment and referral processes; and (3) it relies on factual assertions that impermissibly (at this stage of the proceedings) contradict the allegations of Plaintiff's Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The issue is not simply whether the State \"commanded\" the conduct challenged here - the inquiry is much more nuanced than that. And although there is a statutory provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20722\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .124e(1)(h), that provides that a child placing agency does not receive public funding with respect to a particular child unless the agency accepts the referral, the parties have pointed to nothing in the adoption services contracts that expressly governs how the child placing agency must allocate each dollar of those funds. The State Defendants suggest that an impenetrable line is drawn between \"recruitment\" and \"referral\" and that no funds flow from the State to any aspect of the \"recruitment\" process where the alleged discriminatory conduct occurs. This argument contradicts the allegations of Plaintiffs' Complaint, which alleges that the State pays these child placing agencies to perform the entirety of a single contract for public adoption and foster care services, a contract that addresses recruitment as well as referral, and in fact alleges that Plaintiffs do not challenge any agency's use of non-public funds. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8, 25, 32.) Plaintiffs' counsel described succinctly during oral argument the issues of fact that abound in this inquiry:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   The Court: Let me ask you a question. Do you dispute the issue of exactly when the funds flow -\n   Plaintiffs' Counsel: Yeah, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   The Court: - and how is this a question of fact or is this -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   Plaintiffs' Counsel: Well, there are some questions of fact in there that certainly that representation cannot be accepted on a motion to dismiss. But also stepping back, they are attempting to parse out the home studying part of their contracted services ... and say that's not really this delegated government function, that's not really the funded activity, because the payment arrangement they have ... with the State is they get paid by per diem rates for the children that they actually place. But the contract themselves specifically call for recruitment and licensing of families and, in fact, we allege in the complaint in paragraphs 25 and 32 that recruitment is a part of that work that they're contracted to do. You can't get funding by placing kids if you don't have families to place them with. And you can't have families to place them with if you don't do the licensing process which necessarily includes a home study. Home studying is not some thing they do for fun on the side that's unrelated to the contract ... They get to do that because they are contracted by the State to perform adoption and foster care services, so ... They are getting paid for providing child welfare services for the whole package of what they're providing, and the manner in which the State and the agencies have agreed to provide that payment was based in part on a per diem rate for children in their care. It's simply a matter of payment. It's not that it's different services. It's all part and parcel to the same services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   (Hr'g Tr. 84:12-21, 84:23-25, 85:2-13, 85:21-86:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   It is undisputed that the State contracts with the child placing agencies cover the whole range of adoption and foster care services, including recruitment and referral, and that the contracts expressly reference and incorporate the religious belief protection of PA 53, which suggests the State's imprimatur on the use of religious criteria in the very gateway to the State's adoption process. The Intervenor Defendants argued strenuously at the hearing on their motion to dismiss that the Court must look to where the money is actually being spent to determine whether a particular activity is being supported by state funding. (Hr'g Tr. 70:7-72:1.) Discovery is necessary to determine how the recruitment and referral process actually works and how the funds actually flow, as well as the legal relevance of that flow of funds on the facts that are revealed. The Court cannot accept the State's controverting assertions regarding this alleged \"bifurcation\" of the recruitment and referral processes at this pleading stage. Nor does the Court express any opinion on the legal significance of such a separation, even assuming it exists here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Plaintiffs have adequately alleged state action, whether viewed as an issue of standing or as an element of their substantive constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

(Intervenor Defs.' Mot. 14-24.) As Plaintiffs correctly observe, none of these affirmative\n   defenses are relevant to the only issue before the Court - whether Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded cognizable Establishment Clause and Equal Protection claims. Even looking forward at this pleading stage to the potential effects of this Court's granting Plaintiffs the relief they seek, the Court is unconvinced that St. Vincent can prevail on a claim that prohibiting the State from allowing the use of religious criteria by those private agencies hired to do the State's work would violate St. Vincent's Free Exercise or Free Speech rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   St. Vincent relies primarily on four cases, none of which compels the Court to reach the conclusions they urge.

The Fifth Circuit draws on the distinction between\n    <em>\n     Allen\n    </em>\n    and its progeny on the one hand, which require a personal denial of equal treatment, and the Establishment Clause cases which find sufficient basis for standing in injuries caused by \"unwanted and unwelcome\" exposure to a religious display - an injury that would not suffice under the Equal Protection clause. In this case, Plaintiffs have claimed injury from stigma caused by an actual incident directed to them personally, being turned away from certain faith-based child placing agencies, and not from abstract stigmatic harm generally to same-sex couples. These allegations would satisfy the more stringent of the two tests at this pleading stage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    The Prospective Parent Plaintiffs assert taxpayer standing as an alternate basis for their Establishment Clause Claim and\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    as a basis for their Equal Protection Claim.

Although the Sixth Circuit saw \"no occasion to revisit [its] holding in\n    <em>\n     Pedreira I\n    </em>\n    ,\" it did acknowledge that both\n    <em>\n     Flast\n    </em>\n    conditions must exist in order for a plaintiff to establish state taxpayer standing.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458281,5917929\" index=\"506\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1436/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    The Court notes that\n    <em>\n     Amos\n    </em>\n    , like many of the Establishment Clause cases relied upon by the Defendants, came to the Supreme Court on a summary judgment record.

In\n    <em>\n     Brent\n    </em>\n    , Judge Julian Abele Cook was considering the very different issue, not before this Court, of whether the private entity defendants sued there, which provided contractual services for the State, could be considered state actors for purposes of liability under \u00a7 1983. Plaintiffs here have not sued any private child placing agencies. But more importantly, the Sixth Circuit recently reversed this aspect of Judge Cook's November 15, 2012 Opinion and Order in\n    <em>\n     Brent v.

As\n    <em>\n     Blum\n    </em>\n    makes clear, Defendants' \"state action\" argument is more appropriately addressed as a merits argument rather than a standing argument.
