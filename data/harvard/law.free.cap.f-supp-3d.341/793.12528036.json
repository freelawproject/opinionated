Plaintiffs Marc and Cindy Olsen are the parents of Emile. Plaintiff C.O. is the sister of Emilie. Emilie committed suicide in December of 2014. Plaintiffs claim that Emilie's suicide was the result of bullying Emilie suffered at school and online. Plaintiffs claim that Emile, a female Asian-American, suffered bullying, harassment, assault, battery, and discrimination because of her race, national origin, and gender, and her association with Caucasian students, and also based upon sex stereotyping and upon her perceived sexual orientation and practices. Plaintiffs claim that when they tried to end the bullying and asked school officials for help, school officials failed to stop the bullying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs have brought twenty-two claims.
