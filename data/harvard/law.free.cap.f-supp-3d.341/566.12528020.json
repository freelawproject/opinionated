Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A federal grand jury returned a one-count indictment against defendant Jamal Brooks (\"Brooks\") for possessing a firearm and ammunition while being a convicted felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). (ECF No. 15.) Brooks filed a motion to dismiss\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing, among other things, that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him because his disqualifying conviction, a misdemeanor conviction for carrying a firearm without a license in violation of 18 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 6106(a)(2), was not for a serious offense. (ECF No. 39 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Case Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 28, 2018, the court held a hearing with respect to Brooks' motion to dismiss and other pretrial motions. The court at the hearing explained that it would apply the two-step analysis set forth by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Binderup v. Attorney General\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2016) (en banc) to analyze Brooks' as-applied constitutional attack on \u00a7 922(g)(1). That two-step analysis requires the court to consider evidence and legal argument presented by the parties to determine (1) whether \u00a7 922(g)(1), a presumptively lawful regulation, burdens Brooks' Second Amendment rights, and, if so, (2) whether \u00a7 922(g)(1) satisfies intermediate scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court permitted the parties to file supplemental briefing to address the parties' burdens of proof and whether the Federal Rules of Evidence applied to the court's consideration of evidence submitted with respect to the two-part\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 24, 2018, this court issued an opinion on procedural matters and explained that at step one of its\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   analysis, the court would find the facts and determine whether Brooks satisfied his burden to make a strong showing that his disqualifying conviction was not for a serious offense, i.e., his circumstances are distinguished from the class of persons historically barred from exercising their Second Amendment rights and he can overcome the presumptive lawfulness of \u00a7 922(g)(1). If Brooks satisfied his burden, the burden would shift under step two to the government. At step two, the court would find the facts and determine whether the government met its burden to show that prohibiting persons like Brooks from bearing arms under \u00a7 922(g)(1) is substantially related to its important interest of promoting public safety and preventing armed mayhem. If Brooks satisfies step one, the government's evidence at step two must be meaningful to strip him of his Second Amendment rights. The court explained that it would not strictly apply the Federal Rules of Evidence to its consideration of the evidence and may consider hearsay evidence. (ECF No. 60 at 25-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 25, 2018, and July 10, 2018, the court held a hearing for the parties to present evidence to satisfy their respective burdens under\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   . Both parties entered into evidence exhibits, and the government presented the testimony of seven witnesses. On August 20, 2018, the parties filed their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon consideration of the parties' submissions, the testimony and documentary\n   evidence presented at the hearing held on June 25, 2018, and July 10, 2018, and the arguments made by counsel, the court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Brooks' Relevant Juvenile Conviction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   1. On January 22, 2008, Brooks-at the age of fifteen years old-was adjudicated delinquent for possession of heroin, possession of ecstasy, and possession of a small amount of marijuana. (Ex. 1 at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Vehicle Shooting on April 19, 2015\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   2. Joi Clark (\"Clark\") and Felicia Johnson (\"Johnson\") testified with respect to a shooting that occurred on April 19, 2015. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 32, 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   3. Clark and Johnson in the early morning hours of April 19, 2015, were at 5406 Columbo Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,\n   which was a \"row house\" amongst three other row houses (\"Johnson's row house\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33, 44.) Johnson's row house was in the middle of two of the four row houses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.) Johnson's three minor children also lived at the row house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.) As of April 19, 2015, Johnson had lived at her row house for two to three years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   4. On April 18, 2015, at about 11:00 p.m., Johnson drove Clark to her row house in Clark's sister's vehicle, a white 2012 Ford Fusion (the \"Ford Fusion\"), which they parked near Johnson's row house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33, 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   5. Shortly after Johnson's and Clark's arrival at Johnson's row house, a neighbor who lived in a row house next to Johnson's row house banged on the door. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 34-35, 45-46.) Johnson recognized the neighbor; she had seen him \"often\" prior to April 19, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   6. The following exchange took place between Johnson and the government during the June 25, 2018 hearing with respect to whether Brooks was the neighbor involved in the incident with Clark and Johnson on April 19, 2015:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q. Do you see that individual here in the courtroom today?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. You are standing in front of him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q. Excuse me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A. I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q. It's okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. He got a haircut and he didn't have a beard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q. Are you indicating that the defendant is that person but appeared differently? Do you need some additional time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A. He just looks different. I don't remember him having a lot of hair or that beard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q. The person that you saw at your door that night, what do you recall him looking like?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A. He's like probably two inches taller than me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q. How tall are you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A. I'm only about 5'5?.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q. Do you recall anything else about him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A. He was little. He wasn't big. He wasn't a big guy. Like the build seems him. He just looks different with the hair and the beard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 46-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   7. Clark was in the living room of Johnson's row house and there were children present in Johnson's row house at the time the neighbor knocked on the door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   8. According to Clark, when Johnson opened the door, the neighbor said: \"I'm tired of you expletives, dealing with you and this parking[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.) The neighbor drew a firearm from his right pocket, pointed it at Johnson's face, turned around, and shot the Ford Fusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, 37, 48.) Clark testified that the firearm was \"no more than two feet\" from Johnson's face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Johnson testified that the neighbor pointed the gun at her before he shot the Ford Fusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.) Clark testified the neighbor \"seemed aggressive, angry, upset\" and \"already enraged[.]\" (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 36-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   9. Johnson testified that the neighbor previously on other occasions asked that she move the car because the neighbor wanted to park his vehicle directly in front of his row house. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 47.) She testified as follows with respect to her recollection of her interaction with the neighbor on April 19, 2015: \"We were getting dressed. I was upstairs. They said someone was knocking on the\n   door and it was the neighbor asking to move the car. By the time I got downstairs, I was saying we're not moving the car until we leave, because we're about to leave.\" (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 45.) Johnson described the neighbor's demeanor as \"very aggressive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   10. The Ford Fusion was parked six to ten feet away from Johnson's row house, and bullets from the neighbor's firearm struck the Ford Fusion. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 38.) Clark testified that the right front headlight and tires \"were shot[,]\" and there was a total of \"about six...holes in the car.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   11. Clark could see the neighbor, who was a short male, from her position in the living room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36.) Clark testified that the neighbor \"looked African American\" but maybe \"was mixed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Clark could not remember whether Johnson moved onto the porch to speak with the neighbor or stood in the doorway of her row house during the altercation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Johnson testified: \"Like, he was inside the doorway, so I pushed him outside, and then I shut the screen and he was talking, saying I need to move the car. Went to the grass. I need to move the car, and he shot the car.\" (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   12. Johnson called 9-1-1. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 39.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Police officers with the Pittsburgh Police responded to the scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   13. Specifically, Pittsburgh Police Officer Aaron Obsenica (\"Obsenica\") and his partner Gregory Livesey (\"Livesey\") were dispatched to Johnson's row house at approximately 1:15 a.m. on April 19, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55.) Obsenica was the lead officer at the scene, i.e., \"other officers...performed different tasks and reported\" to Obsenica at the scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   14. The officers received \"a report of a male shooting the complainant's car.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The officers arrived at the scene within three minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) All other officers that were available at the time were dispatched to Johnson's row house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   15. Obsenica was informed by a fellow officer that Johnson stated Brooks fired three shots into the Ford Fusion and he may have entered his row house. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   16. Obsenica observed that the Ford Fusion had two bullet holes below the passenger side headlight and one bullet hold through the headlight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   17. Other officers questioned Clark and Johnson, Clark identified the neighbor as the actor, and the officers searched the area for him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40, 50, 57.) According to Obsenica, Johnson reported that Brooks used one silver pistol to shoot the Ford Fusion and pointed a second black pistol at her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   18. The police officers hailed Brooks' girlfriend, R'Vaenita Squires (\"Squires\") and five or six small children from the row house next to Johnson's row house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.) The police officers searched that row house, but did not find Brooks at that location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Squires told the officers that Brooks fled from the scene in a white Chevy Tahoe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   19. The police officers later determined that Brooks fled in a white Chevy Tahoe. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 65.) A few minutes after the officers searched Brooks' row house, another Pittsburgh Police Officer recovered Brooks' Chevy Tahoe \"[a] couple blocks\" away from the scene in the area of \"Hillcrest and North Aiken Avenue[.]\" (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 58-59.) Obsenica determined the Chevy Tahoe was registered to Brooks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   20. The Pittsburgh Police did not locate Brooks on April 19, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.) Obsenica filed a criminal complaint charging him with, among other felony crimes, \"two counts of firearm not to be carried without a license in violation of 6106 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code\" because Brooks did not have a license to carry a firearm on April 19, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Brooks was also charged with aggravated assault because he pointed a gun at Johnson and fired a gun into the vehicle and criminal mischief in light of the damage done to the vehicle by the shots fired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62.) Obsenica obtained an arrest warrant for Brooks at the time he filed the criminal complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Brooks was eventually apprehended on the charges filed by Obsenica. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   21. Clark became aware that the Pittsburgh Police charged an individual with crimes with respect to the incident that took place on April 19, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.) Clark testified at the preliminary hearing with respect to those charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Clark was informed that the case was \"sent to court[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.) Clark, however, did not appear to testify at the trial of the charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   22. Johnson was summoned to appear in court to testify with respect to the incident. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 51-52.) She, however, did not appear because she was scared; the neighbor and his girlfriend \"were practically still living there.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   23. Obsenica testified at the preliminary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 63.) The case was held for trial, but the charges were nolle prossed because-despite Obsenica calling Johnson and Clark on the telephone and informing them about the trial-neither Johnson nor Clark attended the trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   24. Johnson testified that the neighbor typically drove a large Chevy truck \"SUV.\" (H.T. 6/25/2018 (EC No. 65) at 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   25. Based upon the circumstantial evidence presented by the government, the court finds that on April 19, 2015, Brooks was the neighbor who approached Johnson's row house, pointed a gun at her, fired shots into the Ford Fusion, and fled the scene in a white Chevy Tahoe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     May 5, 2015 Incident at Club Taboo\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   26. On May 5, 2015, Obsenica and Pittsburgh Police Officers Geno Macioce (\"Macioce\"), Timothy Matson (\"Matson\"), and Dustin Rummel (\"Rummel\"), among others, were dispatched to a bar called Club Taboo located in the Homewood area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in response to a report of an armed robbery in progress. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 64, 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   27. When Macioce arrived on scene, he spoke to a male named Malcom Hill (\"Hill\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71.) Hill informed Macioce that he was the disc jockey (\"D.J.\") at Club Taboo that night. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While Hill loaded his D.J. equipment into his car, which was parked directly in front of Club Taboo, he was approached by a short black male wearing a ski mask who brandished a silver revolver and demanded Hill's backpack containing $1,300.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hill gave the male the backpack, and the male took off running on Bennett Street toward Conemaugh Street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   28. The actor was a black male, had a beard, and was about five foot, five inches tall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72, 79.) The actor's description was put out over the radio to the responding officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   29. In the direction in which the actor ran, there was a parking lot in which school buses were parked. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 74.) Matson and Rummel observed a short male with a beard wearing a mask and all dark clothing coming from the area in which the school buses were located. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75, 90.) Rummel exited his patrol vehicle to \"get closer to the male without him noticing\" Rummel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90.) The male, however, saw Rummel and started to flee from his direction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rummel engaged in a foot pursuit of the actor, i.e., in a \"full-out sprint[,]\" when they were about fifty to one hundred feet away\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   from each other. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91-93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   30. Matson and Rummel reported on the radio and later directly to Macioce that \"they observed a male fitting the description near the school buses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75.) The man fled through a backyard and the parking lot and onto to Conemaugh Street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75, 92.) At that point, Rummel commanded \"Pittsburgh Police, stop[,]\" but the actor disregarded Rummel's commands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92.) The actor kept running through an open yard and Rummel could hear what sounded like the actor jumping over a chain link fence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) By the time Rummel arrived at Frankstown Avenue, he could no longer see the actor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93.) The area in which Rummel chased the actor was dark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   31. The police officers eventually searched the school buses for other actors, firearms, other weapons, and evidence of a crime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75.) A ski mask was retrieved from the officers' search of the school buses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The ski mask was submitted for \"DNA testing\" and \"no conclusions could be drawn regarding whether...Brooks was a contributor to the DNA on the ski mask[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98; Ex. I.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   32. Rummel called out over the police radio that he lost the actor during the foot-chase. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 64-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   33. Obsenica and Rummel canvassed the area around Club Taboo to look for the actor. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 65, 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   34. A firearm was recovered on Conemaugh Street on the path on which the actor ran and a key\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   was recovered in between the two houses in which Rummel chased the actor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   35. Specifically, Matson recovered the firearm where the actor first saw Rummel and began to run to the right through a backyard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94.) Matson found the firearm \"right on the sidewalk\" on the path Rummel was following the actor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103.) Matson packaged the firearm and someone else handled \"further investigative work\" with respect to the firearm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102-03.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   36. The firearm was a black Taurus nine millimeter semiautomatic handgun loaded with ammunition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-78.) The firearm recovered on Conemaugh Street was registered to Brooks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.) Despite Hill's report that the actor brandished a silver firearm, a silver firearm was\n   not recovered on May 5, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85.) Macioce, however, determined that Brooks owned a silver firearm at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   37. Rummel determined that the set of car keys he recovered in between the two houses belonged to a white Chevy Tahoe parked next to Club Taboo. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 65, 80.) The vehicle was registered to Squires,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   who Obsenica recognized as Brooks' girlfriend, and the registration provided the address at which the officers believed Brooks lived. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Obsenica recognized the white Chevy Tahoe as the vehicle Brooks used in connection with the April 19, 2015 shooting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Macioce obtained a search warrant for the white Chevy Tahoe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   38. The white Chevy Tahoe was towed. Macioce obtained a search warrant to search the white Chevy Tahoe. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 82.) Macioce described the items recovered during the search as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   I know there was like a wallet found with the initials JB on it. Inside that were several cards that had the name Jamal Brooks on it, as well the license plate was found in the map pocket of the driver's seat, so the pocket that's behind the driver's seat. That license plate was the license plate Officer Obsenica knew from his prior experience with that vehicle, and upon running the registration plate, it returned a record for Jamal Brooks at the address on, I believe, Columbo.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82.) The officers also found a holster molded to fit a revolver and a small amount of marijuana and a smoking pipe in the white Chevy Tahoe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   39. Macioce charged Brooks with, among other felony crimes, robbery and firearms not to be carried without a license. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 83.) Brooks was eventually apprehended on the charges, and Macioce and Hill appeared at the preliminary hearing with respect to those charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The charges were held for court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   40. The charges were nolle prossed because Hill was unable to be located. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 84.) Macioce went to Hill's home on more than one occasion, he made several telephone calls to Hill, and he made contact with Hill's mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Macioce believed that Hill's telephone was eventually disconnected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   41. The courts finds that based upon the circumstantial evidence presented by the government, Brooks is the individual whom brandished a firearm in the presence of Hill, stole Hill's backpack containing $1,300.00, fled the scene, and engaged Matson and Rummel in a foot chase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Brooks' Disqualifying Conviction, Which Occurred on May 15, 2015\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   42. On May 15, 2015, Brian Pazak (\"Pazak\") worked as a patrol sergeant for Frazier Township. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 22-23.) On that day at around 6:00 p.m., he and fellow officer Daniel Olszewski were dispatched to a Wal-Mart to respond to a complaint of retail theft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.) Upon arriving on scene, Pazak encountered Wal-Mart's loss prevention officer who reported that he had one male and one female in custody for shoplifting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   43. The loss prevention officer informed Pazak that the male and female worked together placing items from the store into a diaper bag and large black purse. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 22-23.) Pazak learned twenty-seven items were recovered for a total of $114.83 in merchandise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   44. Pazak positively identified the female whose last name was Squires. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) The male, however, gave a false name and date of birth and was combative with the officers when they asked a second time for his identification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25, 29.) The officers initially were unable to identify him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   45. Pazak spoke with Squires and asked for her cooperation to identify the male. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) She told Pazak the male was \"Jamal Brooks\" and his birthdate was November 1, 1991. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 26.) Pazak confirmed with the Allegheny County dispatch the information he received from Squires. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   46. Pazak at the hearing held on June 25, 2018, identified Brooks as the male he encountered at the Wal-Mart on June 25, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   47. Pazak placed Brooks under arrest for retail theft and false identification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   48. Brooks was searched incident to arrest and a \"black full sized Glock model 21C .45 caliber\" was recovered from under his t-shirt in a brown leather holster from his left hip. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   49. Pazak learned that Brooks did not have a valid license to carry a concealed firearm, and there was no indication that the firearm was registered to a particular person or was reported stolen. (H.T. 6/25/2018 (ECF No. 65) at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   50. Brooks was charged with (1) one count of carrying a firearm without a license, in violation of 18 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 6106 (third-degree felony) (\"count one\"); (2) one count of providing false identification to law enforcement, in violation of 18 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 4914 (third-degree misdemeanor) (\"count two\"); (3) one count of retail theft, in violation of 18 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 3929(a)(1) (summary offense) (\"count three\"); and (4) one count of criminal conspiracy to commit retail theft, in violation of 18 PA. CONS.

On April 14, 2016, defendant in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County entered into a negotiated guilty plea. (Ex. H at 7.) The presiding judge granted the Commonwealth's motion to reduce count one from a felony in the third degree to a misdemeanor in the first degree. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 55-2 at 2 (\"The Commonwealth moves to amend counts [sic] # 1 to a (M1) Motion Granted By The Court\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   52. Brooks pleaded guilty to count one, as amended, as well as to counts two through four. (Exs. A, B, H at 8.) Brooks was sentenced to a term of probation of one year at count one, which was graded as a misdemeanor in the first degree, and \"[a] determination of guilty without further penalty\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   was entered against Brooks\n   at counts two through four. (ECF No. 55-2 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   53. On a form entitled \"Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing\" (the \"sentencing form\") there is a handwritten note that provides: \"Ct 2,3,4-WD[.]\" (Ex. B (ECF No. 55-2) at 5.) In the section of the sentencing form entitled \"Offense Name/Description\" the only offense listed is \"Firearms-carried w/o license: ineligible (loaded ammo/available).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   54. In the same handwriting on the sentencing form there are alterations that reflect a change in the grade of the offense from \"F-3\" to \"M1\" and a change in the range of imprisonment from 42 to 84 months to 30 to 60 months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   55. The sentencing form also shows that a term of probation of twelve months was imposed and Brooks was convicted via a negotiated guilty plea. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The sentencing form was signed by the judge presiding over Brooks' state court criminal case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   56. The \"Order of Sentence\" issued by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   - Brooks was sentenced to a term of probation of one year at count one for the crime of \"Firearm Not to be Carried W/O License-No Crim Viol (M1)[;]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   - with respect to counts two, three, and four, \"[a] determination of guilty without further penalty[;]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   - with respect to count five, entitled \"Firearms Not to Be Carried W/O License (M3)[,]\" \"Offense Disposition: Charge Changed[;]\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   - with respect to \"[c]ount 9,999[,]\" \"Firearm Not to Be Carried W/O License-No Crim Viol ( )[,]\" \"Offense Disposition: Withdrawn (Lower Court).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (Ex.

On July 23, 2017, at 3:28 a.m., Adam Quinn (\"Quinn\") and Adam Lawrence (\"Lawrence\"), police officers with the Penn Hills Police Department were dispatched to a residence on Leechburg Road for a reported robbery in progress during which one of the actors shot one of the victims. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 3-4, 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   58. When Quinn arrived on scene, he saw Tia Collins,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the person who called 9-1-1, and her husband, Cordell Collins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 5.) Tia Collins was lying on the ground \"in obvious pain\" in the front yard, and Cordell Collins was kneeling next to her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   59. Quinn learned that Tia Collins had been struck in the head. Tia Collins was conscious but dizzy when he encountered her. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 6.) Quinn requested \"EMS assistance\" to treat Tia Collins. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Penn Hills EMS arrived on scene, rendered aide to Tia Collins, and transported her to Forbes Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cordell Collins accompanied Tia Collins to the hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   60. Before Tia Collins was transported to the hospital, she spoke with Quinn for\n   \"[a]pproximately five minutes.\" (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 7.) She told him that she left her husband's nightclub, i.e., Club Elegance, and parked her vehicle in her driveway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Upon exiting her vehicle, she saw two men approach her vehicle from a van, which they parked perpendicular to her vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) Tia Collins told Quinn that the two men were African-American and wore masks; one man was wearing a blue t-shirt and the other man wore a black hooded sweatshirt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The men approached her, drew a pistol, and dragged her to the front porch by her throat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She was struck in the back of the head with a pistol, which rendered her unconscious. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   61. Tia Collins reported that her purse, which contained her \"SIG Sauer\" pistol with serial number F309749, was taken from her possession during the course of the alleged robbery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 52, 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   62. At some point after July 23, 2017, Tia Collins told Jonathan Duthinh (\"Duthinh\"), an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, that one of the actors was \"six feet or above\" and put her into a headlock and the other actor was shorter, i.e., \"between 5'5? and 5'7,? \" and held a pistol to her head. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 70.) Tia Collins told Duthinh that the shorter actor hit her on the head with the pistol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   63. Quinn also spoke to Cordell Collins. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 7-8.) Cordell Collins told Quinn that he left Club Elegance ten minutes after his wife's departure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) He reported that \"[h]e returned home, parked his vehicle in the driveway, started to approach his front porch when a bright light hit him in the face, which he presumed to be a flashlight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   64. Cordell Collins asked the person on his porch \"[w]hat do you want?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) The person responded: \"[y]ou know what we want.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cordell Collins reported to Quinn that at that point, he fled the property, tripped across the street, fell over, and one of the actors shot at him twice from about five yards away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cordell Collins could not provide a description of the actors because of the bright light he encountered upon exiting his vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   65. Quinn's police report with respect to the incident on July 23, 2017, provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Cordell was also unable to provide a description of the actors. I observed that Cordell, who is a heavy set male, was not sweating despite the extremely high humidity causing myself and other officers to sweat. I also observed that Cordell's clothing was not wet despite the grass where he stated he fell being wet from recent rainfall. Cordell was also calm while speaking with the PD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   66. Tia Collins and Cordell Collins told Quinn the actors left their property in a vehicle, but they could not provide a vehicle description. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   67. During the time Tia Collins was being treated by the EMS, a neighbor approached one of the other police officers on the scene and told him that he or she heard two gun shots in the area of the front yard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   68. After Tia Collins and Cordell Collins were transported to Forbes Hospital, Quinn and another police officer canvassed the area for shell casings, but no shell casings were located. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) Quinn then \"went to the active perimeter scene taking place in Verona.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   69. Quinn did not personally observe the suspects and could not describe them based upon his personal observations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Quinn did not know whether the area was processed by a mobile crime lab. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) As of July 10, 2018, charges\n   were not filed and no one had been arrested or convicted with respect to the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   70. Prior to being dispatched to the Collins' residence, Lawrence was at a gas station with other police officers. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 19.) Once the officers received the call with respect to the incident at the Collins' residence, they drove to the call. Lawrence's police car was the last in a line of police cars heading in the direction of the Collins' residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   71. While the other police cars drove straight on Verona Road, Lawrence took an alternate route via Shannon Road to \"cover more area and maybe encounter suspects fleeing[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   72. Once Lawrence turned right off Second Street onto Shannon Road, he saw a vehicle in his lane of travel, i.e., driving in the opposing lane of travel. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 20.) Lawrence explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   They just had passed a vehicle, and this is a two lane road, one lane in each direction. They just passed a vehicle coming to the end of the roadway which is a T intersection with the stop sign. The stop sign is on their end, and I had to lock up my brakes, stop to avoid a head-on collision with them, and they proceeded past me and ran the stop sign and turned left on to 2nd Street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The vehicle observed by Lawrence was a \"newer\" gray sedan with an Ohio registration plate and had two occupants, i.e., a driver and front seat passenger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lawrence described the driver as a \"light skinned black male with black dreadlocks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) Lawrence could not describe the passenger of the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lawrence testified that Brooks \"is not a light skinned black male[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   73. Lawrence explained that the vehicle, which almost struck his police vehicle, appeared to be \"trying to quickly get away from a certain area\" and was coming from the direction of the Collins' residence. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 24.) He suspected that the vehicle was involved in the alleged robbery that had taken place at the Collins' residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lawrence, therefore, turned his police vehicle around and began to pursue the gray sedan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   74. Lawrence pursued the gray sedan as it drove down various streets in the area, and he observed several traffic violations\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   during the pursuit. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 25.) For example, the gray sedan did not have its lights on, which made it more difficult for the vehicle to be detected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) The gray sedan was travelling at a rate of forty to fifty miles per hour on side streets and residential streets, which have speed limits of twenty-five miles per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   75. Lawrence eventually lost sight of the gray sedan because he could not see the vehicle's taillights. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   76. A few moments after Lawrence lost sight of the gray sedan, a police officer with the Verona Police Department located the vehicle crashed nearby at the intersection of Penn Street and Allegheny Avenue. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 27.) The vehicle was wrecked into a fence of a parking lot, there were no occupants inside the vehicle, the engine was running, and\n   the vehicle was partially on the roadway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   77. Lawrence determined the vehicle was registered to Enterprise Rental Car. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 28.) The vehicle was rented by Brooks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52, 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   78. Lawrence and other police officers with the assistance of two police service dogs searched the area in which the gray sedan was crashed in an attempt to locate its occupants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.) Lawrence briefly participated in the search and inventoried the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   79. Lawrence, while taking an inventory of the crashed gray sedan, made a list of the items that were taken out of the vehicle and a property record\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   was completed by a Penn Hills Police Department detective.

The parties in this case dispute whether the court should consider the offense with which Brooks was convicted a misdemeanor or felony. That distinction is important because Judge Ambro noted in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   that a challenger convicted of a felony would have a \"extraordinarily high\" burden, \"perhaps even insurmountable\" to show his or her crime was not serious.\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   353 n.6 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government argues that Brooks' underlying predicate offense, i.e., carrying a firearm without a license, is a serious offense because-despite the state court grading the offense as a misdemeanor at sentencing-the Pennsylvania legislature has determined that when an individual carries a firearm without a license under the circumstances present in this case\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"the conduct, as a matter of law, should be considered serious and graded as a felony.\" (ECF No. 72 at 16.)

The Pennsylvania state legislature in section 6106 grades the offense of carrying a firearm without a license a misdemeanor (as opposed to a felony) only if the defendant (a) \"is otherwise eligible to possess a valid license[;]\" and (b) \"has not committed any other criminal violation\" at the same time. 18 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 6106(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   39. Here, Brooks pleaded guilty to committing three other crimes\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the\n   time he violated section 6106, i.e., a third-degree misdemeanor and two summary offenses, and he was not otherwise eligible to obtain a license to carry a concealed firearm because of his juvenile adjudication of delinquency on January 22, 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   40. All the evidence received by this court, however, shows that Brooks pursuant a negotiated plea agreement pleaded guilty to violating section 6106(a)(2), and the court at sentencing graded the offense as a misdemeanor in the first degree. The \"Order of Sentence\" provides that the felony in the third degree count was \"[c]hanged\" and Brooks was sentenced only at the count containing the misdemeanor in the first degree. (ECF No. 55-2.) \"A determination of guilty without further penalty\" was made at counts two through four. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) That Brooks\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    should have\n   </em>\n   been convicted of a felony or that the sentencing judge made a mistake is not relevant to the court's inquiry under step one, which is to analyze the seriousness of a\n   <em>\n    disqualifying conviction\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   by assessing \"objective indications of seriousness,\" such as, \"the elements of the offense, the actual sentence, and the state of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   353 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   41.

In this case, Brooks, the Commonwealth, and the judge agreed that at sentencing that offense would be graded a misdemeanor in the first degree.

The approach championed by the government in this case and followed in\n   <em>\n    Gurten\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   i.e., consideration of the predicate offense with which a challenger\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have been charged at the state level instead of the\n   <em>\n    actual disqualifying conviction\n   </em>\n   , encourages federal district courts to second guess the actions of state court judges based upon differing interpretations of state legislation. While the government is correct that the court of appeals in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   was concerned with the state legislatures' grading of the challengers' offenses, the court did not make any inquiries into the offenses with which the challengers\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    should have\n   </em>\n   been charged in accordance with the court of appeals' interpretation of state laws. That is what the government asks the court to do in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   50. Criminal defendants often are permitted by prosecutors to plead to lesser included offenses, which in effect appears to be what happened in Brooks' case, and those defendants are not later treated as if they pleaded to the full offense. In any\n   event, this court is not privy to the decision-making process of the prosecutor who negotiated Brooks' plea agreement or the judge who accepted it. The court is, therefore, without the proper basis or authority to second guess the grading of Brooks' disqualifying conviction or otherwise change it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   51. Based upon the foregoing, Brooks' disqualifying conviction was carrying a firearm without a license, a misdemeanor in the first degree. The grading of the offense, i.e., a misdemeanor, weighs in favor of a finding that Brooks' disqualifying conviction was not a serious offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Elements of the Offense\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   52.

It is impossible to reconcile the position of the Commonwealth during Brooks' state court proceeding with respect to his disqualifying conviction, i.e., its agreement to the misdemeanor grading and probationary sentence, and the government's position in this case, i.e., Brooks' underlying conviction was so serious that he should be stripped of his Second Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hatfield v.

Congress defunded the \"unworkable\" program because a determination about whether a particular felon posed a danger to public safety \"was\n   <em>\n    too prone to error.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   93. Judge Fuentes argued that the \u00a7 925(c) procedure, which considered the circumstances of a particular felon, was an in effect an as-applied challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1), which Congress found to be unworkable. According to Judge Fuentes, that determination by Congress to foreclose the \u00a7 925(c) as-applied challenges to \u00a7 922(g)(1) should have a \"profound impact\" on the court's consideration of the as-applied challenges of Binderup and Suarez.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   94. Judge Fuentes countered any overbreadth arguments by recognizing the \"numerous safety valves\" available to disarmed felons, i.e., petitioning the state legislature to amend the law on the underlying predicate offense, having the underlying predicate offense expunged, set aside, or pardoned, petitioning Congress for redress, and the \"offense-specific carve-outs from \u00a7 922(g)(1).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   95.

Judge Ambro determined, however, that evidence about their disqualifying convictions and the statistical evidence presented by the government did not help the court predict whether Binderup and Suarez were likely to commit crimes in the future, and thus, whether disarming them under \u00a7 922(g)(1) was constitutional.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 354 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   101.

A key to a Brooks' to a white Chevy Tahoe was found in the path on which the black male ran from Rummel. Brooks' white Chevy Tahoe was found near Club Taboo. The vehicle was registered to his girlfriend, Squires, but and contained Brooks' wallet and the license plate that was on the vehicle on April 29, 2015, during the shooting at Johnson's row house. Hill could not be located to testify at Brooks' trial with respect to this incident. The evidence presented shows that it was more likely than not Brooks who robbed Hill at gunpoint and ran from the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   106. Ten days later, on May 15, 2015, Brooks engaged in the offense for which he sustained his disqualifying conviction by carrying a firearm without a license in a Wal-Mart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   107. On July 23, 2017, Brooks held a pistol to Tia Collins' head and then knocked her unconscious with the pistol. Two shots were fired after Cordell Collins arrived on scene. Shortly after the 9-1-1 call was placed, Lawrence witnessed a gray sedan with an Ohio license plate being driven erratically from the direction of the Collins' residence. Lawrence attempted to follow the vehicle, but lost sight of it because its taillights were not on. A few minutes later, the Verona police located a crashed gray sedan with an Ohio license plate. The following items, among others, were found inside the vehicle: two firearms registered to Brooks; Tia Collins' firearm (which she reported was stolen during the robbery); paperwork for firearms in Brooks' name and address; retail reward cards in Squires' name; Brooks' wallet, including his driver's license and credit cards; and a cellular telephone registered to Brooks. The evidence provided by the government circumstantially establishes that the actors in the gray sedan with a Ohio license plate were driving away from the Collins' residence, where they engaged in gun violence and a robbery, and Brooks was one of the actors in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   108. Based upon the foregoing, the particular category of persons relevant to the intermediate scrutiny analysis in this case is \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     people who have a history of engaging in gun violence, were convicted of a misdemeanor for carrying a firearm without a license, received a sentence of probation, and continued to engage in gun violence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   109. The court must now determine whether the government satisfied its burden to show that barring firearm possession by that particular category of individuals, which includes Brooks, is substantially related to its interest in promoting public safety and preventing armed mayhem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   110. According to Brooks, the government cannot satisfy that burden because it did not present any empirical evidence about the risk of recidivism with respect to that category of people. (ECF No. 73 at 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   111. This case, however, is unlike any other decision applying the\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   two-part framework. The government showed that the challenger in this case, i.e., Brooks, engaged in gun violence prior to his disqualifying conviction and continued to engage in gun violence after the disqualifying conviction. Brooks, however, was not criminally convicted of those acts of gun violence.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting neither Binderup nor Suarez had sustained any other convictions since their disqualifying convictions, specifically Suarez had \"led a life free of run-ins with the law\");\n   <em>\n    Holloway v.

The court has an ample basis on which to conclude that the government satisfied its burden to show that it is more likely than not that people like Brooks are likely to recidivate and engage in violent activities with firearms in the future, and, therefore, barring people like them from possessing a firearm under \u00a7 922(g)(1) is substantially related to the government's important interest of promoting public safety and preventing armed mayhem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

While Brooks satisfied his burden to show that his disqualifying conviction was not serious, the government satisfied its burden to show that disarming people like Brooks, i.e., people who have a history of engaging in gun violence, were convicted of a misdemeanor for carrying a firearm without a license, and continued to engage in gun violence, is substantially related to the government's interest of promoting public safety and preventing armed mayhem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   The motion to dismiss the indictment (ECF No. 39) will be DENIED with respect to Brooks' argument\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   that\n   \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   An appropriate order will be entered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-332\">\n    On the same day Brooks filed the motion to dismiss, he filed: (a) a motion for discovery (ECF No. 36); (b) a motion to produce evidence that the government intends to use under Federal Rules of Evidence 404(b) and 609 (ECF No. 37); and (c) a motion to suppress evidence and statements (ECF No. 38). The government filed an omnibus response in opposition to Brooks' motions. (ECF No. 43.) Brooks filed a supplement to the motion for discovery and motion to suppress. (ECF No. 44.) On February 28, 2018, the court held a hearing on Brooks' pretrial motions.

The challenger had no other conduct for the court to consider to define the particular category of persons applicable in that case. Hatfield, therefore, is distinguishable from this case.

Any evidence introduced about Brooks' wrongdoing at step two is not being used by the court to convict him of a crime and the court may consider evidence that does not rise to the level of criminal activity. Under those circumstances, the government is not required to prove Brooks' wrongdoing \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" and his due process rights are not violated by the procedures employed by this court to decide his as-applied attack on \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-396\">\n    Brooks argues that he must be afforded the opportunity to confront his accusers, the government must prove his wrongdoing beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Federal Rules of Evidence must apply if the court permits the government to introduce evidence particular to him at step two. (ECF No. 58 at 14-15.) To the extent Brooks argues that the procedures used by this court violate his procedural due process rights, the court does not agree. The court must weigh the following three factors to determine whether a hearing deprived a defendant of his procedural due process rights:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-397\">\n    First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-398\">\n    <em>\n     Mathews v.

Here, although the outcome of the hearing has the potential to be outcome determinative, Brooks' interest in the evidentiary hearing under\n    <em>\n     Marzzarella\n    </em>\n    is of a lesser magnitude than a trial during which he is afforded the right to confront his accusers, the government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Federal Rules of Evidence apply.\n    <em>\n     Raddatz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188607\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/667/#p679\">\n     447 U.S. at 679\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188607\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/667/#p679\">\n     100 S.Ct. 2406\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court is the finder of fact at other kinds of pretrial hearings and, like the defendants in those proceedings, Brooks had the opportunity to present evidence in support of his position at the hearing on his motion to dismiss the indictment. Although the court did not strictly apply the Federal Rules of Evidence to the evidence presented at those hearings, it gave whatever weight it deemed appropriate to hearsay evidence and took into account the quality of evidence presented by the government, which must be meaningful evidence. There is value to the safeguards proposed by Brooks, but those safeguards are guaranteed at trial and not in pretrial hearings.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188607\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/667/#p679\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Lastly, granting Brooks' request to order those safeguards would turn the hearing into a trial, which would burden the court and parties.

The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, however, has already held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and, as explained in this opinion, the court does not have \"unfettered discretion\" to analyze whether a challenger possesses rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"43\">\n   <p id=\"p-400\">\n    Obsenica reported that Johnson identified Brooks at the scene as the actor; Brooks' girlfriend, Squires, told the officers Brooks fled in a white Chevy Tahoe; Johnson told the officers Brooks drove a large Chevy vehicle; Brooks' vehicle was recovered in the nearby area in which the shooting took place; and it was reported that-like the other instances of firearm violence in which Brooks was involved-a silver pistol was used in the commission of the offense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-401\">\n    Johnson at the hearing first testified that the neighbor who pointed a gun at her and shot the Ford Fusion on April 19, 2015 was Brooks.
