(Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 25.) Pending is defendants' motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 68.) For the following reasons, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Abboud was born in Syracuse, New York. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 18-19.) His parents are from Lebanon, and he has dual-citizenship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) In 2002, he was hired by the County as a corrections officer and, on September 24, 2011, he became a senior corrections officer at the Jamesville Correctional facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22; Defs.' Statement of Material Facts (SMF) \u00b6 114, Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 95; Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 5.) He claims that \"[t]he majority of employees working at the Jamesville Correctional facility are [w]hite\" and he is \"the only employee of Arab ancestry.\" (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The County maintains policies and procedures addressing harassment, discrimination, and retaliation, which are outlined in the employee handbook that is provided to every County employee. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 39.) Additionally, Department employees are issued an employee manual containing directives regarding harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.) County employees also receive diversity training, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50), and Department employees attend additional annual training, which covers harassment and discrimination, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The remaining defendants (hereinafter \"Jamesville defendants\") consist of one or more John and Jane Doe(s) and eleven Department employees who, at all relevant times, held the following positions at the Jamesville Correctional Facility: defendant Timothy Cowin was the Commissioner, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3), defendants Daniel Boyle and Randy Blume were Assistant Commissioners, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7), defendants William Brush and Thomas Tripoli were Captains, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23), defendants Nathan Hawker and Robert\n   Burnett were Lieutenants, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 28), defendant Kathleen Zabinski was a Sergeant, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15), and defendants Troy Pritchard, Gerald Riposa, and Adam Brockway were Corrections Officers (CO), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27, 30).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Personnel Advisory Committee (PAC), which is comprised of the Assistant Commissioners, the Captains, and a Personnel Administrator, reviews reports of incidents involving employees and makes disciplinary recommendations to the Commissioner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) Based on these recommendations, the Commissioner ultimately determines the appropriate discipline to be issued, if any. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56, 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    2. Abboud's Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Abboud claims that he has faced unfair treatment based on his Arab ethnicity\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   since 2007. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 56.) In support of his claims, he describes defendants' alleged harassment, discrimination, and retaliation in his deposition testimony, (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19), and an affidavit attached to his response to defendants' motion for summary judgment, (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    a. Incidents Lacking Specificity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, many of Abboud's allegations fail to state when they occurred or who was responsible for them. For instance, he alleges that an unidentified employee called him \"ISIS\" about a year and a half before his deposition, and that individual was subsequently disciplined after an investigation. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 107.) In or around 2007, he claims that a group of unidentified officers called him a \"camel jockey.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.) Abboud also claims that on unidentified dates, \"many officers\" stated \"go back home ... [t]owel head,\" made disparaging comments regarding him and \"a barrel of oil,\" and directed other officers not to talk to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57.) Abboud further alleges that he was subjected to the following comments from unidentified individuals on unidentified dates: \"get back on your [c]amel and go back to your country\" and \"don't you own a 7-Eleven store[?]\" (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 7.) Other conduct that Abboud did not attribute to any particular individual occurred in \"2010 or 2011,\" when a drawing was \"posted in the facility's cafeteria depicting [another CO] wearing a turban in a background filled with sand ... teaching a crowd how to make bombs.\" (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 8.) On another unidentified date, Abboud alleges that CO Riposa told him that he supported Hitler's ideas and referred to Abboud as \"Saddam Hussein's son.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) He alleges that \"on a daily or near daily basis, co-workers and officers of rank have made demeaning comments to [him] about the style of [his] civilian clothing, the rap music [he] listen[s] to, and the customizations to the vehicle [he] own[s].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) And he further alleges that unidentified co-workers and supervisors have commented that he \"look[s] like an inmate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also alleges that, on an unknown date and time, Captain Brush called him \"a fucking Arab,\" \"terrorist,\" and blamed him for 9/11. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 45.) Sometime prior to August 2011, Abboud claims to have witnessed Captain Brush, Sergeant Zabinski, and other officers either make ethnically disparaging comments to another officer of Arab ancestry or fail to admonish individuals making such statements. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 10.) Additionally, he claims he was not selected for various interviews for positions that have all gone to white people. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 100-02.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On an unidentified date, Abboud alleges that Lieutenant Hawker took him off \"[S]upport [C]lub\" and he was denied positions on the Response Team.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63, 73, 127.) Specifically, Abboud claims that Lieutenant Hawker consistently assigned CO Riposa, who was neither a Senior CO nor a Response Team member, to Security Support and Unit Support Officer positions, while he assigned Abboud to the\n   Housing Units, despite the fact that \"[h]istorically, the Security Support and Unit Support Officer positions are given to Senior [COs] and Response Team members.\" (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Other of Abboud's sworn statements are more specific, but difficult to reconcile. For instance, at one point in his deposition, he testified that CO Riposa, Lieutenant Hawker, and Captain Brush were the only people who made disparaging remarks in his presence. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 144.) But he also testified that, on an unspecified date and time, CO Brockway made a comment about the rims on his car, which he took as an implication that he sold drugs, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 151), and, in his affirmation, he alleged that CO Brockway stated that \"[f]oreigners don't belong in this country,\" (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 36). Strangely, Abboud also testified during his deposition, \"I get along with everyone [at the facility] and everyone pretty much gets along with me.\" (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 59.) When asked about what evidence he had that the Jamesville defendants conspired with each other, he merely speculated that all of the Jamesville defendants are friends. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 157-59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    b. 2010-2011\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The first instances of conduct attributable to any of the Jamesville defendants on a specific date begin in 2010. On April 19, 2010, Abboud alleges that COs, including Riposa, called him a \"[s]tone thrower,\" and said \"I d[id]n't think ... you people wore shorts.\" (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 14.) Although, in his original deposition, he did not specify CO Riposa as one of the officers making such statements and could not recall when these comments were made, (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 46-47), his testimony was consistent that, after hearing these comments, he complained to Lieutenant Burnett and Captain Tripoli but would not provide the names of the COs involved. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 46-47; Attach. 40; Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16.) The next day during roll call, Lieutenant Burnett directed officers not to make these types of remarks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 14; Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.) Abboud admits that the discriminatory comments stopped after this or \"if there was a reoccurrence[,] he would indicate that he did not like it, and it would stop.\" (Def.'s SMF \u00b6 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The same day that Abboud complained about these alleged comments, he was issued a written reprimand, per PAC's recommendation, based on a March 8, 2010 violation of visitation room policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-84; Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 23, 2010, while being interviewed by a member of Internal Affairs regarding complaints about his interactions with inmates during visitation, Abboud \"became visibly upset and began crying.\" (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 91.) On September 29, 2010, Abboud alleges that he was \"criticized by Lieutenant Burnett for allegedly 'pacing' in the visitation room\" and told that his job performance was \"not good.\" (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 20.) He told Lieutenant Burnett that he felt like he was being discriminated against, and Lieutenant Burnett responded by telling him to fill out a harassment form if he felt that way. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 1, 2010, Abboud alleges that he notified a County Personnel Officer about the harassment and discrimination that he allegedly experienced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) On October 6, 2010, Assistant Commissioner Blume met with Abboud to discuss issues that might compromise his ability to perform his duties, based on his September\n   23, 2010 interview, and discussed that the employee assistance program might be useful. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6\u00b6 78, 92.) On October 24, 2010, Lieutenant Burnett allegedly called him a \"shit magnet.\" (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 4, 2010, while Abboud was outside the facility smoking a cigarette, he alleges that Captain Brush commented, in sum and substance, that it would not be so expensive to live in New York City \"if it wasn't for you fucking Arabs blowing up shit down there.\" (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 48-49; Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    c. 2011-2012\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 5, 2011, Abboud allowed a visitor involved in an incident to leave without contacting his immediate supervisor as directed. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 93 (citing Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 60).) Thereafter, PAC recommended that Abboud receive an oral warning for neglect of job duties based on the incident, which Lieutenant Brush issued to him on January 26, 2011. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 26. (citing Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 21 at 5); Defs.' SMF \u00b6 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On February 16, 2011, Brush received a complaint from a visitor that Abboud had made rude comments to her. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 95.) On February 22, 2011, Zabinski received a complaint from an inmate that Abboud had acted inappropriately towards one of his visitors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.) On February 23, 2011, Abboud was notified that he was being transferred from visitation duty and reassigned to splitting his time between two shifts, allegedly to \"address the repeated issues that had arisen while [he] was assigned to visitation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98; Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) After an investigation of the complaints made against Abboud, PAC recommended that he receive a written reprimand, which was given to him on March 29, 2011 by Lieutenant Burnett. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 97; Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 32 (citing Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 42 at 20-24).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 8, 2011, Abboud detailed the above-mentioned conduct that he perceived to be unfair treatment in an \"Onondaga County Employee Harassment and Discrimination Complaint Form,\" (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 21), and a complaint to Commissioner Cowin, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7). The matter was referred to Internal Affairs for investigation. (Def.'s SMF \u00b6 101.) Later that month, Abboud provided more details concerning the examples outlined in the complaint to Internal Affairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102; Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    d. 2012-2013\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On October 27, 2012, CO Pritchard claims that an inmate accused Abboud of providing him drugs. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 36 at 37-38.) CO Pritchard immediately alerted Lieutenant Brush and CO Brockway. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 118.) Thereafter, Lieutenant Brush alerted Captain Tripoli, and the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office was called to investigate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 128-129.) Captain Tripoli later informed Assistant Commissioner Blume about the situation, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130), who, in turn, contacted Commissioner Cowin to discuss whether Abboud should remain on duty during the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131.) Commissioner Cowin determined that Abboud should be taken off duty, so he directed Assistant Commissioner Blume to direct Captain Brush to have Abboud escorted off the premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 131-132; Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 33-34A.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Abboud was escorted off the premises and placed on administrative leave. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 133.) Abboud was paid for his time off and not subjected to\n   discipline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Abboud arrived home that day, he received a call from Captain Brush, who told him to return to work on his next regularly-scheduled shift. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139; Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 34B.) The Sheriff's investigation revealed that the inmate in question later identified a different CO as the individual who provided him contraband and was not credible. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 141.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On November 3, 2012, Aboud filed another \"Onondaga County Employee Harassment and Discrimination Complaint Form\" for discrimination and harassment; however, he did not check the box for \"national origin\" or \"race,\" but rather \"other,\" which he did not describe further. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 35B (citing Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 76).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On December 15, 2012, Abboud received another written reprimand for an absence. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 38 (citing Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 78 at 2-6.) Specifically, Abboud failed to provide a written verification from his medical provider to support his claim that he was sick on November 6, 2012. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 151.) Accordingly, PAC recommended Abboud receive a written reprimand and that his pay be docked for the absence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After Abboud filed a grievance, the written reprimand was reduced to an oral warning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    e. 2013-2014\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Abboud affirms that on March 5, 2013 a non-party Sergeant made a comment referring to his \"drug sales going up.\" (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 40.) He claims that Lieutenant Hawker tacitly supported this statement by laughing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 21, 2013, Abboud alleges that \"[CO] Riposa stated that he did not want minorities to progress\" and that Lieutenant Hawker tacitly supported this statement by responding, \"Yeah[,] I couldn't believe that he got promoted, that they would promote him.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) After an internal investigation into CO Riposa's alleged comments, PAC issued him an oral warning and ordered him to attend diversity training. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 187.) Thereafter, Abboud alleges that CO Riposa told other officers not to speak to him. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 51.) After another investigation, PAC recommended coaching. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6\u00b6 243.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 26, 2013, Abboud complained to Lieutenant Hawker upon noticing that he was the only member of the Response Team on his shift not on the list to be firearms qualified. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 44.) As a result of being omitted from this list, Abboud alleges that he was \"denied assignments and deprived of overtime opportunities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) Although being firearms qualified does not affect an officer's ability to earn overtime, (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 167\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), it is undisputed that such an omission precluded him from certain assignments, (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On April 4, 2013, Hawker advised Abboud that he was not in compliance with the shaving policy. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6\u00b6 160, 184.) Initially, Lieutenant Hawker ordered him to write a report about why he did not shave and then asked him to rewrite it after he submitted it. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 48.) Ultimately, PAC recommended\n   that coaching was the appropriate remedy for the violation. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 161.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Abboud was aware of the Department policy that employees be clean shaven at all times in order to ensure that face masks could be fitted properly. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6\u00b6 175, 177.) However, Abboud was exempted from face mask fitting because he had a medical note indicating that he could not shave everyday. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 74.) Abboud's exemption from being fitted for a face mask did not mean that he was not required to shave in general. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 184.) Nonetheless, Abboud felt that it was unfair that he was prohibited from face mask fitting because of his facial hair, despite having a medical note addressing his shaving restrictions. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 74.) He alleges that other employees who chewed tobacco, which was also a violation of protocol, were not disciplined and that another employee with facial hair was allowed to be fitted for a face mask. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 49.) Given his inability to be fitted for a face mask, Abboud was used in a support role on the Response Team if chemical agents were necessary. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6\u00b6 179-82.) Eventually, in 2014, Abboud was allowed to be fitted for a gas mask after signing a waiver regarding his inability to shave daily. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 186.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On April 10, 2013, Abboud filed a complaint with the NYSDHR regarding his omission from firearms qualifications, the shaving incident, CO Riposa's comments, his escort off the premises and placement on administrative leave, random gossip, the non-party Sergeant's comments about drug sales, and being \"singled out.\" (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 50 (citing Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 6).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On April 27, 2013, Abboud was observed crying and told Hawker that \"his brain was making him cry\" and that \"his brain was moving around inside of his head.\" (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 194.) Hawker directed another CO to drive Abboud home, and Abboud remained out of work until May 7, 2013 under a medical provider's direction. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 195, 197.) When he returned, Captain Tripoli and Michael Romeo, the Personnel Administrator, met with him to discuss what caused the April 27 incident and determine if it posed a future problem. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 198.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The April 27, 2013 incident was one of a handful of similar incidents dating back to 2006, which defendants describe as including episodes of crying on the job, panic attacks, dizziness, and other physical and mental difficulties experienced by Abboud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 206.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Thus, Commissioner Cowin decided to obtain a medical examination\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Abboud to determine his fitness for duty and decided that temporarily placing him on restricted duty, which would restrict his contact with inmates, was appropriate until an examination could be conducted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 199, 203, 204, 207-08, 215.)

No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 57A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) However, in reality, PAC recommended that he receive an oral warning based on his failure to provide documentation for the refusal of overtime on May 11, 2013, which was presented to him on May 17, 2013. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6\u00b6 217-18.) Abboud refutes the reason for this discipline because he claims that when he told Lieutenant Hawker that he was unavailable to work the overtime shift due to his father's hospitalization, he was ordered to write a memo, which he did, and was then relieved of the assignment and ordered to work a different overtime shift, which he did. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 57A.) In his opinion, this eliminated the need to submit the medical verification, as ordered, but he does not deny the fact that he disobeyed the order to submit such verification. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 13 \u00b6 217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On May 22, 2013, Abboud filed a second complaint with the NYSDHR involving his reassignment to rear control, restriction from inmate contact, and discipline for not providing a medical note.

Given that this was a violation of his order to refrain from inmate contact, PAC recommended that Abboud receive a written reprimand, which he was issued on July 10, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 225-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   By letter dated July 15, 2013, Dr. Andrew Kaufman was appointed to conduct a medical examination of Abboud in order to determine his fitness to perform his duties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 229.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Abboud filed another NYSDHR complaint on August 12, 2013 alleging discrimination and retaliation based on his national origin and ethnicity when he was issued the July 10 written reprimand and ordered to undergo the medical examination. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The examination was conducted on August 15, 2013. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6 232.) Dr. Kaufman found that Abboud \"did not presently suffer from any disorder that would render him unable to perform his duties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 244.) As such, Abboud was notified that he was able to resume full duties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Abboud filed another NYSDHR complaint on September 18, 2013 claiming discrimination based on his national origin and ethnicity due to CO Riposa's negative comments in general and Lieutenant Hawker's response. (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 15.) The NYSDHR and U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found no probable cause for any of Abboud's four complaints. (Defs.'

Sept. 22, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Abboud filed his first complaint with the NYSDHR on April 10, 2013. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 50.) Although defendants appear to posit that June 4, 2012 is 300 days prior to April 10, 2013, the court calculates 300 days prior to April 10, 2013 as falling on or about June 15, 2012. In any event, Abboud's allegations regarding conduct occurring prior to June 2012 cannot provide a basis for his Title VII claims. Next, Abboud filed his complaint on February 24, 2014, (Compl.), and the earliest specific allegation of discrimination describes conduct that occurred on April 19, 2010, (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 14). Accordingly, claims under Section 1983 and the NYSHRL based on conduct occurring prior to February 24, 2011 are untimely-except for Abboud's claims under Section 1983 that involve violations of Section 1981, which may be based on conduct that occurred on or after February 24, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Abboud attempts to extend the statute of limitations period by arguing that \"[d]efendants fail to acknowledge the applicability of the continuing violation doctrine.\" (Dkt. No. 76 at 3.) Indeed, the continuing violation doctrine, which acts to toll the otherwise applicable statute of limitations period, applies to claims \"composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful ... practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

(Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 96 at 5-9.) However, these actions must be analyzed in the context of the steady course of discriminatory comments from co-workers and supervisors as well as the Department's failure to remedy such speech in the workplace. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Part II.A.2.) Clearly, discriminatory comments may constitute evidence of discriminatory animus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bader v.

No. 68, Attach. 30 at 49-50), Abboud has provided evidence that several employees were added to the 2013 list who were not on the previous year's list, (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 3).

Although Captain Brush is a member of the committee responsible for reviewing reports of incidents involving employees and recommending discipline to the Commissioner, (Defs.'

First, he primarily relies on the close temporal proximity between his complaints and subsequent reprimands. (Dkt. No. 76 at 10-12.) For instance, the only evidence he provides for the retaliatory motive behind the April 19, 2010 and March 29, 2011 written reprimands is that they followed close in time to his complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And Abboud does not even bother discussing the July 10, 2013 written reprimand in his response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Temporal proximity alone is insufficient to overcome an employer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for an adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simpson v. N.Y. State Dep't of Civil Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1051976\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/166/499/#p502\">\n    166 F. App'x 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 502 (2d Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Additionally, the comment made by Lieutenant Burnett-who allegedly called him a \"shit magnet\" on October 24, 2010, (Dkt. No. 76 at 11)-is not evidence of the motivation behind his written reprimands because there is no evidence that Lieutenant Burnett was on PAC or influenced Commissioner Cowin in determining his discipline. (Defs.' SMF \u00b6\u00b6 54, 56, 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Regarding the December 15, 2012 written reprimand, the only evidence Abboud points to is Captain Brush's alleged statement about \"walking on eggshells,\" which was made well over a year later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Although Captain Brush was on PAC, as discussed previously there is no evidence to demonstrate his level of influence over Commissioner Cowin, and, in any event, his comment was made in a different context and a long time after issuance of this written reprimand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As for the May 17, 2013 oral warning, the only evidence upon which Abboud relies is that defendants were aware of his prior complaints filed a month earlier. (Dkt. No. 76 at 12.) Abboud also attempts to create an issue of material fact by arguing that there was no need for him to provide a medical note. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Abboud's disagreement with the order that he provide a medical note is not material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dorcely v.

Abboud does not deny that he was given an order to provide a medical provider's note and failed to do so. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 13 \u00b6 217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   However, there is sufficient evidence to permit a finder of fact to infer that defendants' proffered reasons for ordering Abboud to submit to a medical evaluation and placing him on restrictive duty was pretextual. First, Abboud points to evidence that these actions followed shortly after his complaints. (Dkt. No. 76 at 13.) Next, he points out inconsistencies in defendants' proffered reasons for their actions. That is, the record demonstrates that \"there were other incidents of ... alleged bizarre behavior of [Abboud] in prior years, none of which singularly or together induced the Department to restrict [his] duty assignment or require him to attend a psychological evaluation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Additionally, he maintains that he informed the Department that the April 27, 2013 incident was caused by a severe migraine, which was well-documented by his medical provider. (Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6 53.) Moreover, defendants' proffered rationale for placing Abboud on restrictive duty is undermined by the fact that the assignment did not prevent contact with inmates or other officers and also tasked him with securing and issuing firearms, ammunition, pepper spray, and batons. (Dkt. No. 76 at 13-14.) Given that this evidence undermines defendants' rationale, and defendants' do not address these contentions in their reply, a reasonable jury could determine that defendants' proffered rationale was mere pretext for retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zann Kwan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732472\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/834/#p846\">\n    737 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   846 &amp; n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Accordingly, the only retaliation claims that survive are those based on Abboud's omission from the 2013 firearms qualification list, the order to submit to a medical examination, and placement on restrictive duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Hostile Work Environment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In order to survive a summary judgment motion with respect to a hostile work environment claim, Abboud must\n   provide sufficient evidence to create a genuine question of fact as to whether \"[his] workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult ... that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [his] employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Aug. 23, 2010) (finding that the court is not obligated to scour the record for evidence of material questions of fact). For example, throughout Abboud's response to defendants' statement of material facts, he cites to his own affirmation generally, without bothering to point out which of the sixty-six paragraphs in that affirmation actually support his responses. (\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 13.) Further, in several other instances, Abboud fails to specifically controvert the assertions contained within defendants' statement of material facts with record evidence, in admissible form. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g., id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 93-94, 135, 167, 206.) The court deems such facts admitted.

Implicit within the rule requiring parties to \"set forth, in numbered paragraphs, each material fact about which the moving party contends there exists no genuine issue\" is the expectation that they will actually cite to these paragraphs in their motion papers. Failure to do so provides a basis to deny the moving party's motion in its entirety. In the interest of justice, the court declines to do so.

No. 68, Attach. 96 at 27-28), but considers it to be unavailing because it is not sufficiently supported by the current record and hinges on factual issues best left for resolution by a jury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    Although \"most of the standards applicable to the conduct alleged to constitute hostile work environment in violation of Title VII are also applicable to [plaintiff]'s .. claims under \u00a7 1981 and his ... claims under \u00a7 1983,\" there are some key differences.\n    <em>\n     Patterson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9373907\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/206/#p225\">\n     375 F.3d at 225-26\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Notably, individuals may be held liable under Sections 1981 and 1983 for discriminatory acts giving rise to a hostile work environment if the discrimination was intentional.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9373907\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/206/#p225\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9373907\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/206/#p225\">\n     at 226\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, Abboud's hostile work environment claims under Title VII remain only against the County and his hostile work environment claims under Section 1981 and Section 1983 remain against the Jamesville defendants in their individual capacities who were personally involved in discriminatory acts. Given that Abboud fails to adequately respond, (Dkt. No. 76 at 20), to defendants' arguments that they were not personally involved in the conduct establishing the remaining Section 1981 and Section 1983 claims, (Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 96 at 28-31), and because the record is devoid of any evidence that defendants Boyle, Blume, Tripoli, and Pritchard were personally involved in creating the hostile work environment described by Abboud, the claims against them are dismissed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Patterson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9373907\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/206/#p225\">\n     375 F.3d at 229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, defendants' motion as it relates to the personal involvement of defendants Riposa, Hawker, Brush, Brockway, Zabinski, and Burnett is denied based on the record evidence of their personal involvement. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Dkt. No. 68, Attach. 19 at 48-49, 95, 144, 151; Dkt. No. 75, Attach. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14, 23, 36, 41-42, 51.) Additionally, in an abundance of caution, the court does not dismiss these claims for lack of personal involvement against Cowin, given he \"was responsible for overseeing all aspects of the [D]epartment, including enforcing the County['s] ... equal employment opportunity policy\" and \"made the final decisions regarding policy within the Department.\" (Defs.' SMF \u00b6\u00b6 3-4);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Colon v.

Furthermore, the claims against the Jamesville defendants in their official capacities are dismissed as redundant, given that the action is proceeding against the County.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Baines v.
