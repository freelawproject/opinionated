Larry Alan Burns, United States District Judge\n   Defendants removed this case from the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego, relying on federal question jurisdiction. Although all the claims in the complaint are identified as arising under state law, Defendants argue that they are completely preempted by federal law because they all involve interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement. The parties are not diverse, and no other basis for this Court's exercise of jurisdiction is apparent. Plaintiffs then moved to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants argue Plaintiffs' claims arise under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"Section 301\" or \"\u00a7 301\").

Defendants offer evidence that, during the time of Plaintiffs' employment there, they were covered by one of two collective bargaining agreements that, with regard to the claims here, were identical (the \"CBA\"). (Decl. of John Irelan in Support of Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.) The first of these was effective April 8, 2012 through April 9, 2016. The second and current CBA came into effect April 10, 2016. Defendants also offer excerpts of the 2012 CBA as Exhibit A to their Opposition, and have offered to submit the entire document if requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they all began working for Pacific Bell and/or AT T at various times from 1997 through 2010 as Splicing Technicians. At the time, they were all designated \"Term\" employees. Around March of 2015, they allege Defendant Betsy Farrell, a Vice President for AT &amp; T, promised that she would formally designate Plaintiffs as \"Regular\" status employees and that they would not be terminated except \"for Cause.\" Relying on this promise, Plaintiffs allege, they continued to work for Defendants. The \"Regular\" Splicing Technician positions that came open in San Diego at that time, however, were filled by other workers by November, 2015. (Irelan Decl., \u00b6 7.) Defendants believe the vacancies were filled as required by the CBA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both \"Term\" and \"Regular\" employees are job classifications under sections 4.03.B and 7.10.B of the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Then around June of 2016, Plaintiffs allege that a rumor of layoffs began circulating. Because they had not yet been designated as \"Regular\" employees and feared being laid off, Plaintiffs allege they complained to Defendants that Farrell's promise had not been honored. The complaint does not say when they complained. Shortly after that, in late October, they were fired. The complaint implies that the firing was related to the complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The removal statute is strictly construed against removal jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction falls to the party invoking the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    California ex rel.

Their claim does not depend on the validity of their complaints, but on whether they were wrongfully discharged for making them.

Defendants have offered no explanation or argument about whether this claim is based on a genuine state policy, and have therefore not met their\n    burden of establishing federal jurisdiction as to this claim. The CBA also appears to have a \"just cause\" provision, but Defendants have not attempted to show that the wrongful discharge claim arises under this clause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Stallcop v.

Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim is based on a theory that Farrell's promises amounted to an enforceable contract. The promissory estoppel claim is very close to the breach of contract claim, except that it involves Plaintiffs' reasonable and foreseeable reliance on Farrell's promises instead of a valid contract. Their fraud claim, however, is based on allegations that Farrell's promise was false when made, and that she knew it. In other words, they allege she made this promise with the intent never to perform it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Defendants cite the CBA's terms, which govern how vacancies are to be filled. Defendants interpret the CBA as providing that changing the classification of a position from \"Term\" to \"Regular\" amounts to the creation of a new position. (Irelan Decl., \u00b6 6.) Although Defendants' briefing says Plaintiffs were \"fifth in line\" for open positions, this refers to their priority rating under the CBA. The briefing says nothing about the number of Splicing Technician positions, either \"Term\" or \"Regular,\" that existed at the time or became vacant in the San Diego area. Nor does it say anything about the number of employees other than Plaintiffs who were eligible to fill those positions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Court's analysis of these three claims begins with an examination of the elements.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lingle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218054\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/399/#p405\">\n     486 U.S. at 407\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218054\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/399/#p405\">\n     108 S.Ct. 1877\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     Claim 2: Fraud\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Although fraud may be related to a contract, it is not a contract claim and does not involve enforcing a contract.

Most of these do not involve the CBA.

Defendants controlled the number of vacancies,\n    and likely knew how many Splicing Technicians they were likely to need.

The CBA does not govern the number of positions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    A statement to the effect that Plaintiffs would be made \"Regular\" employees could have been based on a representation about the number of upcoming vacancies Defendants expected to have, or even the number they might have been willing to create. \"I promise to designate you as 'Regular' employees\" could mean \"I promise there will be enough 'Regular' openings for each of you, and that you will be given priority to ensure you get them.\" But it could also mean \"We are going to need a lot of new Splicing Technicians, and will have so many new 'Regular' openings that, in light of the number of people who are eligible for them, you are sure to get one.\" It could also mean \"I promise that we can and will create as many 'Regular' positions as necessary to make sure you each get one.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Milne\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525638\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/960/1401/#p1410\">\n     960 F.2d at 1410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that misrepresentations about job security in light of secret plans to shut down the company were not anticipated by collective bargaining agreement and could support a non-preempted fraud claim).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    In addition, neither party has said how many openings there actually were. If Farrell promised \"Regular\" positions to each of the six Plaintiffs knowing there would be fewer than six \"Regular\" positions offered, the promise would have been knowingly false regardless of what the CBA said. In other words, the alleged falsehood of the promise, and whether Plaintiffs were justified in relying on it might or might not have been based on the CBA. The Court cannot say that resolution of the fraud claim necessarily requires interpretation or application of the CBA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Defendants also point out that the alleged promise includes a guarantee that Plaintiffs would not be fired except for just cause, and that the CBA defines \"just cause.\" But they also agree that the CBA provides that \"Regular\" employees have the benefit of this guarantee. The Complaint treats the \"just cause\" promise as stemming from Plaintiffs' promised \"Regular\" status. (Compl., \u00b6 29 (\"This [rumor about layoffs] raised concerns for Plaintiffs because they were promised to be Regular employees, who may only be terminated 'for Cause.' \").) The \"just cause\" promise could be subsumed within the larger promise to designate Plaintiffs \"Regular\" employees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Defendants have not carried their burden of showing that resolution of this part of the fraud claim necessarily requires interpretation of the CBA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <strong>\n     Claim 1: Promissory Estoppel\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Under California law, the elements of a promissory estoppel claim are 1) a promise 2) made with reasonable expectation that it would induce reliance or forbearance, 3) actual reliance or forbearance, and 4) enforcement of the promise being the only way to avoid injustice.\n    <em>\n     Kajima/Ray Wilson v.
