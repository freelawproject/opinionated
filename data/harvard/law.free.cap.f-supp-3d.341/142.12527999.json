BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed the instant action in the Supreme Court of Columbia County, New York on or about February 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, dkt. # 1, at \u00b6 2. Then-Defendants Todd Baily, April Bailey, Premier Biotech Inc., and Premier Biotech Labs, LLC (\"the Premier Defendants\") filed a notice of removal in this Court on March 16, 2017, contending that diversity jurisdiction existed because the Defendants and Plaintiff were from different states and the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. After the Premiere Defendants removed the case to this Court, they filed a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. # 15. The remaining Defendant, Peckham Vocational Industries, Inc. (\"Peckham\"), also filed a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 16. Plaintiff also filed a cross-motion for a preliminary injunction, dkt. # 21, and a motion for leave to supplement the pleadings, dkt. # 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court considered the motions to dismiss and granted those motions except for that of Todd Bailey on the basis that\n   the Court lacked personal jurisdiction over the other defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. # 35. The Court also denied Todd Bailey's motion to dismiss with leave to renew.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Court denied Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and for leave to supplement with leave to renew.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff then filed the instant motion for reconsideration and for leave to supplement and Defendant Todd Bailey filed the instant motion to dismiss. Those motions have been briefed and are presently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Reconsideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff seeks reconsideration of the Court's order dismissing the case against Defendant Premier Biotech, Inc. When a party files a motion for reconsideration, \"[t]he standard for granting such a motion is strict, and reconsideration will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked-matters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Shrader v.

R. CIV. P. 15(d). A supplemental pleading may be allowed \"even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"An application for leave to file a supplemental pleading is addressed to the discretion of the court, and permission should be freely granted where such supplementation will promote economic and speedy disposition of the controversy between the parties, will not cause undue delay or trial inconvenience, and will not prejudice the rights of either party.\"\n   <em>\n    Bornholdt v.

Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant Todd Bailey has filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not stated a claim upon which relief could be granted, even if all factual allegations in the complaint were proved true.

Reconsideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court will first address Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. Plaintiff argues for reconsideration on only one ground: that Defendant Premiere Biotech, Inc., had actually consented to jurisdiction. Defendants do not address this issue in responding to Plaintiff's brief, and the Court assumes they do not oppose such a finding. The Court agrees that dismissing the case against Premier Biotech, Inc. was in error, and the Court will grant the motion in that respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Supplement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff next renews its motion to supplement the pleadings with information allegedly newly obtained about Defendant Todd Bailey's conduct. Plaintiff also seeks, in its renewed motion, to amend the Complaint to add causes of action against Defendant Todd Bailey and Premier Biotech and remove all claims against the other original Defendants. Defendant responds by arguing that any supplementation would be futile. Defendant does not argue any other basis for denying the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff seeks to supplement the Complaint in a number of ways, which Defendant opposes as futile.

Proposed Amended/Supplemental Pleading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff has submitted a proposed supplemental pleading, which the Court will summarize here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental/Amended Complaint (\"Supp. Complt.\"), dkt. # 39-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The proposed complaint names two Defendants, Todd Bailey and Premier Biotech, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Todd Bailey was an employee and/or consultant for Plaintiff from April 2001 to December 23, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. He had various positions, including Vice President of Sales and Marketing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's job represented a \"senior management position,\" and he earned more than $200,000 a year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Plaintiff also \"had significant contact with Plaintiff's customers and sales staff,\" as well as \"access to proprietary and confidential information\" about \"Plaintiff's contracts, pricing, product costs, internal sales strategies, legal and regulatory procedures, and competitive positions within the industry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bailey also represented Plaintiff at various conferences and functions around the world, at Plaintiff's expense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Bailey founded his own company in 2009 without Plaintiff's consent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. That company, Defendant Premier Biotech, Inc., \"servic[ed] a customer contract that, for\n   regulatory reasons, the Plaintiff could no longer serve.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bailey began working as a 1099 consultant for Plaintiff in September 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. He received a larger commission \"in lieu of his previous salary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No written agreement covered this change.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Bailey retained the title of Vice President of Sales and Marketing through November 2013, \"and the levels of information he received related to Plaintiff and its business remained substantially the same.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff had an account to provide \"point of care\" drug testing to the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services (\"ARDHHS\") before 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. Defendant Bailey, who did not serve as the account's sales representative, was aware of the contract because he sat in on client meetings in New York and his job made him aware of the contract provisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. ARDHHS also had another contract with one of Plaintiff's competitors for \"lab service\" drug testing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. ARDHHS had problems with this competitor's work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Bailey recommended to ARDHHS that the Department replace the competitor as provider of these services with Defendant Premier, not Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result of Bailey's recommendation, Premier received the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In July 2016, Plaintiff became aware that Premier had quoted prices to ARDHHS for \"point of care\" drug testing \"that matched the Plaintiff's pricing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. Plaintiff's representatives confronted Bailey about Premier's activities, and Bailey \"repeatedly stated\" that Premier would stop marketing the \"point of care\" tests to ARDHHS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Despite this promise, Plaintiff's \"main contact\" with the Department began to be excluded from meetings related to the ARDHHS point-of-care program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. The \"main contact\" had been included in such meetings before that point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff learned in December 2016 that Premier had been awarded ARDHHS' contract for \"point-of-care\" testing effective January 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. That contract had typically provided Plaintiff more than $200,000 in gross annual revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff subsequently found out that Premier had provided ARDHHS with a \"six-month pilot program\" for \"point of care\" testing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Plaintiff was still servicing the ARDHHS contract at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bailey's conduct with respect to ARDHHS led Plaintiff to terminate its relationship with Bailey on December 23, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff also had a contract with the Michigan Department of Corrections (\"DOC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Over the fourteen or more years that this contract endured, Plaintiff supplied the Department with drug testing kits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The contract typically generated between $800,000 and $1 million in revenue per year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During his employment and consultancy with Plaintiff, Bailey managed that contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. DOC informed Plaintiff in 2012 that state regulations required the Department to request proposals rather than offer a simple renewal to current contractors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Plaintiff could avoid that requirement, however, if it supplied its products through a Community Rehabilitation Organization (\"CRO\") that proved itself a \"worthy supplier\" of materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The CRO had to meet certain standards for quality, function, and quantity to qualify as a worthy supplier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Beginning in 2012, Plaintiff worked with Peckham Vocational Industries, Inc. (\"Peckham\"), a CRO in the State of Michigan, to package products supplied by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. Peckham would then distribute the products to the DOC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Bailey was Plaintiff's primary contact with Peckham.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. Without informing Plaintiff, Bailey told Peckham that he \"was contacting Peckham\n   on behalf of both the Plaintiff and Defendant Premier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. Over a five-year period, Plaintiff spent significant resources and energy to make sure Peckham could package Plaintiff's products and distribute them to DOC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. These efforts led Peckham to be deemed a \"worthy supplier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's contract with DOC got extended \"by exception\" over that period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 2016, DOC informed Plaintiff that it would request proposals from CROs for the drug-testing products, rather than contract with Peckham.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. As explained above, Plaintiff had terminated its consulting relationship with Bailey on December 23, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. Plaintiff contacted Peckham about preparing a proposal to deliver to DOC in January 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. Peckham made no mention of ending its relationship with the Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The DOC's request for proposals appeared on February 3, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. Proposals were due by March 3, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. On February 10, 2017, Peckham informed Plaintiff that it would propose to package Defendant Premier's products, rather than Plaintiff's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. Plaintiff sought another CRO, but was unable to find one on such short notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. Instead, Plaintiff submitted a proposal without a partner CRO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. Peckham submitted a proposal with Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. That proposal specifically relied on Peckham's experience in the program that Plaintiff had funded and organized, as well as information obtained by Bailey in his years working for Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39. Peckham claimed a five-year relationship with Defendant Premier and Premier's experience in Arkansas, but that relationship was actually established with Plaintiff and the Arkansas experience was Plaintiff's, not Premier's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. The proposal included documents and procedures \"materially identical\" to those used by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. Defendant Bailey had received such documents and materials during his employment with Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In July, 2017, Michigan regulators awarded the contract to Peckham.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. Plaintiff protested, but the decision did not change.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. Officials estimated the value of the contract over three years to be $1,872,309, but Plaintiff anticipates the actual value to be greater.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff has a contract with the Northeastern Association for the Blind at Albany (\"NABA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. NABA-a non-profit located in Albany-packages and distributes Plaintiff's products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Those products can then be sold through the New York State Preferred Source Program for People who are Blind.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   State and local agencies are required to purchase goods and services from that program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   NABA's products and prices are public information, but the prices at which Plaintiff sells its products to NABA are \"confidential and proprietary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. So are NABA's mark-ups.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bailey had access to Plaintiff's confidential pricing information and attended meetings with NABA on Plaintiff's behalf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49. Plaintiff has become aware that Bailey contacted NABA while still employed by Plaintiff \"to establish a contract with NABA to sell Premier products\" through the state agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. The products Premier sells are similar and Premier has used Bailey's knowledge to undercut Plaintiff's pricing to NABA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   During his tenure with Plaintiff, Bailey attended various meetings designed to establish a business relationship between AMBC and the Untied States Department of Defense (\"DOD\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. Plaintiff hoped to sell DOD drug testing equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff paid travel expenses for Bailey and for a consultant to attend meetings with DOD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. Plaintiff never developed a business relationship with DOD or generated any business from Bailey's\n   efforts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54. After his termination, however, Premier obtained a contract with DOD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55. In an effort to obtain more business, Bailey contacted Plaintiff's consultant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56. Bailey did not inform the consultant that he no longer represented the Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed Amended Complaint contains nine causes of action. All nine name Todd Bailey, and two name Premier Biotech, Inc. Counts 1-4 allege various types of contractual breaches because of Bailey's alleged use of confidential information to poach clients and steal business from Plaintiff. Plaintiff seeks both injunctive relief and compensatory damages. Counts 5 and 6 allege misappropriation of trade secrets and seek both damages and an injunction. Count 7 alleges a breach of Bailey's duty of loyalty to the Plaintiff and business interference in Bailey's negotiations with the Department of Defense. Count 8 alleges that Bailey and Premier tortiously interfered with Plaintiff's contract with Peckham. Count 9 alleges unjust enrichment by both Defendants because of the bid they submitted to the Michigan DOC, which cost Plaintiff a contract with that agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Analysis of Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff seeks to amend/supplement the Complaint to include the additional information and substitute the claims listed above for those in the original Complaint. The proposed Amended/Supplemented Complaint also named only the parties over which the Court has personal jurisdiction. As Defendants object to the proposed Amended/Supplemented Complaint as futile on every claim, the Court will address each Count in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Breach-of-Contract Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Several of Plaintiff's claims are breach-of-contract claims raised against Bailey. In New York, \"[t]he essential elements of a cause of action to recover damages for breach of contract are the existence of a contract, the plaintiff's performance pursuant to the contract, the defendant's breach of its contractual obligations, and damages resulting from the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    PFM Packaging Mach.

With this standard in mind, the Court will address the parties' arguments regarding each of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Count 1\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Count 1 alleges that \"Bailey's Employee Compliance Certification states that Defendant may not use any confidential or proprietary information he acquires in the course of his employment with Plaintiff for any purpose other than to perform his duties\" as Plaintiff's employee. Supp. Complt. at \u00b6 58. This Certification defines \"proprietary information\" as \"(among other information) business plans and strategies, financial information and forecasts, marketing strategies and information, information regarding customers and their specialized agreements, and information regarding customer contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. Plaintiff alleges that Bailey \"used confidential information acquired during his employment with the Plaintiff-in particular regarding the specialized requirements of the Plaintiff's relationship with DOC, such as the need for involvement of a CRO, Peckham's availability and experience in performing that specialized service, and Peckham's financial arrangements with the Plaintiff-to advance\" Premier's interests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60. Plaintiff alleges that this conduct violated the Employee Compliance Certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. That breach threatens Plaintiff's relationship with DOC, and has already caused economic damage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 63-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not alleged that Bailey violated the confidentiality\n   agreement in his contract. Information on \"the specialized requirements of the Plaintiff's relationship with DOC, such as the need for involvement of a CRO, and on Peckham's ability to perform the services was not confidential information, but information publically available. That information, Defendant contends, appears on the Michigan DOC's website. Moreover, pricing information on Plaintiff's DOC contract is publically available and therefore not proprietary. The financial arrangements with Peckham are not confidential, and Plaintiff did not have a contractual relationship with Peckham in any case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The question before the Court is whether Plaintiff has pled facts sufficient to make it plausible that Bailey violated the clause in his agreement prohibiting the disclosure of \"Proprietary Information,\" as defined by the contract. The agreement defines Proprietary Information as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ABMC's internal operating systems and procedures, ABMC's current and future business plans and strategies, (including but not limited to analytical methods and procedures, financial information, forecasts and forecast assumptions), marketing strategies or information, knowledge concerning ABMC's customers and their specialized requirements (including but not limited to any customer lists or databases pertaining to existing customers, information related to past or prospective customers, data about the terms, conditions and expiration dates of existing relationships or contracts with customers), any technical data, new or existing product or service concepts or ideas, know-how (trade secrets), any and all information related to ABMC's research and development activities, manufacturing, products, inventions, formulas, processes, designs, drawings and service and operation manuals and documentation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-47\">\n   Proprietary Information shall mean all notes, memoranda, files, records, writing or other documents which Employee has, in the past, or shall after full execution of this Agreement, prepare, use or come into contact with during his/her employment with ABMC, which relate to any of the above or are useful in any manner to the business of ABMC. Proprietary Information shall also include any and all information and materials in ABMC's possession or under ABMC's control for any other person or entity which ABMC is obligated to treat as confidential or proprietary, and any and all information not generally known to the public or within industries or trades in which ABMC competes. The definition of Proprietary Information applies, to all communications, including written, electronic and oral, and without regard, to whether any specific matters would be deemed confidential, material or important or whether any specific matters would be deemed, patentable or copyrightable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The obligations noted above shall not apply to: Information that immediately prior to or at the time of disclosure is, or thereafter becomes, available to the general public, Information that has been lawfully obtained by me from an independent third party without breach of the obligations noted above as shown by sufficient document that establishes the third party as the source of the Information and that the third party has not obtained the Information from ABMC, or Information that I can establish, by documented and competent evidence, was in my possession prior to my employment with ABMC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. B to Plaintiff's Proposed Supplemental/Amended Complt. (\"Employee Compl. Cert.\"), dkt. # 39-4, at \u00b6 1. Bailey's obligation to keep this information confidential\n   \"remain[ed] in effect until such time as the information is no longer confidential or secret and is known to the general public, and my obligations related to the information survives any termination or resignation of my employment with ABMC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed pleading alleges that Defendant disclosed a variety of information in conjunction with Premier's efforts to obtain a contract with the Michigan DOC. Plaintiff alleges that Premier and Peckham worked together on Peckham's submission for the DOC contract as a CRO. Supp. Complt. at \u00b6 33. Peckham's proposal relied on a \"pilot program\" in which it had participated with Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. \"In its proposal, Peckham relied specifically upon Todd Bailey's familiarity with DOC's staff and personnel, which was established over a period of years at the Plaintiff's expense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. Peckham's proposal claimed a \"five-year relationship with Defendant Premier,\" but Plaintiff alleges that \"the relationship between Peckham and Todd Bailey was established and built at the expense, and for the benefit, of the Plaintiff, rather than Premier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. Peckham also relied on Premier's prior experience in Arkansas, \"but Todd Bailey participated in managing ARDHHS accounts on behalf of the Plaintiff as well as Premier, and the events characterized in Peckham's proposal precipitated the termination of Todd Bailey's relationship with the Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. Peckham's proposal included a copy of Premier's product recall policy, \"but that document [was] materially identical to the Plaintiff's own product recall procedures, which were internal quality control materials disseminated to Todd Bailey in the course of his employment with the Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. The other confidential information relied on in Peckham's proposal, Plaintiff alleges, consisted of \"information regarding the specialized requirements of the Plaintiff's relationship with DOC, such as the need for the involvement of a CRO, Peckham's availability and experience in performing that specialized service, and Peckham's financial arrangement's with Plaintiff[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court finds that most of the information alleged by Plaintiff does not qualify as Proprietary Information-and therefore protected-under the terms of the agreement. First, as explained, Proprietary Information does not include \"[i]nformation that immediately prior to or at the time of disclosure is, or thereafter becomes, available to the general public, Information that has been lawfully obtained by me from an independent third party without breach of the obligations noted above as shown by sufficient document that establishes the third party as the source of the Information and that the third party has not obtained the Information from ABMC[.]\" Employee Compl. Cert. at \u00b6 1. Information about the requirements for contracting with the Michigan Department of Corrections is information from a publically available source, as Plaintiff acknowledges. Allegations regarding Bailey's general experience working with DOC, the state of Arkansas, and Peckham as a AMBC employee represents general experience and does not allege any of the specific types of information and knowledge covered by the agreement. Plaintiff does allege that Bailey used Plaintiff's own recall policy in Peckham's proposal. As Defendants argue, however, a recall policy is hardly confidential and proprietary; the policy is one designed to become \"available to the general public\" and is not covered by the agreement. Bailey also allegedly used knowledge of \"Peckham's availability and experience in performing that specialized service, and Peckham's financial arrangements with Plaintiff.\" The Court fails to see how\n   \"Peckham's availability and experience in performing that specialized service\" constitutes confidential and proprietary information in Plaintiff's possession. Peckham's experience and availability belongs to Peckham, not Plaintiff, and Plaintiff does not allege any agreement with Peckham not to share that information. Moreover, though the agreement covers \"knowledge concerning ABMC's customers and their specialized requirements,\" Peckham was not Plaintiff's customer, but a partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Read generously, however, Plaintiff's complaint that Bailey used information about Plaintiff's financial arrangements with Peckham could be covered by that portion of the agreement that prohibits using information about \"ABMC's current and future business plans and strategies.\" Employee Compl. Cert. at \u00b6 1. Employing the Rule 12(b)(6) standard and making all inferences in Plaintiff's favor, that allegation implies that Plaintiff violated the Employee Compliance Certification by using his knowledge of Plaintiff's business plans and strategies-which Plaintiff alleges included a plan to use Peckham's position and services in certain ways and at certain rates-to obtain a contract with the Michigan DOC. Plaintiff's claim here is a contract claim founded on the obligations stated in the Employee Compliance Certification. Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that Defendant Bailey violated the confidentiality agreement stated in that contract. Whether Bailey actually used Plaintiff's confidential and proprietary business strategies and methods in a way that violated the agreement is a question that will be answered after discovery on this issue. The Court therefore finds that supplementing the claim in this respect is not futile, and will grant the Plaintiff's motion in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Count 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants argue that Count 2 of the Proposed Amended Complaint is futile as well. Defendants contend that Plaintiff's allegations fail to demonstrate any damage from the alleged breach of contract as it relates to Plaintiff's dealings with NABA. Plaintiff does not explain how AMBC lost revenue as a result of the alleged breach. Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that NABA is a distributor, not a customer. Nothing in the proposed Amended Complaint, Defendants point out, indicates that Plaintiff could not also have made a contract with NABA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Count 2 alleges that \"Defendant Bailey used confidential information acquired during his employment with the Plaintiff-in particular information regarding the Plaintiff's sales strategies, profit margins, and pricing on the NABA contract, and NABA's price mark-up-to advance the interests of Defendant Premier, enabling Premier to undercut the Plaintiff's prices through its own contract with NABA.\" Supp. Complt. at \u00b6 70. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant Bailey's breach \"damaged\" Plaintiff \"through lost revenues in an amount not yet to be determined.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72. Count 2 also references Plaintiff's earlier allegations concerning NABA, which included that \"NABA packages and distributes the Plaintiff's products,\" which could then be sold to state and local agencies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. Using information about Plaintiff's pricing on products sold through NABA, Premier sold similar products and \"undercut the Plaintiff's pricing using confidential ABMC pricing information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the reasons stated on Count 1, the Court finds that amending and supplementing the Plaintiff's Complaint to include these allegations would not be futile. Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Bailey used information covered by the confidentiality provisions of the employment contract to harm Defendant by assisting Premier to sell substantially similar products\n   at lower prices. Such alleged conduct certainly implicates Plaintiff's confidential business strategies and therefore alleges a breach of contract. Defendants' contention that Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled damages is also unpersuasive. Defendants are correct that \"an allegation that defendant 'suffered damages' without particular facts as to how she was damaged does not satisfy\" the federal pleading requirements.\n   <em>\n    International Business Machines Corp. v. Dale\n   </em>\n   , No. 7:11-cv-951,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204012399\">\n    2011 WL 4012399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2011). In\n   <em>\n    Dale\n   </em>\n   , the defendant's counterclaim alleged \"damages in the amount of $150,000 without an explanation for how she was damaged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204012399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is not the case here. Plaintiff alleges damages, without stating a particular amount, contending that amount cannot yet be determined. Plaintiff certainly explains the cause of the damage here: a breach of the employment agreement in which Bailey used confidential information to undercut Plaintiff's prices and take business away from the company. Plaintiff alleges an injury caused by a breach of contract, and an amended Complaint that states that injury would not be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As such, Plaintiff's motion will be granted in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Count 3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Count 3 alleges that Defendant Bailey's Employee Compliance Certification prohibits direct and indirect solicitation of Plaintiff's \"suppliers, customers, employees, distributors, sub-distributors or consultants\" for one year after the end of Bailey's employment. Supp. Complt. at \u00b6 74. Defendant contends that Bailey's employment ended on December 23, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75. Plaintiff alleges that Bailey's work to obtain Peckham's assistance with the Michigan Contract amounts to a violation of the non-solicitation agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 76-83\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants contend that this count should be dismissed because the non-solicitation agreement in Bailey's contract expired one year after his termination or resignation from employment with AMBC. That agreement states that \"[d]uring and for a period of one (1) year after my termination or resignation from employment with [Plaintiff], I will not directly or indirectly solicit suppliers, customers, employees, distributors, sub-distributors or consultants of ABMC for my benefit or for the benefit of any other party.\" Employee Compl. Cert., at \u00b6 2. Plaintiff admits that the agreement appears to place a one-year limit on the non-solicitation agreement after the end of the employment relationship. Plaintiff argues, however, that Bailey had a \"1099 consulting relationship\" with Plaintiff that extended beyond the termination of his employment contract and \"he continued to manage those customers' accounts on the plaintiff's behalf.\" As such, the non-solicitation agreement still applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court finds that amendment/supplementation would be futile with respect to any non-solicitation claims in Count 3. The non-solicitation clause in the contract expires one year after the termination of employment with the Plaintiff. Plaintiff's proposed supplemented/amended Complaint alleges that \"in 2009, with the Plaintiff's knowledge and consent, Bailey founded his own company, defendant Premier, in order to continue servicing a customer contract that, for regulatory reasons, the Plaintiff could no longer service.\" Proposed Supplemental/Amend Complt. at \u00b6 8. Then, \"[i]n September, 2011, Bailey transitioned into a 1099 consulting relationship with the Plaintiff, whereby Bailey received an increased commission on sales in lieu of his previous salary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. The non-solicitation agreement quoted above ends one year after termination of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, Plaintiff admits that Bailey's employment ended and became a consultancy in 2011. A consultant is not an employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff is correct to argue that the determination of whether a person is an employee or independent contractor is normally a question of fact for a jury to determine.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Carlson v. American Intl. Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547837\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/490/#p301\">\n    30 N.Y.3d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547837\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/490/#p301\">\n    89 N.E.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.Y. 2017) (\"In various ... contexts, we and other courts have held that the determination of whether someone is an independent contractor is a fact-specific question.\"). The Court finds that a jury need not make this determination, however, since Plaintiff has admitted that Bailey stopped being an employee after 2011 and became a consultant. The plain language of the agreement precludes Plaintiff's claim that Bailey breached the non-solicitation agreement in his Employee Compliance Certification. The solicitation Plaintiff alleges occurred well more than a year after the end of Plaintiff's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The motion will be denied in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Count 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants also contend Count 4 in the proposed supplemental/amended Complaint is futile. That count alleges that Defendant breached the non-solicitation agreement in the employee contract in 2016 through his contacts with ARDHHS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Complt. at \u00b6\u00b6 86-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For the reasons explained above in connection with Count 3, the Court finds that supplementing the Complaint would be futile in this respect. The Court will therefore deny the Plaintiff's motion in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Based on Defendant's briefing, the Court would apply the same standard of futility to evaluating an Amended Complaint as to the motion to supplement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Burch v.

Accepting the allegations here as true, however, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged the existence of trade secrets, if barely. Read as a whole, and making all inferences in Plaintiff's favor, Plaintiff's complaint alleges that AMBC developed and used a compilation of information about marketing, pricing, packaging, and selling testing kits to the Michigan DOC that provided the company with a significant advantage over competitors. As explained in connection with the breach-of-contract claims, not all of Plaintiff's allegedly confidential information could constitute a trade secret, but at this stage in the litigation that allegation is sufficiently pled. Likewise, the question of whether Plaintiff acted adequately to protect the information is best left until after discovery. As discussed above, Plaintiff made an effort through a confidentiality agreement to keep the alleged trade secrets confidential. Plaintiff will be required, of course, to point to actual trade secrets in sufficient detail after discovery.

They first contend that Plaintiff cannot meet the \"tangible expectancy\" test because Plaintiff's allegations concerning the likelihood of a contract with the DOD represent a mere hope, which is insufficient to state a claim. Plaintiff alleges that Bailey, while working for AMBC, \"attended various meetings for the purpose of establishing a business relationship between Plaintiff and the U.S. Department of Defense[.]\" Supp. Complt. at \u00b6 52. Plaintiff hoped to sell the Department drug-testing equipment.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \"Plaintiff never developed a business relationship with the Department of Defense nor saw any business from Bailey's activities.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 54.

Plaintiff here admits that it did not have a business relationship with DOD, but simply hoped for a future one, and that the company never had any business relationship with DOD during Bailey's time with the company, either as employee or consultant. Plaintiff's argument that this expectancy of an agreement was more than a mere hope is unpersuasive. Plaintiff contends that AMBC sent Bailey to have numerous meetings with the Department of Defense, and intended and expected those meetings to lead to a contract. The fact that Premier secured a contract, Plaintiff contends, is evidence of Plaintiff's tangible expectancy. The Court disagrees. Plaintiff's argument describes a hope that business meetings would lead to a contract. A hope is not a tangible expectancy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Defendants next argue that Plaintiff has not pled facts sufficient to meet the essential element test. To satisfy that test, a plaintiff must allege that \"the opportunity ... was 'necessary' for or 'essential' to its business such that 'the consequences\n    of deprivation are so severe as to threaten the viability of the enterprise.' \"\n    <em>\n     Moser\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3548779\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/42/731/#p735\">\n     42 A.D. 3d at 735\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3548779\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/42/731/#p735\">\n     839 N.Y.S.2d 843\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Alexander &amp; Alexander\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=542%20N.Y.S.2d%20530\">\n     542 N.Y.S.2d at 534\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). The Court finds that Plaintiff has not stated a plausible claim in this respect either.

In New York, a party proves tortious interference with contract by showing \"(1) a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third party; (2) the defendant's knowledge of that contract; (3) the defendant's intentional procurement of the third party's breach of that contract; and (4) damages.\"\n    <em>\n     Iacono v.

They argue that Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendants received something of value which belonged to Plaintiff, and the claim must therefore fail. Moreover, Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendant Bailey profited from the alleged unjust enrichment.

Here, the Plaintiff alleges that, due to the Defendants' misconduct, a bid that should have been prepared by Plaintiff and Peckham was prepared by Premier and Peckham. The money and property that rightly belonged to Plaintiff that Defendants received, Plaintiff alleges, was the contract payment from the Michigan DOC. Plaintiff's allegation is not that property that was rightly Plaintiff's ended up in Defendants' hands. Instead, Plaintiff's allegation is that Defendants interfered in the process of bid preparation between Peckham and Plaintiff. The money that came from that bid process could not be considered the property of anyone but the Michigan DOC until the contract was awarded and paid out. Plaintiff's claim here is essentially an attempt to state a tort claim in equity. Plaintiff alleges Defendants improperly used Plaintiff's knowledge to construct a winning bid. As explained, however, unjust enrichment occurs when \"the defendant, though guilty of no wrongdoing, has received money to which he or she is not entitled.\"\n    <em>\n     Corsello\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719503\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/777/#p790\">\n     18 N.Y.3d at 790\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719503\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/777/#p790\">\n     944 N.Y.S.2d 732\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719503\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/777/#p790\">\n     967 N.E.2d 1177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

As the Court has found that Plaintiff should be permitted to supplement/amend the original complaint as discussed above, the original complaint is no longer the operative pleading. The Defendants' motion to dismiss is now moot. Moreover, the Court has considered the arguments that Defendants make regarding each of the claims in the original complaint in deciding Plaintiff's motion. The Court finds that Defendants' arguments regarding the breach-of-contract and misappropriation of trade secrets claims that remain in the complaint are unpersuasive with respect the original Complaint as well. The Court will therefore deny the Defendants' motion as moot.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
