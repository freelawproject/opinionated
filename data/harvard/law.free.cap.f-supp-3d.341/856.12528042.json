For the reasons set forth below, the motion [18] is denied. The case is set for further status on October 4, 2018 at 9:00 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Maria Isabel Corpeno-Argueta-a citizen of the Republic of El Salvador-crossed the United States border on or about December 26, 2014, seeking asylum in the United States. [16, at \u00b6 1.] At the time that Plaintiff filed her amended complaint, her asylum case was still pending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant United States of America-by and through its employees working for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\")-arrested Plaintiff upon entering the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or about January 12, 2015, ICE placed Plaintiff in an alternative to detention program known as Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (\"ISAP\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. When Plaintiff was placed in ISAP, Plaintiff's spouse and two minor children resided in Waukegan, Illinois.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. Plaintiff did not have any criminal record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a condition of Plaintiff's release into the community to live with her family, ICE required Plaintiff (as a participant in ISAP) to be placed in an ankle bracelet to be monitored electronically.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Plaintiff alleges that the decision to place her in an ankle monitoring device was made by ICE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. On or about January 12, 2015, Defendant B.I. Incorporated (\"B.I.\")-by and through its employees working in the scope of their employment at the Chicago office of ISAP-affixed a monitoring device to Plaintiff's right ankle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Although Defendant B.I. placed the monitoring device on Plaintiff, removal of the monitoring device required action by ICE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. Plaintiff complied with all check-in and reporting requirements for ISAP by appearing in-person at the Chicago office of ISAP, which was operated by B.I. through a contract with ICE (or the United States of America).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From January 2015 through September 2015, on each occasion that Plaintiff appeared in-person at the Chicago office of ISAP-approximately two times per month through July 2015 and one time per month in August and September 2015-Plaintiff complained to the ISAP office that the ankle monitoring device was too tight and too bulky, causing Plaintiff numbness, pain, and difficulty walking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. In March 2015, Plaintiff started requesting that the ISAP office remove and replace the electronic monitor with a monitor that was not as tight and not as bulky.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. In the alternative, Plaintiff requested that the electronic monitor be loosened or placed on her other ankle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ISAP office refused Plaintiff's requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Plaintiff, starting in January 2015, when an employee of Defendant United States of America (the \"United States\" or the \"Government\") made monthly visits to Plaintiff's home, Plaintiff complained to the employee that the ankle monitor was too tight and too bulky, causing numbness, pain, and difficulty walking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. From the time of the decision to place Plaintiff in an ankle monitoring device on or about January 12, 2015, through October 4, 2015, ICE did not review the need for Plaintiff's placement in the ankle monitoring device.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2015, the ISAP office referred Plaintiff to a medical clinic in Waukegan to be evaluated based on her complaints, but the first available appointment at the medical clinic was on October 20, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. On October 4, 2015, while walking down stairs at her residence, Plaintiff sustained a right ankle fracture caused by the physical stress the ankle monitor placed on her ankle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Plaintiff sought emergency medical treatment the same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The following day, Plaintiff underwent surgical treatment consisting of open reduction internal fixation of the right ankle fracture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on October 4, 2017. [See 1.] Plaintiff seeks to bring a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act against the Government (Count I) and a negligence claim against B.I. (Count II). [See 16.] Defendant B.I. answered Plaintiff's amended complaint [17], but the Government moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction. [See 18.] In support of its motion, the Government attached the declaration of Paul C. Morley, an ICE deportation officer. [19-1.] Officer Morley avers that responsibility for the placement and monitoring of the ankle bracelet had been contracted by ICE to a private vendor (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , B.I.) and that ICE was not involved with or responsible for the placement or monitoring of the device on Plaintiff. [19-1 (Morley Decl.), at \u00b6\u00b6 4-6, 11-12.] Officer Morley further avers that ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were not responsible for monitoring the day-to-day operations of B.I.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11-12. According to Officer Morley, \"[o]nce [Plaintiff] was enrolled in the monitoring program provided by B.I., ICE and its employees were not involved with or responsible for the placement or monitoring of the GPS ankle bracelet on [Plaintiff].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. \"ICE employees did not conduct any interviews with [Plaintiff], either in-person or by telephone, and ICE employees did not conduct any home inspections to verify [Plaintiff's] compliance with the supervised release order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Attached to the declaration are portions of the United States' contract with B.I. [19-1, at 6-9.] The full contract is referenced in the government's memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss [19, at 2] and is publicly available on ICE's website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 n.3. Although the Court cannot summarize the substance of all 276 pages of contractual documents, the Court notes that the contract contains detailed requirements regarding how the contract is to be carried out. See Contract No. HSCEDM-14-D-00004 between B.I. and United States of America, available at\n   <em>\n    https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/contracts/biIncorporatedHSCEDM14D00004.pdf\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Chapter 171 covers a great deal of ground: it defines various terms, \u00a7 2671; it establishes rules for administrative adjustment of claims, \u00a7 2672; it requires exhaustion of administrative remedies, \u00a7 2675; it stipulates that the remedies it contains are exclusive, \u00a7 2679; and it carves out exceptions to its coverage, \u00a7 2680. One could not find the exceptions of \u00a7 2680 to be jurisdictional without at the same time giving jurisdictional status to the remainder of these provisions, including the exhaustion rule. This result, however, would be inconsistent with the way that the Supreme Court has treated filing rules in the analogous context of a lawsuit claiming employment discrimination by a federal agency.

[19, at 6-7.]\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Plaintiff appears to concede that ICE's decisions regarding whom to detain and in what manner those detained should be monitored involve elements of judgment or choice-satisfying the first prong of the discretionary function exception. Plaintiff argues, however, that the government's alleged decision to do nothing in response to her complaints regarding the placement of the electronic monitor cannot satisfy the second prong of the discretionary function exception. Plaintiff alleges that employees working for ICE \"did not review the need for [P]laintiff's placement in an ankle bracelet monitoring device[,]\" [16, at \u00b6 15], even though Plaintiff repeatedly complained \"that the right ankle monitor was too tight and bulky, causing [P]laintiff numbness, pain, and difficulty walking.\" [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 15-18.] Plaintiff further alleges that from March 2015 through September 2015-during her in-person appearances at the Chicago office of ISAP-she repeatedly requested that (1) her ankle monitor be replaced with a monitor that was not as tight and bulky, or (2) her ankle monitor be loosened or placed on her other ankle.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 19.

Interlocutory Appeal\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Although the Court is treating the FTCA's exceptions as claims-processing rules-not jurisdictional limits-the Court recognizes that there is substantial ground for difference of opinion regarding whether the FTCA's exceptions are jurisdictional in light of recent Supreme Court cases, as discussed above. Accordingly, the Court invites the parties to consider whether the following question may be appropriate for certification for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S. Code \u00a7 1292(b) :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    Whether the exceptions to the Federal Tort Claims Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202671\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671\n    </extracted-citation>\n    et seq., found in Chapter 171 of the Act-including the independent contractor exception under \u00a7 2671 and the discretionary function exception under \u00a7 2680(a) -are claims-processing rules or jurisdictional limits.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    In raising this issue, the Court remains uncertain whether a ruling on this controlling question of law will materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation (an issue the parties have yet to address), which is a prerequisite to certification for appeal under \u00a7 1292(b). Based on the information currently before the Court, it appears that-even if the exceptions to the FTCA were considered jurisdictional-some discovery would be necessary to determine whether the discretionary function exception applies. For example, it is unclear how Plaintiff could determine whether the government action or inaction in this case was based on policy considerations otherwise. Discovery also may be necessary to determine whether the contractor exception applies. Although the Government relies heavily on its contract with B.I. to argue that it was not involved in B.I.'s day-to-day operations [see 21, at 6-7; 28, at 7], the provisions of the contract cited to by the Government do not conclusively establish that point. For example, the Government does not cite any contractual provision negating Plaintiff's allegation that removal of the monitoring device required action by ICE. [16, at \u00b6 13.] Furthermore, other provisions of the contract suggest that the Government may have been involved in certain aspects of B.I.'s day-to-day operations. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Contract No. HSCEDM-14-D-00004 between B.I. and United States available at\n    <em>\n     https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/contracts/biIncorporatedHSCEDM14D00004.pdf\n    </em>\n    , at 103-105, 120-121 (identifying detailed descriptions regarding the qualifications and responsibilities for contractor personnel, as well as specific training requirements for case specialists and management staff).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Still, the affidavit that the Government submitted in support of its motion to dismiss provides strong evidence that B.I. was acting as an independent contractor.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    In that affidavit, Officer Morley avers that \"[o]nce [Plaintiff] was enrolled in the monitoring program provided by B.I., ICE and its employees were not involved with or responsible for the placement or monitoring of the GPS ankle bracelet on [Plaintiff\n    ].\" [19-1, at \u00b6 12.] Officer Morley further avers that \"ICE employees did not conduct any interviews with [Plaintiff], either in-person or by telephone, and ICE employees did not conduct any home inspections to verify [Plaintiff's] compliance with the supervised release order.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202671\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Plaintiff argues, however, that the extent of ICE's involvement in Plaintiff's case cannot be determined without reviewing Plaintiff's entire file.

The Court will consider any arguments on these points if any party moves for certification of the controlling question of law identified above (or a variation thereof) for interlocutory appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1292(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.

The Government also argues that its contract with B.I. requires that all home visits of ISAP participants be performed by B.I. [21, at 6 n.1]. Even if the Court were to consider this contractual language in ruling on the Government's motion to dismiss, the cited contractual provision provides that the contractor shall provide services-such as home visits-\"when selected and assigned by ATD Officers on a case by case [sic] basis[.]\" Contract No. HSCEDM-14-D-00004 between B.I. and United States of America, available at\n     <em>\n      https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/contracts/biIncorporatedHSCEDM14D00004.pdf\n     </em>\n     , at 110.
