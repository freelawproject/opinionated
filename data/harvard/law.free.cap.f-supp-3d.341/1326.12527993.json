Martin, Dana Bowers, Jasmine Clark, Smythe DuVal, Jeanne Dufort, and the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, Inc.'s (\"Electors\") Amended Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Civ. A. No. 1:18-cv-4766 [hereinafter, \"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   \"], Dkt. No. [19] and Plaintiffs Georgia Muslim Voter Project (\"GMVP\") and Asian-Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta's (\"Advancing Justice-Atlanta\") Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Civ. A. 1-18-cv-4789 [hereinafter, \"\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   \"], Dkt. No. [5]. Plaintiffs seek an injunction to prevent election officials-as mere enforcers of current Georgia law-from rejecting absentee ballot applications and ballots due to an alleged signature mismatch or other technical error without pre-rejection notice, a reasonable opportunity to cure the deficiency before Election Day, and an opportunity to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   All Plaintiffs seek an injunction on the basis that Georgia's statutory procedures for rejecting absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 21-2-381, - 386, infringe upon the fundamental right to vote in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiff Electors also allege that such procedures threaten to burden the fundamental right to vote in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of substantive due process. Finally, Plaintiffs GMVP and Advancing Justice-Atlanta contend that the aforementioned Georgia statutes violate the procedural due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the extent they deprive absentee ballot applicants and absentee voters of notice and an opportunity to be heard before their ballots or applications are rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because the Electors just filed a motion for preliminary injunction on Friday and an amended motion for preliminary injunction on Tuesday morning (the day of the hearing), the Court will only consider the Electors' arguments as to signature mismatch. All other Elector claims will be addressed by the Court at a later time, after Defendants have had an opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order,\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [21] (setting a briefing schedule to resolve the Electors' Amended Motion for Preliminary Injunction). This Order will address the entirety of the\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Motion and the signature mismatch argument from the\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After due consideration and with the benefit of oral argument, the Court enters the following Order:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Summary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Georgia law authorizes any eligible voter to cast his or her absentee ballot by mail. With the exception of a slight change to the oath requirement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the procedures governing how county registrars verify absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots have been in place since 2007. Harvey Decl.,\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [24-1] \u00b6 4. The first step in the absentee-voting process is for a voter to submit an absentee ballot application via mail, fax, email, or in person. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-381(a)(1)(A). A voter may submit an absentee ballot application as early as 180 days prior to the date of the primary or election through and including the Friday before the primary or election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Absentee ballots cannot be issued the day before a primary or election. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-384(a)(1)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When an absentee ballot is received, the county registrar or absentee ballot clerk must determine if the applicant is eligible to vote in the relevant primary or election by comparing the applicant's identifying information to the applicant's information on file with the registrar's office. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-381(b)(1). If the elector signed the application, the registrar must compare the elector's application signature to the elector's voter registration card signature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If the registrar determines that the signatures do not match, the clerk or the board of registrars \"shall deny the application by writing the reason for rejection in the proper space on the application and shall promptly notify the applicant in writing of the ineligibility.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-381(b)(2)(3). While there is no procedure by which an elector can contest the registrar's decision, the statutes do not prevent an elector whose application is rejected from applying a second time or voting in person. In Gwinnett County, when a voter's application for an absentee ballot is rejected, the Gwinnett County Board of Registrations and Elections (\"BORE\") sends a letter by first-class mail within three days of the rejection along with a written explanation of why the ballot was rejected, a new application, and an explanation of other ways the individual can cast his or her vote. Ledford Decl.,\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [23-1] \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   If a voter's eligibility is confirmed, the registrar must mail an absentee ballot to the voter. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-381(b)(2)(A). When an absentee voter receives an official absentee ballot, they receive two envelopes. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-384(b). The voter must place the completed absentee ballot in the smaller of the two envelopes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The smaller envelope must then be placed in the larger envelope, which contains the oath of the elector and a line for the elector's signature. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-384(b) - (c). All absentee ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day to be counted. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-386(a)(1)(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon receipt of each absentee ballot, the registrar or clerk must once again compare the elector's oath signature or mark made on the outside of the envelope with the signature or mark on the absentee elector's voter registration card. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-386(a)(1)(B). A ballot will be rejected \"[i]f the elector has failed to sign the oath, or if the signature does not appear to be valid, or if the elector has failed to furnish required information or information so furnished does not conform with that on file ... or if the elector is otherwise found disqualified to vote[.]\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-386(a)(1)(C). The clerk shall write \"Rejected\" across the face of the envelope, provide the reason for rejection, and \"promptly notify the elector of such rejection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   An elector whose ballot is rejected pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-386(a) may vote in the primary or election by either applying for a second absentee ballot at least two days prior to the election or primary, or voting in person through early absentee voting or at the elector's polling place on the day of the election or primary.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Comp.%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%20183-1-14\">\n    Ga.

Consistent with these regulations, within three days of a rejection, Gwinnett County provides a voter with a letter stating the reasons for rejection, a new application for an absentee ballot, and information on how to vote in person through early or Election Day voting. Ledford Decl.,\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [23-1] \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, before an absentee ballot is rejected for mismatched signatures in Gwinnett County, the Gwinnett County Director of Registration and Elections, Lynn Ledford, reviews the questioned ballot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Comp.%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%20183-1-14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15.

By contrast, an elector whose absentee ballot is rejected on grounds that the elector is unqualified to vote is provided with notice, a hearing \"on an expedited basis prior to the certification of the consolidated returns of the election,\" and given an opportunity to appeal to the board of registrars, as well as further opportunity for judicial appeal. O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 21-2-229, - 230(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   County election directors are reporting an increase in the volume of absentee by-mail voting and absentee in-person (early) voting for the upcoming general election. Harvey Decl.,\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [24-1] \u00b6 7. Indeed, Defendant Gwinnett County reports that it has received \"significantly\" more absentee ballot applications for the upcoming election than in previous years. Ledford Decl.,\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [23-1] \u00b6 20. Plaintiff Electors contend that the recently publicized dangers associated with voting in person using Georgia's paperless Direct Recording Electronic (\"DRE\") machines has led candidates from all parties to encourage Georgia citizens to vote absentee by mail, thereby greatly increasing the number of voters casting their ballots by mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs GMVP and Advancing Justice-Atlanta allege that at least 493 absentee ballot applications and nearly 100 absentee ballots have been rejected due to signature mismatch thus far for the 2018 general election. Ali Decl.,\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [5-3] \u00b6 7. With regards to Gwinnett County, Plaintiff Electors argue that absentee voters in Gwinnett County are more likely than absentee voters outside Gwinnett County to have their absentee ballots rejected.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [1] \u00b6 44. Specifically, Plaintiff Electors allege that as of October 12, 2018, Gwinnett County had rejected 9.6%\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of all absentee mail ballots, while DeKalb County had only rejected 1.9% and Fulton County had rejected none.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Comp.%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%20183-1-14\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Comp.%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%20183-1-14\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Plaintiff Electors also argue that in addition to Gwinnett County's comparatively high rate of rejection, the percentage of ballots rejected by Gwinnett County varies by race and ethnic group-for example, Plaintiff Electors allege that 171 black voters' ballots were rejected while only 66 white voters' ballots were rejected; similarly, Plaintiff Electors note that while Asian and Pacific Islanders made up approximately 15% of the mail ballot voters as of October 12th, they made up 25% of the mail ballot rejections.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Comp.%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%20183-1-14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Comp.%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%20183-1-14\">\n    \u00b6 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant Gwinnett County explains that as of Thursday, October 18th, BORE has rejected a total of 713 absentee ballot applications.

These Plaintiffs also ask that voters whose absentee ballots are rejected be given an opportunity to resolve and appeal a signature discrepancy pursuant to the existing procedures set forth in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-230(g) within three days of Election Day or three days after receiving pre-rejection notice, whichever is later. For ballot application rejections, Plaintiffs GMVP and Advancing Justice-Atlanta ask that voters also be permitted to avail themselves of the notice and opportunity procedures in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-230(g) up until the Friday before Election Day.\n   <em>\n    See GMVP\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Thus, following the Seventh Circuit's reasoning, the Eleventh Circuit similarly held that the organizational plaintiffs had made a sufficient showing of an imminent concrete injury where they \"reasonably anticipate[d] that they [would] have to divert personnel and time to educating volunteers and voters on compliance with [the Florida statute] and to resolving the problem of voters left off the registration rolls on election day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1165-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In arguing that\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have not presented sufficient resource-diversion evidence, Defendants in their brief correctly note that the Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Common Cause\n   </em>\n   discussed evidence from the organizational plaintiff that it had to divert resources from efforts that were part of its mission to efforts to assist voters in obtaining photo identification.\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Browning\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit found that the SVREP plaintiff made a sufficient showing that it would suffer a concrete injury based only on its \"anticipat[ion] that it will expend many more hours\n   <em>\n    than it otherwise would have\n   </em>\n   conducting follow-up work with registration applicants because voters will have their applications denied due to matching failures.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761058\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/1153/#p1159\">\n    522 F.3d at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arcia v.

These activities include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , phone banking, finding canvassing volunteers, in-person and written \"get-out-the-vote\" efforts (which Advancing Justice-Atlanta conduct in five different languages), preparing for and facilitating voter education forums to educate community members on what will appear on their ballots and on issues that impact them, facilitating a candidate forum, preparing for an upcoming fundraiser and grant-writing efforts, and translating educational materials.\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

If the requested injunction is granted,\n   <em>\n    the State\n   </em>\n   will be required to implement procedures necessary to satisfy procedural due process. In other words, the organizational Plaintiffs will not bear the same burden of assisting and warning voters once the State is required to assist voters whose ballots are challenged as illegitimate and once the urgency of warning voters is diminished by way of due process protections.

There is simply no guarantee that such voters' signatures might match on a second absentee ballot or absentee ballot application.

With respect to their hardship, Defendants essentially argue that it would be unduly burdensome to employ a new procedure this close to the election and that Plaintiffs should have brought their actions sooner. By changing the procedures this close to the election, Defendants argue, the integrity of the election process will be put into question. But Defendants' arguments at the hearing undermine those points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Preliminarily, the Court does not understand how assuring that all eligible voters are permitted to vote undermines integrity of the election process. To the contrary, it strengthens it. Second, Defendants argue that the signature mismatch rejection is \"rare\"-only 0.017% of all accepted absentee ballots in 2016 were rejected on that basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Harvey Decl.,\n   <em>\n    GMVP\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

For instance, according to the Secretary of State's online system-which the State readily admits is not accurate as not all counties track absentee ballot rejection numbers through it-only 228 signature match rejections have occurred statewide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McDonald Decl.,\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

The State cannot claim on one hand that an appeal process would be an administrative nightmare while on the other claiming that such a rejection is rare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   And finally, because the Court is ordering Defendants to provide an opportunity to be heard by essentially adopting the\n   provisional ballot process, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-419,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , election officials will not have to divert resources to conduct informal, identification-confirmation hearings until after the election. In the interim, election officials will only have to additionally provide provisional ballots-which are on the same form as absentee ballots-to ballot applicants with signature mismatches. This, coupled with drafting a new rejection letter which outlines the Court's mandated procedures, is not so burdensome as to outweigh Georgians' right to vote.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wesberry v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs have shown they are entitled to an injunction on the signature mismatch issue. The Court proposes entering the below injunction. As the parties have not had an opportunity to be heard on the exact terms of the Court's proposal, the parties have until noon on Thursday, October 25, 2018, to provide the Court with any objections to the form. Any objections should not exceed 10 pages. The Court is specifically interested in comments as to whether any of the below language is confusing or will be unworkable for the implementing officials. This is not meant to be an opportunity to readdress the propriety of entering the injunction-only its form. The Court will then take into account the parties' comments and immediately enter an injunction similar to that proposed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Proposed Injunction\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Secretary of State's Office shall issue the following instructions to all county boards of registrars, boards of elections, election superintendents, and absentee clerks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   1) All county elections officials responsible for processing absentee ballots shall not reject any absentee ballots due to an alleged signature mismatch. Instead, for all ballots where a signature mismatch is perceived, the county elections official shall mark this ballot as provisional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-419. The county elections official shall then provide pre-rejection notice and an opportunity to resolve the alleged signature discrepancy to the absentee voter. This process shall be done in good faith and is limited to confirming the identity of the absentee voter. This process shall be done no later than three days following the election. The absentee voter shall have the right to appeal any absentee ballot rejection following the outcome of the aforementioned process, as designated in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-229(e).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   2) All county elections officials responsible for processing absentee ballot applications shall not reject any absentee ballot application due to an alleged signature mismatch. Instead, for all ballot applications where a signature mismatch is perceived, the county elections official shall, in addition to the procedure specified in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-381(b), provide a provisional absentee ballot to the absentee voter along with information as to the process that will be followed in reviewing the provisional ballot. The outer envelope of the absentee ballot provided shall be marked provisional. Once any provisional\n   ballot is received, the procedure outlined in section 1 above is to be followed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   3) This injunction should apply to all absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots with designated signature mismatches submitted in this current election. This injunction does not apply to voters who have already cast an in-person vote.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 24th day of October, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Specifically, the oath requirement has changed to require a voter to list his or her year of birth instead of the month and day of birth.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Harvey Decl.,\n    <em>\n     GMVP\n    </em>\n    Dkt.

Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that other absentee voters whose mail ballots are challenged on the basis of the voters' qualifications are given an opportunity to be heard on such challenge before any final determination is made not to count their ballots.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-230(g). No such hearing procedure is granted to absentee voters whose mail ballots are rejected on the basis of a signature mismatch. While these voters may be able to vote another way or submit a new mail ballot, the rejected ballot is never counted. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-381(b)(2)(3). Further, the injury is fairly traceable to the\n    <em>\n     Martin\n    </em>\n    Defendants' enforcement and implementation of these state election laws and redressable by the relief sought.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Nor does the Court find merit in Defendants' assertion that entering injunctive relief this close to an election will seriously disrupt the electoral process, resulting in significant prejudice to both Defendants and the public.
