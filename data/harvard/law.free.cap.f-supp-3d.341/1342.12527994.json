Ross, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. For the reasons\n   set forth below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Lead Plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   are City Pension Fund for Firefighters &amp; Police Officers in the City of Miami Beach, Pembroke Pines Pension Fund for Firefighters and Police Officers, and Hollywood Police Officers' Retirement System. Defendants are HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (\"Company\" or \"HD Supply\"), and Joseph J. DeAngelo and Evan J. Levitt (\"Individual Defendants\"). Plaintiffs bring suit on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired HD Supply common stock between November 9, 2016 and June 5, 2017, inclusive (\"Class Period\"). Plaintiffs bring this suit on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated to recover losses suffered from Defendants' alleged violations of federal securities laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   HD Supply is one of the largest commercial distributors in North America, providing products and services to approximately 500,000 customers across a variety of industrial sectors. The Company's business is concentrated in three segments, with the most important being its Facilities Management (\"FM\") division. As a commercial distributor, the FM segment's lifeblood is its supply chain, which provides it with the ability to obtain the products needed by its customers on a timely basis, and its ability to deliver those products to its customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant DeAngelo has served as HD Supply's President and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") since January 2005, and as Chairman of the Board of Directors since March 12, 2015. DeAngelo also served as the interim CEO of the Company's FM segment from September 2015 until June 5, 2017, when William Stengel was appointed CEO of FM. Defendant Levitt served as HD Supply's Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), Chief Administrative Officer, and Comptroller during the Class Period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court will discuss Plaintiffs' detailed allegations below, but provides here a general summary of the facts Plaintiffs assert in their complaint as part of their allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   5. In the months leading up to the Class Period, FM's supply chain experienced significant failures after relocating its headquarters cross-country and laying off nearly all of its supply chain employees. FM under-ordered inventory for its busy selling season, then, upon realizing its problems, over-ordered to compensate, which, according to former employees directly involved in the supply chain process, \"paralyzed\" the Company's distribution centers as the FM business struggled to process the excess incoming inventory and fill customer orders at the same time. As a result, the FM segment failed to fulfill orders, incurred massive additional expenses, and lost numerous customers and sales. These failures also exposed systemic problems in the segment's supply chain, and left FM floundering to clear its inventory and struggling to return to normal operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   6. Significantly, following FM's operational breakdown, Defendants guaranteed the market that HD Supply was successfully implementing measures to rectify its supply chain deficiencies, and that any inventory delays and expenditures would be quickly resolved. Indeed, Defendant DeAngelo emphasized that he\n   and the rest of the Company's senior executives were \"laser focused\" and \"intensely engaged\" on the recovery. On November 9, 2016-the start of the Class Period-Defendant DeAngelo appeared at the Robert W. Baird Global Industrial Conference, where he assured investors that the most serious deficiencies in FM's supply chain had been fixed, that the Company's \"supply-chain execution\" had \"tracked exactly where we thought it would be,\" and that the recovery process was \"on track.\" When analysts pressed for further information, DeAngelo reiterated that \"we have no surprises, we're right on track,\" and that the Company was \"perfectly positioned\" to deliver strong results in 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   7. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants repeated these assurances. On February 22, 2017, Defendant Levitt appeared at the Barclays Industrial Select Conference, where he further made clear that the problems that had affected the FM supply chain in 2016 had been rectified. Levitt acknowledged that the Company suffered \"a bit of a supply chain disruption\" in 2016, but emphasized that \"[a]ll of that's behind us now. Supply chain is in [as] good condition as it's ever been[.]\" Levitt further added that the Company had \"pivoted from that supply chain recovery to a commercial recovery in November,\" and that the Company felt \"real good about where we are and the prospects for 2017.\" Levitt's assurances had their intended effect on investors: on February 23, 2017, the day after he spoke at the Barclays conference, the price of HD Supply stock reached its Class Period high of $44.49 per share.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   8. Just one month later, with the stock still trading close to its Class Period high, Defendant DeAngelo liquidated virtually his entire stake in the Company at prices that were artificially inflated by Defendants' fraud. Beginning on March 29, 2017, and continuing over the course of a mere five days, DeAngelo unloaded 1.3 million shares, or 80% of his holdings in HD Supply, for proceeds of almost $54 million. Not only were these sales massive in scale, they were also extraordinarily suspicious in scope and timing. Indeed, DeAngelo had not sold a single share of HD Supply stock in the previous twelve months, and he dumped his stake just one month after Defendants falsely assured investors that the problems that had impacted FM's supply chain in 2016 were \"behind us now.\" Moreover, DeAngelo gave no explanation for the liquidation, and no market-related rationale-such as tax obligations or expiring options-was readily apparent. DeAngelo's stock sales were so large and suspicious that HD Supply took the extraordinary step of emailing its employees to assure them that, despite his liquidation of stock, DeAngelo had not lost confidence in the Company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   9. In reality, Defendants knew full well that the problems that had impacted the FM supply chain were not \"behind us now,\" and that, in stark contrast to Defendants' public statements, the supply chain was not in \"as good condition as it's ever been.\" Indeed, former high-ranking Company employees, each of whom were personally involved in the supply chain recovery effort, confirmed that by November 2016 at the latest, it was well known inside the Company-including to the Individual Defendants-that \"the supply chain needed a massive overhaul to meet demand,\" and that the Individual Defendants were well aware of the continued deficiencies in the FM segment's supply chain. These employees also confirmed that the Individual Defendants received daily reports and data that made clear the severity of the supply chain problems, and that this information\n   stood in direct contrast to Defendants' public representations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   10. Significantly, these employees also independently confirmed that, in December 2016, the \"Supply Chain Transformation Team,\" which was tasked with guiding the supply chain recovery efforts, prepared a detailed presentation for HD Supply's senior management. This presentation meticulously outlined the dire need for a multi-million-dollar, long-term overhaul of the Company's supply chain. Nazia Ali (\"Ali\"), HD Supply's then-Director of Supply Chain Transformation and the head of this team, repeatedly stressed to the Individual Defendants and the rest of the management team that the Company's recovery efforts were ineffective and deficient, and required a much more substantial plan. Defendant DeAngelo refused to implement the team's recommendations, and instead Ali was fired just days later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   11. The full extent of Defendants' fraud was not revealed until June 6, 2017, when the Company issued a press release admitting that, contrary to Defendants' prior representations, FM's supply chain issues had still not been fixed. On that day, the Company disclosed that: (1) the problems affecting the FM supply chain were still materially impacting the Company's business, such that FM's Q1 2017 adjusted EBITDA\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   had actually declined a staggering 13% compared to the same quarter of the prior year-representing the largest such drop in HD Supply's history as a public company; (2) the FM supply chain recovery efforts would extend through the rest of 2017, and even into 2018; and (3) as a result of the ongoing supply chain problems, the Company would be forced to spend substantial additional sums on the recovery efforts, which would materially impact Adjusted EBITDA in future periods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   12. Moreover, during a conference call to discuss these results, analysts pressed management for additional details regarding these disclosures. In response, DeAngelo adamantly refused to quantify the additional supply chain investments. During the call, Defendants also admitted that, in direct contrast to their statements in February 2017, that the supply chain problems were \"behind us now,\" in reality the FM supply chain had only just begun to function properly \"exiting the quarter,\" i.e., in May 2017 at the earliest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   13. Analysts were shocked by these admissions, slashing the Company's ratings and excoriating management for their prior misrepresentations. For example, Deutsche Bank issued a report headlined, \"Downgrading to Hold; Credibility Crunch,\" which emphasized that management's credibility had become an \"impediment\" given that management had \"repeatedly professed high confidence in the Company's profit trajectory,\" and was now calling for \"a sizeable ramp in FM investment spending for which details and magnitude were not articulated.\" As such, it was \"unclear when the new elevated spending might subside, and could instead go on for years.\" Similarly, RBC Capital Markets stated that the \"most troubling development was the new incremental FM spending that was unexpected and frankly poorly explained on the call.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   14. As a result of Defendants' disclosures, HD Supply's share price crashed, falling $7.24 per share, or 17.5%, from a\n   close of $41.27 per share on June 5, 2017, to a close of $34.03 per share on June 6, 2017. The stock fell another $1.22 per share, or 4%, to $32.81 per share on June 7, 2017, as the market continued to digest the news. In total, HD Supply stock fell more than 20% in just two trading days in response to these disclosures, wiping out a total of $1.7 billion in market capitalization. Moreover, the stock price never recovered, and today trades far below its Class Period high-and the prices at which DeAngelo sold his stake in the Company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   15. Investors who purchased HD Supply common stock at artificially-inflated prices during the Class Period have suffered substantial losses from Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws. This action seeks redress on behalf of these aggrieved shareholders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Consolidated Am.

The Court disagrees. Plaintiffs have alleged that at least by August 2016, the Company started \"Project Firefight\" to attempt to fix the supply chain disruption through triage measures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44-46.

In attendance at these daily meetings were regional management and usually DeAngelo, Stengel, and the Company's Vice President of Distribution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DeAngelo participated in these calls \"pretty much every day,\" and asked specific questions about how the individual distribution centers were performing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, CW2's team provided daily data updates for management, which included in-stock levels of critical products and fill-rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. According to CW1, this data was compiled daily from an internal \"data warehouse\" system and sent out every morning via emails \"for everyone to see,\" which later served as the basis for the daily meetings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These daily updates were still happening by November 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs have also specifically alleged that according to CW1, by November 2016, it was apparent that \"the supply chain needed a massive overhaul to meet demand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51. Plaintiffs further provide that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   CW2 stated that the supply chain data that CW2's team prepared specifically indicated that the supply chain recovery was experiencing significant failures and was not where management wanted it to be. CW4, who reported to CW2 and was also part of the team responsible for preparing the underlying data, corroborated CW2's account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54.

According to CW6 and CW1, the supply chain data and progress of supply chain recovery were communicated up the reporting chain to Defendant DeAngelo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, in November 2016, according to CW6, the team lead - Ali - \"had told Stengel during their supply chain evaluation meetings that FM's distribution centers were not able to function in their current state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65. Additionally, \"the supply chain transformation team, particularly Ali and CW6, had also briefed Stengel on the systemic weaknesses in the supply chain in November 2016, which CW6 characterized as 'pull[ing] the curtain back a little and r[unning] them through what was happening with distribution center operations.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.

As explained above, Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient details regarding the falsity of the metrics information based on the CWs' beliefs and information at the time, without having to specifically quantify how false the statements were when made. This will be made clear through discovery. Moreover, even if DeAngelo's statements about the metrics information from December 6, 2016, turns out to be true, he further reiterated that the supply chain progress was \"on track\" and \"tracking exactly where it should be,\" which according to the CWs was not correct because through November and December 2016, \"the supply chain was still fundamentally broken\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57), the distribution centers could not function in their current state (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65), and a multi-million dollar overhaul of the supply chain was proposed by Ali, the Company's Director of Supply Chain Transformation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants further assert that the complaint's metrics information regarding in-stock rates and fill rates is from the summer of 2016, prior to the Class Period.

Additionally, Defendants contend that Levitt's \"behind us\" statement from February 2017 referred to several specific events which were behind the Company. However, the complaint alleges that, by the beginning of 2017, after Defendants rejected a large-scale proposal to address supply chain problems from the Supply Chain Transformation Team, it was clear to CW6 \"that basically HD Supply had just decided to continue to muddle through with its existing systems rather than undertaking the more extensive and appropriate restructuring measures that were needed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71. In addition, the complaint alleges that \"by March 2017, according to CW5, FM and Company management 'still weren't fixing the issues long-term and they still weren't really getting over the hump.' In fact, the Company was still failing to fulfill orders properly and to manage its supply chain logistics correctly-the same problems that had plagued FM during 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. The Company's act of muddling through with existing systems, rather than restructuring, and continuing to fail to fulfill orders properly and manage supply chain logistics correctly, which had also plagued FM in 2016, support Plaintiffs' allegations that Levitt made false statements about supply chain disruption being behind the Company. While Defendants offer other explanations, when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have made particularized allegations to survive dismissal. The same is true on the issue of inventory rebalancing. Viewing the complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that these particular statements about the inventory were false or misleading, and that discovery will determine whether the rebalancing effort had actually fixed the supply chain's underlying problems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carlton v.

The Court disagrees. As Plaintiffs argue in response, the CWs listed in the complaint were tasked with assessing the supply chain and determining how to repair it as well as reviewing, compiling, and reporting supply chain performance metrics daily and weekly to the Individual Defendants. Thus, they had the knowledge during the relevant time frame based on a proximity to the supply chain issues. Viewing the complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court accepts the particularized statements from the CWs at this time. Discovery may prove that Defendants are correct - that these six CWs merely disagreed with how the Company was addressing problems with the supply chain and that the Company was continuously improving. But at this early stage, Plaintiffs have met the standard to survive dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In summary, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient particularized facts to support their allegations that Defendants made false or misleading statements to support Plaintiffs' 10(b) claims, except for the statements from \u00b6\u00b6 93, 108, and 109 in the complaint as discussed herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The Eleventh Circuit has explained the standard governing scienter as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Rule 10b-5 requires a plaintiff to show that the defendant made the material misstatement or omission with the requisite culpable state of mind, or scienter.

Defendants' disclosures on March 14, 2017 and June 6, 2017 revealed to the market the false and misleading nature of Defendants' statements and omissions. On March 14, 2017, Defendants revealed that the FM supply chain recovery was not completed as previously stated, but instead $10 million of additional expenses was needed to get the supply chain recovery to completion. In response to Defendants' March 14, 2017 partial disclosure, the price of HD Supply common stock materially declined from a close of $42.68 on March 13, 2017, to a close of $41.02 on March 14, 2017-a drop of nearly 4% on unusually high volume of 5.75 million shares, as compared with less than half that volume on March 9 and 10, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   145. Then on June 6, 2017, Defendants revealed the full truth of their fraudulent conduct when they disclosed (a) that the supply chain problems and prolonged recovery process had caused a $17 million decline in FM's Q1 Adjusted EBITDA as compared to the same quarter the previous year-the largest such drop in HD Supply's history as a public company; and (b) FM's supply chain would require substantial additional investment during the remainder of the year and into the following year in order to fully recover. In response to Defendants' June 6, 2017 disclosures, the price of HD Supply common stock plummeted by more than 20% over the next two days, from a close of $41.27 on June 5,\n   2017, to a close of $34.03 on June 6, 2017, and then to a close of $32.81 on June 7, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 144-145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   First, Defendants argue that the announcement on March 14, 2017, of $10 million of additional expenses necessary to get the supply chain recovery to completion did not correct or reveal any prior challenged statement to have been false because Defendants had repeatedly warned that the Company would continue to incur such expenses. In support, Defendants cite to their following statements: Defs.' Mtn. to Dismiss at 28 (\"Ex. C at 11 ('[W]e're always making investments in the supply chain. So it wouldn't be appropriate to assume that [supply chain recovery costs] go to zero.'); Ex. A at 5 (lease expense and other costs associated with overflow facilities 'will continue into 2017 and 2018'); Ex. D at 14 (HD Supply would retain labor hired for recovery efforts to be prepared for upcoming 2017 selling season.\") ). While these statements may show that additional expenses might be necessary, none of these statements indicates that $10 million worth of expenses was to be expected. On the same day as the announcement of the $10 million in expenses, Levitt announced the spending as $2 million associated with labor, $5 million associated with freight expenses, and $3 million associated with rent expenses. Compl. at \u00b6 106. Even if the Court accepted Defendants' statements that Defendants had warned of the labor and rent expenses (see\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A and Ex. D), there is no explanation for the additional $5 million for freight expenses. Moreover, while the announcement of the $10 million does not precisely mirror the earlier alleged misrepresentations about the supply chain recovery - that there were no surprises and they were right on track, FM supply chain teams were executing at or ahead of expectations, inventory was perfectly deployed, supply chain disruption was behind the Company and in as good condition as it had ever been by February 2017, and problems with the supply chain were \"behind\" them, Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 92, 96-98, 102-103 - the $10 million announcement for supply chain recovery completion does relate back to the misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Second, the Court need not view the March 14, 2017 corrective disclosure in isolation and can consider the additional alleged corrective disclosure made on June 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552395\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/1189/#p1195\">\n    710 F.3d at 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (court can consider series of partial disclosures). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts establishing that the decline in Q1 EBITDA was caused by the supply chain problems or that the additional investment spending was intended to address any undisclosed problems with the supply chain. However, Plaintiffs did plead facts showing that in response to the June 6 announcement, analysts lost faith in management credibility, contending that management credibility was now an impediment to a sustained higher share price, and analysts stated that the \"most troubling development was the new incremental FM spending that was unexpected and frankly poorly explained on the call,\" and that \"the key new development that appears to have spooked investors was Outperform-rated HD Supply's admission that it needed to invest more than previously expected in FM.\" Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 88-89. These analysts' reports support Plaintiffs' inference that the June 6 announcement revealed a truth to the market about FM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorpe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365627\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/111/1336/#p1378\">\n    111 F.Supp.3d at 1382-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relying on analysts' reports to strengthen the inference that the disclosure revealed a truth to the market in support of loss causation).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Stengel stated\n   that supply chain performance had only improved by May 2017, at the end of the first quarter of 2017, thereby contradicting Levitt's statements from at least February 2017 that the supply chain was in as good condition as it had ever been and all metrics were good or better than they had ever been.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at \u00b6 74. Once again the June 6 announcement may not precisely mirror Defendants' prior alleged misrepresentations, but it does relate back.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, when viewed in totality, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to support that the March 14 and June 6 announcements were corrective disclosures, there was a price drop after the announcements, and a factfinder could infer at this stage that it was more probable than not that the corrective disclosure caused at least a substantial amount of the price drop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' 10(b) claims are sufficiently pleaded so as to proceed except for the specific statements discussed herein found in the complaint at Paragraphs 93, 108, 109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs have failed to plead a primary violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, their control person claims under Section 20(a) must also be dismissed. Having found that all but three specific statements of the 10(b) claims survive, the Court denies Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Section 20(a) claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The complaint alleges that in December 2016, the Company hired a consulting firm called REGIS to audit the inventory of FM's nine largest distribution centers and that the audit revealed that FM's inventory management system was in total disrepair, with an accuracy rate of 80%, below the 90% for industry standards.

However, the Court notes that the complaint does not state when the audit was completed and only that the Company hired REGIS in December 2016. Therefore, the Court does not rely on the audit information to find that the complaint has properly alleged the false and misleading statements from December 2016.
