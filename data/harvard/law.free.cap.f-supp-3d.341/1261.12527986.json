On August 11, 2013, Cynthia Thompson was a passenger in a motor vehicle accident with an underinsured driver. Docket No. 58 at 2, \u00b6 3. Ms. Thompson claimed that she suffered injuries, damages, and losses as a result of the accident.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4.

The Certificate of Death, postmortem autopsy examination, and toxicology report indicate that Ms. Thompson died from respiratory suppression caused by multiple drug intoxication. Docket No. 59-10 at 1-2, 7. Of the two drugs listed in the postmortem examination report as \"capable of producing respiratory suppression and sudden death\" when used in combination,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, diazepam and fentanyl, only the diazepam was prescribed for injuries sustained in the August 11, 2013 car accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 58-2 at 2, \u00b6 11. Although there is evidence showing that Ms. Thompson was prescribed fentanyl in 2010 for pain unrelated to the car accident, it is undisputed that she was not prescribed the drug at any time between August 11, 2013 and her death on February 5, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 58 at 2, \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 59-16 at 1 (Colorado Prescription Drug Monitoring Database printout showing November 16, 2010 as date of last fentanyl prescription). Plaintiff's toxicology expert, William Boroughf, D.O., suggested that the fentanyl patch found on Ms. Thompson's body after her death may have been left over from a prior prescription,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 109-5 at 6; however, plaintiff has proffered no evidence that Ms. Thompson applied the patch at the direction of one of her doctors. In fact, Dr. Boroughf opined that Ms. Thompson's death appeared to have been \"related to inappropriate usage of a left-over fentanyl patch\" in a \"self-directed attempt to control her pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Although the Certificate of Death and postmortem examination report indicated that Ms. Thompson's death was the result of \"multiple\" drug intoxication, Docket No. 59-10 at 1-2, 7, there is also no evidence that the diazepam - or any other prescribed medication - would have been sufficient, in the absence of the fentanyl, to cause Ms. Thompson's overdose. Additionally, Dr. Boroughf opined that the concentrations of diazepam and nordiazepam (a metabolite of diazepam ) in Ms. Thompson's system were \"exceptionally low and not expected to have any significant pharmacological effect\" such that her \"death was almost exclusively related to fentanyl.\" Docket No. 109-5 at 7. In summary, there is no evidence that the medications prescribed to treat pain resulting from the August 11, 2013 car accident were a sufficient cause of Ms. Thompson's overdose. And, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Paul\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Leja\n   </em>\n   cited above, there is no indication that the August 11, 2013 accident caused plaintiff to suffer a cognitive or psychological injury that would have impaired Ms. Thompson's judgment regarding the appropriate use of medication.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12254014\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/192/427/#p436\">\n    192 P.3d at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing rule that a defendant's negligence may be held to be the proximate cause of a person's suicide where the \"negligence resulted in delirium, insanity, or, in some cases, other mental conditions that precluded the deceased from making a rational choice\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on the evidence presented, the Court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude that the automobile accident on August 11, 2013 was the proximate cause of Ms. Thompson's death.

First, plaintiff contends that defendant \"has not met its summary judgment burden on proximate cause\" because defendant has not argued that \"there is proximate cause evidence in the record that [plaintiff] cannot overcome (such as expert medical opinions, treatment statistics, or any other evidence bearing on the likelihood of someone who is injured suffering further injury or death as a result of an accidental overdose on pain medications).\" Docket No. 59 at 12. However, plaintiff's argument improperly attempts to shift the burden of persuasion onto the defendant. As stated above, a moving party who does not bear the burden of persuasion at trial \"may satisfy its burden at the summary judgment stage by identifying a lack of evidence for the nonmovant on an essential element of the nonmovant's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Bausman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090840\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/1111/#p1115\">\n    252 F.3d at 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant has satisfied this requirement by arguing that plaintiff's evidence is insufficient to establish proximate causation, an essential element of plaintiff's declaratory judgment and breach of contract claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090840\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/1111/#p1115\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The burden therefore falls on plaintiff, not defendant, to present evidence demonstrating\n   a genuine issue for trial.\n   <em>\n    Concrete Works of Colo., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532654\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/1513/#p1518\">\n    36 F.3d at 1518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff's second argument is that the Certificate of Death creates a genuine issue of fact regarding whether Ms. Thompson's use of pain medications was a foreseeable intervening cause of her death. Plaintiff relies on the portion of the Certificate that lists \"[p]atient taking pain medication due to accident on 8/10/2013\" under the heading \"other significant conditions - [c]onditions contributing to death.\" Docket No. 59-10 at 1. Instructions published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that this section is meant to reflect \"diseases or conditions contributing to death that were not reported\" as part of the chain of events in the \"immediate cause\" section \"and that did not result in the underlying cause of death.\" Docket No. 59-11 at 2. However, the instructions also provide that, \"[i]f two or more possible sequences resulted in death, or if two conditions seem to have added together,\" the \"immediate cause\" section should reflect the condition that \"most directly caused death\" and the \"other conditions\" section should reflect \"the other conditions or diseases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532654\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/1513/#p1518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff argues that these directions show that \" 'cause' as used on the death certificate is not the same as legal causation.\" Docket No. 59 at 13. But even assuming plaintiff is correct, the Certificate of Death and accompanying instructions establish only that Ms. Thompson's use of pain medications due to the August 2013 accident was a contributing cause of death. Such evidence does not undermine the Court's finding, detailed above, that Ms. Thompson's non-prescribed use of a highly potent opioid was an unforeseeable intervening cause of her death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12254014\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/192/427/#p436\">\n    192 P.3d at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a negligent actor may be relieved of liability \"if, in order to bring about [the plaintiff's] injuries, it was necessary that the conduct\n   <em>\n    combine or join with an intervening cause which also contributed to cause the injuries\n   </em>\n   , but which intervening cause would not have been reasonably foreseen by a reasonably careful person under the circumstances\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, plaintiff contends that a reasonable jury could conclude that Ms. Thompson's fentanyl use is \"the type of conduct that is too frequent to be abnormal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 59 at 13-14.
