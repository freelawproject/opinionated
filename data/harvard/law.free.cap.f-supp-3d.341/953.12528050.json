PETERSON, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a products liability case. Plaintiff Constance Morgan's claim focuses on devices called \"laparoscopic power morcellators,\" which are defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as \"Class II medical devices used during laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgeries to cut tissue into smaller pieces so the tissue can be removed through a small incision site (typically 2 cm long or less).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Morgan alleges that a morcellator used during her hysterectomy in February 2014 caused the spread of uterine cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Morgan is suing defendant Trokamed GmbH (a German company that manufactures the device at issue) and defendant Market-Tiers, Inc., which the parties call Blue Endo (the North American distributor of the device). The question before the court is whether Trokamed has sufficient contacts with Wisconsin to allow this court to exercise personal jurisdiction over that party. Both Morgan and Blue Endo oppose Trokamed's motion to dismiss, so the court will refer to them collectively as \"the opposing parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court will grant Trokamed's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Although the court sees merit to the opposing parties' view that foreign manufacturers can be sued in Wisconsin if they\n   have distribution agreements that cover all of the United States (as Trokamed does), the Supreme Court rejected that view in\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450504,5930194\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/873/\">\n    564 U.S. 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450504,5930194\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/873/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450504,5930194\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/873/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). Because the opposing parties have not persuasively distinguished Trokamed's situation from that of the foreign manufacturer in\n   <em>\n    J. McIntrye\n   </em>\n   , Morgan cannot maintain her claim against Trokamed in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Generally, a federal district court must consider the requirements of both the Due Process Clause and state law when deciding whether the court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant.\n   <em>\n    Ricoh Co. v. Asustek Computer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3992675\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/481/954/#p957\">\n    481 F.Supp.2d 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 957-58 (W.D. Wis. 2007). But in this case, Trokamed does not develop an argument under state law, so the court will limit its analysis to the requirements of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Federal courts recognize two types of personal jurisdiction: general and specific.\n   <em>\n    Daimler AG v. Bauman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/#p126\">\n    571 U.S. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126-33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    187 L.Ed.2d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). A court has general jurisdiction when a defendant's contacts with the forum state are so substantial that the defendant can be sued in that state for any reason; specific jurisdiction focuses on the relationship between the plaintiff's claims and the defendant's contacts with the forum state.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Morgan does not contend that the court can exercise general jurisdiction over Trokamed, so the court will limit its analysis to specific jurisdiction. The court of appeals has synthesized the Supreme Court's opinions on specific jurisdiction into three elements: (1) the defendant must have purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting business in the forum state or purposefully directed his activities at the state; (2) the alleged injury must have arisen from the defendant's forum-related activities, and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n   <em>\n    Felland v.

The court may consider the allegations in the complaint and any evidence submitted by the parties and must resolve any factual disputes in favor of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890214\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/665/#p673\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Trokamed's alleged contacts with Wisconsin\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Most of the parties' debate focuses on the question whether Trokamed purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Wisconsin or purposefully directed activities here. It is undisputed that Trokamed does not have an office, employees, or sales representatives in Wisconsin. The opposing parties do not allege that any representative\n   from Trokamed has visited the state or solicited business here. And there is no evidence or allegations that Trokamed has shipped products to Wisconsin. Instead, the opposing parties rely on the following evidence and allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 the exclusive distribution agreement between Trokamed and Blue Endo;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 statements from Blue Endo's president regarding collaboration between Trokamed and Blue Endo;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 documents showing that morcellators were sent to Wisconsin and allegations that replacement parts were sent here as well;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 a guarantee included in the \"instructions for use\" that accompanied the morcellator;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 the application that Trokamed submitted to the FDA and the agency's approval of that application;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 documents related to a November 2014 safety communication from the FDA about morcellators;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 testimony that a high-ranking officer at Trokamed came to Florida to meet with Blue Endo representatives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court will consider each alleged contact in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Exclusive distribution agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Morgan's primary argument relies on Trokamed's distribution agreement with Blue Endo, which gave Blue Endo the exclusive right to sell Trokamed's morcellators throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Dkt. 9-2, \u00a7 1.5. By entering into that agreement, Morgan says, Trokamed demonstrated its intent sell its products in all 50 states, including Wisconsin. And because it could reasonably expect that its products would be sold in Wisconsin, it \"could reasonably anticipate being haled into court\" here as well.\n   <em>\n    World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

And Justice Ginsburg has defended the theory forcefully in a similar case,\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450504,5930194\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/873/\">\n    564 U.S. 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450504,5930194\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/873/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450504,5930194\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/873/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). The plaintiff in that case was injured by a scrap metal machine manufactured by a foreign company that used a distributor to sell its products throughout the United States, including New Jersey. In concluding that a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over the manufacturer in New Jersey (where the distributor sold the machine at issue and the injury occurred), Justice Ginsburg wrote the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Is it not fair and reasonable, given the mode of trading of which this case is an example, to require the international seller to defend at the place its products cause injury? Do not litigational convenience and choice-of-law considerations point in that direction? On what measure of reason and fairness can it be considered undue to require [the manufacturer] to defend in New Jersey as an incident of its efforts to develop a market for its industrial machines anywhere and everywhere in the United States? Is not the burden on [the manufacturer] to defend in New Jersey fair, i.e., a reasonable cost of transacting business internationally, in comparison to the burden on [the plaintiff] to go to Nottingham, England to gain recompense for an injury he sustained using [the manufacturer's] product at his workplace in Saddle Brook, New Jersey?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [The manufacturer], by engaging [its distributor] to promote and sell its machines in the United States, purposefully\n   availed itself of the United States market nationwide, not a market in a single State or a discrete collection of States. [The manufacturer] thereby availed itself of the market of all States in which its products were sold by its exclusive distributor. The purposeful availment requirement ... simply ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    J.

(internal quotations, alterations, and footnotes omitted). Justice Ginsburg's common-sense opinion strongly supports Morgan's argument in this case. The only problem is that Justice Ginsburg's opinion was the dissent, not the opinion of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The holding of the Court in\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre\n   </em>\n   is not as easily stated as it is in most cases because no single opinion garnered at least five votes. But Justice Kennedy's plurality opinion and Justice Breyer's concurrence both rejected the lower court's holding that a foreign manufacturer can be sued in any state if it \"knows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.\"\n   <em>\n    Nicastro v.

But Morgan does not support that allegation. The opposing parties do not point to any provisions in the distribution agreement that require Blue Endo to market or sell in Wisconsin or that even\n   <em>\n    mention\n   </em>\n   Wisconsin (or any other state or region within the United States). Rather, the agreement states that Blue Endo is \"an independent contractor\" that \"retain[s] exclusive control over its employees, agents, contractors and business practices.\" Dkt. 9-2, \u00a7 2.1 Blue Endo is permitted to sell \"to any person or entity\" and can use \"sub-distributors or sub-contractors in its sole discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450504,5930194\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/873/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 3.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The opposing parties cite two other provisions in the agreement as evidence of Trokamed's control.

Both provisions are directed at increasing sales in the territory as a whole, but neither provision directs Blue Endo to market or sell products in Wisconsin or otherwise purports to control\n   <em>\n    where\n   </em>\n   Blue Endo will sell the product within the United States, Canada, or Mexico.

Both the plurality and the concurrence relied on the small number of New Jersey sales to support the conclusion that the foreign manufacturer did not have sufficient contacts with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In this case, Morgan has identified only two sales of Trokamed's morcellators in Wisconsin, including the one at issue in this case. Dkt. 21, at 12. That is no different from the one to four sales at issue in\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Morgan resists this conclusion on the ground that the morcellators include disposable components such as blades and valves. Morgan alleges (without citing evidence) that Blue Endo \"regularly\" sent\n   those components into Wisconsin. Dkt. 1, \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   There are several problems with Morgan's reliance on the possibility that Blue Endo regularly shipped disposable components to Wisconsin. First, Blue Endo itself did not make this claim in its opposition brief. Because Blue Endo would be in the best position to know what products it shipped to Wisconsin, its silence on this issue undermines the plausibility of Morgan's allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, even if the court accepts the allegation as true, Morgan does not say where Blue Endo obtained disposable parts, so it is not clear whether the parts came from Trokamed. Again, Blue Endo is silent on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Third, Trokamed denies that it knew that it had customers in Wisconsin at the relevant time and Morgan does not contradict that view.

Similarly, Justice Breyer stated in his\n   <em>\n    J.

The opposing parties cite \"Instructions for Use,\" or IFUs, that accompanied each of Trokamed's morcellators sold in the United States. The IFUs included the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Scope of guarantee\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The manufacturer guarantees that the product is shipped in perfect order with regard to function, safety, and reliability.

According to Trokamed, it did not provide a warranty to its American customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, Trokamed says that any guarantee provided in the IFUs was made by Blue Endo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Trokamed ignores the fact that the guarantee refers to the \"manufacturer,\" not the distributor. Trokamed also fails to address the testimony of its president that \"the guarantee is from the producer of the product, and it doesn't stop if you sell it through a dealer, it always goes with the product.\" Dkt. 21-4 (Trondle Dep. 143:4-7). But even if the court assumes that the guarantee came from Trokamed, the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Asahi\n   </em>\n   on which the opposing parties rely relates not to \"guarantees\" but to established channels of communication between the manufacturer and the customer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This is where the opposing parties' argument fails: the opposing parties have not a made a prima facie showing that Trokamed\n   established a channel of communication with any Wisconsin customer. The language cited by the opposing parties is part of a section in the IFUs called \"Guarantee Repair.\" Dkt. 10-1, at 47. In that section, the IFUs direct the customer to send the device to\n   <em>\n    Blue Endo\n   </em>\n   for repairs and they provide Blue Endo's address, telephone number, and email address.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450504,5930194\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/873/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Every page of the IFUs include Blue Endo's logo. The beginning of the IFUs state that the morcellator is \"a product from BLUE ENDO\" and that the IFUs \"are the intellectual property of BLUE ENDO.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (emphasis in original). Neither the \"Guarantee Repair\" section nor any other part of the IFUs provides any contact information for Trokamed, identifies Trokamed as the manufacturer, or even mentions Trokamed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   No one reading the IFUs would know that he or she should contact Trokamed for any reason. And the opposing parties do not allege that either of the two customers in Wisconsin ever had any communication with Trokamed. Under these circumstances, the court concludes that the opposing parties have not made a prima facie showing that Trokamed established channels of communication with Wisconsin customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    F. FDA documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The opposing parties rely on two sets of documents related to the FDA: (1) Trokamed's application and the FDA's approval of Trokamed's request to sell its morcellator in the United States; and (2) documents related to the FDA's November 2014 request to Trokamed to update its IFUs. The first set of documents is not helpful because, like the distribution agreement, it relates to Trokamed's contacts with the United States generally rather than Wisconsin specifically.\n   <em>\n    J.

But the court will accept as true the opposing parties' version of events: (1) after receiving the request from the FDA, Trokamed directed Blue Endo to update the IFUs and deliver them to all customers, which Blue Endo did; (2) Trokamed directed Blue Endo to prepare a spreadsheet that contained the contact information of its American customers; and (3) Trokamed used the spreadsheet in communications with the FDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Even if true, these allegations do little to support the opposing parties' position. The allegations again relate to Trokamed's contacts with the United States generally rather than Wisconsin specifically and they arise out of conduct that occurred after Morgan was injured. Morgan does not contend that her claims arose out of the updated IFUs.\n   <em>\n    Felland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890214\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/665/#p673\">\n    682 F.3d at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (to support an exercise of specific jurisdiction, \"the alleged injury must have arisen from the defendant's forum-related activities\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Blue Endo suggests that Trokamed established a channel of communication by updating the IFUs, but it fails to explain how. The opposing parties do not allege that Trokamed had any direct communication with any Wisconsin customer during the updating process or that Trokamed invited communication from customers. And neither Morgan nor Blue Endo cites any authority in which a court found that similar conduct was sufficient to justify an exercise of personal jurisdiction. For these reasons, the court concludes that Trokamed's contacts with the FDA do not provide a basis for exercising jurisdiction over Trokamed in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

Because this meeting occurred in Florida and the opposing parties do not allege that the meeting had anything to do with Wisconsin in particular, it does not provide a basis for exercising personal jurisdiction over Trokamed in this case.\n   <em>\n    J.

Other cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the sake of completeness, the court will briefly address four cases that the parties rely on, three of which also involved a products liability claim against Trokamed related to its morcellators. Of the three cases filed against Trokamed, two were dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction and one was allowed to proceed. But two of the cases provide little guidance to other courts. In\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v. Trokamed\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-1-2347 (Haw. Cir. Ct. Jan. 12, 2018), the court concluded that it could not exercise jurisdiction over Trokamed, and in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Market-Tiers Inc.,\n   </em>\n   No. 15C2984 (Tenn. Cir. Ct. Feb. 28, 2018), the court concluded that the plaintiff had made a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over Trokamed. But\n   <em>\n    Schmidt\n   </em>\n   was a one-page order that did not provide reasoning for the court's decision. Dkt. 10-3. The court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   concluded that Trokamed \"controlled\" the distribution of its morcellators in the United States by imposing quotas, but the court did not explain how the quotas were relevant to the jurisdictional analysis. Dkt. 21-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The third case is consistent with this court's analysis. In\n   <em>\n    Trokamed GmbH v.
