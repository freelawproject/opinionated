Following a trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Mr. Robinson, awarding him $750 in compensatory damages. Having received a favorable jury verdict, Mr. Robinson seeks from the Court injunctive relief, an award of back pay, and attorneys' fees. Upon consideration of the parties' filings, the Court concludes that Mr. Robinson is entitled to all three forms of relief, though not to the extent he requests. Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Mr. Robinson's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Robinson (\"Robinson Affidavit I\"), ECF No. 24-1. Mr. Robinson began working full time in the ATEU in 2008, and he became sufficiently proficient in the unit's functions that he was tasked with training and certifying MPD officers to work in the ATEU Overtime Program, which allowed those officers to supplement their normal workload with ATEU overtime work.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.01\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.01\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 11-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In late-2011, Mr. Robinson was transferred from the ATEU to MPD's Special Events Branch (\"SEB\"), ostensibly because MPD was \"civilianizing\" the ATEU.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.01\">\n    \u00b6 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court dismissed Mr. Robinson's retaliation claim at the end of his case, leaving only Mr. Robinson's discrimination claim for the jury's deliberation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(2) ; Minute Order, Mar. 13, 2018. On this claim, the jury found that Mr. Robinson's SEB supervisor in 2014 and 2015, Ms. Sutter, discriminated against him by denying him ATEU overtime opportunities, and the jury accordingly awarded Mr. Robinson $750 in damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict Form, ECF No. 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly after the trial, Mr. Robinson filed a motion asking the Court to (1) enjoin the District from excluding Mr. Robinson from ATEU overtime opportunities which are not filled by officers actively working within the ATEU; (2) enjoin the District from retaliating against Mr. Robinson; and (3) enjoin the District from discriminating against Mr. Robinson on the basis of his race or color.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As described above, the jury concluded that Mr. Robinson's supervisor, Ms. Sutter, withheld ATEU Overtime opportunities from Mr. Robinson because of his race. Mr. Robinson's rights having been vindicated at trial, he now seeks injunctive relief, back pay, and attorneys' fees. The\n   Court will address each form of relief in turn, concluding that Mr. Robinson is entitled to a portion of the injunctive relief sought, a portion of the back pay sought, and a portion of the attorneys' fees sought. Accordingly, it grants each of Mr. Robinson's motions in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the Court addresses Mr. Robinson's motion for injunctive relief. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(1), the Court may grant \"equitable relief\" that \"the court deems appropriate\" to restore Mr. Robinson, as nearly as possible, to the circumstances he \"would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Lander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527257,3475204\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/888/153/\">\n    888 F.2d at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted, Mr. Robinson asks the Court to (1) enjoin the District from excluding Mr. Robinson from ATEU overtime opportunities which are not filled by officers actively working within the ATEU; (2) enjoin the District from retaliating against Mr. Robinson; and (3) enjoin the District from discriminating against Mr. Robinson because of his race. Inj. Mot. at 3. As explained below, the Court will enjoin the District from excluding Mr. Robinson from the ATEU Overtime Program because of his race, but it will not enjoin the District from discriminating or retaliating against Mr. Robinson going forward, because Mr. Robinson has not demonstrated that such relief is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Access to Overtime Opportunities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In response to the jury's finding that he was deprived of ATEU overtime opportunities because of his race, Mr. Robinson argues that the District should be enjoined from excluding him \"from consideration from overtime opportunities offered in\" the ATEU going forward. Inj. Mot. at 3. The District, on the other hand, argues that this relief would be overbroad because it \"contemplates generic overtime opportunities offered in the ATEU,\" while the jury found that Mr. Robinson was discriminated against with respect to only a subset of those opportunities; those offered in the ATEU Overtime Program. Def.'s Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Injunctive Relief (\"Inj. Opp'n\") at 2, ECF No. 66. The District argues that this program was discontinued \"in or about May 2015,\" Mr. Robinson's assertions to the contrary notwithstanding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The District also notes that Mr. Robinson's motion \"makes no mention of racial discrimination,\" which suggests that Mr. Robinson's requested relief would prevent the District from excluding Mr. Robinson from consideration for ATEU overtime opportunities even for non-discriminatory reasons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court declines to determine whether the ATEU Overtime Program is still in operation, and it instead grants Mr. Robinson's requested relief more narrowly than it is framed in his motion. \"When fashioning remedies under Title VII, courts attempt not to 'interfere with the policymaking and personnel decisions that rightly belong to public servants.' \"\n   <em>\n    Caudle v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3970022\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/73/#p80\">\n    825 F.Supp.2d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 80 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Although that goal is ultimately secondary to Title VII's core purpose of making a plaintiff whole,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lander,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527257,3475204\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/888/153/\">\n    888 F.2d at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it is nevertheless a factor to be considered. Accordingly, the Court will not require the District to consider Mr. Robinson for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   overtime opportunities offered in the ATEU. Rather, it enjoins the District from excluding Mr. Robinson, because of his race, from overtime opportunities in the ATEU Overtime Program, to the extent the Program is still operational and such opportunities are available to officers outside the ATEU unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Robinson also argues that the District should be enjoined from retaliating\n   against him because of his successful lawsuit. Inj. Mot. at 3. He claims that he is particularly \"vulnerable\" to retaliation because one of his current supervisors, Captain Robert Glover, testified for the District during the trial about SEB overtime opportunities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Mr. Robinson asserts that Captain \"Glover and the [MPD] command staff must be embarrassed and greatly displeased with a verdict that impliedly finds them derelict in their duties,\" and are likely to seek retribution. Pl.'s Reply Inj. Opp'n at 2, ECF No. 71. The District first counters that this relief \"would be entirely disconnected from the [jury's] verdict,\" which contemplated discrimination but not retaliation. Inj. Opp'n at 3. The District next counters that \"Plaintiff has offered no evidence suggesting that he is at risk of retaliation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On this point, the District has the stronger argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Absent more specific evidence that Mr. Robinson is likely to face retaliation, forbidding retaliation-which is already forbidden by Title VII-is not necessary for the Court to address Mr. Robinson's harm. Ms. Sutter, the individual who discriminated against Mr. Robinson, no longer works for the District. Mr. Robinson's conclusory assertion that \"Ms. Sutter may now or in the future be employed by [the District]\" does not convince the Court that Ms. Sutter is reasonably likely to ever be in a position to retaliate against Mr. Robinson. Inj. Mot. at 2. Moreover, without additional evidence, the mere fact that Mr. Robinson's current supervisor testified for the District is not enough to show that the supervisor is likely to retaliate against Mr. Robinson. Because the Court cannot conclude that there is a \"reasonable expectation\" that retaliation will occur, the Court declines to impose injunctive relief addressing retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Bundy v.

Discrimination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, Mr. Robinson argues that the District should be enjoined from further discriminating against him because of his race. Inj. Mot. at 3. Title VII expressly provides that, after a finding of liability, \"the court may enjoin the [defendant] from engaging in [the] unlawful employment practice [in question].\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(1). That said, \"[a]lthough enjoining a defendant from further acts of discrimination is a typical remedy in Title VII cases, [the D.C. Circuit] has never held that it is a mandatory remedy ....\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Brock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1635493,4329806\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/810/219/\">\n    810 F.2d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 225 (D.C. Cir. 1987). And the Seventh Circuit has reasoned that where \"the proscribed discriminatory practice has been terminated and there is little likelihood of recurrence,\" a court need not enjoin the defendant from further acts of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Mr. Robinson argues that \"a need persists to protect [him] from further discrimination based on his race or color,\" and he again supports this argument with the conclusory assertion that \"Ms. Sutter may now or in the future be employed by the Defendant\n   or she may become a contractor of the [District], or she may currently be or become an employee of a contractor of the [District],\" and in one of those roles have the opportunity to discriminate against Mr. Robinson. Inj. Mot. at 2. The District rightly notes that this assertion is wholly unsupported by the record, and it argues again that a permanent injunction is unnecessary because Mr. Robinson \"has offered no evidence suggesting that he is at risk of racial discrimination in the future,\" given that Ms. Sutter-who was responsible for the discrimination here-is no longer employed by the District. Inj. Opp'n at 4. The District again has the stronger argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As noted above, Mr. Robinson has failed to demonstrate that Ms. Sutter is reasonably likely to ever again discriminate against Mr. Robinson or be placed in a position to do so. Because Ms. Sutter is no longer employed by the District, Mr. Robinson can only speculate that she may at some point become a contractor or employee of the District, and that this hypothetical position would involve oversight of Mr. Robinson. Inj. Mot. at 2. Mr. Robinson's speculation, absent any record evidence, does not give the Court \"significant concerns that the District could once again fail to respond to harassment of or discrimination against\" Mr. Robinson; the degree of concern that typically warrants enjoining future discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Jean-Baptiste v.

Transcript of Trial at 16:8-15 (Mar. 14, 2018), Pay Opp'n Ex. 3, ECF No. 75-3. However, the District has not provided record evidence in support of that claim, and the SEB overtime opportunities raised by Captain Glover during the trial appeared to be primarily daytime opportunities, such as sports events, parades, protests, and official government detail assignments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Trial at 11:8-16; 14:2-15:10 (Mar. 14, 2018).

Mr. Robinson notes that MPD officers with at least 1,000 hours of ATEU overtime during the discrimination period worked an average of approximately 1,354 overtime hours. Pay Mot. at 8. He claims \"in good faith that he would have worked no less than 1,354 hours of ATEU overtime during the [discrimination period] in addition to the [526] hours of overtime he worked in the SEB.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9; Robinson Affidavit II \u00b6 10. In other words, Mr. Robinson claims that he would have worked approximately 1,880 overtime hours over the sixteen-month discrimination period. The Court finds this number to be overly speculative for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, Mr. Robinson has not supplied sufficient data for the Court to conduct a direct comparison of his overtime hours to the overtime hours of similarly situated individuals. He provides the number of ATEU overtime hours worked by those similarly situated individuals, but he does not provide those individuals'\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   overtime hours. It may be true that, as Mr. Robinson asserts, those individuals accrued their ATEU overtime hours \"in addition to overtime hours they worked in their respective units,\" (emphasis omitted), but Mr. Robinson supplies no evidence to support that statement. Pay Mot. at 6. Accordingly, the Court is left with no choice but to assume that the individuals similarly situated to Mr. Robinson during the discrimination period worked an average of 1,354\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   overtime hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, Mr. Robinson has not sufficiently demonstrated that he could reasonably have accumulated 1,880 overtime hours. He claims that, if given the opportunity, he would work two back-to-back ATEU overtime shifts on his days off from the SEB, Pay Mot. at 5, but the District presents evidence indicating that Mr. Robinson worked back-to-back shifts on a day off very infrequently between 2010 and 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pay Opp'n at 7; Pay Mot. Ex. 2. Mr. Robinson also identifies six officers \"working in a branch of the Special Operations Division\"-the division in which the SEB is housed-who accumulated more than 1,000 ATEU overtime hours, including four who accumulated more than 1,500 hours, but he has not demonstrated that those officers worked similar shifts in their respective divisions to his shifts in the SEB, which would suggest that he could have taken advantage of the same ATEU overtime opportunities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pay Mot. at 7;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5. Accordingly, Mr. Robinson has failed to show that it was feasible for him to work the same amount of overtime as those officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Robinson claims that he would work nearly\n   <em>\n    eleven extra work days per month\n   </em>\n   over sixteen months, but he has not provided the evidence necessary to justify that ambitious claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In summary, the Court concludes that in the absence of discrimination Mr.\n   Robinson would have worked additional ATEU overtime hours, but not as many as he claims. Accordingly, the Court must determine a sufficient back pay award to \"recreate the conditions ... that would have been [for Mr. Robinson], had there been no unlawful discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Berger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11590728,3669106\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/1111/\">\n    170 F.3d at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted, the Court credits Mr. Robinson's assertion that he was similarly situated to individuals who worked at least 1,000 ATEU overtime hours in 2014. Because the record evidence indicates that these individuals worked an average of 1,354 overtime hours, Pay Mot. at 8; Pay Mot. Ex. 1 \u00b6 10; Pay Mot. Ex. 5, the Court will assume that Mr. Robinson would have worked 1,354 overtime hours during the period at issue, in the absence of discrimination.
