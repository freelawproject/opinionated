(ECF No. 3.) Both initiatives proposed ordinances with identical language that essentially decriminalized marijuana possession. The initiative reduced criminal fines to $0, removed any consequences related to licenses, and reduced court costs to $0. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After acquiring the necessary signatures, Schmitt and Thompson submitted the proposed ordinances to the Portage County Board of Elections, one of the defendants in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Portage County Board of Elections rejected the proposed initiative for two reasons. First, the Board determined that \"the $0 fine and no license consequences are administrative in nature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, the Board found that \"[t]he $0 court costs is administrative in nature and is an impingement on the judicial function by a legislature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On August 21, 2018, the Portage County Board of Elections notified Schmitt and Thompson that it would not certify the proposed initiatives for the ballot.

Ohio's Ballot Initiative Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ohio has created an initiative process for its citizens. Ohio Const. Art. II, Sec. 1. Relevant to this case, Ohio law requires petitioners for the initiation of legislation in a municipality to submit an initiative petition to a board of elections. O.R.C. \u00a7 3501.11(K)(1). The board of elections then reviews, examines, and certifies the sufficiency and validity of the petition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186349\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/390/#p395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The boards of elections are also required to \"determine whether the petition falls within the scope of authority to enact via initiative and whether the petition satisfies the statutory prerequisites to place the issue on the ballot.\" O.R.C. \u00a7 3501.11(K)(2). This is known as the \"gatekeeper mechanism.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Walker v.

The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that boards of elections have discretion when determining \"which actions are administrative and which are legal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20N.E.3d%20419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Administrative actions are not appropriate for the initiative process; legislative actions are.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3501.38(M)(1) and 3501.39(A)(3). While recognizing that this Court is without jurisdiction to decide whether the initiative petition contains legislative or administrative action, the parties dispute this issue, which would otherwise determine whether the matter should be placed on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When a local elections board determines that an action is administrative (and therefore improper) or legislative (and therefore proper), Ohio law creates a\n   fork in its procedural road. If the initiative petition is deemed valid, then citizens opposing the petition's validity-and in a practical sense, the board's decision-have an original cause of action for review of the board's decision in the Supreme Court of Ohio. Ohio Const. Art. II, Sec. 1g. On the other hand, if the board or secretary rejects a petitioner's submission for a substantive reason, as in the administrative versus legislative divide,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   neither the Ohio Constitution nor state laws provide a remedy. As a result, a party aggrieved by the rejection of an initiative petition has no right, by statute or otherwise, to review of an executive board's legal conclusion. An aggrieved petitioner may seek a writ of mandamus, which is wholly separate from an appeal of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under Ohio law, to be entitled to a writ of mandamus, a petitioner must prove, by clear and convincing evidence: (1) a clear legal right to the requested relief, (2) a clear legal duty on the part of the board to provide it, and (3) the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Instead, the only recourse available is a petition for a writ of mandamus. A writ is an extraordinary remedy that is discretionary and \"will not issue to prevent an erroneous judgment, or to serve the purpose of appeal, or to correct mistakes of the lower court in deciding questions within its jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

In other words, rejected petitioners are stuck between a rock and a hard place. But is there any constitutional violation?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On that question, the parties disagree. Plaintiffs allege that by following Ohio law, Defendants violated their rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Defendants argue that the gatekeeper mechanism and the possibility of a writ of mandamus are constitutionally sound. To remedy their alleged violations, Plaintiffs move this Court to order injunctive relief, pursuant to Federal Rule 65 of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Federal Rule 65 of Civil Procedure allows a party to seek injunctive relief if\n   the party believes that it will suffer irreparable harm or injury. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65. To determine whether injunctive relief should be issued, the Court considers these four factors: (1) whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant would otherwise suffer irreparable injury; (3) whether granting the injunction would cause substantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuing the injunction.\n   <em>\n    McPherson v.

Likelihood of Success\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Ohio's ballot initiative procedure violates their rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.

What Plaintiffs challenge is how Ohio has chosen to implement this otherwise lawful task.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At oral argument, however, Plaintiffs argued that the Ohio procedure for proposing initiatives violates constitutional due process protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the same oral argument, Defendants responded that the mandamus relief is constitutionally sufficient. Defendants conceded that mandamus relief is only appropriate when there is no adequate remedy at law, and that the Supreme Court or courts of appeals must review local board of election's decision by a \"clear disregard of law\" standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The right to initiate legislation through the initiative process is not a federal constitutional right.\n   <em>\n    Taxpayers United for Assessment Cuts v.
