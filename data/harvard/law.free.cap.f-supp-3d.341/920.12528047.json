(\"Plan Pros\"), and Prime Designs Inc. (\"Prime Designs\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed this copyright infringement action alleging that Defendants have violated and continue to violate Plaintiffs' exclusive rights in certain architectural works and technical drawings depicting architectural works. The Management Defendants contend that they are entitled to summary judgment\n   because Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate how they infringed upon Plaintiffs' copyrights in certain architectural works, and they are not even in the business of creating house plans or building houses. The Home Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiffs cannot show that they had access to Plaintiffs' copyrighted works or that the Home Defendants' architectural plans are substantially similar to Plaintiffs' copyrighted materials, their architectural plans were independently created, and Plaintiffs have failed to establish that they own the registrations in the copyrighted works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Also pending are several other motions: Motion for Oral Argument on Kerstiens' Motion for Summary Judgment (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 149\n   </em>\n   ), Renewed Motion to Require Plaintiffs to Post Bond for Costs and Expenses (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 159\n   </em>\n   ), Defendants' Objections to Expert Testimony That May Be Proffered by Plaintiffs (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 176\n   </em>\n   ), Plaintiffs' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony and Request for Daubert Hearing (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 196\n   </em>\n   ), Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine Regarding Evidence not Provided By Defendants in Discovery (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 197\n   </em>\n   ), and Plaintiffs' General Motion in (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 199\n   </em>\n   ).

It has designed five new home plans since 2016 (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-1 at 2\n   </em>\n   -3). Similarly, Plaintiff Prime Designs, Inc. designs home plans through a single designer, Marc Behrens (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-7\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 2\n   </em>\n   ). Plan Pros and Prime Designs generate revenue by licensing home designs to builders through Plaintiff Design Basics and other plan brokers (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-1\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 3\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-7 at 2\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-9 at 4\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Design Basics is a residential design firm founded in Omaha, Nebraska, in the 1980s by Dennis Brozak. Design Basics creates custom and ready-made home plans for single and multi-family homes. It markets these home plans through plan catalogs, home building industry publications, brokerage marketing partners, client-specific publications, and the internet (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-9 at 3\n   </em>\n   ). Design Basics has designed thousands of home designs from scratch, including 350 new home plans since 2009. It licenses these home plans as complete sets of construction drawings that can be modified to meet the customer's design needs. Design Basics registers its designs with the United States Copyright Office before or near the time of publishing and marketing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Since 1990, Design Basics has published more than 180 home catalogs and other publications containing its home designs and has circulated more than 4.2 million copies of those publications to builders and other consumers across the country. Design Basics rented targeted lists from the National Association of Home Builders, which included the contact information of builder members of local home builders associations. Design Basics used these lists and other lists to compile mailing lists and then send its publications to potential customers\n   across the country (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-20 at 3\n   </em>\n   -4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since the early 2000s, Design Basics' home plans, plan catalogs, and other publications have been displayed at Carter Lumber and Menards locations across the country, which total 446 stores, including 28 stores in Indiana. Design Basics also has distributed its home plan publications as handouts at numerous home shows, conventions, and trade shows.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. It has widely disseminated its house plans on the internet on its own website as well as on the websites of leading plan broker companies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Design Basics has had success marketing and licensing its home designs to builders. It has more than 164,000 customers across the country who have purchased more than 135,000 licenses to build homes from plans marketed or designed by Design Basics. At its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Design Basics was earning more than $4 million annually from licensing revenues (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-9 at 3\n   </em>\n   , 4, 9). Design Basics currently offers single-build licenses for any home design in its inventory of more than 2,800 plans for fees ranging from $700.00 to $6,000.00. Since 2009, it has issued 8,272 licenses for its home plans for a total of more than $6,000,000.00 in licensing revenue. More than 2,500 licenses have been sold in the last three years. Concerning the seven home designs at issue in this lawsuit, Design Basics has earned $25,000.00 in licensing revenue from selling 116 licenses since 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After Design Basics made its house plans readily available on the internet, it noticed a precipitous decline in house plan licensing revenue. At its peak, Design Basics' licensing revenue was above $4 million annually, but that dropped to less than $1 million annually after making its house plans widely available on the internet. Corresponding with the decline in licensing revenue was a precipitous decline in the number of licenses that builders and other customers purchased from Design Basics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Among the thousands of house plans that Design Basics licenses to builders and other customers are seven house plans that are at issue in this copyright infringement case. The seven house plans at issue are the 3098 Duncan, 3385 Brittany, 8096 Pine Ridge, 8026 Sun Ridge, Kirsten, Bloom, and Cartwright (collectively, \"Copyrighted Works\"). Design Basics created and owns the 3098 Duncan, 3385 Brittany, 8096 Pine Ridge, and 8026 Sun Ridge designs. Plaintiff Plan Pros created and owns the Kirsten and Bloom designs. Plaintiff Prime Designs created and owns the Cartwright design. All of the house plans at issue in this case were created from scratch with the exception of the Kirsten plan, which was a derivative of Plan Pros' Leftwich design, and the Cartwright plan, which was a derivative of Prime Designs' Dekyan plan. The Leftwich and Dekyan plans were created from scratch (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-1\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 4\n   </em>\n   -5;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-7 at 3\n   </em>\n   -4;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-9 at 8\n   </em>\n   -9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant Kerstiens Homes &amp; Designs, Inc. is a construction company that has specialized in residential construction for nearly fifty years. It is based out of Jasper, Indiana (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-36\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 2\n   </em>\n   -3). Defendant T-Kerstiens Homes Corp. was started around 1995 to do work in residential construction. It sometimes did business as Kerstiens Homes &amp; Designs (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-32\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 9\n   </em>\n   , 11, 12, 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant Kerstiens Holding Corp. does not engage in any business; rather, it is a holding company that owns stock of other companies. Defendant Kerstiens Management Corp. is in the business of renting properties that it owns. It has never built any houses or created any house plans. Defendant Kerstiens Leasing Corp. is in\n   the business of leasing vehicles and equipment. Like Kerstiens Management, Kerstiens Leasing has never built any houses or created any house plans. Defendant Kerstiens Development, Inc. is in the business of purchasing land, subdividing the land into lots, and selling the lots. It also has never built any houses or created any house plans (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 89-1 at 2\n   </em>\n   ). The Kerstiens entities are owned and controlled by a combination of the same four individuals: Jerome and Doris Kerstiens and their two sons, Todd and Bart (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-32\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 118\n   </em>\n   -19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In June 2013, Design Basics' director of business development conducted market research in Indiana in an effort to develop more business. He researched the websites of home builders throughout Indiana, which had previously been one of Design Basics' best-selling states. When he went to the website of Kerstiens Homes &amp; Designs, he discovered what he believed to be infringing copies of the Copyrighted Works. He returned to the website again in July 2014 and found the same house plans that he believed infringed the Copyrighted Works (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-26\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 3\n   </em>\n   -4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint was filed on August 30, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 38\n   </em>\n   ), which asserts claims of copyright infringement against the Management Defendants and the Home Defendants. Thereafter, the Management Defendants filed a summary judgment motion, asserting they are not in the business of creating house plans or building houses and did not infringe the Copyrighted Works (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 88\n   </em>\n   ). The Home Defendants also filed a summary judgment motion, asserting that Plaintiffs' evidence cannot support the elements of a copyright claim. They also assert that their house plans were independently created, and Plaintiffs have not shown they own the registrations in the Copyrighted Works (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 136\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The purpose of summary judgment is to \"pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

Kerstiens' \"617\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The size dimensions of the garage, foyer, breakfast nook, kitchen, living room, and four bedrooms are different between the two floor plans. The Bloom does not have a back patio off the breakfast nook, a bay window in the breakfast nook, a walk-through door into the garage from the outside, a utility closet in the garage, a powder room coming in from the garage, or a linen closet in the second bathroom, but each of these features are in the 617 floor plan. The Bloom has a fireplace in the living room, side windows in all the bedrooms and bathrooms, and a drop zone in the mudroom. None of these features appear in the 617 floor plan. The size, location, and orientation of the laundry rooms are different in each design. The size and location of the master bathroom linen closets are different. The master walk-in closet is in the bedroom in the 617 but in the bathroom in the Bloom. The foyer in the 617 is smaller, but it has a larger coat closet. The Bloom has a den with angled doors and a linen closet in the hall; whereas the 617 has a bedroom without an angled wall. The 617 garage has a side-entry garage door with small windows on the front wall; whereas the Bloom has a front-entry garage door. Additionally, the 617 has a straight hallway leading from the garage to the master bedroom. To get to the master bedroom from the garage in the Bloom, a person would have to go through the mudroom, foyer, living room, and nook (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 147-5 at 11\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In light of the narrow window created by the Seventh Circuit's case law to support an architectural works infringement claim, the Court concludes that the numerous differences among the Copyrighted Works and the Defendants' house designs undermine the substantial similarity element of Plaintiffs' copyright claim. These numerous differences are not subtle or trivial. While some similarities exist among the floor plans,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [the] accused plans resemble Design Basics' plans, but only because both sets resemble common home designs one might observe throughout the suburbs of Milwaukee, Chicago, Indianapolis, or many other communities. There are only so many ways to arrange a few bedrooms, a kitchen, some common areas, and an attached garage, so not every nook and cranny of an architectural floor plan enjoys copyright protection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Lexington Homes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276651\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1093/#p1099\">\n    858 F.3d at 1102-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotation marks omitted). \"While it is possible to design a home that is a one-of-a-kind work of art, the home designs here do not fit that description.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276651\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1093/#p1099\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276651\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1093/#p1099\">\n    at 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Plaintiffs do not have evidence to support the element of substantial similarity under Seventh Circuit case law, the Home Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the copyright infringement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Management Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Management Defendants seek summary judgment asserting that none of the management companies have committed any infringing act, as none are in the business of creating house plans or building houses. They argue that they have been sued only because they have the word \"Kerstiens\" in their legal name. In\n   response, Plaintiffs argue that the Management Defendants also are liable for the copyright infringement actions of the Home Defendants because the Home Defendants and Management Defendants companies are owned by the same four individuals and are so closely interrelated that they should be treated as a single entity. Accepting Plaintiff's theory, that the companies are so closely interrelated and should be treated as a single entity, the summary judgment of the Home Defendants' Motion makes the issues raised in the Management Defendants' Motion moot. Accordingly, the Court need not conduct further analysis on the Management Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Home Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 136\n   </em>\n   ). Because the resolution of the Home Defendants' Motion makes the issues raised in the Management Defendants' Motion moot, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES as moot\n   </strong>\n   the Management Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 88\n   </em>\n   ). The other pending motions have become moot because of the Court's resolution of the summary judgment motion in favor of the Defendants. Therefore, these other motions are also\n   <strong>\n    DENIED as moot\n   </strong>\n   : Motion for Oral Argument (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 149\n   </em>\n   ), Renewed Motion to Require Plaintiffs to Post Bond (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 159\n   </em>\n   ), Defendants' Objections to Expert Testimony That May Be Proffered by Plaintiffs (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 176\n   </em>\n   ), Plaintiffs' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony and Request for Daubert Hearing (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 196\n   </em>\n   ), Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine Regarding Evidence not Provided By Defendants in Discovery (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 197\n   </em>\n   ), and Plaintiffs' General Motion in\n   <em>\n    Limine\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 199\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Final judgment will issue under separate order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The Defendants assert that the seventh defendant, Kerstiens Realty, Inc., is not known to exist and has not appeared, and Plaintiffs do not respond to this assertion or argue otherwise.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
