Chutkan, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") has moved for a preliminary injunction to block a proposed merger between defendants Wilhelmsen Maritime Services AS (\"WMS\"), Wilhelmsen Ship Services (\"WSS\") (collectively \"Wilhelmsen\"), and The Resolute Fund II, L.P., Drew Marine Intermediate II B.V., and Drew Marine Group, Inc. (collectively \"Drew\"), two large providers of marine water treatment chemicals and related services. The FTC objects to the merger on the grounds that Defendants are each other's closest and only realistic competition for supplying these chemicals and services on a global scale, and the merger threatens to reduce or eliminate tangible consumer benefits resulting from market competition. Having considered the evidence presented through live testimony, as well as extensive pleadings, exhibits, and other submissions, the court hereby GRANTS the motion for preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is about the likely impact of a proposed merger in the international maritime industry-an industry on which much of the global economy, including intercontinental trade, large-scale transport of raw materials, and the import/export of foodstuffs and manufactured goods, depends.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX90033 at 001; PX90034 at 001 (noting that \"[i]nternational shipping transports more than 80 percent of global trade\n   to peoples and communities all over the world,\" and that \"[s]hipping is the most efficient and cost-effective method of international transportation for most goods\"). By at least one estimate, the worldwide shipping industry includes 50,000 merchant ships registered in over 150 nations. PX90033 at 001. The following map, originally sourced from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, depicts common global shipping routes and underscores the breadth and density of maritime industry activities:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PX10126 at 023. While international merchant ships includes many types of vessels, all of them-and especially large ones-require regular maintenance to ensure continuous performance at operational levels. Companies like Wilhelmsen and Drew provide an array of products and services designed to ensure the continued operational performance of all types of maritime vessels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX10126 at 008-009 (noting that \"VPP [vessel performance products] applications are necessary to maintain financial and operational efficiency of vessels,\" and that such products \"are required by all commercial shipping vessel classes,\" which include container ships, bulk ships, cruise ships, military ships, tankers, cargo ships, and even offshore oil and gas rigs). Defendants sell maritime customers several categories of products, including cleaning chemicals, fuel treatment chemicals, welding gases, refrigerants, and, critically, water treatment chemicals. Am. Compl. \u00b6 29; Ans. \u00b6 29. The products at issue in this case are consumable water treatment products and related services, a category that includes products and services for the chemical treatment of boiler water, cooling water, water production, waste water, ballast water, and potable water. DX-1161 at 0019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Marine vessels use water resources for a number of applications, including drinking, showering, cleaning, pools, spas, and-critically-for boiler and cooling systems. JX-0149 at 003. Depending on the type of ship, a boiler is necessary either as a constituent part of the main propulsion system or as part of an auxiliary system on which the propulsion system relies. PX90030 at 001. In auxiliary systems, the boiler primarily serves to generate steam to support ship functions in vessels running on marine diesel engines or diesel electric propulsion. PX90030 at 001. Examples include preventing Heavy Fuel Oil (\"HFO\")-a highly viscous substance-from falling below the temperature at which it is useable, heating HFO to ensure fluidity immediately before use in the engine, and for use in purifiers,\n   booster modules, and other applications. PX90030 at 002-005. Cooling water systems reduce excess heat produced by the working machinery of a vessel's engine. PX90032 at 001. Essentially, cooling water systems circulate water through the engine to remove heat and reduce the likelihood of engine failure. Fry Hrg. Tr. at 943: 17-24 (\"If you don't maintain the cooling water side, then you're relying on the oil side of the house to take up and remove that heat from the engine. And what happens is, if you don't cool the cylinders down, the oil starts breaking down. When the oil starts breaking down, then you get metal-to-metal contact inside the piston and the rings, and then you have an engine failure, and usually ... under those circumstances you have a crank case explosion as well.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Marine water treatment chemicals \"are all the chemicals associated with the maritime operation of ships\"-including boiler chemistry, diesel chemistry, central cooling water, and evaporators. Fry Hrg. Tr. at 936: 11-12. After measuring the pH, conductivity, temperature, and oxidation-reduction potential of the water with specialized testing equipment, ship engineers inject these chemicals into the boiler and engine cooling systems through specialized dosing equipment optimized for high-pressure/low-volume or low-pressure/high-volume applications. Fry Hrg. Tr. at 945: 10-12; JX-0135 at 005; PX90014 at 003-004. Once injected, water treatment chemicals ensure the performance and reliability of marine boiler and engine cooling systems by: (1) removing excess oxygen from the systems, (2) allowing fine-tuned control of boiler water, cooling water, and feedwater pH; and (3) preventing the leaching and circulation of harmful metals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fry Hrg. Tr. at 937: 1-21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JX-0135 at 002. In each of these applications, the chemicals operate to reduce or eliminate the incidence of scale, corrosion, and oxygen formation within boiler, feedwater, and engine cooling systems, as well as the risk of engine overheating with respect to cooling systems specifically. Fry Hrg. Tr. at 937: 1-6; JX-0135 at 003; Fry Hrg. Tr. at 943: 12-14 (\"Q. And why do vessels use engine cooling water chemicals? A. To control the amount of corrosion and erosion within the cooling channels of the engine itself.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although marine water treatment chemicals \"only account for a small fraction of the cost of managing a ship,\" PX80014 \u00b6 3, failure to treat the water resources in boiler and engine cooling systems comes with significant consequences, including breakdown or catastrophic failure.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Thompson Hrg. Tr. at 259: 18-24 (\"Q. What happens if a boiler develops corrosion? A. [I]t could potentially damage the boiler. It may require significant servicing or even replacement\"); JX-0135 at 002 (\"Deviating from recommended pH and phosphate control limits can lead to caustic corrosion and result in catastrophic failure of the boiler system.\"); Fry Hrg. Tr. at 942: 24-25-943:4, 17-24 (describing how failure to treat high pressure boiler water could cause a ruptured pipe and boiler explosion, and how failure to treat cooling water could cause engine failure or explosion). System failure requires costly repairs and unscheduled downtime that translates to lost business and profits for shipping companies. JX-0149 at 003 (\"Water treatment is as much about asset protection as it is about maintaining efficiency. The consequences of not using the right treatments can be costly, resulting in unscheduled downtime, or in the worst cases catastrophic, leading to total breakdown of equipment\"); PX90014 at 003; Thompson Hrg. Tr. at 259:21-24 (noting that due to the size of the boilers involved, replacement would likely require cutting a hole in the hull and removing the boiler in\n   pieces). Maritime companies therefore regard a consistent and effective marine water treatment program as critical to maintaining an operational fleet of ships.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX80014 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5, 7 (describing the importance of water treatment chemicals to ship operations, the need for consistency and dependability in chemical products, and the preference for companies offering total packages of chemical products and related services); Medina Hrg. Tr. at 167: 8-10 (\"[C]onstancy in the chemical makeup of [marine water treatment chemical] products is crucial to the maintenance of our equipment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Consistent with customer demand for reliable water treatment chemical programs, suppliers of water treatment chemicals focus their business strategy on providing more than the chemicals themselves. They supply a \"total solution\"-a program that includes chemical products, test kits, technical expertise and support, and access to a global network with the ability to quickly and reliably provide product on demand, wherever a vessel is located, and whatever its specific needs may be. JX-0231 at 154 (\"Manufacturer/supplier should be able to ... [s]upply a total solution rather than just the product\"); [redacted] uses the phrase 'total solution' here, can you explain what that phrase means. A. It typically means the service that would come with the product, or even identifying what would be the best product for that application. So the total package would be not just a product but the service associated with the use, or identifying the right use of the right product for that application.\"); [redacted] (noting that when Drew enrolls a new customer in its water treatment program it offers recommendations on how to use specific water treatment chemicals, how to test water in boiler and cooling systems, and how to properly dose the chemicals); Medina Hrg. Tr. at 170:7-171:25 (discussing various services provided by marine chemical suppliers);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Thompson Hrg. Tr. at 279:9-281:22 (describing the specific products and services covered under contract with marine chemical supplier). Defendants-whose business is described in more detail below-provide such programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Drew Marine Group, Inc. is a subsidiary of defendant Drew Marine Intermediate II B.V., which is owned by defendant The Resolute Fund II, L.P., a private equity fund managed by The Jordan Company. Am. Compl. \u00b6 24. Drew was originally established in 1928, and has grown over the ensuing years into a company with a global infrastructure. Am. Compl. \u00b6 24; DX-1161 at 0006, 0010. As Drew Marine representatives put it at a management presentation on February 15, 2017, \"Drew Marine's strength is in delivering technical support in specialty chemicals.\" DX-1161 at 0019. Accordingly, roughly [redacted]% of Drew's revenue is traceable to \"Water Treatment Solutions,\" a category that includes an array of products and services related to the chemical treatment of boiler water, cooling water, water production, waste water, ballast water, and potable water.

Wilhelmsen Ship Services (WSS) is a division of WMS that focuses on supplying marine customers with a number of products and services, including water treatment chemicals and associated equipment for boiler water, cooling water, water production,\n   and pool water. PX61000 \u00b6\u00b6 51, 53; PX90046; PX90047; PX90050; PX90063. Wilhelmsen-the parent company-was founded as a shipping business in 1861. PX61000 \u00b6 51. WSS was founded in 1968. Since then, WSS has developed into \"the largest maritime services network in the world,\" capable of delivering \"in 125 countries ...

Am. Compl. \u00b6 25. The FTC then conducted a ten-month investigation, after which it \"found reason to believe that the proposed Acquisition violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the FTC Act.\" Mem. Supp. Prelim. Inj. 12 (\"Mot.\"). The FTC initiated an administrative action alleging a violation of the above statutes, and the merits trial in that action is scheduled to begin on July 24, 2018.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The FTC defines the relevant product market here as \"the supply of marine water treatment (\"MWT\") products and services to Global Fleet customers,\" where MWT products and services include \"[t]he supply of BWT chemicals, CWT chemicals, and associated products and services.\" Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (\"PFF\") \u00b6\u00b6 7, 17, ECF No. 81-2. This definition depends on at least three premises: (1) that there are no functional substitutes for the supply of\n   boiler water treatment (\"BWT\") products and services or cooling water treatment (\"CWT\") products and services, (2) that it is appropriate to cluster BWT products and services and CWT products and services into one antitrust market for analytical convenience (while excluding other water treatment products), and (3) that it is appropriate to define the relevant market around \"Global Fleets\" as a distinct set of targeted customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PFF \u00b6\u00b6 17-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As an initial matter, the court finds that there are no reasonable substitutes for BWT or CWT products and services. These products and services have unique purposes-preserving the functionality of boilers and engines-and no party has pointed to any chemical or group of chemicals, or associated services, that could replace the critical functions that such products perform. In other words, it is possible to regard BWT products and services and CWT products and services as two\n   <em>\n    separate\n   </em>\n   product markets (e.g., the market for BWT and the market for CWT), insofar as none of the products grouped in either category have any reasonable substitutes that can perform the same functions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the disputed threshold issues are (1) whether the markets for BWT and CWT can be clustered together in the manner proposed by the FTC, and (2) whether that cluster market can be further defined around the FTC's preferred set of targeted customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    i. BWT and CWT as a Cluster Market\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants, supported by their expert, Dr. Mark A. Israel, advance two primary arguments against the FTC's proposed cluster market: that the market is overinclusive and underinclusive. Mem. Supp. Opp'n to Mot. at 23, ECF No. 50-2. They argue that the market is overinclusive insofar as it combines two categories of product-BWT and CWT-that are not reasonably interchangeable, meaning that combining them does not accurately reflect commercial realities and conflicts with the notion that product market definition depends on substitutability. ECF No. 50-2 at 24; DX-0060 \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. Defendants also argue that the proposed market is underinclusive because it is inappropriate for the FTC to consider BWT and CWT in the same market without also including the other water treatment and marine products typically sold alongside BWT and CWT, frequently in the same contract. ECF No. 50-2 at 25; DX-0060 \u00b6\u00b6 68-70. While Defendants acknowledge that these other products are not reasonable substitutes for BWT or CWT, they assert that neither are BWT and CWT reasonable substitutes for one another, such that with respect to products typically sold together, the FTC cannot include one product category that is not a reasonable substitute and then exclude others on that same ground. In other words, \"the FTC cannot both lump BWTC and CWTC because they are part of the same sales and purchase process, but then also exclude all other products that are also part of that process.\" ECF No. 50-2 at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The FTC responds first that Defendants' argument regarding overinclusiveness-based on the absence of interchangeability between BWT and CWT-fundamentally misapprehends the nature of a cluster market. According to the FTC, a cluster market does not aim to group\n   together substitutable products, but rather groups non-substitutable products that face similar competitive conditions. Reply to Opp'n. to Mot. 5, ECF No. 56-2. The FTC argues that since both BWT and CWT products function to maintain operational equipment on marine vessels, both involve the same customers with the same need for global consistency, and both are distinguishable from products like cleaning chemicals, which do not require the same level of consistency. ECF No. 56-2 at 5-6. Moreover, the FTC argues that Defendants face the same set of competitors for both products, and therefore BWT and CWT face similar competitive conditions and can be appropriately clustered. ECF No. 56-2 at 5-6. As for Defendants' underinclusiveness argument, the FTC notes that clustering BWT and CWT with other marine products is inappropriate because those products do not share similar competitive conditions, despite the fact that customers negotiate for them at the same time as they negotiate for BWT and CWT. ECF No. 56-2 at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The court concludes that the FTC's use of the cluster market approach is appropriate in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although BWT and CWT products are distinct products intended for distinct uses, they are also indisputably similar. Both are specially blended chemicals that are injected into water systems using special equipment, in order to prevent corrosion and erosion in critical systems. Thompson Hrg. Tr. at 259:18-24; Fry Hrg. Tr. at 943:13-14. While both products make up a \"small fraction of the cost of managing a ship,\" PX80014 \u00b6 3, the cost of system failure in the absence of these products is high. JX-0135 at 002. The fact that these products are low cost, highly critical, and heavily dependent on precise chemistry means that maritime companies strongly prefer consistency in their use, so as to avoid the risk of adverse chemical reaction and the resulting temporary or catastrophic system failure. Moreover, BWT and CWT products are frequently sold together as part of an overall management program that includes a number of additional product-related services. Deckman Hrg. Tr. at 475: 4-14. These similar characteristics matter because they factor into customers' decisions regarding the quantity of products they purchase, the timing of those purchases, as well as where they make their purchases. In other words, similar product characteristics-including function and risk-produce similar needs and constraints for shipping companies, which in turn affects supplier strategies and, accordingly, promotes similar competitive conditions across these product categories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It follows from this point that products that do not share key characteristics do not produce similar needs or constraints for shipping companies, meaning that they give rise to different competitive conditions. The court finds that the FTC has carried its burden to demonstrate those differences. While BWT and CWT chemicals are both \"water treatment chemicals\"-a category that includes \"chemicals for the treatment of evaporator water, ballast water, potable water, and pool/spa water or their related equipment,\" DFF \u00b6 85-the evidence is clear that (1) sales of BWT and CWT are the driving force behind sales in the \"water treatment chemicals\" category,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) other chemicals in that category, such as pool and spa chemicals, are easier to obtain from multiple suppliers. PX80006 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 27; Thompson Hrg. Tr. at 326:24-327:10. They also do not pose the same risks to a ship's critical systems, because they have no function related to those systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The same is true for the larger grouping of marine products. While Defendants correctly note that agreements for the sale of marine products to global fleets often include products in addition to BWT and CWT-such as tank cleaning chemicals, gases, or refrigerants,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sarro Hrg. Tr. at 113 (noting that Teekay purchase agreements often include many different marine products, and that Teekay also purchases many products from WSS in addition to BWT and CWT); DX-1297 at 0013-0015 (listing products covered by purchase agreement)-the differences between these products and BWT/CWT are material. For example, tank cleaning products are less technically complex, do not pose the same operational risks, and are ordered on a short term, cleaning-by-cleaning basis, which makes it easier for shippers to switch suppliers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franzo Hrg. Tr. at 348:22-350:1-22 (describing the differences between tank cleaning and water treatment business and the difference in competitive conditions based on the characteristics of each product); JX-0254 \u00b6 7 (\"Different categories of chemicals require different levels of sophistication in chemistry. Water treatment chemicals are generally more sophisticated and harder to develop than other categories of marine chemicals.\"). Accordingly, tank cleaning presents a more lucrative business opportunity for smaller suppliers than does water\n   treatment, where ships \"really [do not] want to upset the apple cart by changing their products.\" Franzo Hrg. Tr. at 349:7-11; JX-0254 \u00b6 3 (noting that tank cleaning is roughly 60% of [redacted] business, and that water treatment business is small in comparison); PX-80028 at \u00b6 3 (describing water treatment chemicals as [redacted] \"smallest product category\" and tank cleaning chemicals as the largest). In other words, differences in product characteristics between BWT/CWT and other water treatment products lead to differences in maritime companies' sourcing decisions and are therefore connected to differences in competitive conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, while the evidence suggests that companies tend to negotiate prices for multiple products at the same time, it also cuts against the notion that customers engage in one-stop shopping for all their marine products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX00004 at 010, 015 (noting that WSS and Drew customers do not typically \"one-stop shop\" and often \"mix and match across suppliers\"). In other words, framework agreements may set the price for several products from a particular supplier, but such agreements tend to be non-exclusive, leaving the door open to other, specific product purchases at individual ports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX-61002 at 041-042. Thus, an analytical approach that focuses on BWT and CWT to the exclusion of other marine products does not appear to fundamentally conflict with commercial reality, given that customers are empowered to make individualized product choices in different places and at different times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For these reasons, the court concludes that FTC has appropriately clustered BWT and CWT products and services into one antitrust market for analytical convenience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    ii. \"Global Fleets\" as Targeted Customers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As defined by the FTC, \"Global Fleets are fleets of 10 or more globally trading vessels-vessels above 1,000 gross tons in size that have traded at two ports that are at least 2,000 nautical miles apart in the preceding 12 months.\" Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 18, ECF No. 45-3. The FTC argues that it is appropriate to define the relevant product market around this group because \"Global Fleets have distinct characteristics and requirements that limit customer choice, as compared to local or regional fleets,\" thus making them susceptible to price discrimination as a distinct customer group. ECF No. 45-3 at 19. In particular, the FTC points out that Global Fleet customers have \"particular needs as it relates to centralized negotiation of contracts for delivery to geographically dispersed locations, product consistency, and product availability.\" ECF No. 45-3 at 19. The FTC also argues that Defendants have the ability to price discriminate because they \"individually negotiate prices with each customer[,] and customers have a limited ability to arbitrage.\" ECF No. 45-3 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants proffer several reasons why the \"Global Fleets\" distinction is not a meaningful way of segmenting customer groups. First, they contend that the definition of Global Fleets does not accord with commercial reality, given that neither WSS nor Drew use the FTC's definition of that term and less than half of WSS customers meet the Global Fleet criteria. ECF No. 50-2 at 26; DX-0060 \u00b6\u00b6 82, 85, 86. Defendants further argue that the Global Fleets construct is premised on arbitrary thresholds and accordingly produces variable and underinclusive results. Specifically, they allege that: (1) 43% of the vessels that WSS and Drew supply had trading patterns fitting the FTC's criteria in some fiscal quarters, but not in others, indicating\n   that the boundaries of the Global Fleets construct are too permeable to be analytically helpful; and (2) the FTC's numerical cutoff-10 or more globally trading vessels-is arbitrary, and produces the following anomalous mismatches: (a) a quarter of the vessels in 23% of Global Fleets were not globally trading vessels, (b) 31% of the vessels in non-Global Fleets count as globally trading vessels, and (c) 20% of non-Global Fleets are comprised completely of globally trading vessels. ECF No. 50-2 at 27;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DX-0060 \u00b6\u00b6 83-84 &amp; Table 4. Defendants contend that including all vessels weighing 1,000 gross tons or more in the antitrust market would better accord with commercial realities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The \"Global Fleets\" construct is meant to capture key aspects of the economic reality facing fleets with a significant number of globally trading vessels and which need access to the products and services that defendants provide. The construct purports to isolate a relevant subset of the market and measure how the result of a merger would affect customers within that subset. It follows that the construct is a useful way to discuss and predict economic conditions only if its key aspects correspond to elements of the existing marketplace that would make it possible to \"profitably target a subset of customers for price increases\" post-merger.\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FTC, relying on the analysis of its economic expert, Dr. Aviv Nevo, has carried its burden to show that the construct is useful here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Global Fleets Constitute a Distinct Customer Group with Distinct Needs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The FTC has adequately demonstrated that Global Fleets are a distinct group with distinct needs, as compared to the entire group of MWT customers. The distinction matters primarily because vessel trading patterns differ. Some vessels trade more globally than regionally or locally, meaning they travel further, visit more countries and ports in more varied locations, and spend less time in port. PX-61000 \u00b6 103. Within the FTC's definition of Global Fleets as fleets including ten or more globally trading vessels, a vessel trading pattern that includes distances of more than 2,000 nautical miles is global, while regional patterns include distances of 500 and 2,000 nautical miles and local patterns include distances of less than 500 nautical miles. PX-61000 \u00b6 105. The following data, reproduced from PX-61000 \u00b6 110, illustrates the distinct travel patterns of local, regional, and globally trading vessels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Importantly, neither the emphasis on vessels with global trading patterns nor the 2,000 nautical mile cutoff for defining a globally trading vessel are arbitrary parameters. Different trading patterns create different product needs that affect how customers weigh the value of consistent worldwide service potential at high levels of product quality. PX-61000 \u00b6 111 (\"Globally trading vessels tend to be larger, travel much greater distances, and visit more countries and multiple continents during the course of a year. Therefore, it should be expected that their preferences over the importance of high quality water treatment products and services that are consistently available differs from vessels with regional and local trading patterns);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sarro Hrg. Tr. at 77:15-25 (\"Q. When Teekay's vessels are operating on a spot charter, how predictable is where they're traveling to? A.

Tr. at 1236:10-16 (describing the total market in terms of sailing ships above 1,000 gross tons). Thus, combining the court's findings regarding trading pattern and vessel size, it follows that the FTC's definition of a globally trading vessel-vessels larger than 1,000 gross tons that have traveled 2,000 nautical miles between furthest points in the last 12 months-is both non-arbitrary and grounded in the ordinary course of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The evidence also shows that vessels are typically organized into fleets, containing varying numbers of globally trading vessels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX61000 \u00b6 91. In order to measure the effect that a significant number of globally trading vessels would have on the water treatment needs of a fleet as a whole, Dr. Nevo organized the vessel-level raw data into fleets according to affiliation with unique owners or separate technical managers (\"operators\"). PX61000 \u00b6 113. Dr. Nevo grouped vessels with the same operator into the same fleet, producing 9,407 unique \"fleets\" made up of varying numbers of vessels. PX61000 \u00b6\u00b6 113, 114; Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 586:6-20. He then defined \"Global Fleets\" as those having ten or more globally trading vessels, Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 586:21-587:6, and on the basis of that definition, identified 532 Global Fleets and calculated Defendants' market shares within the Global Fleets category. PX61000 \u00b6\u00b6 118, 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As noted above, Defendants objected to Dr. Nevo's definition of \"ten or more globally trading vessels,\" on the grounds that ten vessels is arbitrary and incongruent with commercial reality. While the court agrees that Dr. Nevo's choice of ten globally trading vessels was arbitrary in the sense that the number ten is not compelled by any specific market reality, the court disagrees that Dr. Nevo's construction is therefore meaningless. As the court understands it, Dr. Nevo's choice of ten globally trading vessels was not intended as an exact statement of the threshold number of globally trading vessels a fleet must have in order to manifest distinct product-related\n   needs and preferences. Rather, Dr. Nevo chose ten as a starting point for developing a series of statistical estimates, the non-statistical implications of which support the appropriateness of regarding Global Fleets as a distinct customer group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Dr. Nevo's fleet-level analysis took the following course: first, he inferred-after analyzing data and documentation used or created in the ordinary course of Defendants' business-that fleets with a significant number of globally trading vessels were likely to have distinct preferences that uniquely suit global suppliers. Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 587:7-19. Then, using the fleet data he compiled, Dr. Nevo sought to approximate what share of the fleet-level market would have those preferences. Because he did not know what threshold number of vessels would separate fleets with distinct preferences from those without, Dr. Nevo chose the number ten because of its roundness and simplicity. Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 587:20-22 (\"So then, the question is, where's the cutoff. And I started with ten. Ten is a starting point.... [I]t's a round number. That's literally why we chose [it].\"), 589:3-4 (\"[I]'ll be the first to admit ... there's no hard rule as to why it was ten);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Staples II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122808\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/190/100/#p117\">\n    190 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   118 n.10 (acknowledging and accepting expert's need to establish threshold cutoff for \"practical analytical purposes\"). After obtaining the results of that analysis, he ran trials to test the robustness of the results-that is, to measure how dependent his initial results were on his initial assumption of ten vessels. Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 589:1-590:11. Less dependency-i.e., more stability in the result-indicates the presence of a stable market reality that produces similar results despite variation in threshold numbers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 596:20-597:19. Based on the initial trial, Dr. Nevo found that (1) Global Fleets accounted for most of all globally trading vessels-84% of vessels by tonnage and 71% by vessel count; (2) Global Fleets were mostly made up of globally trading vessels: 81.8% and 92.2% by count and tonnage; and (3) Global Fleets accounted for [redacted] and [redacted] of WSS's and Drew's respective MWT revenue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 595:16-596:13; PX61000 \u00b6\u00b6 118, 161, 123. He also found that similar market share calculations held across four subsequent trials, two substituting five and then fifteen as the threshold numbers, one using ten but omitting any attempt to standardize the names of \"operators\" as they appeared in the raw data, and one only measuring sales to all globally trading vessels, without sorting those vessels into fleets (thus eliminating the need for any threshold number at all). PX61000 \u00b6 123 n.234; Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 589:14-590:11. Notably, the specific percentages differ between each of these trials. PX61000 \u00b6 123 n.234. That is because the point of the trials is not to establish that any particular set of percentages is the most accurate one, but rather to rely on the consistency across the range of percentages to illustrate that (1) there is a significant segment of the market-whatever the exact numbers-that focuses on global trading and therefore has needs and preferences that distinguish it from other customers; and (2) that segment accounts for a majority of Defendants' business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX61000 \u00b6\u00b6 119-21. In other words, the qualitative implications of the percentages do not change even if the percentages themselves shift somewhat across trials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX61000 \u00b6 123 n.234 (noting that market share percentages \"are not qualitatively sensitive to alternative definitions of 'global fleets' \"); Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 589:10-13 (\"So ... I really tried to say, well, what happens if I define it as 5 and 15, or various other measures, to make sure that the end result, at least qualitatively, doesn't actually change.\"). The court\n   considers these factual observations to be accurate and well supported, and therefore finds that the FTC has carried its burden to demonstrate that it is appropriate to consider Global Fleets a distinct customer group within the market for MWT products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Price Discrimination Against Global Fleet Customers is Possible Post-Merger\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The court finds that the FTC has carried its burden to demonstrate that price discrimination is possible post-merger because: (1) Global Fleets are a distinct group of customers with distinct needs; (2) negotiation with Global Fleets typically occurs on an individualized basis; and (3) documentation reveals that Defendants have contemplated pricing differentials based on size and trading pattern. As the court has already discussed the first factor, the discussion in this section focuses on the remaining two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants typically negotiate framework agreements with Global Fleets for the whole fleet or for a significant proportion of vessels.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX80006 \u00b6 21 (describing fleet-level negotiations for the entire [redacted] fleet); JX-0277 \u00b6 23 (describing same for Teekay). These negotiations are customer specific, and result in customer-specific pricing at ports relevant to the particular customer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JX-0248 at 014 (\"In negotiations, customers often focus on specific ports that they consider to be key in light of their trading patterns. They then negotiate a customer specific net price for the ports relevant to them.\"). JX-0240 at 011-014 (showing course of negotiation between [redacted] and Drew Marine). While there are general pricing trends-for instance, low volume ports tend to have higher pricing than high volume ports-ultimate prices are determined on a customer-by-customer basis. PX70000 (Cassaras (Drew) IH Tr. at 84:8-85:3, 87:7-10). While customers retain the freedom to purchase outside of framework agreements, they typically choose not to do so with products for which consistency is valued. Sarro Hrg. Tr. at 106:9-107:11 (noting that he prefers not to purchase outside contract when \"it's really important that you have that product on board from that supplier,\" including BWT). This individualization makes the pricing for each Global Fleet opaque to the next, which in turn facilitates differential pricing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, WSS internal documents expressly contemplate market segmentation for the purpose of price discrimination. An internal pricing presentation dated November 2014 notes the benefits of \"value-based pricing,\" which allows WSS to \"segment customer[s] based upon preferences.\" PX20381 at 003. The presentation also distinguishes local and global customers by their preference for suppliers with global reach, and then considers a price discrimination exemplar that distinguishes local and global customers, noting that global customers are willing to pay more for global reach and describing how \"[v]alue based pricing identifies differences in customers' preferences and valuation of attributes, then identifies ways to make them pay different prices for virtually the same product/service.\" PX20381 at 003. The presentation also describes how \"[a]greement discount levels will be built bottom up by applying indexes to multiple price discrimination levels,\" which include \"segment\" and \"trading pattern\" indexes, among other factors. PX20381 at 011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In sum, based on (a) the lack of pricing transparency in a marketplace characterized by individualized negotiations, combined with (b) evidence that Global Fleets constitute a distinct segment of the market with distinct preferences, (c) evidence that WSS recognizes the potential benefits of price discrimination, and (d) the lack of\n   any evidence suggesting arbitrage, the court concludes that price discrimination is possible post-merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

The court now turns to an examination of expert evidence concerning the Hypothetical Monopolist Test (\"HMT\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To model the course of a hypothetical monopolist, Dr. Nevo-the only economist to have performed the HMT in this case-conducted a critical loss analysis, which essentially calculates \"the largest amount of sales that a monopolist can lose before a price increase becomes unprofitable.\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v. Swedish Match\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11135459\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/131/151/#p160\">\n    131 F.Supp.2d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160 (D.D.C. 2000). The test has three steps. First, Dr. Nevo calculated the critical loss threshold-that is, the point at which a hypothetical monopolist would lose too many customers for a SSNIP to be profitable. This step is purely mathematical-the critical loss threshold is the point at which increased profit margins resulting from an increase in price are offset by increased costs resulting from lost sales. Second, Dr. Nevo estimated the\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   aggregate diversion ratio, which \"represents the proportion of lost sales that are recaptured by all other firms in the proposed market as the result of a price increase ... [s]ince these lost sales are recaptured within the proposed market, they are not lost to the hypothetical monopolist.\"\n   <em>\n    H &amp; R Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130667\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/36/#p51\">\n    833 F.Supp.2d at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Third, Dr. Nevo compared aggregate diversion to critical loss, and if aggregate diversion exceeds critical loss, then a SSNIP would be profitable for a hypothetical monopolist.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Swedish Match\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11135459\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/131/151/#p160\">\n    131 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   160 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Dr. Nevo used four kinds of data to calculate margins for different trials-estimates of gross margin for all water treatment products sold to all customers, WSS and Drew invoice data specific to BWT/CWT and Global Fleets, lowest gross margins by quarter, and variable cost margins based on accounting data specific to BWT/CWT and Global Fleets. For aggregate diversion, Dr. Nevo used three kinds of data-revenue information provided by marine suppliers, WSS salesforce data, and WSS and Drew win-loss data. PX61000 \u00b6 227. After running multiple trials with varying inputs, including a SSNIP of 10% (in addition to the typical 5%), Dr. Nevo found that across all cases, the highest critical loss estimate was 17.5%, and the lowest aggregate diversion ratio estimate was 90%. PX61000 \u00b6\u00b6 232, 237; Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 903:14-904:4. In cross-examining Dr. Nevo and in closing arguments, Defendants challenged the basis for his estimates of margins and aggregate diversion, correctly noting that his BWT/CWT-specific estimates are drawn from broader data sets that include all water treatment products. Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 812:1-17. Nevertheless, Defendants' expert, Dr. Israel, presented nothing to suggest that the methodology Dr. Nevo employed in arriving\n   at his estimates was flawed (apart from contesting the appropriateness of a cluster market analysis), and did not present any alternative calculations or HMT results.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DX-0060. Moreover, the gap between critical loss and aggregate diversion in every trial was so large as to ensure the stability of the HMT's qualitative result against any but the gravest of statistical errors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX61000 \u00b6\u00b6 232, 237.

PX61002 \u00b6 272, Ex. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants' expert Dr. Israel challenged Dr. Nevo's analysis on a number of grounds. First, Dr. Israel questioned the appropriateness of applying the cluster market doctrine and focusing on Global Fleets, contending that BWT and CWT should be broken out separately and that the relevant market should include sales to all vessels. DX-0060 \u00b6\u00b6 109-10. Dr. Israel also suggested that Dr. Nevo's use of revenues as a metric to compute shares is\n   problematic because it (a) relies on several estimates and assumptions to fill gaps in revenue data, (b) places more weight on larger vessels with more engines and boilers, rather than treating every vessel as an equal business opportunity, and (c) ignores the utility of treating sales of MWT chemicals as unit sales-corresponding to vessels-where one vessel makes one lower or higher-priced product choice and so constitutes one unit share. DX-0060 \u00b6\u00b6 112-114. Dr. Israel calculated market share based on sales to all vessels weighing 1,000 gross tons or more. DX-0060 \u00b6\u00b6 108, 111, 112, 115. He also employed a \"single invoice\" rule, whereby he assumed that any vessel with less than two invoices from the merging parties in 2017 was making a \"one-off\" purchase, which Dr. Israel took to mean that that vessel purchased most of its BWT or CWT products from other suppliers. DX-0060 \u00b6 116. Dr. Israel separated BWT and CWT into individual market categories, and, applying the single invoice rule, computed Defendants' combined market share as 31% and 33%, resulting in HHIs that are substantially lower and below the Guidelines cutoff of 2500. DX-0060 \u00b6 117.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court credits Dr. Nevo's analysis. While it has already determined that both the cluster market approach and the focus on Global Fleets are appropriate, the court also disagrees with Dr. Israel for other reasons. For one, the court sees no justification for treating all vessels as constituting equal shares of the overall market for MWT. The core of the FTC's argument in this case-as borne out by the evidence-is that all vessels are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   created equal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 640:18-19 (noting that \"not all vessels are created equal\"). Where a vessel has more boilers and engines, it has greater MWT needs that comprise a correspondingly larger part of the market, making such vessels more valuable to suppliers. Conducting the analysis by using just the number of vessels obscures this fact, while using revenue data acknowledges that capturing the market for larger ships means capturing a larger part of the market for MWT. The court views this increased sensitivity to market reality as a strength of Dr. Nevo's revenue-based analysis, not a flaw. Moreover, while there is some imprecision inherent in estimating revenue shares for suppliers that did not produce revenue information, there appears to be only one known supplier-Vecom-that failed to produce such data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX61002 \u00b6 271 Ex. 26. Dr. Nevo ran trials accounting for up to ten additional hypothetical suppliers with revenues matching the median and average of all non-party suppliers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX61002 \u00b6 271 Ex. 26; PX61000 \u00b6 263 Ex. 32. Defendants have pointed to no evidence suggesting that the absence of specific information about one missing supplier would change the data more substantially than ten additional suppliers with median or average revenues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The FTC need not present market shares and HHI estimates with the precision of a NASA scientist.

For instance, in a January 2015 internal presentation on the strategic rationale for the merger, WSS acknowledged that \"[t]he combined entity will be the unrivalled leader in maritime services in general and marine chemicals in particular.\" PX20329 at 48. Another WSS internal presentation titled \"Global Strategy 2013-2017\" described WSS as having \"relatively high market shares within Marine Chemicals\"-listing WSS as possessing slightly more than 50% market share in marine chemicals and describing Drew as having 25%. JX-0192 at 005. Furthermore, internal Drew documents acknowledge that\n   \"Drew Marine essentially has one global competitor-Wilh. Wilhemsen Holding ASA.\" JX-0055 at 027;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JX-0053 at 024 (noting that \"VPP segment is dominated by Drew Marine and the market's largest participant, Wilh.

Moreover, the record includes multiple instances of serious competition between WSS and Drew, specifically on issues such as price and other non-price incentives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 64-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Customer testimony from Global Fleets further supports the notion that Defendants occupy the number one and number two market positions and that competition between them plays a key role in providing consumer benefits at the fleet level.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [redacted] (describing WSS and Drew as only viable options, describing how merger would leave fleet without alternatives, describing how negotiation with Vecom broke down over capability concerns); Sarro Hrg.

The court agrees with Defendants that such testimony is not without its flaws-while many customers testified that they consider Drew and WSS to be the only proven suppliers capable of meeting their needs on a global basis, some also admitted that they have not undertaken any detailed investigation of other suppliers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX70028 106:14-18. It is also true that customer testimony alone is often considered a less reliable form of evidence in this context.\n   <em>\n    Arch Coal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213297\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/329/109/#p115\">\n    329 F.Supp.2d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"[i]n many contexts ... antitrust authorities do not accord great weight to the subjective views of customers in the market.\"). Nevertheless, in light of the extensive documentary and statistical evidence the FTC has presented in this case, it does not appear that the FTC is over-relying on customer input, and the fact that the documentary and statistical evidence aligns with customer testimony bolsters the reliability of the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Quantitative Evidence Suggests Competitive Effects Based on High Market Shares and Elimination of Head-to-Head Competition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Dr. Nevo performed two additional studies to confirm that Defendants will have the incentive and ability to raise post-merger prices-the Gross Upward Pricing Pressure Index methodology (\"GUPPI\") and a merger simulation model.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   A GUPPI analysis is essentially a bargaining framework that quantifies a firm's change in incentive to raise prices following a merger-i.e., the \"upward pricing pressure.\" PX61000 \u00b6\u00b6 318-19. The model takes as a premise that, when WSS (or Drew) bids for business in the current market, higher prices increase the chance that customers will choose another supplier, and that given the closeness of competition between WSS and Drew, Drew (or WSS) will usually be the alternative supplier. PX61000 \u00b6 317. In this model, the firm that chooses to raise or lower prices must balance the potential for increased profits at a higher price against the potential to lose profits but gain business at a lower price. PX61000 \u00b6 317. The optimal price lies somewhere between these points. PX61000 \u00b6 317. The model hypothesizes that without Drew or WSS as a check, the need for balancing disappears. PX61000 \u00b6 317. The incentive to raise prices depends on the size of the fraction of diverting WSS customers that go to Drew (or vice versa) and the size of the margin that Drew or WSS earns. PX61000 \u00b6 320. To estimate these variables, Dr. Nevo used a number of values drawn from market share estimates based on revenue data, market share estimates based on WSS's PSM tool, WSS salesforce data, and WSS win-loss data. PX61000 \u00b6 321. For margins, Dr. Nevo used invoice data and variable cost margins. PX61000 \u00b6 323. Dr. Nevo's results across multiple trials, accounting for variations of these inputs and calculated from the perspective of both Drew and WSS, produced percentages consistently over 20%, indicating strong incentives for post-merger price increase. Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 658:20-660:23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Dr. Nevo's merger simulation model aimed to quantify the effect that combining the first and second choice MWT suppliers would have on bargaining and prices in the relevant antitrust market. The model hypothesized that since customers needing supply are likely to solicit more than one bid and play the second-best supplier alternative off the first-best in order to secure better offers, a situation in which (a) the first and second-best merge, and (b) the third-best supplier (which will become second-best post-merger) represents a weak alternative relative to the merging parties, will tend to produce higher prices. Indeed, the weaker an option the third supplier represents relative to the merging parties, the more likely it is that customers will face higher prices. PX61000 \u00b6\u00b6 332-23;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 663:22-665:5, 670:16-671:18. Using the same market share and margin estimates as in the GUPPI analysis, Dr. Nevo calculated estimated percentage price increases post-merger using eight scenarios involving all input combinations. Percentage increases across all sensitivities ranged from 13.6% to 53.1% ($6.7 million to $26 million in dollar increases), with ranges based on Dr. Nevo's preferred data of 29% to 46.6% (14.4 million to 23 million in dollar increases). PX61000 \u00b6 339. Notably, the model did not predict the timing of price increases. As Dr. Nevo testified at the evidentiary hearing, such high price increases can be implemented over time, and in a market where it is typical for parties negotiating framework agreements to bargain over substantial discounts off list prices, price increases could simply involve reducing the amount of the discount in proportion to reduced negotiating leverage. Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 675:12-677:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendants argue that Dr. Nevo's models are flawed because they depend on unreliable data, specifically incomplete win-loss data and overbroad salesforce data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nevo Hrg. Tr. at 581:23-582:3 (\"THE COURT: Dr. Nevo ... for this win-loss data ... what kind of numbers are we talking about in reaching these percentages? THE WITNESS: So these are very small numbers. I forget exactly.... But I think this is-it is very sparsely populated.\"), 722:11-723:8 (noting that salesforce and win-loss datasets are not specific to the market alleged). While the court agrees that there are some reliability issues with both the win-loss and salesforce data, the court disagrees that this flaw dooms the studies' significance, especially when, with respect to the merger simulation model in particular, the difference in market share between the merging parties and the third-best alternative so closely tracks the model's basic assumptions. Win-loss and salesforce data were the basis for market share estimates in only two of the scenarios in each analytical category (GUPPI and merger simulation), and did not form the basis of Dr. Nevo's preferred calculations. In all other trials, market shares were estimated using other data, and the results were stable across these variations. Moreover, even acknowledging the limited usefulness of certain data, calculations using that data can be considered as confirmatory, insofar as the results match the results of calculations that use more reliable data and accord with the inferences suggested by a larger body of evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding merger simulation strengthened\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case despite imperfections in underlying data where result was qualitatively robust to other variations using more reliable data).

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendants contend that there are no significant barriers to expansion by other firms already in the market as defined by the FTC, and that one or more of those firms will expand to provide a competitive counterbalance that will maintain prices at pre-merger levels. Defendants note that they are required only to show that \"another competitor or group of competitors could fill Drew's current position in the market,\" DFF \u00b6 280, examine a number of potential barriers, and argue that none of them prevent expansion in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   First, Defendants argue that \"there is no meaningful limit on the supply of BWTC and CWTC,\" meaning that the FTC cannot argue that \"current suppliers are capacity constrained.\" ECF No. 50-2 at 39. In particular, Defendants assert that the chemistry that guides formulation of MWT products is well known, and toll blenders-chemical companies that blend MWT chemicals for suppliers, including Drew-are not bound by exclusive agreements and could find another outlet for their products among other market participants. ECF No. 50-2 at 34; DFF \u00b6\u00b6 287-91. Second, Defendants argue that the need for a global distribution network does not constitute a significant barrier to entry because \"there is nothing that prevents ... competitors from easily expanding their [distribution] networks in response to customer demand.\" ECF No. 50-2 at 40; DFF \u00b6\u00b6 298-300. Defendants emphasize that Drew outsources about two-thirds of its MWT business, [redacted] and engaging others such as Wrist-a large ship chandler-to make last-mile deliveries to vessels at distant ports, often far from warehouses (which are leased, rather than owned). DFF \u00b6\u00b6 301-03. Defendants also argue that the FTC has failed to identify any ports \"where entry would be needed and would purportedly not occur.\" ECF No. 50-2 at 37; DFF \u00b6\u00b6 298, 301-14. Third, Defendants argue that the ability to offer technical services in conjunction with the delivery of chemical products poses no barrier. They point out that Drew offers only three kinds of technical services: (1) log sheet reporting, which involves periodically recording boiler and cooling testing results in proprietary software and collating data in a central location to ensure consistency over time; (2) initial training sessions, which involve providing new customers with written materials describing dosing and testing methods for Drew's products and conducting a presentation for onboard\n   engineers; (3) on-board visits to customer vessels, during which Drew representatives answer shipboard engineers' questions, review the testing history, and make recommendations. Defendants note that Drew had 40-53 service engineers between January 2015 and June 2017, and contend that procuring engineers is not a sustainable entry barrier because an entrant can start with a smaller number and scale up over time. ECF No. 50-2 at 40-41; DFF \u00b6\u00b6 316-21. Fourth, Defendants argue that reputation and brand are not significant barriers to entry because Global Fleet customers are highly sophisticated, and are therefore unlikely to be influenced by branding. DFF \u00b6 322. Defendants note that to the extent that some Global Fleet customers believe other suppliers are incapable of serving their needs, they are uninformed. DFF \u00b6 326.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The court concludes that Defendants have not carried their burden to establish that entry will be appropriately timely, likely, and sufficient to deter or counteract the competitive effects of the merger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cardinal Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1586899\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/12/34/#p45\">\n    12 F.Supp.2d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants' contention that Drew's business-including its products, services, reputation, customer relationships, and distribution model-is simple and capable of replication in a short period of time is at odds with inferences drawn from the state of the current market and with documentary and testimonial evidence from customers and suppliers. It defies basic economic principles for a profitable market to be simultaneously characterized by (a) markedly high concentration and head-to-head competition between two dominant firms over a significant period of time, and (b) low barriers to entry and easily replicable business models. Where the latter is true, economic incentives to compete should ensure that the former is not. Low barriers signify economic opportunities, and as Defendants' own expert acknowledges, \"[e]conomics teaches that firms will enter markets where there are opportunities to earn economic profits (profits above the competitive level) until those economic profits are pushed to zero.\" DX-0060 \u00b6 224; Israel Hrg. Tr. at 1567:4-10, 1568:11-24. The FTC has presented strong evidence that the current market is highly concentrated and dominated by head-to-head competition between Drew and WSS, notwithstanding that a number of other suppliers have been present in the market for years. In other words, \"the fact that the merging parties have been able to maintain high margins and market shares without witnessing notable entry and expansion\" suggests that, contrary to Defendants' contentions, the market for supply of MWT products is characterized by significant barriers to entry. PX61002 at \u00b6 244.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   This perspective is borne out in documentary and testimonial evidence, which suggests that barriers to entry-especially global distribution networks, customer relationships and reputation, and customer retention rates-play a significant role in the merging parties' respective business models. Global presence in particular is consistently considered a distinguishing feature of Defendants' business that is capital intensive and difficult to replicate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JX-0279 at 022 (Drew presentation describing one of its features as an \"Established Global Presence with Significant Barriers to Entry,\" and further explaining that its \"Expansive Global Logistics and Distribution Network Enables Swift Order Fulfillment and is Difficult and Costly to Replicate\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PX60008 (Drew) at 006 (\"Q.

[t]he complexity of this operation is the major barrier to entry for competing manufacturers and suppliers, focusing their efforts towards larger, land based markets.\"). Indeed, other market participants have confirmed that expanding a distribution network to the size of Drew's would require significant capital investment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franzo Hrg.

[I]t would take a financial influx of capital to do such a thing.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Similarly, evidence indicates that prior customer relationships and reputation function as barriers in the MWT industry because customers are highly risk averse, leading them to favor known providers and avoid switching suppliers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JX-0250 at 009 (consultant presentation of MWT analysis to WSS indicates that \"[c]ustomer relationships are important to maintain sales and contract extensions,\" because \"[w]ater treatment products has a lock-in effect, as the vessels cannot change water treatment supplier continuously, as it would defeat its purpose\"); [redacted] (describing elimination of Marine Care from bidding process because \"[t]he evaluation of the team was that the Marine Care bid had more risk to it. They didn't cover as many ports as we were seeking. They were an unknown supplier to us, so a lot more testing would be required to consider their chemicals.\"); Fry Hrg. Tr. at 962:11-23 (explaining that Military Sealift Command single sources its chemicals worldwide because \"[c]ommonality of chemicals, commonality of training, commonality of test equipment\" helps \"prevent[ ] ... mistakes and ... minimize the risk to the ship itself.\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   PX80000 (MSC Decl.) at \u00b6\u00b6 51-52 (noting that \"[r]eputation cannot be understated given that even small discrepancies in the quality, availability, or service of marine chemicals could shorten the lifecycle of equipment or cause immediate failure,\" and that \"if another company decided to make a concerted effort to replace Drew, it would take additional time for that company to earn the reputation for quality, service, and reliability that Drew and Wilhelmsen have developed over decades in the marine industry\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In sum, evidence relating to the foregoing barriers alone shows that here, as in\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   , new entry and/or expansion are \"capital intensive and demand[ ] a long time horizon\"-capital to fund expansion of distribution network, and time to build relationships with customers and develop a high reputation for quality and reliability.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence does not reveal any specific competitor or potential\n   competitor with any plan to enter, and in fact suggests the opposite-that expansion is costly, and no smaller competitor or potential competitor intends to expand or reposition in order to make a bid for Global Fleet customers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [redacted] \u00b6 10 (noting that expansion is costly, on the order of $20,000-$30,000 in shipping per container of product on top of third-party fees, and that [redacted] has not expanded for water treatment chemicals in five years); [redacted] \u00b6 8 (noting that [redacted] has no intention of entering the MWT business); [redacted] \u00b6 6 (noting absence of expansion plans);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Based on their assessment that expansion would not be an economically viable strategy, regional distributors have said that they have no plans to expand or reposition in order to serve national customers.\"). Defendants may be correct that at some point in the future one or more smaller competitors will be in a position to replicate the competitive benefits that Drew's presence currently provides. Nevertheless, the record does not support the notion that any entry or credible threat thereof will be timely, likely, and sufficient to counteract the likely anticompetitive effects of this merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

LEGAL STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Courts have also noted that the existence of power buyers-sophisticated customers who retain strategies post-merger that \"may constrain the ability of the merging parties to raise prices,\" Merger Guidelines \u00a7 8-is a factor that can serve to \"rebut a prima facie case of anti-competitiveness.\"\n   <em>\n    Cardinal Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1586899\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/12/34/#p45\">\n    12 F.Supp.2d at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Defendants argue that the FTC's Global Fleets construct focuses on the largest shipping companies-those most likely to have the power to constrain the merger's anticompetitive effects. In support of this contention, Defendants point out that customers tend to purchase other goods from suppliers, which permits them to discipline attempted BWT and CWT price increases by switching or credibly threatening to switch purchases of these other products to other suppliers or by negotiating price decreases on other products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   ECF No. 50-2 at 45; DFF \u00b6\u00b6 246-249. Defendants further argue that customers could adapt purchases to another supplier's distribution network or shift part of their fleet to another competitor, since many vessels in Global Fleets do not avail themselves of all of Defendants' networks-instead visiting a subset of available ports and picking up MWT from an even smaller subset. DFF \u00b6\u00b6 250-253. Defendants also contend that Global Fleets could stockpile larger quantities of MWT products in order to shift purchases to major ports with lower costs, DFF \u00b6\u00b6 254-258; ECF No. 50-2 at 45-46, and that customers can partner with suppliers to sponsor entry or expansion to new ports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The court is unpersuaded by Defendants' power buyer argument. The evidence is mixed-at best-regarding the effectiveness of each of the Defendants' suggested strategies. Although at least one witness suggested that customers could shift purchases of other products in more competitive markets to other suppliers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Kelleher Hrg. Tr. at 536:6-20, there is, as Dr. Nevo noted, little empirical basis for the notion that this strategy-already available to large customers-would yield any additional benefits beyond those customers currently enjoy. PX61002 \u00b6\u00b6 223, 232. Similarly, while testimony suggested that customers may be able to stockpile product and concentrate purchases in ports where products are cheaper, that same testimony suggests that storage space is often limited and that customers already do so.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [redacted] (describing size of storage facilities onboard and efforts to ensure that product sourcing occurs efficiently);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fry Hrg.

Defendants have not identified any\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   strategy or alternative likely to emerge post-merger-instead, they have focused on strategies that are already part of the competitive landscape and which show no promise of becoming more effective. On the other hand, the FTC has shown that the merger will result in the loss of a proven strategy-the ability to leverage one large, global supplier against another-that appears to be the most effective price constraint in the consolidated MWT market. In other words, the FTC has established a reasonable probability that as a result of the merger, sophisticated buyers will have one less alternative strategy through which they can exercise power, and Defendants have not identified any equally or more effective buyer options to counteract that loss.

Dr. Rothman reviewed data and documentation from the merging parties, and the parties' consultants provided him with spreadsheets relevant to their claimed cost savings. Dr. Rothman concluded in his report and his testimony at the evidentiary hearing that the merging parties had failed to provide sufficient information for him to verify the likelihood and magnitude of the claimed cost savings. PX61001 at \u00b6 10. In particular, Dr. Rothman found that the alleged cost savings in each of the categories were based on a series of significant assumptions-percentage reductions in cost, percentage increases in productivity, or assumed cost/product equivalencies-that were \"doing all the work\" in calculation of the estimates. Rothman Hrg. Tr. at 1035:5-6. Dr. Rothman further pointed out that Wilhelmsen failed to provide any information that would have allowed him to confirm whether those assumptions are reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Rothman Hrg.

Thus, if a vessel were to purchase multiple times from Defendants in 2015 and 2016, but only once in 2017, the single invoice rule would treat that vessel as a non-loyal customer that bought its total supply of MWT elsewhere-ignoring the quantity it did buy from Defendants during 2017, and discounting the possibility that the vessel stocked up on supplies for the relevant time period, or experienced downtime, or did not need to purchase again during that year for some other reason.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    The complete results of these trials are presented in Dr. Nevo's reply report at PX61002 \u00b6 104 Ex. 8.

Essentially, Dr. Israel used sales data to focus on vessels weighing 1,000 gross tons or more that purchase from one of the merging parties in one year but not the next year (or years, in some formulations). If that vessel disappeared from the invoice data for one party, and did not show up in the invoice data for the other within the relevant time period, Dr. Israel counted it as a \"loss.\" Dr. Israel's results indicated that most vessels that switch from one merging party do not typically switch to the other.
