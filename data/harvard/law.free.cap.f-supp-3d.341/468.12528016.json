On the evening of February 25, 2012, Waris was the victim of a \"violent criminal assault\" by Neary. At the time, Waris and Neary were roommates sharing a rented apartment in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. According to\n   the complaint, at the time of the attack Neary was suffering from \"pre-existing mental health issues which may cause him to exhibit violent and aggressive behavior.\" These mental health issued were \"severely exacerbated upon consumption of alcohol\" by Neary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the night of the assault, Neary and Waris attended a party where Neary consumed alcohol. At the party, without provocation, Neary began to attack Waris orally and physically. After the attack, Waris returned to the apartment he shared with Neary. Shortly thereafter, Neary made his way back to the apartment and physically assaulted Waris. After the assault Neary delayed in seeking help or medical care for Waris, thereby exacerbating Waris's injuries. As a result of the attack, Waris suffered a traumatic brain injury which has caused memory loss, concentration issues, headaches, insomnia, and emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The underlying complaint against Neary contains counts for: (1) negligence and recklessness (Count I); (2) negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count III); and (3) negligent failure to rescue (Count IV).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Waris seeks compensatory and punitive damages plus interest, costs, and attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plain language of the Homesite policy limits coverage to injury or damage caused by an accident. Specifically, it provides that coverage extends to a claim or suit \"brought against an 'insured' for damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' caused by an 'occurrence' to which this coverage applies.\" \"Occurrence\" is defined as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results, during the policy period, in: a. 'Bodily Injury'; or b. 'Property damage.' \" Additionally, the policy contains an \"Exclusions\" section, which forecloses coverage for \" 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' ... [w]hich is expected or intended by the 'insured.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While the Homesite policy does not define \"accident,\" we construe words of common usage in an insurance policy \"according to their natural, plain, and ordinary sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Kvaerner Metals Div. of Kvaerner U.S., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458945,2573580\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/908/888/\">\n    908 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   897 (citing\n   <em>\n    Madison Const.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has instructed that the term \"accident\" in an insurance policy \"refers to an unexpected and undesirable event occurring unintentionally, and that the key term in the definition of the 'accident' is 'unexpected' which implies a degree of fortuity.

Rather, we must look to the factual allegations of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3499639\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/105/#p116\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Haver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1701987,11639853\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/725/743/\">\n    725 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   745 ). For the reasons discussed above, the assault by Neary cannot be deemed an \"occurrence,\" that is, an accident, under the insurance policy. Accordingly, Waris's attempt to characterize causes of action arising from the assault as claims sounding in negligence is insufficient to trigger Homesite's duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In an attempt to escape this result, Waris has asserted in the underlying complaint that the attack was caused by Neary's consumption of alcohol. Under Pennsylvania law, intoxication \"must be considered in determining if the actor has the ability to formulate an intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Mehlman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3499639\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/105/#p116\">\n    589 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   112 (citing\n   <em>\n    Stidham v.

If the actor lacks the ability to formulate intent, it follows that the resulting act cannot be intentional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"The mere fact that an insured was intoxicated, however, will not prevent a court from finding that he intended the natural and probable consequences of his actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"921923,1837484\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/618/945/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, \"voluntary intoxication ordinarily will not prevent the formation of the general intent necessary for the commission of an assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115. Instead, Pennsylvania courts have only recognized voluntary intoxication as negating a finding of intent where the insured was in the midst of an alcoholic blackout or completely lost awareness of his actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 113-15. As our Court of Appeals has aptly stated when explaining this distinction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   It is entirely appropriate to recognize this limitation on the consequences of intoxication in coverage disputes, for alcoholic beverages certainly can contribute to the loosening of a person's inhibitions without eliminating his ability to intend to engage in harmful conduct. Indeed, the effect of the use of alcoholic beverages may contribute to a party formulating an intent to engage in anti-social conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, the underlying complaint merely alleges that Neary \"consumed alcohol\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   on the night of the assault. The complaint contains no factual allegations to support an inference that Neary's voluntary intoxication rose to a level that would render his actions accidental. There is no information regarding the amount Neary drank that evening, his blood alcohol content, or anything else about the degree to which Neary was impaired, if at all. Importantly, there is no allegation that Neary was in the midst of an alcoholic blackout or that he completely lost awareness of his actions when he attacked Waris. Instead, the complaint alleges that Neary orally and physically attacked his roommate Waris at a party and then travelled to their shared apartment where he again assaulted Waris. Thus, the conclusory allegation that Neary consumed alcohol, without more, is insufficient to trigger Homesite's duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We are bound to reach the same conclusion with regard to Waris's allegation in the underlying complaint that the assault by Neary was caused by the \"pre-existing mental health issues\" of Neary. The complaint contains no factual support for the allegation that Neary has any specific mental health issue which was so severe as to negate his ability to form general intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Germantown Ins.

Accordingly, this conclusory allegation cannot render the \"violent criminal assault\" by Neary an accident covered by the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"900482\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/407/326/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In opposing Homesite's motion, Neary asserts that coverage should be extended in the underlying matter because he acted in self-defense when he assaulted Waris.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is nothing within the four corners of the underlying complaint that would support this position, and thus we decline to consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, Waris points out that the policy does not specifically exclude coverage for criminal acts. This is irrelevant because, as discussed above, the policy applies only to an \"occurrence,\" that is, an accident. We further note that there are also specific exclusions for the intentional acts of the insured and for injuries \"[a]rising out of physical or mental abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We conclude that the attack perpetrated by Neary on Waris as alleged in the underlying complaint was not an \"occurrence,\" that is, was not an accident. Thus, the claims of Waris are excluded from coverage under the policy, and Homesite has no duty to defend or to indemnify Neary in the underlying action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sikirica v.
