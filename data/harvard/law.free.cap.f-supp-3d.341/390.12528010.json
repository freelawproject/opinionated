(D.I. 1). At that time, Plaintiff also filed actions against six other defendants. Five of those cases have been resolved, and the sixth, against Gibson Brands, Inc., was stayed and administratively closed on May 8,\n   2018, after the defendant filed a notice of bankruptcy. (No. 17-1498, D.I. 17, 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Defendant is \"infringing at least claim 1 of the '379 patent.\" (D.I. 1, \u00b6 13). The '379 patent contains seven claims, which read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. A method performed in a system having multiple navigable nodes interconnected in a hierarchical arrangement comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   at a first node, receiving an input from a user of the system, the input containing at least one word identifiable with at least one keyword from among multiple keywords,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   identifying at least one node, other than the first node, that is not directly connected to the first node but is associated with the at least one keyword, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   jumping to the at least one node.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. The method of claim 1 further comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   providing a verbal description associated with the at least one node to the user.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. The method of claim 1 further comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   searching a thesaurus correlating keywords with synonyms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   4. The method of claim 3 wherein the searching further comprises:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   identifying the at least one word as synonymous with the at least one keyword.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   5. The method of claim 1 further comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   determining that the at least one word is neither a keyword nor a synonym of any keyword; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   learning a meaning for the word so that the word will be treated as a learned synonym for at least one particular keyword of the multiple keywords.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   6. The method of claim 5 further comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   adding the word to a thesaurus so that, when the word is input by a subsequent user, the word will be treated as synonymous with the at least one particular keyword.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   7. A method performed in connection with an arrangement of nodes representable as a hierarchical graph containing vertices and edges connecting at least two of the vertices, the method comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   receiving an input from a user as a response to a verbal description associated with a first vertex;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   analyzing the input to identify a meaningful term that can be associated with at least one keyword;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   selecting a vertex in the graph structure that is not connected by an edge to the first vertex, based upon an association between the meaningful term and the at least one keyword and a correlation between the at least one keyword and the vertex; and jumping to the vertex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (D.I. 1-1, Exh. A, claims 1-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

A hierarchically arranged decisional network is an arrangement of \"nodes\" (numbered boxes), which are connected by \"edges\" (lines connecting the numbered boxes). ( '379 patent, Fig. 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A user makes a decision at a particular node, after which an \"edge\" is used to traverse from that node to an adjacent node, which corresponds to the user's decision.

Instead, says Plaintiff, the invention allows the system to \"jump\" laterally from one branch to another. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing '379 patent at 3:35-43) ). Plaintiff argues that \"jumping\" is accomplished \"by associating each node with descriptions, and matching words in user's responses with those descriptions so the system can jump to nodes that may not be directly connected to a user's current node in the hierarchically arranged decisional network.\" (D.I. 17 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff argues, \"Independent claims 1 and 7 of the '379 patent\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   are directed to methods for improved navigation in a computerized hierarchically arranged decisional network that must be navigated by a user as part of the processing, and that is also constructed to accept user inputs or data for navigation.\" (D.I. 17 at 12 (citing '379 patent at 2:9-16) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, argues Plaintiff, those independent claims are \"directed to an improvement in the functioning of a computer,\" and are not abstract.\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n    822 F.3d at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    McRo\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit found that claims were not directed to an abstract idea because the claims were \"focused on a specific asserted improvement in computer animation\" whereby \"[t]he claimed process uses a combined order of specific rules that renders information into a specific format.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/\">\n    837 F.3d at 1314-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff argues that the claims here provide \"implementation details,\" which are not \"purely functional,\" but rather amount to computer improvement. (D.I. 17 at 15). First, argues Plaintiff, the \"receiving an input\" claim limitation \"requires a specific user ... who provides the input, provides the location where the input is received ..., and what the input is ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing '379 patent at 22:47-53) ). Second, argues Plaintiff, the \"identifying at least one node ... associated with the at least one keyword\" limitation requires \"nodes associated with keywords.\" (D.I. 17 at 15-16 (citing '379 patent at 22:54-56) ). Plaintiff argues that \"nodes\" in \"the ordinary setup of a hierarchically arranged decision network\" are \"not associated with keywords.\" (D.I. 17 at 14). Third, argues Plaintiff, the \"jumping\" limitation \"requires the system to directly traverse from one node/vertex to another node/vertex that is not directly connected.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendant, on the other hand, argues that the claims of the '379 patent are directed to the abstract idea of \"using keywords to search hierarchically-arranged data.\" (D.I. 14 at 7). Defendant continues, \"The claims of the '379 Patent are [ ] abstract because a human being could perform the steps of each method claim mentally or with pen and paper.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13). \"[A] method that can be performed by human thought alone is merely an abstract idea and is not patent-eligible under \u00a7 101.\"\n   <em>\n    CyberSource Corp. v.

Cir. 2011). Claim 1 recites, \"a system having multiple navigable nodes interconnected in a hierarchical arrangement.\" Defendant argues that the claimed \"nodes\" and \"interconnections\" are \"not physical\" or \"tangible objects,\" but rather are \"pieces of information\" and \"logical relationships between them,\" respectively. (D.I. 14 at 14). \"Such logic constructs,\" argues Defendant, \"are organizational concepts that humans memorize and work with mentally, even unknowingly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant continues, \"Similarly, the claim feature that nodes must be 'interconnected in a hierarchical arrangement' is an abstract concept drawn from mathematical 'graph theory.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing '379 patent at 2:64-3:43) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   I agree with Defendant. The claims are directed to the idea of \"using keywords to search hierarchically-arranged data.\" (D.I. 14 at 7). I assume that Plaintiff is correct that the claims cover a \"computerized\" network; even so, the claims are not directed to an invention that improves the functionality of that computerized network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n    822 F.3d at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the claims at issue were not directed to an abstract idea because \"the plain focus of the claims is on an improvement to computer functionality itself, not on economic or other tasks for which a computer is used in its ordinary capacity\"). Plaintiff\n   makes no argument as to how the claims' \"implementation details\" amount to an \"improvement to computer functionality,\" or anything other than generic automation of a once-manual method. Plaintiff argues that \"nodes\" in \"the ordinary setup of a hierarchically arranged decision network\" are \"not associated with keywords.\" (D.I. 17 at 14, 19). However, \"keywords\" do not necessarily invoke computer functionality at all. They merely label certain decisions in a decisional hierarchy. Plaintiff further argues that the claims provide \"implementation details.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16). However, \"receiving an input,\" \"identifying at least one node,\" and \"jumping,\" are all steps that a person can perform mentally in navigating a decisional hierarchy. The \"implementation details\" can be computerized, but the '379 patent provides no information as to how they might improve the functionality of a computer or computerized data set.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff identifies several \"claim construction issues,\" which it says preclude me from granting Defendant's motion, and proposes a claim construction for each purported issue. (D.I. 17 at 7-9). However, even were I to adopt Plaintiff's constructions, the independent claims would be abstract. First, Plaintiff proposes that, \"A system having multiple navigable nodes interconnected in a hierarchical arrangement\" and \"an arrangement of nodes representable as a hierarchical graph containing vertices and edges connecting at least two of the vertices\" mean \"a computerized system of multiple nodes interconnected in a hierarchically arranged decisional network in which a user provides inputs or responses at each node to navigate through adjacent nodes in the hierarchical arrangement.\" (D.I. 17 at 8). At most, Plaintiff's proposed construction puts the claims into a more specific technological environment. \"The prohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of [the idea] to a particular technological environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2354\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Plaintiff proposes that \"jumping\" means \"a direct traversal from one node or vertex to another node or vertex that is not directly connected to it (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , without traversal through any intervening nodes or vertices or to a node or vertex whose only least common ancestor with that node or vertex is the root node or vertex).\" (D.I. 17 at 8). However, the claims do not actually disclose a mechanism for \"jumping.\" Plaintiff does little more than claim the idea of moving directly from one \"node\" in a decisional hierarchy to another non-adjacent node. Third, Plaintiff proposes that the \"jumping to the at least one node\" and \"jumping to the vertex\" limitations require that the \"system,\" rather than the \"user,\" jumps to the \"at least one node\" or \"vertex.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). At most, Plaintiff's proposal amounts to the automation of the mental process of jumping from one node to another. The proposal does not render the claims non-abstract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The dependent claims are no less abstract than the independent claims. Claim 2, like claim 7, covers, \"providing a verbal description associated with the at least one node to the user.\" Claims 3 and 4 cover using a \"thesaurus\" to correlate keywords with synonyms. Searching a thesaurus is human task that in no way improves the functioning of a computer. At most, it is an \"insignificant post-solution activity\" added onto claim 1's abstract use of keywords.\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p71\">\n    566 U.S. at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p71\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bilski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644410,12455287\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/593/\">\n    561 U.S. at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644410,12455287\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/593/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ). Claims 5 and 6 cover, \"learning a meaning for [a] word,\" and \"adding the word to a thesaurus,\" respectively.
