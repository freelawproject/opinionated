DEGUILIO, Judge, United States District Court\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pro se plaintiffs, Michael Dobbie and Janice Dobbie, filed a complaint against various defendants after a welfare check on an individual located in Mr. Dobbie's home resulted in a warrantless search of the home, as well as the arrest and prosecution of Mr. Dobbie for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia. Construing the pro se claims liberally, it appears that plaintiffs assert Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims against the Bremen Police Department and Bremen Police Officers Bradley Kile and Ronald Rybicki (counts 1 and 2) for unlawful search, seizure, and arrest; a Sixth Amendment claim against the Marshall County Prosecutors' Office and Prosecutors Lynn Berndt and Matthew\n   Sarber (count 3) pertaining to the state charges; and, a state claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") against all six of the defendants (count 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rather than file answers to the complaint, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and provided the requisite\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. Faulkner\n   </em>\n   notices. The individual prosecutors (and their employer) allege that they are entitled to absolute immunity [DE 21]. The individual officers (and their employer) allege that the claims against them are barred by the statute of limitations and that the facts fail to support the claims alleged [DE 25; DE 37]. Plaintiffs oppose the motions to dismiss [DEs 33-36]. On a referral, the magistrate judge recommended that the Court grant both motions in their entirety [DE 43]. Plaintiffs have objected to that recommendation [DE 46], which then generated responses from defendants [DEs 47-48]. For the reasons that follow, the Court grants the motions with respect to the federal claims and denies the motions with respect to the state claim because the Court declines to exert supplemental jurisdiction over it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts viewed in the plaintiffs' favor are as follows. On April 2, 2015, Officers Kile and Rybicki arrived at Mr. Dobbie's residence to conduct a wellness check on a female guest of Mr. Dobbie. After entering the home without permission and finding that the guest was okay, the officers conducted a search of the premises over Mr. Dobbie's objection and discovered a pipe typically used for drugs. After threatening to return with a narcotics detection dog, Mr. Dobbie turned over a small amount of marijuana to the officers. The marijuana and paraphernalia were seized and Mr. Dobbie was arrested, but he was never provided\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings during the encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Dobbie bonded out of jail the following day, but was charged with possession of marijuana and paraphernalia. As part of his defense, Mr. Dobbie filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search of his residence. On March 3, 2016, the evidentiary hearing on the motion was held; and on March 17, 2016, the judge found that the warrantless entry, search, and seizure were illegal, which required that the evidence obtained during the search be suppressed. On June 15, 2016, Prosecuting Attorney Sarber moved to dismiss the criminal charges against Mr. Dobbie and the motion was granted on the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiffs filed their pro se complaint on June 2, 2017. Counts 1-3 imply an action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, in count 1, plaintiffs allege that Officers Kile and Rybicki violated Mr. Dobbie's Fourth Amendment rights by conducting an unlawful search of his home on April 2, 2015. In count 2, plaintiffs allege that by threatening to further search the home and then arresting Mr. Dobbie on April 2, 2015, Officers Kile and Rybicki violated Mr. Dobbie's Fifth Amendment rights by \"forc[ing him] to be a witness against himself,\" depriving him \"of his liberty without due process of law,\" and failing to \"read him his rights.\" In count 3, plaintiffs allege that Mr. Dobbie was \"denied the right to a speedy disposition or trial,\" as protected\n   by the Sixth Amendment, because the \"prosecuting attorneys\" took about fourteen months to determine that they did not have a case against him. The plaintiffs contend that the prosecutors delayed the case because they \"should have known that the search conducted was illegal and that Mr. Dobbie was not read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   Rights.\" In count 4, the plaintiffs allege that the stress and expenses incurred as a result of the criminal prosecution of Mr. Dobbie support a claim for IIED. Mr. Dobbie explains that for \"well over a year [he] did not know his fate\" and that having to post bond, pay attorney's fees, and attend court hearings were financially and emotionally stressful on him. Ms. Dobbie (whose relationship to Mr. Dobbie is unclear) alleges that the situation was equally stressful on her, even though she has lived in Michigan the entire time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court construes the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accepts the factual allegations as true, and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' pro se complaint in its entirety. The Court first considers the federal claims and explains why these claims are subject to dismissal. The Court then considers the state claim and explains why it declines to exert supplemental jurisdiction over it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Counts 1-2: Federal Claims against Bremen Police Department and Individual Officers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Bremen Police Department and Officers Kile and Rybicki seek dismissal of the Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims as barred by the applicable statute of limitations. They further contend that plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently plead a violation of the Fifth Amendment. For the following reasons, the Court finds that plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim (count\n   1) is barred by the statute of limitations, and that plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim (count 2) is insufficiently pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With respect to the Fourth Amendment claim (count 1), the parties do not dispute when the claim accrued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Case law makes clear that any claims for Mr. Dobbie's alleged unlawful search and seizure occurred on April 2, 2015; however, it must be clarified that any claim for unlawful detention would have accrued the following day when Mr. Dobbie was released from jail.\n   <em>\n    Manuel v.

Therefore, the only outstanding dispute and portion of the report and recommendation to which the plaintiffs object is the magistrate judge's conclusion that a two-year, rather than a five-year, statute of limitations applies to count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Federal law does not set the limitations period in \u00a7 1983 actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

Here, the complaint does not allege, nor can it be plausibly inferred, that Mr. Dobbie made an inculpatory statement to police while in custody or that such a statement was used against him in court.

And while outside of the home (and before Mr. Dobbie was arrested), Officers Rybicki and Kile threatened to return with a drug detection dog and then Mr. Dobbie gave officers his marijuana.

The Court ADOPTS the report and recommendation [DE 43] in part, to the extent it is consistent with these holdings. Plaintiffs' motion for an entry of default judgment [DE 29] is DENIED. Plaintiffs are permitted until October 29, 2018 to file an amended complaint setting forth sufficient allegations of fact establishing a Fifth Amendment violation by the officers and/or a Sixth Amendment violation by the prosecutors not barred by absolute immunity, in which case the state claim for IIED could also be re-pled. If no amended complaint is timely filed, then\n   judgment will be entered and the case closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Plaintiffs assert that because the defendant prosecutors failed to file an answer by September 1, 2017, then default judgment should be entered against them [DE 29]. But plaintiffs are mistaken because defendants did not fail to appear and defend when they filed a motion to dismiss instead of a responsive pleading. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' motion for default judgment [DE 29] is DENIED at this time because defendants are actively defending themselves.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ.
