Plaintiff Lake Calumet Cluster Site Group (\"LCCS Group\") cross-moves for summary judgment only as to liability and only against Interplastic. (Dkt. 309.) For the reasons stated herein, all three Motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   LCCS Group is a legal entity comprising signatories to an agreement with the United States Environment Protection Agency (the \"EPA\"). (Pl.'s Resp. to Interplastic's Statement of Facts (\"Interplastic SOF\") \u00b6 1, Dkt. 313-1.) Said agreement obligates the LCCS Group to pay the remediation costs to clean up a Superfund site referred\n   to as the Lake Calumet Cluster Site (\"the Cluster Site\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.) Eager to reduce the apportionment of liability for that cleanup among its members, the LCCS Group seeks in this suit to add additional parties to its number, including Interplastic and Central Michigan. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., Dkt. 1.) In this vein, the LCCS Group seeks those parties' contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)-(4), and declaratory judgment as to the liability of those parties,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 482-507.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Interplastic Corporation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Interplastic's role in this case arose from a single delivery to the Cluster Site: an August 6, 1979, load of fifty drums of \"waste resin\" shipped from Interplastic's facility in Minneapolis. (Interplastic SOF \u00b6\u00b6 25-28.) The exact components of that resin are unknown, but the only resins Interplastic produced at that time were unsaturated polyester resins (\"UPRs\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) All of the UPRs Interplastic produced during the relevant time period contained anhydride and styrene as raw materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Some of those UPRs also included as raw materials one or more of the following: adipic acid, diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, fumaric acid, methyl methacrylate, and phthalic anhydride. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) In their raw forms, each of those materials appears on the EPA's \"List of Lists,\" a non-exclusive enumeration of substances deemed \"hazardous\" for the purposes of determining CERCLA liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   All UPRs are thermoset polymers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Thermoset polymers are designed to undergo a chemical reaction known as curing which transforms the polymers (presumably originally in a liquid state) into solids. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Interplastic maintains that once thermoset polymers solidify, they cannot break down into their constituent parts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff at once seems to admit to this fact (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (objecting not to the\n   <em>\n    content\n   </em>\n   of Interplastic's claim of irreversibility but merely to the claim's\n   <em>\n    materiality\n   </em>\n   ) ) and also dispute it (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n    \u00b6 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (contending that Interplastic's assertions as to the irreversibility of polymerization do not account for intervening forces which could effect a breakdown of the UPRs at the Cluster Site) ). To any extent, Interplastic also contends that all UPRs inevitably cure into solids; Plaintiff dispute this as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Interplastic sold the UPRs it produced in liquid form - the form usable to the customer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) To enhance the viability of its product, Interplastic added inhibitors to the UPRs it distributed to delay their solidification and extend their shelf life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But when Interplastic's manufacturing process went awry, resulting in unusable \"waste resin,\" Interplastic added a \"significantly lower\" volume of inhibitors to the batch, recognizing it was unsuitable for sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Interplastic treated its waste resin on-site in Minneapolis by placing it in a \"hot box\" and polymerizing it, causing the waste resin to solidify. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) On rare occasion, the waste resin would not fully cure even after \"hot box\" treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) In such instances, Interplastic contracted to have that resin transported for off-site disposal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The fifty barrels of waste resin delivered to the Cluster Site in 1979 appear to have been the object of such an arrangement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interplastic's Resp. to Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 15, Dkt. 316; LCCS Interplastic Site Records, Ex. D to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. 309-8.) Though the parties dispute whether Interplastic manufactured the waste resin contained in those barrels, the uncontested documentation indicates that the barrels originated with Interplastic. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 309-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Central Michigan Railway.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Central Michigan is the corporate successor to Lakeshore Terminal &amp; Pipeline Company, which Plaintiff contends arranged for a third-party entity called Inland Waters to deliver 2,800 gallons of flammable jet fuel waste from Lakeshore to the Cluster Site on June 24, 1982. (Pl.'s Resp. to Cent. Mich.'s Statement of Facts (\"Mich. SOF Resp.\") \u00b6 5, Dkt. 314-1; Cent. Mich.'s Reply to Pl.'s Statement of Additional Facts (\"Mich. SOF Reply\") \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, Dkt. 323-2.) The waste disposal manifest describing that shipment lists Lakeshore as the waste's \"generator.\" (Manifest, Ex. F to Cent. Mich.'s Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J., Dkt. 306-1.) Central Michigan concedes that it stored that jet fuel waste in a tank on its premises yet maintains it neither owned the fuel nor arranged for its disposal. (Mich. SOF Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.) Rather, according to Central Michigan, the U.S. Department of Defense owned that fuel, Central Michigan merely stored it on DOD's behalf, and it was DOD that contracted with Inland Waters for the fuel waste's removal to the Cluster Site.

It argues that because polymerized resin permanently binds together its composite elements, no intervening force of any strength or kind can release its hazardous components and so Plaintiff cannot establish the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   element of threatened release. This argument fails in two respects. First, it ignores the parties' dispute over whether UPRs remain permanently cured once polymerized. And second, the argument ignores that to win on summary judgment, Interplastic must prove not only the polymerization's irreversibility, but also that the particular waste resin Interplastic arranged for disposal was fully cured (and thus immutably non-hazardous) as opposed to partially cured (and thus potentially still\n   hazardous,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by \"containing\" a hazardous substance).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The record is unclear on this last point. These are the competing facts: Interplastic says that all UPRs eventually cure, but Interplastic also contends that whenever a batch of its UPR failed to \"fully cure,\" Interplastic contracted to have that waste \"\n   <em>\n    liquid\n   </em>\n   resin\" disposed of. (Interplastic SOF \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20.) Interplastic also contends that because waste resin contains significantly less inhibitor volume than consumer-worthy resin, waste resin \"could cure as quickly as a matter of hours, and typically within several days.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) This is puzzling. If waste, liquid resin self-hardens within a matter of days, why would Interplastic go to the trouble of arranging for its off-site disposal?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This puzzle aside, two questions of disputed, material fact preclude summary judgment to either party: (1) whether fully-cured UPRs are unalterably polymerized, even upon the introduction of an intervening force, and (2) if so, whether Interplastic arranged for the disposal of fully-cured, as opposed to partially-cured, resins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    B.F.

Central Michigan points to a few exhibits in support of that contention, but none is very persuasive. Central Michigan contends that a June 30, 1982, letter from Lakeshore's manager to DOD showcases Lakeshore taking responsibility for the fuel waste disposal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. E, Dkt. 306-1.) This is one reasonable reading of the letter. Another is that as owner of the tanks, Lakeshore simply used this letter to report back to DOD concerning the work DOD-retained contractors completed on-site. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140596\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/433/#p448\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (recounting simply that the fuel waste \"was taken to a disposal site in Chicago\").) The other set of exhibits are internal DOD memoranda from 1981 in which DOD recites the then-newly unveiled EPA regulations concerning the disposal of the type of waste held in Central Michigan's tanks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. C-D, Dkt. 306-1.) Central Michigan argues that these memos are proof of DOD's responsibility not simply for some unrelated wastes in its control but rather specifically for the fuel waste initially held by Central Michigan. This conjecture is a leap too far; it is not supported by the memos themselves nor by any supporting documentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Clearly,\n   <em>\n    someone\n   </em>\n   arranged for Inland Water to dispose of the fuel waste at the Cluster Site. It might have been DOD; it might have been Central Michigan (as Lakeshore). But either is possible from the present record. Plaintiff suggests that the fuel-storage agreement between DOD and Lakeshore might elucidate those parties' responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis disposal. But that agreement, if one exists, is not before the Court now. On this record, a reasonable jury could conclude that either Lakeshore or DOD arranged for the waste disposal, so summary judgment is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Interplastic's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 310), Central Michigan's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 305), and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 309) are all denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
