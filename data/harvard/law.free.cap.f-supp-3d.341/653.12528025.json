(\"Mid South\") seeking to correct Mid South's allegedly unlawful employment practices on the basis of disability and to provide appropriate relief to Intervenor Plaintiff Jeffrey Wyant (\"Wyant\"), who was allegedly adversely affected by such practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is a Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 25] filed by Mid South. The EEOC filed an Opposition [Doc. No. 30], in which Wyant joins [Doc. No. 31]. Mid South filed a reply memorandum [Doc. No. 32]. For the following reasons, the Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 2014, Wyant was hired as a maintenance technician by Mid South, a plastics manufacturer that specializes in custom process films for individual packaging. After Wyant accepted the offer of employment, he completed a \"Post Offer Medical History Questionnaire,\" disclosing that he had a prior shoulder injury, which included a rotator cuff injury, leaving him with an eleven percent (11%) impairment in his range of motion and lifting overhead. Other than this shoulder injury, Wyant did not disclose any other impairments or conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Wyant completed his ninety (90) day probationary period without any issue, was told he was making adequate progress, and was given a pay increase. According to Wyant's supervisor, Charles Landry (\"Landry\"), Wyant's performance began to fall below Landry's expectations soon thereafter, and Landry became concerned with Wyant's ability to work safely in the plant. Landry asserts he received multiple complaints from other employees regarding Wyant showing up to work with a strong smell of alcohol emitting from his body. On another occasion, Wyant allegedly tried to delegate work which required lock-out tag-out training to an employee\n   who did not have the requisite training. As a result, Landry states that he verbally warned Wyant and explained the dangers he could have caused\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In late June 2015, Wyant began having breathing problems. His primary care doctor gave him a pulmonary function test and referred him to a lung specialist. In mid-July 2015, the lung specialist determined that Wyant has significantly reduced breathing capacity and an esophagus disease which occurred due to breathing asbestos in a previous job. In addition, the lung x-ray indicated that Wyant had undiagnosed Tuberculosis (TB) which apparently occurred as a child or young man. The TB crystalized and became dormant. As a result of these findings, Wyant was referred to a cardiologist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early August 2015, the cardiologist determined that Wyant needed a heart catheter and recommended that he see a gastroenterologist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In mid-August 2015, Wyant met with Lisa Shore (\"Shore\"), Human Resources Manager for Mid South, and told her about his TB, lung, heart, and esophagus conditions, and that he was having a heart catheterization procedure done on August 18, 2015. On August 13, 2015, Shore emailed Landry with concerns about Wyant's health affecting his continued employment. Shore stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Hey, I wanted to let you know that Jeff stopped me on the way back over and he wanted to talk about a couple of things. First, he wanted to know how many points he has left, because he is having a heart Cath next week and the doctor told him he will need to be off a couple of days for that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   He also stated that his doctor says he doesn't need to be working in this environment with all the health problems he has. He said the doctor told him he should get on disability. That automatically raised a red flag for me. He said his health issues stem from having TB as a child and from working around asbestos and things like that at the school board. I know we have had safety and health studies done on the plant and we are good, but this really bothers me. Just wanted to let you know what was going on since we just talked about him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [Doc. No. 25-4, p. 143].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Wyant underwent the heart catheterization procedure on August 18, 2015, and was able to return to work on August 21, 2015, with a release from his doctor to work regular duty with no restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In mid-September 2015, Wyant's lungs became irritated by plastics dust in the plant when the machine he was working on overheated, causing him to cough repeatedly and creating some breathing difficulties. Wyant states that he used his inhaler and that, after ten (10) minutes, he was fully recovered. Wyant avers that the next morning Landry questioned him about the incident. Wyant explained that he began to cough when his lungs got irritated by the machine when it overheated, but once he used his inhaler he was okay. Landry does not recall speaking to Wyant about the coughing incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Shortly afterwards, Wyant was scheduled to receive his annual review, which would have given him a raise, ten (10) more sick days per year, and forty (40) hours paid vacation per annum. The EEOC contends that, rather than allowing Wyant to vest in these benefits, Landry preemptively terminated him - close on the heels of the coughing incident. In an email dated September 21, 2015, Landry told Shore that he was discharging Wyant because he was \"not qualified to be a maintenance technician.\" [Doc. No. 25-4, p. 158]. Wyant avers that Landry told him he was discharged because he had no \"long term commitment to the company\" and\n   because upper management wanted him gone. [Doc. No. 30-2, p. 96].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Wyant filed a charge with the EEOC. In his charge, Wyant alleges that Mid South discharged him because it perceived him as disabled. Specifically, he stated he was discharged shortly after telling Mid South he had dormant TB from childhood, as well as other breathing issues due to working with asbestos in the past, and after having a serious coughing attack at work. Further, Wyant alleges that Landry made negative disability-related comments to him, prior to his termination, including \"... hate to say this but we are going to have to let you go ... you are riding the clock waiting until you get your disability because of your disability and our insurance ... having all of these sick people makes our insurance liability and premiums higher ... didn't know you had all these health problems ... why didn't you go to the doctor before you came to us ... was it because of our insurance?\" [Doc. No. 30-2, pp. 93-96]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The EEOC issued a Letter of Determination finding that Mid South discharged Wyant in violation of the ADA because of his medical impairment and the insurance costs associated with his treatment. When attempts to resolve the matter informally failed, the EEOC instituted the present suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 26, 2017, the EEOC filed a Complaint in this Court alleging that Wyant, a qualified individual with a disability under Sections 3 and 101(8) of the ADA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 12111(8), was discharged from employment because he has a lung impairment (50% lung capacity) that substantially limits the major life activity of breathing and/or because Wyant has a record of such impairment and/or because Mid South regarded Wyant as having an actual or perceived impairment. The EEOC filed an Amended Complaint on September 28, 2017. On March 27, 2018, with leave of court, Wyant intervened in the suit and reiterates EEOC's allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 7, 2018, Mid South filed the instant motion for summary judgment. Mid South contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that Wyant did not suffer from a disability during the time that he was employed with Mid South; that Wyant is not a \"qualified individual\" under the ADA because he cannot perform the \"essential functions\" of a maintenance technician; and that, regardless of any alleged disability, Mid South had legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 1, 2018, the EEOC filed an opposition memorandum. The EEOC asserts that Mid South misrepresented the relevant facts and applicable law in its Motion for Summary Judgment. Additionally, the EEOC contends the motion is premature because the parties are still engaged in discovery with the deposition of two of Wyant's pulmonary doctors scheduled for November. The EEOC further contends there are genuine issues of material facts in dispute. Finally, the EEOC argues the motion is meritless because much of its arguments is based on pre-ADA amendments law, whereas this is a suit governed by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (\"ADAAA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 12, 2018, Mid South filed a reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Motion is fully briefed, and the Court is prepared to rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Shore stated in her email to Wyant's supervisor Landry that she was concerned about Wyant's \"disability.\" At the time of his termination, according to Wyant, Landry said he had to terminate Wyant's employment because management was concerned that Wyant would be seeking long term\n   <strong>\n    disability\n   </strong>\n   benefits - an expense Mid South did not want to incur. The EEOC asserts this direct evidence shows, without need of inference, that Wyant was discharged on the basis of a disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court finds the EEOC has raised a genuine issue of material fact which precludes\n   summary judgment. Although the email from Shore to Landry may not constitute direct evidence, the statements that Landry allegedly made to Wyant when firing him, if true, are direct evidence of discrimination. When a supervisor, in the context of firing an employee, or immediately prior to that event, says that \" we are going to have to let you go\" because \"of your disability and our insurance\", as well as other statements, the jury can infer an intent to discriminate by Mid South. Therefore, on this basis alone, Mid South's Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Indirect Evidence of Discrimination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Absent direct evidence of discrimination, a plaintiff must make a prima facie case of discrimination by showing he (1) has a disability, or was regarded as disabled, or has a record of a disability; (2) was qualified for the job; and (3) he was subjected to an adverse employment decision on account of his disability.\n   <em>\n    Cannon v.

Mid South further contends that Wyant never informed Shore or anyone else with Mid South of his alleged disability, that the only medical information that he provided Mid South consisted of medical releases from three different health care providers indicating that he was released to return to work full duty with no restrictions, and that Wyant indicated in his EEOC intake questionnaire that his alleged breathing impairment did not limit him from working. Finally, Mid South asserts that in their conversation in August 2015, Shore was under the impression that Wyant was referring to his health problems associated with his heart catheterization, and not a problem with his breathing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   However, at this stage, the Court may rely on Wyant's own statement that his lungs are functioning at a significantly low capacity of 50%, as compared to a non-disabled person.

Mid South further contends that Wyant has no evidence to support his claim that Mid South terminated him because he allegedly told Shore that he has a lung impairment that substantially limits the major life activity of breathing. It argues, instead, that Shore was under the impression that Wyant's heart catheterization procedure was due to his claims to her of a childhood TB diagnosis and his past exposure to asbestos. It contends Wyant never made a request or complaint to anyone regarding his inability to breathe, and never informed anyone at Mid South that he had a breathing impairment prior to his termination. Mid South asserts that the first word it received of any breathing difficulty is the EEOC's findings rendered on June 16, 2017, almost two years after he was terminated. Mid South concludes that because there is no evidence to support Wyant's allegations that he informed Mid South of his breathing impairment, he cannot establish that he was discriminated against because Mid South \"regarded\" him as disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The EEOC responds that the evidence shows that Mid South regarded Wyant as disabled and that Mid South acted on fears, prejudices and biases in its treatment towards Wyant. The EEOC contends that Landry's alleged remarks to Wyant when firing him, along with Shore's email evidencing concerns with Wyant's disability shows that the reason for discharge was Wyant's medical condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court finds there are genuine issues of material fact which preclude summary judgment in Mid South's favor on the \"regarded as\" prong. The temporal proximity of Mid South's actions, in terminating Wyant within a day after having a coughing spell at work, which Wyants alleges was witnessed by a supervisor, and within weeks of his informing them he had dormant TB and other health issues due to exposure to asbestos, supports the view that Mid South regarded Wyant as disabled within the meaning of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Record of Disability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mid South moves for summary judgment on the basis that there is no evidence of a record of Wyant's alleged disability. Mid South asserts that, although Wyant alleges that he informed Lisa Shore that he has a 50% breathing capacity in his lungs and an esophagus disease during their meeting on August 13, 2015, there is no evidence of Mr. Wyant having a \"record of\" impairment, and, instead, there are merely allegations that are not documented in either party's Rule 26 disclosures. Mid South states the only records that Wyant provided it indicated that he was\n   released to return to work with no restrictions, and in fact, Wyant provided Mid South with a release to work with no restrictions on August 21, 2015, which was after his meeting with Lisa Shore. Because there is no evidence of a \"record of\" impairment, Mid South submits Wyant will not be able to satisfy his burden under a \"record of disability\" claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The EEOC responds that Wyant's records show he was treated by several medical doctors while working with Mid South who noted the extent of his medical health and his permanent limitations. Also, Wyant informed Shore of the medical results, particularly relative to the TB and asbestos exposure, which permanently reduced his lung capacity. Wyant's medical test and diagnoses records caused Shore to question his continued employment because of his disability. Shore then informed Landry of Wyant's disability. Landry discussed the matter with upper management and Landry then terminated Wyant - allegedly for poor performance - but told Wyant it was because management was concerned with his disability and its associated medical costs. The EEOC asserts, therefore, Wyant has a record of a disability of which the Defendant was well aware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court finds there are genuine issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment in Mid South's favor on the \"record of disability\" prong. Wyant was treated by several doctors, including a cardiologist. Shore discussed Wyant's medical condition and disability in her August 13, 2015, email to Landry, which indicates Mid South was aware of Wyant's existing health problems and medical treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
