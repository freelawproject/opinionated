New York District Council of Carpenters Pension Fund</em>, 16-cv-3551 (LAP), that was consolidated with the Funds' action pursuant to a Court order dated July 25, 2016. (<em>See</em> Order dated July 25, 2016, <em>Greaney v. New York District Council of Carpenters Pension Fund</em>, 16-CV-3551 (LAP) (ECF No. 10) ). The Greaneys claim that the Funds failed to pay John Greaney his pension or to disburse his annuity to him in a lump sum. The Greaneys also seek a determination that Imelda Greaney has a valid interest in Greaney's annuity and pension. (R &amp; R 1-2.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p-18\">a. <em>Forde's Objections</em></p>\n\n<p id=\"p-20\">As Magistrate Judge Gorenstein noted in observing the oddity of Greaney's attorney's filing on behalf of Forde, however, \"many of the issues applicable to Greaney apply equally to Forde.\" Forde joined in Greaney's motions and, as a matter of law, Forde and Greaney are jointly and severally liable. (Forde Obj. \u00b6 2.) Accordingly, to the extent the R &amp; R leaves open whether its conclusions apply equally to Forde and Greaney, the Court clarifies that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"p-21\">b. <em>Greaney's Objections</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<opinion type=\"majority\"><p id=\"p-7\"><em>Order Adopting Report and Recommendation</em></p><p id=\"p-8\">Loretta A.

Gorenstein's Report and Recommendation dated June 1, 2018, (Report and Recommendation dated June 1, 2018 (\"R &amp; R\") (ECF No. 268) ). For the reasons that follow, the Court adopts the findings of the R &amp; R in full, subject to the single modification that the Funds are entitled to offset both Greaney <em>and Forde's</em> pension and annuity benefits. The Court also makes one minor modification to the R &amp; R's factual summary as set out below.</p><p id=\"p-9\">I. <em>Background</em></p><p id=\"p-10\">Pension and annuity funds (collectively, the \"Funds\") have brought this case under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961</extracted-citation> - 68, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001</extracted-citation> - 1461. The Funds seek damages against certain former trustees for losses caused by the trustees' corrupt conduct. (R &amp; R 1.) Presently before the Court is the Funds' motion for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 against former trustees and defendants Michael Forde and John Greaney. Forde and Greaney are two of three remaining defendants in this case who have not been dismissed or defaulted.</p><p id=\"p-12\">a. <em>The Instant Motion</em></p><p id=\"p-13\">Both the Funds and Defendants have cross-moved for summary judgment on their claims and for damages. On July 18, 2017, the Court referred the motions to Magistrate Judge Gorenstein for a report and recommendation. In the R &amp; R, Judge Gorenstein recommends granting the Funds' partial summary judgment on (1) Forde and Greaney's liability for violating RICO and ERISA; (2) compensatory damages under both RICO (before trebling) and ERISA as to Greaney in the amount of $4,973,259.92, and as to Forde in the amount of $4,973,259.92; (3) their ability to bring further claims for damages that are not limited by the restitution orders or the settlement agreement with On Par; (4) the issue of calculation of treble damages under RICO; (5) their ability to offset any damages against Greaney's pension and annuity payments. (R &amp; R 56.) The R &amp; R also recommends that both sides be denied summary judgment on the issue of whether Imelda Greaney is entitled to benefits from the Fund.

As the R &amp; R notes, Forde never filed an opposition to the Funds' motion for summary judgment or his own motion. (R &amp; R 11.) In response to the R &amp; R, however, Forde's attorney, Dino J. Lombardi of Lombardi &amp; Solerno PLLC, filed objections and argued that Forde \"joined in the opposition to the Funds' summary judgment motion and the affirmative summary judgment motion submitted by co-counsel, Victoria Quesada, Esq., on behalf of John Greaney.\" (Forde Obj. \u00b6 1.) Counsel for Forde concedes that he should have communicated to the Court in some other manner that Forde did join in Greaney's motions.</p><p id=\"p-22\">Paragraph 2(C) of the Court's Individual Rules provides that memoranda of law in <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"337\" href=\"#p337\" id=\"p337\">*337</a>support of or in opposition to motions shall not exceed 20 pages. Paragraph 2(C) also specifically identifies \"objections to [a] Magistrate Judge's ruling\" as an example of a \"motion.\" The Greaneys' 66 pages of objections to the R &amp; R greatly exceed this page limit. Represented by experienced counsel, Victoria Quesada of Quesada &amp; Moore, LLP, this noncompliance reflects a blatant disregard for the Court's rules as well as its time and resources. The Greaneys' counsel also flouted this rule when filing initial motion for summary judgment, which totaled 160 pages of substantive legal argument. Counsel for the Greaneys did not request an expansion of the Court's page limit prior to filing either the Greaneys' initial motion for summary judgment or their objections to the R &amp; R. Counsel for Forde also did not request an expansion of the Court's page limit prior to Greaney filing his objections, a relevant aside given that Forde claims to join in Greaney's objections to the R &amp; R.</p><p id=\"p-23\">In reviewing the objections filed by Greaney's counsel and the Greaney's initial summary judgment motion, the level of overlap between the documents is noteworthy. It appears that the Greaneys either copy-and-pasted large sections of arguments already advanced in their initial motion for summary judgment into their objections or reiterated, in substance, arguments they had already made.</p><p id=\"p-24\">By definition, objections that are 46 pages over the allowable page limit are not \"specific.\" Even if they were, however, the Greaneys' objections are a rehash of arguments from their initial motion for summary judgment that Magistrate Judge Gorenstein already reviewed and considered in the thorough and detailed R &amp; R. For these reasons, the Greaneys' objections do not warrant <em>de novo</em> review. <em>See</em> <em>Pullman v. Alpha Media Publishing, Inc.</em>, No. 12 Civ. 1924(PAC) (SN), <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205042250\">2014 WL 5042250</extracted-citation>, *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2014).</p><p id=\"p-25\">Having undertaken a full and thorough review of the R &amp; R, the Court finds no clear error and adopts Magistrate Judge Gorenstein's R &amp; R in full, with the exception that the R &amp; R be modified to reflect that the Funds are granted partial summary judgment on their ability to offset any damages against Greaney <em>and Forde's</em> pension and annuity payments. The Court agrees that it appears Magistrate Judge Gorenstein unintentionally omitted Forde from this conclusion, and therefore makes this single modification for the same reasons as articulated with respect to Greaney.</p><p id=\"p-26\">Though the clear error standard of review is appropriate for evaluating the R &amp; R in this case, the Court addresses two objections raised in the Greaneys' objections below for the sake of clarity and applies the <em>de novo</em> standard of review.</p><p id=\"p-27\">i. <em>Evidentiary Issues Regarding Trial on Turbo and On Par</em></p><p id=\"p-28\">Greaney and Forde raise various evidentiary arguments regarding the issue of further damages on the Turbo and On Par transactions to be determined at trial. Those issues relate to the admissibility of certain evidence at trial and are thus improperly raised in a motion for summary judgment. These arguments are premature and can be properly addressed in a future motion in limine. Accordingly, the Court does not address the merits of these evidentiary issues and denies the motions without prejudice to renewal at trial.</p><p id=\"p-29\">ii. <em>Spousal Offset</em></p><p id=\"p-30\">The parties dispute whether any offset by the Funds of Forde and Greaney's pension may be applied to benefits due to Greaney's wife, Imelda Greaney. In their motions, the Funds asserted that Mrs. Greaney filed a form waiving her right to <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"338\" href=\"#p338\" id=\"p338\">*338</a>any benefits on April 25, 2015, with the desired outcome of expediting Greaney's annuity payments. Conversely, Mrs. Greaney alleges in her Complaint that she revoked this waiver when she sent a letter to the Plan Administrator stating that she intended to revoke any prior waiver. The parties dispute whether Mrs. Greaney made this alleged revocation within the period applicable to an election to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form benefit under ERISA. <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201055\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055</extracted-citation>(c)(7)(A). In the R &amp; R, Magistrate Judge Gorenstein denied summary judgment to both parties on this issue because \"neither side ha[d] submitted evidence\" on this \"critical issue.\" (R &amp; R 55.)</p><p id=\"p-31\">The Greaneys' objections to the R &amp; R attached two documents - Mr. Greaney's pension application dated September 2, 2014 (ECF No. 270-1), and Mr. Greaney's letter dated June 5, 2018 to the Annuity Fund, (ECF No. 270-2). In their objections, the Greaneys explain that these two documents - which go to the heart of the timing of Mrs. Greaney's alleged revocation - were \"inadvertently omitted from the Record.\" (Obj. 12.)</p><p id=\"p-32\">\"In objecting to a magistrate's report before the district court, a party has 'no right to present further testimony when it offers no compelling justification for not offering the testimony at the hearing before the magistrate.' \" <em>Paddington Partners v.

Mar. 27, 2012) (citation omitted).</p><p id=\"p-33\">Here, the Greaneys present no \"compelling justification\" for their omission of documents that were critical to Magistrate Judge Gorenstein's assessment of whether the parties were entitled to summary judgment on this issue. Therefore, the Court declines to address the newly-submitted evidence as part of the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and denies summary judgment on this issue. <em>Paddington</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530675\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/34/1132/#p1137\">34 F.3d at 1138</extracted-citation> (concluding that district judge did not abuse her discretion in refusing to consider new evidence submitted with party's objections to magistrate judge's report and recommendation).
