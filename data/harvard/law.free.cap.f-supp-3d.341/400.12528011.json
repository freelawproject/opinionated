But a non-citizen spouse like Mr. Martinez, who has been ordered removed, may not apply domestically; rather, he must leave the United States to apply for an immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate abroad. Further, his prior order of removal triggers various provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , that bar him from reentering the U.S. for up to 10 years even with a visa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9)(A); (a)(9)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2013, the Department of Homeland Security promulgated regulations that allow noncitizen spouses of U.S. citizens with no criminal history who have been present in the U.S. without authorization to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility for unlawful presence (a \"provisional waiver\"). The provisional waiver allows them to adjust their respective immigration status and obtain immigrant visas without a prolonged period of separation from their\n   families-that is, a waiver of the multiple-year bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility for Certain Immediate Relatives\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Final Rule\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%20535\">\n    78 Fed.

The applicant and beneficiary are then scheduled for an interview with USCIS to determine the validity of that relationship. Once the Form I-130 is approved, the applicant files a Permission to Reapply for Admission to the United States form (\"Form I-212\") and then for a provisional unlawful presence waiver (\"Form I-601A\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Based upon these regulations, Mr. and Ms. Martinez began the process of applying for a provisional waiver in 2016.

As part of this process, Mr. and Ms. Martinez, together with their attorney, appeared for an interview with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") on their I-130 application on April 27, 2018 to confirm the bona fides of their marriage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. At the conclusion of the interview, and despite DHS's regulations concerning the provisional waiver process, two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") agents entered the interview room and abruptly arrested Mr. Martinez, purportedly based on a \"new policy\" of detaining any individual with an outstanding order of removal at an interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.

Less than one week later, USCIS approved the Martinezes' I-130 application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.

ECF Nos. 1, 2. That same day, the Court stayed Mr. Martinez's removal pending further order of the Court. ECF No. 6. On August 3, 3018, the Court entered an Order finding that the government's actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and Mr. Martinez's due process rights, and ordered him released so that he could complete the waiver process. ECF No. 25. This Opinion and Order supplements and amends the Court's August 3, 2018 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Martinez sought an order releasing him from custody and enjoining Respondent-Defendants Kristjen Nielsen, Thomas Homan, Thomas Decker, and Ronald Edwards\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   from removing him until he exhausts his right to complete the process of obtaining a provisional unlawful presence waiver. He argues that the government's attempt to detain and deport him as he engaged in a step of the provisional waiver process violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment and the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Respondent-Defendants contend that the Court lacks jurisdiction to review Mr. Martinez's claims and that, even if it did, the Court cannot grant Mr. Martinez relief because he has no right to engage in the provisional waiver process.

But that is not what happened. ICE agents did not track down Mr. Martinez because of his final order of removal. Instead they waited until he appeared for an interview pursuant to DHS regulations that permit aliens\n   <em>\n    in exactly Mr. Martinez's position\n   </em>\n   to gain legal status, and attempted to frustrate those regulations by detaining Mr. Martinez without warning or explanation. ICE arrested Mr. Martinez because he presented himself for an I-130 interview and, as such, exceeded its legal authority when it chose to arrest him after he had begun a lawful process but before it was completed. The Honorable Paul Crotty in the Southern District of New York recently considered similar claims brought by a petitioner seeking to complete the provisional waiver process prior to his removal and found that Petitioner's claims were not barred by \u00a7 1252(g) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Petitioner here does not challenge ICE's prosecutorial discretion.
