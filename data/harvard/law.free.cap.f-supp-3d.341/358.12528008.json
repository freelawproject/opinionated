Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Barrick Gold and the Veladero Mine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Barrick Gold Corporation, based in Toronto, is the largest gold mining company in the world. AC \u00b6 23. Its common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker ABX.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   AC \u00b6 23. As part of its gold mining business, Barrick operates a number of mines, including the Veladero mine in San Juan province, Argentina. AC \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31. Four Barrick employees are of particular relevance here and are named as individual defendants: (1) Kelvin Dushnisky, Barrick's President and Director during the Class Period; (2) Catherine Raw, Barrick's CFO and Executive Vice President during the Class Period; (3) Richard Williams, Barrick's COO during the Class Period, and (4) Jorge Palmes, the Barrick Executive General Manager overseeing the Veladero mine. AC \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Veladero mine was opened in 2005 and is located on the Argentine side of the Andes Mountains at an elevation of 4,000 to 4,850 meters above sea level (approximately 13,000 to 16,000 feet). AC \u00b6 31. Veladero is a strip mine, at which gold is extracted through the following process: First, ore is extracted from an open pit. AC \u00b6 31. Second, the ore is crushed and transported by conveyor to a \"leach pad.\" AC \u00b6 32. Third, gold is \"leached,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , extracted, from the ore in the leach pad area through a series of chemical processes known as gold cyanidation, where a cyanide-based solution is poured over the crushed ore in order to separate the gold from other materials. AC \u00b6 32. Finally, the gold is then formed into semi-pure alloy bars, also known as dor\u00e9 bars, which are then transported to a refinery for further processing. AC \u00b6 32. Barrick estimated that as of December 31, 2016, the Veladero mine contained 3.3 million ounces of \"measured and indicated gold resources\" and 6.7 million ounces in \"proven and provable gold reserves.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to a confidential witness CW1, who worked for Barrick between February 2001 and February 2016 and was the Process Chief at Veladero in September 2015, Barrick and the Veladero mine had a culture of focusing on and maintaining production targets. AC \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. CW1 was required to report daily production numbers to corporate headquarters in Toronto (and Dushnisky in particular) and would be required to explain what remedial steps were being taken when production was below target. AC \u00b6\u00b6 45, 84. When accidents and incidents occurred, Barrick focused on maintaining production and \"would just push employees to try and recuperate the lost production.\" AC \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Prior Incidents at Veladero\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Veladero experienced two incidents involving spills of cyanide solution in September 2015 and September 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   September 13, 2015, a valve on a pipeline in the leach pad failed, resulting in the spill of solution from the leach pad. AC \u00b6 34. CW1, the Veladero process chief at the time, AC \u00b6 35, recalled the incident as occurring in an expansion area of the mine, AC \u00b6 37. According to CW1, the \"monitoring instruments at the mine were not precise enough to detect the extra flow of cyanide solution that the broken valve allowed into the heap leach,\" which allowed the solution to accumulate and then overflow. AC \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly thereafter, a Barrick employee at Veladero informed local residents of the spill through a Whatsapp message, stating that in part that \"Today there was a spill of 15,000 liters of cyanide and mercury in Veladero directly into the river\" and instructing message recipients to \"not use water from the tap to drink, cook, etc.\" AC \u00b6 38. Barrick, by contrast, issued a statement the next day, September 14, characterizing the spill as a small leak and denying that solution had contaminated the river or local water supplies. AC \u00b6 39. The San Juan provincial government weighed in the next day, September 15, warning residents to \"avoid and/or limit consumption of water\" from the river in question. AC \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   One day later (3 days after the spill), September 16, Barrick acknowledged that cyanide solution had spilled into the Las Taguas River near Veladero. AC \u00b6 41. Barrick technicians estimated that 224,000 liters of cyanide solution were spilled in the incident, but Barrick again denied any impact on the health of local residents. AC \u00b6 41. An environmental emergency was declared in the local town of Jachal, and Judge Pablo Ortija of the Judicial Court of Jachal ordered a five-day suspension of gold leaching at Veladero. AC \u00b6 41. Barrick acknowledged one week later, on September 23, that the magnitude of the incident was greater than previously disclosed and that one million liters of solution had spilled into the Potrerillos River. AC \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 25, 2015, 12 days after the spill and 9 days after the suspension of production, Barrick announced that production restrictions imposed by the Argentine authorities had been lifted and that it expected no material impact on Veladero's 2015 production guidance. AC \u00b6 44; Fernandez Johnson Decl. ex 1. CW1 explained, however, that restrictions on the introduction of additional cyanide reduces the efficiency of the leaching process and reduces production, and estimated that production was reduced by 10% on days in which Barrick was restricted from adding cyanide. AC \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 8, 2016, approximately one year after the September 2015 spill, Barrick experienced another spill of cyanide solution at Veladero. AC \u00b6 47. Barrick disclosed the incident to provincial authorities four days later, on September 12, and issued a public statement on September 14. AC \u00b6\u00b6 48, 51. Barrick stated that the incident stemmed from the tailings pond and was \"caused by a break in an 18? pipeline containing solution\" that \"occurred after the pipe was struck by a chunk of ice.\" AC \u00b6 48. Barrick's statement reassured that cyanide solution did not contaminate local water sources and stated that there was no impact on mining activity. AC \u00b6 48. The governor of San Juan province, however, suspended operations at the mine that day. AC \u00b6 48.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Production\n   did not resume until October 4, 2016 -- 26 days after the initial spill and 20 days after production had been suspended. AC \u00b6 48. Barrick announced the resumption of production that day, and noted in its press release that \"[t]he company has completed a series of remedial works required by provincial authorities designed to prevent such an incident from reoccurring, including increasing the height of the perimeter berms that surround the leach pad.\" Fernandez Johnson Decl. ex. 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The company also reaffirmed its previously announced production guidance for 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3512868\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/87/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Events During the Class Period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Class Period begins on February 16, 2017, when Barrick held a conference call to discuss its results for the fourth quarter of 2016. AC \u00b6 52; Fernandez Johnson Decl. ex. 6. After discussion by senior management (including defendants Dushnisky, Williams, and Raw,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fernandez Johnson Decl. ex. 6 at 5-13), six location-specific General Managers discussed results for their particular sites. These managers included defendant Palmes, who stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   At Veladero, 2016 was a very challenging year. In Q2, severe winter-related [sic] resulted in 42 days of lost production. In Q3, production was impacted by the two weeks suspension of an operation due to environmental incident quickly followed by a recovery action plan in Q4. We previously completed a series of remedial works to prevent such an incident from occurring again, including the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles for remote sensing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Looking forward, our digital transformation initiative at the Barrick's first integrated Remote Operations Centre will help us drive high returns. For 2017, we expect increased production of 770,000 ounces to 830,000 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $840 per ounce to $940 per ounce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Fernandez Johnson Decl. ex. 6 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Approximately six weeks later, at approximately 5:00 p.m. on March 28, 2017, Veladero experienced a leak of cyanide solution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 53, 70; Letter from Kim E. Miller to the Court, Aug. 27, 2018, ECF No. 59. Barrick issued a press release confirming the leak on March 29, which stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   SAN JUAN, Argentina - Barrick confirms that on the evening of March 28, the monitoring system at Veladero detected a rupture on a pipe carrying gold-bearing solution on the leach pad.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Procedures were immediately activated to contain and mitigate the situation, and the Company quickly corrected the issue. At the same time, the Company shared this information with San Juan provincial authorities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   All solution was contained within the operating facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   There was no impact to people or the environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Letter from Kim E. Miller to the Court ex. A, Aug. 27, 2018, ECF No. 59-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The next day, March 30, Barrick issued a second press release discussing the March 28 incident. AC \u00b6 56; Fernandez Johnson Decl. ex. 8. This press release,\n   titled \"Barrick Reports Restrictions at Veladero Mine Heap Leach Facility\" stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Barrick Gold Corporation ... today reported that the Government of San Juan province, Argentina, has temporarily restricted the addition of cyanide to the Veladero mine's heap leach facility pending the verification that remedial works have been completed. The Company is working to complete this remediation as quickly as possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   On the evening of March 28, the monitoring system at Veladero detected a rupture of a pipe carrying gold-bearing solution on the leach pad. All solution was contained within the operating site; no solution reached any diversion channels or watercourses. The Company promptly notified San Juan provincial authorities, who inspected the site on March 29.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The safety of people and the environment remains Barrick's top priority.

AC \u00b6\u00b6 71, 88. We take judicial notice of the following changes of Barrick's stock prices:\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 27, Barrick opened at $19.62 and closed at $19.60. On March 28, Barrick opened at $19.52 and closed at $19.08. On March 29, Barrick opened at $19.00 and closed at $19.19. On March 30, Barrick opened at $19.06 and closed at $18.84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On April 6 -- one week later -- Barrick announced via press release that Shandong Gold Mining Co. would acquire a 50% interest in Veladero in exchange for $960 million. AC \u00b6 58; Fernandez Johnson Decl. ex. 9. This press release described the Veladero mine as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The Veladero mine is located in the San Juan province of Argentina, on the highly prospective El Indo Belt, approximately 10 kilometers away from Barrick's Pascua-Lama project. Veladero is located at elevations of between 4,000-4,850 meters above sea level, approximately 375 kilometers northwest of the city of San Juan. As of December 31, 2016, the mine had proven and probable gold reserves of 6.7 million ounces, and measured and indicated gold resources of 3.3 million ounces.\n   <em>\n    The mine is expected to produce 770,000-830,000 ounces of gold in 2017, at a cost of sales of $750-$800 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs of $840-$940 per ounce.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Fernandez Johnson Decl. ex. 9 at 3 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). This press release contained cautionary language identical to the language contained in the March 30 press release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That same day, Barrick executives met with Argentine officials, who informed Barrick that its operations in the country were in jeopardy and that \"the company's concession to operate the mine would have been at risk if Barrick Gold had not agreed to an external audit.\" AC \u00b6 57. Barrick and Shandong \"\n   <em>\n    would be\n   </em>\n   submitting a plan to the government of San Juan province to make $500 million worth of necessary upgrades on the mine to prevent future spills.\" AC \u00b6 58 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On April 24, 2017 -- the end of the Class Period and 27 days after the March 28 leak -- Barrick announced its First Quarter 2017 operating results. AC \u00b6\u00b6 59, 74; Fernandez Johnson Decl. ex. 10. The announcement provided further details about the situation at Veladero:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   On March 28, a coupling on a pipe carrying gold-bearing solution at the Veladero mine heap leach facility failed. Solution released from the rupture was contained within the operating site and did not result in any impact to the environment or people. The Company promptly notified San Juan provincial authorities, who inspected the site on March 29. On March 30, the Government of San Juan province temporarily restricted the addition of cyanide to the Veladero mine's heap leach facility, pending the completion of works to strengthen and improve the mine's operating systems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Barrick presented its proposed work plan to San Juan provincial authorities on April 21, following extensive consultation with both federal and provincial officials and regulators. The provincial government has indicated it will take approximately two weeks to review the Company's proposals, a process that will also include federal authorities, including the national Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. Initial work on the proposed modifications to the heap leach facility has already begun, concurrent with the review by provincial and federal authorities. Our updated guidance assumes a resumption of normal leaching activities at the mine in June, subject to approval by the Government of San Juan province, the lifting of operating restrictions by the San Juan provincial court, and the resolution of regulatory and legal matters by the federal and provincial courts (for more information about these matters, please see Note 17 \"Contingencies\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   of Barrick's first quarter financial statements and the notes thereto). This assumption is based on our assessment of the time required to complete the proposed modifications to the leach pad. The timing of approval for the resumption of leaching activities will depend on the actual progress of work, any potential new requirements, and a final evaluation of the completed modifications by provincial authorities. In parallel with the submission of a new technical plan for the operation, Barrick has also presented an updated community investment and engagement plan to the Government of San Juan and federal authorities for review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   On a 100 percent basis [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , including the 50 percent attributable to Shandong Gold],\n   <em>\n    we now expect full-year production at Veladero of 630,000-730,000 ounces of gold, at a cost of sales of $740-$790 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs of $890-$990 per ounce.\n   </em>\n   Barrick's share of full-year production, assuming 50 percent ownership from July 1, is expected to be 430,000-480,000 ounces of gold.\n   <em>\n    This compares to our original 2017 guidance of 770,000-830,000 ounces (100 percent basis), at a cost of sales of $750-$800 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs of $840-$940 per ounce.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Fernandez Johnson Decl. ex. 10 at 4 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This release also announced a number of other weak results on Barrick's part, including (1) increased all-in sustaining costs in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to 2016; (2) reduced production of copper at higher costs in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to 2016; and (3) reduced expectations for company-wide gold production in 2017, a \"significant portion\" of which was attributable to the 50% sale of Veladero to Shandong Gold.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.

Plaintiffs' Additional Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In addition to the events before and during the Class Period, plaintiffs offer a number of additional allegations. First, Judge Ortija (of the Jachal Judicial Court) stated that Barrick had failed to comply with work orders issued in December 2016 and February 2017, AC \u00b6 60, and that he learned on May 5, 2017 that the March 2017 leak would not have occurred had Barrick complied with an earlier order directing the replacement of certain pipes. AC \u00b6\u00b6 60, 81. Similarly, the provincial minister of mining stated that Barrick had failed to complete an \"urgent review\" of its pipe system. AC \u00b6 60. Second, an additional confidential witness, CW2, a senior accountant at Barrick's Cortez mine in Nevada between 2009 and 2016, explained that the company maintained an accounting system through Oracle that tracked expense costs and capital costs. AC \u00b6 55. CW2 further explained that \"senior executives could pull anything from the Oracle systems,\" including costs spent on remedial works.

Barrick either had done so or it had not as of that time, and what occurred afterwards -- including the March 28 spill -- is irrelevant.

One of these three orders -- plaintiffs do not specify which one -- directed the replacement of certain pipes at Veladero. AC \u00b6 60. Assuming in plaintiffs' favor that these work orders in fact related to the September 2016 spill, the fact that Barrick did not complete certain remedial measures (even if required by local authorities) nonetheless does not mean that it did not complete certain other remedial measures (which could be fairly described as \"a series\"). Plaintiffs can argue (and the Argentine authorities can state) with the benefit of hindsight that compliance with those work orders would have prevented the March 2017 spill, but this chain of causation was hardly known\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   before the spill, including the time Palmes's statement was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Ultimately, plaintiffs' theories support at most an inference that Barrick could have, and very possibly should have, done more to prevent further leaks and spills of cyanide solution.

At bottom, the total amount of gold produced at Veladero in a given year -- the figures reflected in the production guidance -- can be assessed only at the end of the year, which was nine months into the future at the time the statements in question were made.

Plaintiffs contend that Barrick knew that its production estimates were false because the individual defendants received daily production reports from Veladero, Barrick had a history of maintaining production guidance despite previous spills and the production restrictions consequently imposed by the Argentine authorities, and Barrick admitted that restrictions on the addition of cyanide reduced production.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Lacking in these theories, however, is any plausible inference that reduced production over the course of two and nine days -- the amount of time that the production restrictions had been in place following the March 28 leak when the March 30 and April 6 statements were made -- has a material impact on total production assessed as of year-end. Accordingly, accepting that Barrick executives (including several of the individual defendants) received daily production updates from Veladero reflecting decreased production day-to-day, AC \u00b6\u00b6 45, 84, whether these production updates reflected decreases that were significant enough to call into question Barrick's annual production guidance is a separate question and is unsupported by plaintiffs' allegations. For example, considering CW1's estimate that gold production was reduced by up to 10% on days when cyanide solution was not added to the leach pad, AC \u00b6 44, restrictions in place for a period of 18 days (the length of time between Barrick's April 6 statement and April 24 corrective disclosure) would amount to only a 0.5% reduction in annual production. Restrictions would need to be in place for a substantial period before overall\n   <em>\n    annual\n   </em>\n   production would be impacted, and plaintiffs do not seriously engage with the mismatch in temporal scope between\n   restrictions in effect for a number of days and annual production reflected in production guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Nor does Barrick's history of maintaining annual production guidance in the face of operating restrictions imposed after the 2015 and 2016 spills support an inference of scienter. Plaintiffs label as baseless Barrick's maintenance of annual production guidelines, but they also do not argue that Barrick in fact failed to meet the production guidance it reaffirmed after the 2015 and 2016 spills.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 23, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 34:20-24 (\"THE COURT: Are you arguing that Barrick missed production goals in 2015 and 2016?

Given that plaintiffs do not argue that Veladero having been subject to processing restrictions for 9 days in 2015 and further subject to the wholesale suspension of production for 20 days in 2016 caused Barrick to miss its production guidance in those years, the impact on production that the imposition of cyanide restrictions for 2 and 9 days following the March 2017 spill is wholly insufficient to raise a plausible inference that the March 30 and April 6 statements regarding 2017 production guidance were made with actual knowledge of falsity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Further, any inference that defendants knew that the March 30 and April 6 press releases' reaffirmance of the production guidance was false -- that is, defendants knew as of March 30 and April 6 that the 2017 production guidance was unattainable -- is undermined here by CW1's statements that Barrick placed great emphasis on the catching-up of behind-target production, AC \u00b6 46, and by the fact that nine months in the production year remained at the time the March 30 and April 6 statements were made. We therefore conclude that the March 30 and April 6 statements fall within the PSLRA's safe harbor for the additional reason that plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege that these statements were made with actual knowledge of their falsity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In sum, we hold that plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that Palmes's February 16 statement was false or made with scienter and that the remaining statements are forward-looking statements protected by the PSLRA's safe harbor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Loss Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Given the foregoing, we need not address the parties' loss causation arguments. Nonetheless, we note here that plaintiffs' theory of loss causation as to the alleged partial disclosure on March 29 borders on the nonsensical. As an initial matter, plaintiffs allege that Barrick's stock price dropped over the period from March\n   27 (a Monday) to March 30 (a Thursday), an expansive window that is difficult to reconcile with their allegations, AC \u00b6 91, that Barrick's stock trades in an efficient market allowing them to rely on the presumption of reliance set forth in\n   <em>\n    Basic Inc. v.

Plaintiffs contend that the decrease in price on March 28 is attributable to the occurrence of the spill which partially revealed the falsity of Palmes's February 16 statement, that the increase on March 29 is attributable to Barrick's press release containing reassurances that there were no impacts on the environment or local residents, and that the decrease on March 30 is attributable to Barrick's disclosure of cyanide restrictions in the press release issued that day. [Pls.'

Given that Barrick's stock price increased on March 29, rather than decreased, it is far from clear that plaintiffs have met their burden as to loss causation -- even though that burden is a low one at the pleading stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenters Pension Tr.

Accordingly, this holding in\n    <em>\n     Wagner\n    </em>\n    is best characterized as a forward-looking statement that was made with actual knowledge of falsity (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , Barrick could not reasonably have expected that costs would decrease given that it was simultaneously undertaking cost-increasing processes).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Plaintiffs also rely on this Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     In re BHP Billiton Securities Litigation\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418366\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/276/65/#p92\">\n     276 F.Supp.3d 65\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (S.D.N.Y. 2017), in which we held that general disclosures about breaches of tailings dams were insufficient to render \"very particular, concrete, and grave risks relating to\" a specific dam immaterial by virtue of having already been in the public domain,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418366\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/276/65/#p92\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418366\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/276/65/#p92\">\n     at 83\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
