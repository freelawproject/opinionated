No. 11) filed jointly by the Defendants. The Plaintiffs have responded, and Defendants have filed a reply. This matter is now ripe for adjudication. For the following reasons, Defendants' Motion is granted in part, denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Cities4Life, Inc., Daniel Parks, and Patrick Courtney (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") brought this civil rights action against: the City of Charlotte; Marcus D. Jones in his official capacity as City Manager of Charlotte (\"Jones\"); the City of Charlotte Department of Housing and Neighborhood Services (\"HNS\"); the City of Charlotte Division of Code Enforcement (\"DCE\"); Ben Krise, individually and in his official capacity as City of Charlotte Code Enforcement Division Manager (\"Krise\"); Mandy Edwards, individually and in her official capacity as a City of Charlotte Code Enforcement Inspector (\"Edwards\"); Mark Fowler, individually and in his official capacity as a City of Charlotte Code Enforcement Inspector (\"Fowler\"); Kimberly Sauer, individually and in her official capacity as a City of Charlotte N &amp; BS Area Supervisor (\"Sauer\"); and Jane Does 1-5 and John Doe 1, individually and in their official capacities as City of Charlotte employees (\"Does\") (collectively, \"Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The factual allegations contained in the Complaint are presumed to be true at this stage of the litigation, and thus the Court relies on them for purposes of resolving this motion alone. According to the Complaint, Plaintiff Cities4Life, Inc. (\"Cities4Life\") is a \"faith-based organization that seeks to engage, strengthen, and support local churches and Christians to proclaim, protect, and provide life for unborn babies in each city across the United States where abortion exists.\" (Compl., \u00b6 17). Plaintiff Daniel Parks (\"Parks\") is the Executive Director of Cities4Life, and\n   Plaintiff Patrick Courtney (\"Courtney\") is a Missionary for Help Pregnancy Center in Monroe, North Carolina. (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 20, 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cities4Life regularly assembles volunteers and counselors outside of abortion facilities in order to \"preach[ ] the Gospel and speak[ ] the Truth\" to women contemplating an abortion. (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 48-49). Specifically, Cities4Life volunteers hand out information to women going into abortion clinics about \"the alternatives to abortion and the means by which they can obtain tangible help in their difficult situation\" and pray for \"specific immediate needs they encounter in front of abortion centers.\" (Compl., \u00b6 50). As a part of this work, Cities4Life employs the use of signs and placards that are large enough to be seen by individuals entering abortion facilities. (Compl., \u00b6 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Charlotte City Code regulates signs within public rights-of-way and on public property. Specifically, the Code provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (a) It shall be unlawful for any person to attach, place, paint, write, stamp or paste any sign within 11 feet of the edge of any pavement of any roadway or alley.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to attach, place, paint, write, stamp or paste any sign within any public rights-of-way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (c) It shall be unlawful for any person to attach, place, paint, write, stamp or paste any sign upon any post, pole, tree, tree stake or guard, shrub, or fire hydrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (d) It shall be unlawful for any person to attach, place, paint, write, stamp or paste any sign upon anything else within 11 feet of the edge of the public rights-of-way, upon any bridge or overpass within the city limits, or upon other public property including, but not limited to, traffic medians.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (e)\n   <em>\n    Exceptions.\n   </em>\n   This section shall not apply to the following signs:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1.

In the case of a sign advertising a service, product, dwelling, or event, the responsible person shall be deemed the person hosting or organizing the event or the person attaching, placing, painting, writing, stamping, or pasting any sign. Violation of this section shall subject the responsible person to a civil penalty of $100.00 per sign.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Charlotte, N.C., Code \u00a7 10-141 (June 6, 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 29, 2017, Parks led a team of Cities4Life volunteers to hand out information on public property near an abortion clinic called A Preferred Women's Health Center of Charlotte (\"Preferred Women's Health\"). Defendants Krise and Fowler arrived and confiscated and subsequently destroyed a canopy belonging to Cities4Life. The canopy was not blocking any right of way, and it was not affixed permanently or semi-permanently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On July 5, 2017, Parks and Cities4Life again engaged in their activities near Preferred Women's Health and three officials from the DCE arrived and began issuing citations for violation of City Code \u00a7 10-212. Parks received two citations on this date for allegedly violating City Code \u00a7 10-212, both of which were signed by Defendant Edwards. Defendant Sauer explained that one citation was being issued because \"a placard was resting on an individual's shoes without her feet actually being inside her shoes.\" (Compl., \u00b6 86). The officials also seized and destroyed the placards used by Cities4Life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On July 11, 2017, Parks and Cities4Life again engaged in their activities near Preferred Women's Health. Officials from the DCE arrived, seized two placards that were leaning against a vehicle, and subsequently destroyed them. When a volunteer sat on a sign, the officials declined to take it, stating that because it was no longer being \"displayed,\" there was no violation of any ordinance. (Compl., \u00b6 91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Similar seizures and destruction of placards belonging to individuals associated with Cities4Life occurred on August 8, 2017, and August 18, 2017. And on September 16, 2017, both pro-life and pro-choice groups marched in the vicinity of Preferred Women's Health carrying flyers and signs. City officials arrived and issued citations to individuals affiliated with the pro-life protesters, but not to pro-choice protesters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On November 5, 2017, Parks was issued two additional citations by members of the DCE, including Defendant Krise, while displaying signs on public property in the vicinity of Preferred Women's Health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Additionally, in the summer of 2017, Courtney spent time \"peacefully praying, preaching, and further exercising his First Amendment rights on public property\" near Preferred Women's Health. He brought a sign with him, and he held it upright with his hands while the bottom of the sign rested on the ground. Three officials\n   from the DCE arrived and approached Courtney. Courtney then put his sign on the ground and sat on it \"to protect his property from the city officials.\" (Compl., \u00b6 110). The DCE members demanded that he turn over his sign, and he refused to do so. The officials then left. Courtney alleges that this \"threat to take his property\" has made him \"fear he will lose his ability to exercise his First Amendment rights and that the city will confiscate his property.\" (Compl., \u00b6 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As stated above, Parks received two citations for violating \u00a7 10-141 on July 5, 2017 and two additional citations for violating \u00a7 10-141 on October 5, 2017, each carrying a $100 fine. On August 4, 2017, Parks requested an appeal of the first pair of citations issued to him and reimbursement for the cost of the destroyed placards on behalf of Cities4Life. On October 4, 2017, the City of Charlotte reimbursed the cost of the destroyed property to Parks without admitting any wrongdoing. On November 9, 2017, Parks again requested an appeal of the July 5 citations as well as an appeal of new citations that had been issued to him on October 5, 2017. Shortly thereafter, on December 11, 2017, the City of Charlotte rescinded the July 5 citations and granted Parks' request for an appeal of his October 5 citations subject to his compliance with the ordinance appeal provisions, including a bond payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the meantime, however, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this matter on November 11, 2017. The Complaint alleges that Defendants, through their enforcement of \u00a7 10-141, violated the First Amendment of the Constitution; the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment; Article I, Section 1 of the North Carolina Constitution ; Article I, Section 14 of the North Carolina Constitution ; and Article I, Section 19 of the North Carolina Constitution. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that they have \"a present and future desire and intention to engage in lawful First Amendment activity\" but \"fear being cited by Defendants.\" (Compl., 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Defendants claim that the claims of Parks and Cities4Life are not ripe because Parks has invoked an appeal of his citations in an administrative hearing, even though he has not yet pursued this appeal by filing the requisite bond payments. Defendants further argue that Courtney lacks standing in this case and that the claims of Parks and Cities4Life should be dismissed under the\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Federal courts have limited jurisdiction, possessing \"only that power authorized by Constitution and statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    511 U.S. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be granted if the court lacks statutory authority at any time to hear and decide the dispute. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). \"The burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction on a motion to dismiss is on the plaintiff, the party asserting jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Bain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1502630\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/697/1213/#p1219\">\n    697 F.2d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1219 (4th Cir. 1982). If the defendant contends the pleading fails to allege facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction can be based, then \"all the facts alleged in the complaint are assumed to be true and the plaintiff, in effect, is afforded the same procedural protection as he would receive under a Rule 12(b)(6) consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1502630\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/697/1213/#p1219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the defendant argues that the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint are untrue, a court \"may then go beyond the allegations of the complaint\" and \"determine if there\n   are facts to support the jurisdictional allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1502630\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/697/1213/#p1219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Ripeness: Parks and Cities4Life\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants first argue that the claims raised by Parks and Cities4Life are not ripe because the City of Charlotte has not yet made a \"final decision\" whether the activities of Parks and Cities4Life violated \u00a7 10-141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Generally, a court assessing ripeness must \"balance the fitness of the issues for judicial decision with the hardship of the parties of withholding court consideration. A case is fit for judicial decision when the issues are purely legal and when the action in controversy is final and not dependent on future uncertainties.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Va. Dep't of State Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559947\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/745/#p758\">\n    713 F.3d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 758 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Thus, \"[a] claim should be dismissed as unripe if the plaintiff has not yet suffered injury and any future impact 'remains wholly speculative.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3464863\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/312/#p319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gasner v.

However, \"like standing, ripeness requirements are also relaxed in First Amendment cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Cooksey v.

This is because even a \"chilling effect\" of potential enforcement may unconstitutionally burden free speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Mexicans for Bill Richardson v.

In such appeal, Parks could raise the same constitutional arguments in opposition to enforcing \u00a7 10-141 against him as he does in this matter. According to the Defendants, this makes any injury suffered by Parks and Cities4Life \"wholly speculative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   While Defendants are correct in noting that Parks has the opportunity to appeal his two remaining citations to a city administrative body, Defendants' arguments are clearly foreclosed by the Fourth Circuit's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Cooksey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5756139\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/226/#p240\">\n    721 F.3d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Virginia Society for Human Life, Inc. v.

The Fourth Circuit found that the plaintiff's claim was ripe even though he had not been subjected to any actual enforcement or punishment pursuant to the licensing regulations because his claims \"present[ed] the question of whether the Act and actions of the State Board unconstitutionally infringe on [his] rights to maintain certain aspects of his website.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5756139\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/226/#p240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5756139\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/226/#p240\">\n    at 240-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And their Complaint clearly alleges that as a result of Defendants' conduct, their \"speech and message are effectively suppressed and silenced.\" (Compl., 24).

The citations at issue were only directed to Parks-not to Cities4Life as an organization. Further, while Cities4Life did join Parks in his notice of appeal to the City of Charlotte, Cities4Life merely requested reimbursement for the value of destroyed placards and signs. Nothing about Cities4Life's request for reimbursement is \"quasi-criminal\" in nature. Rather, it was initiated by Cities4Life and risked no sanction or filing of charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Further, the City of Charlotte granted this request and reimbursed $565.00 for the destroyed property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 11-1,\n   Exh. 5). Defendants have not shown that Cities4Life has subsequently requested any further reimbursement. Thus, even if Defendants were correct that Cities4Life's request for reimbursement created a state proceeding within the scope of\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention, it is clear that such proceeding is no longer ongoing in light of the fact that Cities4Life obtained their reimbursement on or about October 4, 2017-more than a month before Cities4Life filed the instant suit. Thus, its prior (and fulfilled) request for reimbursement is in no way a state civil proceeding akin to criminal prosecution that warrants abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Next, the Court finds that Parks' notice of appeal of his citations also does not rise to the level of a quasi-criminal proceeding to which\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention must be applied. A fundamental element of a quasi-criminal proceeding is that it must be judicial in nature.\n   <em>\n    New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v.

Further, no formal complaint was filed against Parks, and no Code provision guarantees the opportunity for Parks to present witnesses and exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harper v.

And no provision gives the \"neighborhood development key business executive or his designee\"-a local volunteer who serves as \"hearing officer\"-any authority to enter orders, subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, compel the production of documents, or make findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sutton v.

Sep. 12, 2014) (listing these factors as evidence that a proceeding was judicial in nature). Accordingly, this Court finds that such a hearing would not truly be \"judicial\" in nature, and therefore abstention is not warranted with respect to the availability of an appeal of Parks' citation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Additionally, the Court notes that the purposes of abstention pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   would not be served in this matter. First, even if the appeals process was a judicial forum warranting abstention with respect to Parks' as-applied claims, the as-applied claims of Cities4Life and Courtney could not be addressed in that forum. Thus, even if the Court required Parks to pursue a final administrative ruling, Cities4Life and Courtney's claims would continue which would create parallel state and federal proceedings. This result directly defies the goals of\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Further, Plaintiffs have shown that facial challenges to the constitutionality of \u00a7 10-141 could be not be adequately addressed in that forum. Rather, as Plaintiffs have pointed out, it is settled North Carolina law that \"[w]here an aggrieved party challenges the constitutionality of a regulation or statute, administrative remedies are deemed to be inadequate and exhaustion thereof is not required.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Shell Island Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v.

Thus, the State of North Carolina itself would find the administrative appeals process to be an inadequate forum to raise a constitutional challenge to one of its statutes.
