Rappaport brought suit against his former employer, Defendant The Federal Savings Bank (\"TFSB\"), and its CEO, Stephen M. Calk. (Doc. 1). Mr. Rappaport alleges that TFSB illegally terminated his employment after he developed leukemia, and that TFSB and Mr. Calk lied to Mr. Rappaport's clients about his dismissal. (Doc. 1). The first four counts of Mr. Rappaport's Complaint concern the defamation and intentional interference with a business relationship claims, and the last two counts concern the wrongful dismissal and retaliation claims. (Doc. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Rappaport's employment contract with TFSB included an arbitration agreement. (Doc. 12, Exh. A \u00b6 10). It states that any dispute \"concerning the wages, hours, working conditions, terms, rights, responsibilities or obligations between them or arising out of their employment relationship ... shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of JAMS Arbitration....\" (Doc. 12, Exh. A\n   \u00b6 10). Pursuant to this clause and the Federal Arbitration Act, Defendants have requested the Court to stay this case until arbitration is completed.

Although the specific rules used in JAMS Arbitration of employment claims were not attached to the agreement, those rules are easily accessible. The applicable arbitration rules require a standard $1,500 filing fee, twelve percent case management fee, and other customary procedures to efficiently resolve the dispute. (Doc. 12 Exh. B).

B \u00b6 25). Thus, Mr. Rappaport has showed that the cost of arbitration would exceed the cost of litigating the case in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Concerning Mr. Rappaport's ability to afford arbitration, the parties disagree about the expected cost of arbitration and Mr. Rapaport's ability to pay. Mr. Rappaport relies on his attorney's declaration that arbitration would cost between $40,000 and $75,000. (Doc. 22, Exh. B \u00b6 24). TFSB anticipates that the true cost would be between $7,000 and $15,750. (Doc. 35 at 5). Mr. Rappaport claims that he cannot pay this cost because his annual living expenses of $312,000 are greater than his annual salary of $147,300. (Doc. 22, Exh. B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21). Mr. Rappaport's report of annual expenses is exaggerated. He reports that he pays $2,000 per month to care for his children, which is separate from a $3,000 per month court order payment that provides for his children. (Doc. 22, Exh. A \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9). He estimates $3,500 per month in \"medical and dental expenses, including insurance costs\" which are also separate from $1,700 per month in miscellaneous expenses that \"include medical expenses and other household fees.\" (Doc. 22, Exh. A \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12). To find that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable based on Mr. Rappaport's monthly expenditure of $2,300 for personal food and clothing would mean that anyone could defeat an arbitration agreement if his or her lifestyle was expensive enough. The arbitration agreement is not substantively unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Thus, whether these claims relate to the \"rights, responsibilities or obligations\" between Mr. Rappaport and TFSB is a valid question.
