INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In this case, plaintiff Marlin Herbst alleges that he suffers from bronchiolitis obliterans (aka \"popcorn lung\") and/or other lung or respiratory diseases or impairments from working with butter flavorings containing diacetyl at the American Popcorn Company (APC ) plant in Sioux City, Iowa, between 1991 and August 1993. On January 27, 2017, Herbst brought products liability claims under strict liability and negligence and a claim of breach of implied warranties against various \"manufacturing defendants,\" which are companies that allegedly designed, manufactured, distributed, and/or sold diacetyl-containing butter flavorings to APC, and against various \"diacetyl defendants,\" which are companies that allegedly designed, manufactured, marketed, distributed, and/or sold diacetyl that was used by APC. The remaining \"manufacturing defendant\" is Givaudan Flavors Corporation, and the remaining \"diacetyl defendant\" is Emoral, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This case is now before me on Givaudan's February 9, 2018, Motion For Summary Judgment seeking summary judgment on all of Herbst's claims on the ground that, as a matter of undisputed fact and law, his claims, brought nearly 23 years after his employment at APC ended, are barred by the applicable 15-year statute of repose, IOWA CODE \u00a7 614.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Moreover, Givaudan argues, Herbst cannot assert the statutory exception for latent injury caused by \"harmful materials,\" in IOWA CODE \u00a7 614.1(2A)(b), for the reasons I stated in\n   <em>\n    Daughetee v. Chr. Hansen, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836853\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/960/849/\">\n    960 F.Supp.2d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Iowa 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his Resistance, filed March 26, 2018, however, Herbst does not rely on the \"harmful materials\" exception. Instead, he relies on a different statutory exception, in IOWA CODE \u00a7 614.1(2A)(a), which excepts claims from the statute of repose \"if the manufacturer, assembler, designer, supplier of specifications, seller, lessor, or distributor of the product\n   <em>\n    intentionally misrepresents facts about the product\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    fraudulently conceals information about the product\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    that conduct was a substantial cause of the claimant's harm.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added). Herbst asserts that there are, at the very least, genuine issues of material fact as to whether Givaudan fraudulently concealed information about the safety of butter flavorings containing diacetyl that Givaudan sold to APC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In a Reply, filed April 11, 2018, Givaudan argues that Herbst's reliance on the \"fraudulent concealment\" exception fails, under the applicable \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard, because (1) he has presented no evidence from which a fact-finder could reasonably infer that Tastemaker, Givaudan's predecessor, intentionally misrepresented or fraudulently concealed any information about its butter flavorings, and (2) he lacks any evidence that Tastemaker acted with any intent to deceive. Givaudan also makes clear, in its Reply and in its response to Herbst's Statement Of Additional Material Facts, that it considers any evidence of alleged misrepresentations or concealments after Herbst's employment at APC ended in August of 1993 to be irrelevant. Indeed, Givaudan argues, there was no published information about the alleged association between butter flavorings containing diacetyl and lung disease prior to 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both parties request oral arguments on Givaudan's Motion For Summary Judgment. Contrary to the parties' assertions, however, I find that their written submissions are sufficient to resolve Givaudan's Motion. Therefore, I deem Givaudan's Motion fully submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

Iowa April 21, 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Contrary to Givaudan's contentions, I conclude that Herbst has generated genuine issues of material fact as to whether Tastemaker, Givaudan's predecessor, and later Givaudan, fraudulently concealed information about its butter flavorings containing diacetyl, and that Tastemaker (or Givaudan) acted with intent to deceive. First, I do not agree with Givaudan that any evidence of concealment or intent to deceive after the end of Herbst's employment at APC in August of 1993 is simply irrelevant. Section 614.1(2A) states that, with exceptions not relevant, here, the statute of repose begins to run from when \"the product was first purchased, leased, bailed, or installed for use or consumption,\" which the parties appear to agree in the case of APC and Herbst, as APC's employee, occurred in about 1991 and certainly no later than August 1993. That provision does not state any limitation on the time or period during which the \"fraudulent concealment\" must have occurred, however. Logically, such \"fraudulent concealment\" must have occurred during the 15-year period of repose after first purchase when the statutory repose period would otherwise have been running,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , from some point in 1991 until some point in 2006. Thus, even if Givaudan is correct that there was no published information about the alleged association between butter flavorings containing diacetyl and lung disease prior to 2001, concealment of that fact with intent to deceive\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   2001 would\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   be before the end of the statute of repose period otherwise applicable in 2006 and would, thus, be relevant to an exception to the running of the statute of repose prior to Herbst filing his claims. Such concealment, a rational trier of fact could conclude, might include concealment of a determination after the end of Herbst's employment at APC that possible lung disease (possibly even bronchiolitis obliterans ) suffered by some employees at Tastemaker's plant prior to 1993 may have been linked to exposure to diacetyl.\n   <em>\n    Torgerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648351\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/1031/#p1042\">\n    643 F.3d at 1042-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating the rational trier of fact standard at summary judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Furthermore, the 1985 Flavor or Fragrance Ingredient Data Sheet (FFIDS) for diacetyl, Plaintiff's Appendix, 56-60, and Givaudan's conduct based on it\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   give rise to reasonable inferences from which a rational trier of fact could conclude that Givaudan or its predecessor concealed pertinent information from APC and, by extension, from Herbst.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648351\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/1031/#p1042\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Givaudan is correct that the 1985 FFIDS, indicates that \"Statements Relevant to Making a Health Hazard Determination\" consist of the following: \"Irritation Data: Liquid and vapor may be irritating to\n   skin and eyes. Vapor is irritating to throat and lungs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60. Givaudan is also correct that it provided\n   <em>\n    similar\n   </em>\n   information in its material safety data sheets (MSDSs) from 1993 onward, that its butter flavorings \"May be irritating to skin and eyes,\" and that \"Inhalation is irritating to nose, throat, and lungs,\" although the warning in the MSDS is not plainly linked to exposure to either liquid or vapor, as in the 1985 FFIDS. More importantly, the 1993 and later MSDSs do not address\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the human health effects data from \"inhalation\" listed in Section IV of the 1985 FFIDS, which stated \"Harmful. Sore throat, coughing; may be absorbed. High concentrations may cause irritation of respiratory tract; capable of producing systemic toxicity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57 (internal citations omitted). Thus, the 1985 FFIDS, read as a whole, suggests considerably more than \"irritation\" as the result of inhalation, including that inhalation may be \"harmful\" and may produce \"systemic toxicity,\" to the \"respiratory tract,\" including the throat and lungs. A rational trier of fact could discount the testimony of Tastemaker's regulatory department head that \"systemic toxicity\" was not a reference to the lungs or respiratory system, but to a systemic toxic event, such as irritation or sensitization, as a post hoc definition that is inconsistent with the context in which that term is used in the 1985 FFIDS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A rational trier of fact could also infer that Tastemaker was concealing its requirement of procedures, including respirators, for handling diacetyl and products containing diacetyl in its own plant, while indicating that only less rigorous procedures were required for handling butter flavorings containing diacetyl at APC's plant. A rational trier of fact could reject Givaudan's assertion that the procedures at the Tastemaker plant did not require respirators to be used in the presence of finished butter flavorings containing diacetyl, but only when an employee was using pure, liquid diacetyl in the spray dry department, as contrary to the language of Tastemaker's procedures. Those procedures state, in part, \"Whenever liquid Diacetyl\n   <em>\n    or a product where liquid Diacetyl is present\n   </em>\n   is to be used, a respirator ... must be worn,\" and, \"Whenever\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , without reference to whether in pure or liquid form or present in a product] is in tank, lids must be closed [and] [i]f ventilation (mechanical) is not connected to tank or is unavailable, a respirator must be used at all time while in the room.\" Plaintiff's Appendix at 129 (emphasis added). This language could reasonably be understood to apply to both pure or liquid diacetyl and products containing diacetyl, such as butter flavorings. Also, while Tastemaker's procedures warned, \"Avoid heating or flame at all times\" when handling diacetyl,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Tastemaker was aware that APC was heating the butter flavorings in the course of producing butter flavored microwave popcorn and that the microwave popcorn would also be heated when prepared by consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While a rational trier of fact might reject some of the evidence on which Herbst relies to show concealment, a rational trier of fact would not be\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to do so. Moreover, a rational trier of fact would not be required to accept Givaudan's\n   <em>\n    characterization\n   </em>\n   of the evidence as correct and beyond dispute. There is enough evidence, as discussed, above, giving rise to inferences of concealment for Herbst's claim to satisfy the \"concealment\" element of the \"fraudulent concealment\" exception to the statute of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   I am also unpersuaded by Givaudan's contention that Herbst has not generated genuine issues of material fact as to the \"intent to deceive\" element. Givaudan rejects what it contends is Herbst's argument that a showing of concealment is\n   enough to show intent to deceive and contends that argument is based on a misreading of Judge Jarvey's decision in\n   <em>\n    Baier\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Givaudan contends that\n   <em>\n    Baier\n   </em>\n   was a case in which evidence existed from which jurors could infer intent to deceive, but that this is not such a case, because there is no evidence of concealment, in the first place, and even if a jury could find failure to provide information, there is no evidence that the failure was intentional or for the purpose of deceiving APC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Baier\n   </em>\n   , there was evidence that Ford had withheld one crash report that showed the \"drop-in\" gas tank in a Mustang would rupture upon a rear-end collision, and, instead, reported to the federal government that the Mustang had met the federal crash test standard in a second test, but \"did not mention or reference the modifications done to the frame of the car\" that had allowed it to pass that test.\n   <em>\n    Baier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20928615\">\n    2005 WL 928615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Also, when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted an investigation into the safety of Ford's \"drop-in\" gas tank line of vehicles, Ford did not produce any of its internal reports regarding failed tests or the dangers of \"drop-in\" gas tanks, so the NHTSA closed its investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Judge Jarvey concluded this evidence generated genuine issues of material fact as to concealment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As to \"intent to deceive,\" Judge Jarvey explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [T]he relevant inquiry is not whether the defendant intended to deceive the plaintiffs with respect to a time bar, but whether the defendant intended to deceive the plaintiffs with respect to the product. The plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence, as detailed above, to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Ford engaged in fraudulent conduct. This evidence also creates a genuine issue of fact as to whether Ford intended to deceive the plaintiffs, as potential purchasers and then as users of the car, about the Ford Mustang.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Baier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20928615\">\n    2005 WL 928615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Thus, Judge Jarvey did conclude that evidence of concealment by Ford in that case\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   generated genuine issues of material fact on intent to deceive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As indicated, above, I disagree with Givaudan's contention that there is no evidence of concealment in this case, so that there is no evidence from which a rational trier of fact could infer intent to deceive. Rather, I conclude that there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   evidence of concealment and that some of Herbst's evidence of concealment, like Baier's, also gives rise to inferences of intent to deceive. For example, like Baier's evidence of concealment, Herbst's evidence of concealment includes evidence of differences between what Tastemaker was telling APC were adequate procedures to handle butter flavorings containing diacetyl and the procedures that Tastemaker was requiring in its own plant for handling diacetyl\n   <em>\n    and products containing diacetyl.\n   </em>\n   That difference not only suggests concealment of known information, but intent to deceive APC into believing that butter flavorings containing diacetyl were not dangerous, because less stringent handling procedures were adequate.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20928615\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *1-*2, *7 (identifying evidence of differences between information known to Ford and what Ford disclosed and holding this evidence of concealment also gave rise to an inference of intent to deceive). Similarly, other evidence of differences between what Givaudan knew about the possible links between diacetyl or products containing diacetyl and lung or respiratory diseases and what it required for safe handling of diacetyl and products containing diacetyl, on the one hand, and what Givaudan was telling customers about product safety and handling procedures, on the other hand, during the period that the statute of repose would otherwise have been running-\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   1993, and even\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   2001-also gives rise to inferences of intent to deceive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.
