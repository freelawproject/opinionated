(Docs. 64; 78). Because Defendant Beazer Homes Corporation has withdrawn its response to the motion for summary judgment, the motion is unopposed. (Docs. 72; 74). Also before the Court is Mid-Continent's Response to Order to Show Cause on whether a declaration on its duty to indemnify is ripe for adjudication. (Doc. 80). These matters are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is an insurance coverage dispute. (Doc. 53). Mid-Continent seeks a declaration under the Declaratory Judgment Act on its obligations and duties to Defendants Delacruz Drywall Plastering &amp; Stucco, Inc. and Beazer Home Corporation. (Doc. 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mid-Continent issued five commercial general liability policies to Delacruz. (Doc. 53; Docs. 36-1; 36-2; 36-3; 36-4; 36-5). Thereafter, Delacruz was hired by Beazer, a general contractor, to perform stucco work in the construction of single-family homes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-1). After the homes were built, homeowners brought claims against Beazer for defective construction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-1). Beazer then sued Delacruz in Florida state court for its part in the construction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-1). Beazer's claims include breach of contract, contractual indemnity, negligence, common law indemnity, and violating the Florida Building Code under Florida Statute \u00a7 553.84. (Doc. 61-1 at 1-14). Mid-Continent is currently defending Delacruz in the suit under a reservation of rights. (Doc. 64 at \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mid-Continent brought this suit to clarify its duties as to Delacruz and Beazer in the underlying state court case. (Doc. 53). Mid-Continent has since voluntarily dismissed its claims against Beazer, leaving only its claims against Delacruz. (Doc. 74). The only remaining claims request a Court declaration that Mid-Continent has no duty to indemnify Delacruz for claims arising from the home construction. (Doc. 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mid-Continent now moves for summary judgment and default judgment on its duty to indemnify Delacruz. (Docs. 64; 78). It argues that policy exclusions, which preclude coverage for Delacruz's work performed before specific dates, bar coverage for Delacruz's work in the underlying case. Mid-Continent thus argues that it has no duty to indemnify Delacruz. Further, Mid-Continent contends that because it has no duty to indemnify Delacruz, it also has no duty to defend Delacruz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After reviewing Mid-Continent's motions for summary judgment and default judgment, the Court decided it needed more briefing from Mid-Continent on whether entering a declaratory judgment on its duty to indemnify was ripe. (Doc. 79). The Court gave Mid-Continent the opportunity\n   for extra briefing because it did not address the ripeness issue in either motion and its arguments hinge on the Court first deciding Mid-Continent's duty to indemnify. (Doc. 79). In response, Mid-Continent contends that a declaration on its duty to indemnify is ripe for review. (Doc. 80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A court must \"grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears the burden to show there is no genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Mid-Continent contends the matter is ripe because its duty to indemnify is based \"only on when Delacruz performed [its] work\" and it is not based on a final adjudication in the underlying state case. (Doc. 80 at 3). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Declaratory Judgment Act allows federal courts in \"a case of actual controversy\" to \"declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, this Court has likewise found an insurer's duty to indemnify not ripe without a determination of the insured's liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safeco Ins.

Tremblay\n   </em>\n   , 2:16-CV-837-FTM-38CM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203648265\">\n    2018 WL 3648265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (M.D. Fla.

Although Mid-Continent's argument that its duty to indemnify depends solely on when Delacruz performed its work may be accurate, it misses the point on ripeness. If Delacruz is not liable, it does not matter when Delacruz performed its work because indemnification is not required. Only time will tell how the ongoing state court case plays out. Mid-Continent has also not identified any hardship it will suffer if the Court withholds consideration on this issue. (Doc. 80). Nor is it clear if Delacruz will even seek indemnification from Mid-Continent if Delacruz is found liable. Consequently, Mid-Continent's duty to indemnify is not ripe, and its claims requesting a declaration on its duty to indemnify are dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As a result, Mid-Continent's arguments on its duty to defend Delacruz also fail because they hinge on the Court first deciding Mid-Continent's duty to indemnify. And although Mid-Continent argued that it had no duty to defend Delacruz in its motions, it never affirmatively sought this relief in its Second Amended Complaint. (Doc. 53). Instead, the Second Amended Complaint only sought a declaration on its duty to\n   <em>\n    indemnify\n   </em>\n   Delacruz. (Doc. 53). Therefore, there are no remaining claims and the case is dismissed in its entirety without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, it is now\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff Mid-Continent Casualty Company's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 64) and Motion for Default Judgment (Doc. 78) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1.
