Clement filed this action against defendant Ecolab, Inc. (\"Ecolab\"), and five fictitiously named Doe defendants in the Multnomah County Circuit Court on March 8, 2018. Ecolab removed Clement's action to this court on April 5, 2018, on diversity jurisdictional grounds. By and through his complaint, Clement alleges that he is the general manager of a McCormick &amp; Schmick's restaurant (the \"Restaurant\") owned by Landry's. Inc. (\"Landry's\"), and that Landry's had a contract with Ecolab pursuant to which Ecolab was obliged to provide pest control services at the Restaurant. Clement further alleges that under the contract, Ecolab agreed to respond by telephone to requests for service at the Restaurant within one hour, and to arrive at the restaurant to provide requested services within 24 hours. Clement further alleges that in July and August 2017, Ecolab failed to respond to requests for pest-control services in connection with the presence of spiders at the restaurant, and that on August 25, 2017, in light of Ecolab's failure to respond to his multiple requests for service, he cleared out spider webs at the restaurant by himself, in the course of which he was bitten by a brown recluse spider, causing him to suffer severe injury. Arising out of the foregoing, Clement alleges Ecolab's liability for negligence and for breach of contract. Clement seeks award of approximately $1 million in damages, plus pre- and post-judgment interest thereon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because it appears to be undisputed that Clement is a citizen of the State of Washington, and that Ecolab is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Minnesota, this court appears to have diversity jurisdiction over Clement's action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   based on the complete diversity of the parties and the amount in controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Now before the court is Ecolab's motion (# 23) for judgment on the pleadings as to Clement's claims against it. I have considered the motion, oral argument on behalf of the parties, and all of the pleadings and papers on file. For the reasons set forth below, Ecolab's motion (# 23) is granted as to Clement's negligence claim and denied as to his breach of contract claim, and Clement's negligence claim is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fed.

Rule 12(c) provides that \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial-a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). \"Judgment on the pleadings is proper when the moving party clearly establishes on the face of the pleadings that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law....

The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It appears to be undisputed that plaintiff Clement is a citizen of the State of Washington. Clement is employed as the general manager of the Restaurant owned by Landry's in Portland, Oregon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Ecolab is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Minnesota. Ecolab is party to a contract with Landry's pursuant to which it agreed,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to provide certain specified pest elimination and pest control services at the Restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Clement's Allegations in Support of His Claims\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Clement has at all material times been the general manager of the Restaurant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (# 1-1), \u00b6 5. At a material time, defendant Ecolab entered into a contract with Landry's, the owner of the Restaurant, to provide \"pest elimination, pest control and exterminator services to Landry's-owned facilities nationwide, including the Restaurant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540719\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/1542/#p1550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9. Pursuant to the contract between Ecolab and Landry's (the \"Agreement\"), \"Ecolab was obligated to perform pest elimination and pest control services at the Restaurant, including promising [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] 'proactive prevention' through the use of reliable protocols supported by science to help protect customers through regular service visits by highly-trained and professional service specialists.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540719\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/1542/#p1550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Agreement provided for regular service visits. Additionally, in the Agreement, Ecolab also agreed that it could be contacted regarding pest activity and concerns, and that its representatives would be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Ecolab also promised to call back within one hour of such calls to schedule a visit, which visit would occur within 24 hours where immediate attention is requested. Ecolab also agreed to provide emergency services 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079517\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/992/#p998\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11. Clement, in his capacity as general manager of the Restaurant, was responsible for \"coordinating with Ecolab for performance of its pest elimination services at the Restaurant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540719\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/1542/#p1550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12. In connection with that responsibility, Clement often brought pest concerns to Ecolab's attention between Ecolab's regular service visits, including \"to address the elimination and prevention of spider infestation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540719\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/1542/#p1550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the summer and early autumn of 2017, Clement placed several calls to Ecolab requesting that Ecolab perform services at the Restaurant in connection with eliminating spider infestations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540719\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/1542/#p1550\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13. Ecolab failed to timely respond to Clement's service calls of July and August 2017, and failed to perform the requested services (including the request to eliminate spider infestations), notwithstanding its knowledge that the presence of spiders at the Restaurant \"posed a threat to the health and safety of the Restaurant's customers, employees and other visitors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 25, 2017, Ecolab not having eliminated the spiders infesting the Restaurant, Clement cleared the spider webs in and around the Restaurant himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. While doing so, Clement was bitten by what he identifies as a brown recluse spider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19. As a result of the spider bite, Clement suffered physical injuries and was forced to miss work, causing\n   him to incur economic damages.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is Clement's position that Ecolab's failure to respond to Clement's service calls of July and August 2017 unreasonably created a foreseeable risk of harm to Clement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26. It is further Clement's position that both Ecolab's failure to respond to Clement's service calls of July and August 2017 and its failure to provide pest elimination or pest control services in response to those calls constituted breach of the Agreement between Landry's and Ecolab, and that he was at all material times an intended beneficiary of that Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Ecolab's Evidentiary Proffer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In support of its motion for judgment on the pleadings, Ecolab proffers a redacted copy of the Agreement between Landry's and Ecolab. Because Clement's breach of contract claim arises directly out of Clement's allegations that Ecolab's complained-of conduct constituted breach of Ecolab's contractual obligations under the Agreement, and because Clement's complaint refers extensively to that Agreement, I deem the Agreement incorporated by reference into Clement's complaint, and consider Ecolab's motion together with Ecolab's supporting evidentiary proffer without first construing it as a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Hall v.

It appears to be undisputed that Landry's did not request that Ecolab develop programs for other pest issues beyond those specified above, including in connection with the control or elimination of spiders of any description, and that Landry's and Ecolab at no time entered into any material \"separate services agreement\" beyond the Agreement itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Agreement specifically provides that \"\n   <em>\n    Ecolab is only responsible for treating those specific pests which the parties have agreed to in writing\n   </em>\n   ,\" and further specifically provides that \"[i]f Ecolab treats for a pest not specifically listed in th[e Agreement], [Landry's'] only remedy for a new or continued problem relating to that pest will be a free retreatment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079517\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/992/#p998\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Exh.

Clement's Evidentiary Proffer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In support of his opposition to Ecolab's motion for judgment on the pleadings, Clement offers his own sworn declaration testimony that from time to time Ecolab has provided pest control services at the Restaurant in connection with the presence of spiders, both during the course of regularly scheduled services and as a result of specific service calls taking place between regularly scheduled services. Clement additionally offers copies of certain customer service reports and invoices issued by Ecolab to Landry's indicating that from time to time Ecolab provided pest control services including efforts to control spiders at the Restaurant. It is Clement's position as expressed by and through his opposition to Ecolab's motion for judgment on the pleadings that the course of conduct between Ecolab and Landry's (as described in his sworn declaration testimony and as memorialized in his documentary proffer) was effective to modify the Agreement such that, pursuant to the Agreement as so modified, Ecolab owed Landry's a duty to provide pest elimination and pest control services at the Restaurant in connection with spider infestations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   There is no sense in which either Clement's testimony or the facts to which he testifies may properly be deemed incorporated by reference into Clement's complaint.

If the plaintiff's claim is based solely on a breach of a provision in the contract, which itself spells out the party's obligation, then the remedy normally will be only in contract, with contract measures of damages and contract statutes of limitation.

Here, to the extent the duty of care Ecolab is alleged to have breached was its duty to respond to Clement's requests for services under the Agreement, its duty to perform the requested services in a \"timely and competent\" manner according to any metric created by Ecolab's obligations under the Agreement, or any duty to take action to treat known spider infestations at the Restaurant arising out of its relationship with Landry's as created or memorialized by and through the Agreement, his sole remedy necessarily lies as a matter of Oregon law in contract rather than in negligence. To that extent, his negligence claim is therefore without merit, and its deficiencies are not subject to cure by amendment. To the extent Clement's theory of negligence is premised on breach of a duty of care that exists as a creature of the Agreement, Ecolab's motion (# 23) is therefore granted as to the negligence claim, and the negligence claim is to that extent dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As noted above, Clement alternatively alleges Ecolab's breach of duty independent of the contract to prevent \"the Restaurant [from] continu[ing] in a dangerous condition despite the known risks, especially of spider bites,\" Complaint, \u00b6 26, or otherwise to take reasonable steps to prevent any foreseeable harm where the risk of such harm was created by Ecolab's own conduct. This alternative theory of Ecolab's negligence is likewise without merit. A non-party to the Agreement could be liable in negligence for failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate a known risk presented by an infestation of spiders at the Restaurant only to the extent the\n   known risk was created by the non-party's own conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2205396\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/306/484/#p490\">\n    306 Or. at 490-491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2205396\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/306/484/#p490\">\n    760 P.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fazzolari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175421\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/303/1/#p14\">\n    303 Or. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175421\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/303/1/#p14\">\n    734 P.2d 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Clement does not allege that Ecolab's own conduct created the presence of spiders at the Restaurant, but rather that Ecolab's conduct created the risk at issue only in that Ecolab failed to take steps to remove the spiders after learning about their presence. This theory of negligence necessarily begs the question of Ecolab's duty of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Absent a duty of care arising out of the parties' contractual relationship (breach of which would, as discussed above, sound in contract rather than in negligence), Ecolab's duty to prevent harm the risk of which was a foreseeable consequence of its own conduct is the same as that of any non-party to the Agreement. Because in the absence of a contractual duty of care, there is no sense in which Ecolab's failure to take action could have created the risk at issue here, Ecolab cannot be liable to Clement in negligence on a pure foreseeability theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2205396\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/306/484/#p490\">\n    306 Or. at 490-491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2205396\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/306/484/#p490\">\n    760 P.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fazzolari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175421\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/303/1/#p14\">\n    303 Or. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175421\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/303/1/#p14\">\n    734 P.2d 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In consequence, Clement's negligence claim fails on the face of Clement's pleading to the extent premised on breach of a duty of care that exists independently of the Agreement, and the deficiencies in Clement's allegations in support thereof are not subject to cure by amendment. Ecolab's motion (# 23) is therefore granted as to the negligence claim to the extent premised on a foreseeability theory, and the negligence claim is to that extent dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Ecolab's motion (# 23) for judgment on the pleadings is granted as to Clement's negligence claim and denied as to his breach of contract claim, and Clement's negligence claim is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Except where otherwise indicated, the following recitation constitutes my construal of the allegations of Clement's complaint in light of the legal standard governing motions for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Civil Procedure Rule 12(c).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
