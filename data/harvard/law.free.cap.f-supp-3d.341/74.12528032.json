(Am. Compl., ECF No. 7, \u00b6 6.) Early on, the Navy created a major landfill on the island-the Ordot Landfill-to support its mission, and this dump was used to dispose of munitions and chemicals, as well as military and civilian waste, for decades. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11.) As relevant here, by the time the United States government relinquished control of Guam to civilian authorities in the year 1950, the Ordot Landfill contained, and would continue to receive, significant quantities of trash and hazardous waste that posed a serious risk to the surrounding environment. As a protectorate of the United States, Guam is subject to U.S. environmental laws, and pursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"the EPA\") that arose under the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1387, the local Guamanian authorities shut down the Ordot Landfill in 2011, and commenced the arduous (and quite expensive) task of cleaning up the landfill and permanently containing its contents so as to prevent hazardous waste leaks that threatened rivers, waterways, and the Pacific Ocean.

Guam alleges that, because the United States substantially contributed to the environmental contamination at the Ordot Landfill, the United States should pay the full $160,000,000 cost of cleaning up the dump under CERCLA's section 107(a)'s cost-recovery mechanism (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United States' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Guam's Am. Compl. (\"Def.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 27-1.) In its motion to dismiss, the United States argues that Guam cannot compel the United States to pay for the closure and remediation of the Ordot Landfill under CERCLA's section 107(a) because, under the circumstances presented here, CERCLA only provides Guam with a claim for contribution under section 113(f)(3)(B) (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    at 28-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and, unfortunately for Guam, any such contribution action must be dismissed as untimely, per the applicable three-year statute of limitations (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    at 36-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States's argument hinges on the established view that section 107(a) claims and section 113(f)(3)(B) claims are mutually exclusive, and the contention that Guam's circumstances fit the latter provision, because Guam previously executed a 2004 Consent Decree with the EPA that purportedly \"resolve[d] its liability to the United States\" for the cleanup and closure of the Ordot Landfill, and the United States considers that agreement to be a cognizable \"settlement\" for section 113(f)(3)(B) purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(B). Guam responds that the 2004 Consent Decree did not \"resolve its liability\" within the meaning of section 113(f)(3)(B), nor does that agreement qualify as a CERCLA \"settlement,\" and thus, Guam maintains that it is not precluded from bringing a cost-recovery claim under section 107(a). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Government of Guam's Mem. in Opp'n to the United States of America's Mot. to Dismiss Guam's Am. Compl. (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"), ECF No. 30, at 15-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 30, 2018, this Court issued an Order that\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   the United States's motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 37.) This Memorandum Opinion explains the reasons for that Order. In short, the Court concludes that a cost-recovery action under section 107(a) remains available to Guam because the 2004 Consent Decree plainly left the issue of liability for the costs associated with the Ordot Landfill cleanup unresolved, and therefore, section 113(f)(3)(B)'s contribution mechanism was not triggered. Consequently, and to that extent, the Court finds that the United States's motion to dismiss Guam's cost-recovery claim under section 107(a) must be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Ordot Landfill\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Over one hundred years ago, the United States captured the island of Guam from Spain and began administering the island as a United States territory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 6.) Between 1898 and 1950, the United States Navy \"unilaterally governed and operated\" Guam (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and at some point during its administration of the island's operations, the Navy established the Ordot Landfill to dispose of the waste being generated on the island (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n    \u00b6 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In 1950, the Navy handed Guam, and the landfill, over to the newly-established civilian government (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n    \u00b6 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and the Guamanian authorities continued to operate the Ordot Landfill as a dump until the facility was officially closed in 2011 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n    \u00b6 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Notably, throughout its lifespan, the Ordot Landfill accepted waste from both military and civilian entities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n    \u00b6 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The Government of Guam alleges that the United States military deposited \"[s]ignificant quantities of munitions and chemicals\" at the dump, including hazardous substances such as DDT and Agent Orange. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the same time, the Ordot Landfill served as the only public dump site on the island of Guam until 2011 (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), and it appears that even though the landfill \"reached capacity in 1986, it continue[d] to receive virtually all of the industrial and municipal waste from the civilian population of Guam\" for a significant period of time thereafter,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gov't of Guam\n   </em>\n   , 02-00022,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20216918\">\n    2008 WL 216918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D. Guam Jan. 24, 2008). Thus, \"[w]hat was once a valley [became] at least a 280-foot mountain of trash.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20216918\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (describing the Ordot Landfill back in 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For present purposes, it is important to note that because the Ordot Landfill was built in the pre-World War II era, it was not designed with modern environmental practices in mind, and thus, did not have certain safeguards to shield the surrounding environment from contamination. For example, \"[d]uring its years of operation, the Ordot Landfill was ... uncapped at its top.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 12.) Consequently, \"[t]he landfill absorbed rain and surface water\" from storms and other sources, and this water \"percolated through the landfill and picked up contaminants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, since the landfill was also \"unlined on its bottom[,]\" the contaminated water-which is known as \"leachate\"-leaked out of the Ordot Landfill into the nearby Lonfit River, and the river carried hazardous materials from the landfill out into the Pacific Ocean. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The EPA has been aware of these and other environmental problems with the Ordot Landfill for many decades; indeed, the agency placed this site on the National Priorities List as far back as 1983, which indicated its \"priority [status] for the expenditure of funds to respond to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Moreover, starting in 1986, the EPA began issuing administrative orders under the CWA, directing Guam's civilian government to halt the further\n   discharge of contaminants from the Ordot Landfill into the rivers and oceans of Guam.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20216918\">\n    2008 WL 216918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Over the next fifteen years, the EPA regularly ordered Guam to devise a feasible plan for containing and disposing of the waste at the landfill, but Guam did not provide a plan that satisfied the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20216918\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The EPA's CWA Lawsuit And The Resulting Consent Decree\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The EPA finally filed a lawsuit against Guam in 2002, \"asserting that leachate was discharging from the Ordot Landfill into the Lonfit River and two of its tributaries\" in violation of the CWA. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 14.) The EPA's legal action sought (1) \"[a]n injunction ordering the Government of Guam to comply with the [CWA]\"; (2) civil monetary penalties; (3) and court orders that required Guam to file timely and complete applications for any required discharge permits and forbade Guam from allowing further unpermitted discharges from the landfill. (CWA Compl., Ex. 2 to Decl. of Matthew Woolner in Supp. of Def. United States' Mot. to Dismiss (\"Woolner Decl.\"), ECF No. 27-2, at 13 (Prayer for Relief).) Ultimately, rather than litigating these CWA claims in court, the parties entered into a consent decree in 2004 to resolve the EPA's lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2004 Consent Decree, Ex. 3 to Woolner Decl., ECF No. 27-2, at 16-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The 2004 Consent Decree between Guam and the EPA required Guam to pay a relatively modest civil penalty (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5); mandated that Guam close the Ordot Landfill and cease the discharge of pollutants into the Lonfit River (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8); and required Guam to construct a new municipal landfill to replace the Ordot Landfill (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Significantly for present purposes, despite imposing these obligations on Guam, the Consent Decree specifically provided that the agreement was \"based on the pleadings, before taking testimony or adjudicating any issue of fact or law, and without any finding or admission of liability against or by the Government of Guam[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (Therefore Clause).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The 2004 Consent Decree also contained a number of provisions that specified the claims that the EPA was relinquishing as part of the settlement and the rights the United States retained notwithstanding the parties' agreement. First, the Consent Decree expressly stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [e]ntry of this Consent Decree and compliance with the requirements herein shall be in full settlement and satisfaction of the civil judicial claims of the United States against the Government of Guam as alleged in the Complaint filed in this action through the date of the lodging of the Consent Decree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) The Consent Decree also provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [n]othing in this Consent Decree shall limit the ability of the United States to enforce any and all provisions of applicable federal laws and regulations for any violations unrelated to the claims in the Complaint or for any future events that occur after the date of lodging of this Consent Decree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) The Consent Decree further stated that \"[e]xcept as specifically provided herein, the United States does not waive any rights or remedies available to it for any violation by the Government of Guam of federal and territorial laws and regulations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In accordance with the terms of the Consent Decree, which, as noted, required the \"complete closure of [the] Ordot Dump\" and the \"implementation of [a] post-closure plan\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8(h) ), Guam began taking steps to close the Ordot Landfill and to put an end to the leaching of pollutants from that dump. Guamanian officials\n   officially ceased operations at the Ordot Landfill in 2011, and \"[r]emediation and closure work\" began \"in December 2013.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) That remediation work, \"which include[s] capping the landfill, installing storm water management ponds, leachate storage tanks and a sewer line, ... is still ongoing\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and \"Guam expects costs of remediation ... to exceed approximately $160,000,000\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On March 2, 2017, Guam filed the instant CERCLA action against the United States to recoup its landfill-closure and remediation costs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) On May 19, 2017, Guam filed the operative amended complaint, which contains three counts that collectively allege that the United States is liable for at least some, if not all, of the costs that Guam has incurred in closing and remediating the Ordot Landfill. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.) The first count contends that, because the United States Navy contributed hazardous waste to the Ordot Landfill and managed that landfill for many decades (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19), Guam is entitled to recover all of the \"removal and remediation costs\" it incurred at or \"related to the Ordot Landfill, plus interest\" from the United States pursuant to section 107(a) of the CERCLA (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). The second count seeks \"a declaratory judgment of liability\" to the effect that the United States will pay for Guam's future expenses relating to the remediation of the Ordot Landfill under CERCLA's section 113(g)(2). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 33.) The third count is a claim in the alternative for contribution under section 113(f)(3)(B) of CERCLA; Guam maintains that, even if it is not entitled to recover the full costs of remediation and closure of the Ordot Landfill, the United States must nevertheless pay \"for all [such] costs in excess of Plaintiff's fair and equitable share of costs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 27, 2017, the United States filed a motion to dismiss Guam's amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem.) In its motion, the United States first argues that Guam cannot recover its costs for remediating the Ordot Landfill under section 107(a) because Guam resolved its liability for that cleanup in the 2004 Consent Decree, and a contribution claim under section 113(f)(3)(B) is \"the exclusive CERCLA remedy for the costs a liable party is compelled to incur pursuant to a judicially-approved settlement with the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) The United States further asserts that, \"because CERCLA imposes a three-year statute of limitations on contribution claims[,]\" Guam \"waited far too long after settling its liability in 2004\" to bring its alternative claim for contribution under section 113(f)(3)(B). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) Thus, from the United States's perspective, Guam has no right to recover under either section 107(a) or section 113(f)(3)(B) at this time, and therefore, the Court should \"dismiss Guam's amended complaint with prejudice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Guam's opposition challenges the United States's understanding of the applicable law on several grounds. Most significantly, Guam argues that its right to maintain a contribution action under section 113(f)(3)(B) was never triggered because Guam had not \"resolved its liability ... [for] a response action or for some or all of the costs of such action\" in the context of \"an administrative or judicially approved settlement[,]\" as the text of section 113(f)(3)(B) requires. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 20.) Guam insists that the parties \"did not resolve response cost liability\" in the 2004 Consent Decree, because the provisions of that agreement left Guam fully exposed to future liability under CERCLA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-40.) Moreover, because the 2004 Consent Decree was \"expressly limited to the CWA\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16), Guam argues that it does not qualify as a \"settlement agreement\" giving rise to a cause of action for contribution under CERCLA's section 113(f)(3)(B) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-48). Indeed, Guam asserts that it has not heretofore pursued a contribution claim against the United States\n   <em>\n    precisely because\n   </em>\n   it is not entitled to do so, given that its liability for the Ordot Landfill cleanup costs remains unresolved.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In its motion to dismiss, the United States maintains that Guam is precluded from seeking cost-recovery under CERCLA's section 107(a) because the prescriptions of section 113(f)(3)(B) apply to the circumstances presented here. As noted, and as the amended complaint itself suggests, cost-recovery claims under CERCLA section 107(a) and contribution claims under CERCLA section 113(f)(3)(B) are exclusive of one another, such that Guam is permitted to proceed against the United States for full cost recovery under section 107(a) only if Guam's right to contribution under section 113(f)(3)(B) has not been triggered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the key questions that the pending motion to dismiss presents is whether the 2004 Consent Decree \"resolve[d] [Guam's] liability\" for the response action or response costs that Guam undertook with respect to the Ordot Landfill and also qualifies as a \"settlement\" within the meaning of section 113(f)(B)(3). (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 28-31 (discussing the resolution of liability issue)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-34 (arguing that a settlement under the CWA can trigger a section 113(f)(3)(B) action)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 22-40 (contending that Guam's liability for the Ordot Landfill cleanup costs was not resolved in the 2004 Consent Decree)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-47 (contending that a CWA consent decree cannot qualify as a \"settlement\" under section 113(f)(3)(B) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the reasons explained below, this Court concludes that the 2004 Consent Decree did not trigger Guam's contribution rights under section 113(f)(3)(B). In accordance with the persuasive reasoning of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits in CERCLA cases that are substantially similar to this one, this Court finds that whether or not an agreement for the removal or remediation of hazardous waste \"resolves\" liability for section 113(f)(3)(B) purposes turns on the terms of the agreement, and that, here, the 2004 Consent Decree did not resolve Guam's liability for the Ordot Landfill cleanup given the broad, open-ended reservation of rights, the plain non-admissions of liability, and the conditional resolution of liability that that agreement contains. Thus, the statutorily prescribed conditions for bringing a contribution claim under section 113(f)(3)(B) have not been satisfied, which means that Guam is not precluded from maintaining its section 107(a) claim against the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Furthermore, while the covenants not to sue warranted that the EPA would not proceed to sue the PRPs under section 107(a), the agreement \"conditioned\" that promise \"upon the complete and satisfactory performance\" of the terms of the AOC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715669\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/190/#p201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That AOC also stated that the agreement would not \"constitute any admission of liability by any (or all) of the Respondents nor any admission ... of the basis or validity of U.S. EPA's findings, conclusions or determinations[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715669\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/190/#p201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715669\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/190/#p201\">\n    at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, because the parties in\n   <em>\n    Bernstein\n   </em>\n   had included such a release in the agreements at issue, the agency argued that the agreements did, in fact, resolve the liability of the PRPs concerning the cleanup costs and remediation that the agreements addressed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bernstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715669\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/190/#p201\">\n    733 F.3d at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the EPA had argued that the AOCs resolved the PRPs liability because \"[i]n the AOCs, the settling PRPs promised to perform certain removal actions and EPA promised not to sue concerning those actions\").

Moreover, it is entirely possible that, from a PRP's perspective, the benefit derived from entering into a timely settlement agreement that disclaims any finding of liability outweighs the cost of obtaining the right to contribution under section 113(f)(3)(B), such that \"the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites\" that Congress plainly sought to promote,\n   <em>\n    Burlington N.\n   </em>\n   , 556 U.S. at 602,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653258\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/599/#p602\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , will occur nonetheless.

In any event,\n   <em>\n    resolution\n   </em>\n   of liability in the context of a settlement is plainly what the pertinent statutory provision demands in order for the right to contribution to be triggered, and instead of rewriting contractual agreements, courts should have faith that the relevant stakeholders can effect a prompt cleanup (as Congress prefers), in a manner that disclaims the PRP's liability for the response action (as the PRP desires) while also releasing any other claims (as the agency is willing to do), within the parameters of the law as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

This Court now turns its attention to various pertinent provisions of the 2004 Consent Decree-namely, its clear disclaimer of liability, its conditional release of liability for the claims the United States had brought against Guam in a CWA complaint, and two complementary reservation-of-rights clauses-and addresses whether, in light of these provisions, the parties to the 2004 Consent Decree can be said to have \"decided, determined, or settled\" the \"nature, extent, or amount\" of Guam's liability for the response actions or costs relating to the Ordot Landfill.\n   <em>\n    Bernstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715669\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/190/#p201\">\n    733 F.3d at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The 2004 Consent Decree's Disclaimer Of Liability, Broad Reservation-Of-Rights Clause, And Conditional Resolution Of Liability Are Not Indicative Of An Intent To Resolve Guam's Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The very first affirmative representation Guam and the EPA make in the 2004 Consent Decree (following an unremarkable series of \"Whereas\" clauses) is that the agreement itself is \"based on the pleadings, before taking testimony or adjudicating any issue of fact or law,\n   <em>\n    and without any finding or admission of liability against or by the Government of Guam\n   </em>\n   .\" (2004 Consent Decree 18, lines 7-9 (emphasis added).) This \"therefore\" provision leaves no room for ambiguity; it specifies exactly what materials the parties had access to at the time they signed the Consent Decree (few); which legal and factual issues remained unexamined (all of them); and what liability Guam is accepting by virtue of consenting to settlement (none). Thus, this contract language plainly reflects the parties' intention\n   <em>\n    to leave the question of liability unresolved\n   </em>\n   , despite the fact that Guam was proceeding to consent to engage in the immediate cleanup of the Ordot Landfill by virtue of entering into the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9(a) (requiring Guam to start taking steps within thirty days of the entry of the consent decree).)\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bernstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715669\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/190/#p201\">\n    733 F.3d at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"They agreed to perform certain actions in order to remedy an instance of environmental contamination. But they did not settle the issue of\n   <em>\n    liability\n   </em>\n   for that contamination[.]\" (emphasis in original) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The argument that Guam \"resolved its liability\" to the United States by executing the 2004 Consent Decree is thus facially untenable. But that conclusion becomes even more far-fetched when one considers the broad reservation of rights that the EPA inserted into this contract. The 2004 Consent Decree agreement specifically provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [n]othing in this Consent Decree shall limit the ability of the United States to enforce any and all provisions of applicable federal laws and regulations for any violations\n   <em>\n    unrelated to the claims in the Complaint\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    for any future events that occur after the date of lodging of this Consent Decree\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (2004 Consent Decree \u00b6 46 (emphasis added).) And presumably to reinforce the point that Guam could still be held potentially liable notwithstanding the settlement, the Consent Decree also states that \"[e]xcept as specifically provided herein, the United States\n   <em>\n    does not waive any rights or remedies available to it for any violation by the Government of Guam of federal and territorial laws and regulations\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Much like the disclaimer of liability clause, the takeaway from these two provisions in the 2004 Consent Decree is that the United States was reserving its right to pursue\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   violation of law that Guam may have committed other than those articulated in the 2002 CWA complaint to which the settlement agreement was addressed, and the scope of the 2002 CWA complaint was similarly clear: it asserted that Guam was liable under the CWA and should be ordered to pay monetary penalties and to cease the discharge of hazardous chemicals into the Lonfit River. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CWA Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-27, 34-35, Prayer for Relief.) Thus, the careful wording of the 2004 Consent Decree's reservation-of-rights clause makes clear that the United States retained its rights to sue Guam under countless other environmental statutes for the response actions and costs relating to any cleanup at the Ordot Landfill, and it can hardly be viewed as evidencing the parties' intention that\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   settlement agreement resolved Guam's liability for any response costs or response actions that those other statutes might demand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fla.

Again, the parties clearly contemplated Guam's compliance with the 2004 Consent Decree as settling and satisfying\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the CWA claims that the EPA had brought against Guam. And because Guam was plainly left fully exposed to other environmental suits and allegations-say, a subsequent suit brought by the United States to recover costs under CERCLA section 107(a)-the language above cannot be reasonably interpreted to evince the parties' intent that the 2004 Consent Decree resolved Guam's liability for the response costs or actions associated with the cleanup of the Ordot Landfill under section 107(a) or any other statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Also noteworthy is the fact that paragraph 45 of the 2004 Consent Decree explicitly conditions the resolution of whatever\n   CWA liability that the 2004 Consent Decree addresses on both the \"[e]ntry of this Consent Decree\n   <em>\n    and compliance with the requirements herein\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).) Thus, the agreement could not be clearer that the \"entry of this Consent Decree\"\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   does not settle or resolve any of the claims against Guam-that is, whatever circumstances might be inferred from a general conditional covenant not to sue,\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   agreement states that the resolution of Guam's liability for the specified claims does not occur until Guam has actually complied with all of the Consent Decree's requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In short, it is clear to this Court that, taken together, the terms of the 2004 Consent Decree do not support the conclusion that Guam and the EPA intended to resolve Guam's liability for any response actions or costs relating to the Ordot Landfill. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (Therefore Clause), \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 48.) Under the terms of that settlement, Guam and the United States unquestionably reached a consensus that Guam would engage in certain response actions to clean up and remediate the dump, but the 2004 Consent Decree does not decide-much less determine with finality and certainty-who bears the ultimate responsibility for the costs of that cleanup.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bernstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715669\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/190/#p201\">\n    733 F.3d at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, the 2004 Consent Decree did not \"resolve[ ]\" Guam's \"liability\" within the meaning of section 113(f)(3)(B), and absent such a resolution, Guam can maintain its cost-recovery claim under section 107(a), given that the six-year statute of limitations for the remediation and recovery actions that Guam has and is taking has not even begun to run.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The United States's Argument That The 2004 Consent Decree Resolved Guam's Liability Distorts Both The Provisions Of That Contract And Relevant Case Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To resist the above conclusion, the United States makes several pointed arguments that are largely aimed at the just-discussed provisions of the 2004 Consent Decree. In this Court's view, each of Defendant's arguments either warps the underlying text of CERCLA and/or the 2004 Consent Decree beyond recognition, or advances a dubious reading of case law from the courts of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For example, the United States maintains that, because the 2004 Consent Decree \"resolved Guam's liability for the civil penalties paid and the injunctive relief performed under the decree,\" it should be construed as having resolved Guam's liability for the purpose of CERCLA's section 113(f)(3)(B). (Def.'s Reply at 19.) But as has already been explained, CERCLA has its own (strict) liability provision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the complaint that the 2004 Consent Decree settles requested only civil monetary penalties and an injunction requiring Guam to bring the Ordot Landfill\n   <em>\n    into compliance with the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CWA\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CWA Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-27, 34-35, Prayer for Relief.) Consequently, under the terms of the agreement, once Guam completes the response activities laid out in the 2004 Consent Decree, it will have resolved its liability\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   with respect to the prescribed fines and any outstanding obligation to bring the landfill into compliance with the CWA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2004 Consent Decree \u00b6 7 (stating that \"[t]he Government of Guam shall correct all compliance problems that form the basis for the Complaint filed in this action by undertaking the action identified below within the specified times\").) The allocation of costs for CERCLA purposes is not covered, and thus would remain unresolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In a similarly bewildering reading of the agreement between Guam and the EPA, the United States argues that the 2004 Consent Decree contains no \"specific covenant not to sue, let alone one\" that resolves liability \"in a conditional manner.\" (Def.'s Reply at 24.) Yet, as the United States readily admits (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), the consent decree explicitly states that \"entry of this consent decree\n   <em>\n    and compliance with the requirements herein\n   </em>\n   shall be in full settlement and satisfaction of\" the complaint's claims (2004 Consent Decree \u00b6 45 (emphasis added) ). This language establishes duties that are inherently conditional-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , no release of liability will actually occur until (1) the Consent Decree has been entered, and (2) Guam has fully complied with the terms of the Consent Decree. And because the removal and remediation work required in the 2004 Consent Decree is still ongoing (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 14), it is still possible for Guam to fall out of compliance with the 2004 Consent Decree-a circumstance that would seemingly resuscitate the United States's CWA claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fla.

(Def.'s Reply at 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22.) This Court has dutifully compared the clauses in each of those cases with the reservation-of-rights clause at issue here, and it cannot agree with the United States's characterization. In\n   <em>\n    ITT Industries\n   </em>\n   , \"the EPA expressly reserve[d] its rights to legal action to adjudicate Plaintiff's liability for failure to comply with the AOC, for costs of response (past, present or future), for costs of injunctive relief of enforcement, criminal liability, and other damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046932\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/452/#p459\">\n    506 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   459 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046932\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/452/#p459\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"U.S. EPA retains all of its rights under this Consent Order and CERCLA[.]\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). The reservation of rights in\n   <em>\n    Florida Power\n   </em>\n   was similar; it \"broadly reserved [the EPA's] right to take any enforcement action pursuant to CERCLA or any other available legal authority ... for any violation of law or this Consent Order.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060667\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/996/#p1006\">\n    810 F.3d at 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Neither of these reservation-of-rights clauses is any broader than the one at issue in this case. Although no mention of CERCLA is made in the relevant portions of the 2004 Consent Decree, the EPA expressly reserved its rights \"to enforce any and all provisions of applicable federal laws and regulations for\n   <em>\n    any violations unrelated to the claims in the Complaint\n   </em>\n   \" (2004 Consent Decree \u00b6 46 (emphasis added) ), which patently includes any violations under CERCLA, and to be doubly clear, the agreement also stated that \"except as specifically provided herein, the United States\n   <em>\n    does not waive any rights or remedies\n   </em>\n   available to it for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   violation ... of federal and territorial laws and regulations\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48 (emphasis added) ). Therefore, it appears that the United States has discerned a material difference where there is none:\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of these provisions plainly reserve the right of the United States to take any other action against the signatory of the agreement for any violation of law, and if the 2004 Consent Decree is narrower, it is only marginally so, given that the United States only expressly waived its ability to seek the monetary penalties and compliance actions that it requested for the CWA violations that were specified in the underlying complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In the final analysis, then, the 2004 Consent Decree between Guam and the EPA did not \"resolve[ ]\" Guam's \"liability\" within the meaning of section 113(f)(3)(B), as evidenced principally by the following provisions: (1) the statement disclaiming any admission of liability on Guam's part (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (Therefore Clause) ); (2) the broad reservation-of-rights clauses that benefited the United States (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48); and (3) the omission of any language that immediately and effectively insulated Guam from future lawsuits by the EPA under CERCLA sections 106(a) and 107(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For the reasons explained above, this Court has concluded that, in order to resolve liability within the meaning of CERCLA section 113(f)(3)(B), a settlement agreement must \"decide[ ], determine[ ], or settle[ ]\" the \"nature, extent, or amount of a PRP's liability,\"\n   <em>\n    Bernstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715669\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/190/#p201\">\n    733 F.3d at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that the 2004 Consent Decree between Guam and the EPA failed to do so because the provisions within that agreement-from a conditional release of liability to an overly broad reservation of rights to a clear non-admission of liability-demonstrate that the parties did not reach an agreement as to\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   Guam was liable for the cost of the Ordot Landfill cleanup, much less determine the scope of its liability. Consequently, Guam's right to contribution under section 113(f)(3)(B) has not yet been triggered, which means that it is not precluded from proceeding via a cost-recovery action under section 107(a). As a result, this Court determined, on September 30, 2018, that the United States's motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6) must be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    In the context of CERCLA, courts commonly refer to the cost-recovery claim embodied in section 9607(a) of Title 42 of the United States Code as a \"section 107(a)\" action and they call the contribution claim embodied in section 9613(f)(3)(B) of Title 42 of the United States Code a \"section 113(f)(3)(B)\" action.
