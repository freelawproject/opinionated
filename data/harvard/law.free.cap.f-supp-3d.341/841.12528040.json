Hiscox is funding BRCI's defense in ten underlying cases in various state courts, all involving the alleged unlawful mishandling and/or sale of human body parts. Hiscox brought this suit seeking a declaratory judgment as to the scope of BRCI's liability coverage and asserting different theories to limit that coverage. [1]. Hiscox has now moved for partial judgment on the pleadings on Count I of its complaint, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Policy's $2 million single \"Claim\" limit applies to all ten underlying cases, and that it is therefore no longer obligated to provide coverage. For the reasons explained below, this Court grants Hiscox's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Hiscox asserts that the underlying cases constitute a single \"Claim\" under the terms of the Policy, and thus are subject to the policy's $2 million \"Each Claim\" limit of liability, rather than only the Policy's $3 million aggregate liability limit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Count II seeks a declaration that BRCI has waived its right to assert that multiple \"Each Claim\" limits of liability apply based upon BRCI's alleged acquiescence to Hiscox's classification of the complaints as a single \"Claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 116-28. Similarly, Count III seeks a declaration that BRCI should be estopped from asserting multiple \"Each Claim\" limits of liability, and further requests that this Court award Hiscox the amount it has expended in excess of $2 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 129-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In March 2018, Hiscox moved for partial judgment on the pleadings as to Count I [15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

BRCI disputes that its alleged conduct was \"continuous, repeated or related.\" [21] at 9-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This Court's analysis focuses on the meaning of the word \"related.\" The Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Gregory v.

It then instructed that, although \"[a]t some point\" a \"logical connection may be too tenuous reasonably to be called a relationship,\" it needed not impose \"such a drastic restriction of the natural scope\" of the term.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534930\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/602/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While\n   <em>\n    Gregory\n   </em>\n   involved Indiana law, the Illinois Court of Appeals has also embraced a concept of relatedness that incorporates both logical and causal connections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cont'l Cas.

App. Ct. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Given the breadth of the term \"related,\" as interpreted in Illinois and by the Seventh Circuit, this Court agrees with Hiscox that the underlying cases here arise out of BRCI's alleged acts of mishandling decedents' bodies, and that these alleged acts are \"related\" under the Policy. The underlying complaints vary in their precise wording, but all allege that: (1) BRCI promised to use the decedents' bodies for education and/or scientific research; (2) BRCI made false representations and breached the duty it undertook when it mishandled and/or sold the bodies; and (3) the plaintiffs discovered BRCI's allegedly wrongful conduct following a January 2015 FBI raid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1-1]-[1-10]. Thus, the underlying cases are all based upon allegations of the same specific course of conduct. This Court finds the underlying cases plainly \"related\" under the policy terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Various persuasive authorities support this Court's finding that a single course of conduct can provide the basis to deem multiple claims \"related.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Med. Sec., Inc. v. Exec. Risk Specialty Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8907171\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/393/693/#p707\">\n    393 F.Supp.2d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707 (E.D. Wis. 2005) (finding 39 underlying suits \"clearly 'related' \" where they were all based upon the insured's underwriting practice of marketing and selling certain policies as group health insurance);\n   <em>\n    Cont'l Casualty Co. v.

Underwriters, Inc. v. Davies Lemmis Raphaely Law Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331445\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/162/1068/#p1078\">\n    162 F.Supp.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1078 (C.D. Cal. 2016) (seven different underlying cases constituted a single \"claim\" where they all arose from a \"single course of conduct, a unified policy of making alleged affirmative misrepresentations to investors in order to induce them to invest in commercial real estate.\"),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407064\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/708/374/\">\n    708 F. App'x 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In its response, BRCI disputes that the underlying cases can be considered a single \"Claim\" because some variation exists among them. BRCI argues that the underlying cases \"challenge different anatomical donations involving different gifting documents executed at different times by different persons involving different witnesses and made under different circumstances.\" [21] at 1, 13-14. BRCI, however, cites no case law to support its argument that any of these differences (or a combination of some or all of them) means the underlying cases are not \"related.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This Court rejects BRCI's reasoning. That BRCI may have sold different decedents' body parts at different times, or that it may have executed different gifting agreements with different witnesses under different circumstances, does not make the claims unrelated. Each of the underlying cases alleges a specific course of wrongdoing: BRCI's unauthorized mishandling and/or sale of body parts. In any meaningful sense of the word, these alleged acts of wrongdoing are \"related.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   BRCI's other argument-that the underlying cases assert different theories of liability-is equally unavailing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. Again, BRCI cites no authority to support the notion that underlying complaints must assert the exact same legal theories of liability to be considered a single \"Claim.\" Nor could it, as courts have found that claims can be \"related\" even if they assert different causes of action and arise from different bad acts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gregory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534930\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/602/\">\n    876 F.2d at 602-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (class action suit alleging violations of securities laws, RICO, and common law fraud, and another suit alleging professional negligence, were \"related\");\n   <em>\n    In re DBSI, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-12687 PJW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203022177\">\n    2011 WL 3022177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Bankr. D. Del. July 22, 2011) (\"Claims may be related even if they allege different types of causes of action and arise from different acts.\");\n   <em>\n    WFS Fin., Inc. v. Progressive Cas. Ins.

App'x 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625 (9th Cir. 2007) (suits alleged \"interrelated wrongful acts\" where they had a \"common basis,\" even though they were \"filed by two different sets of plaintiffs in two different fora under two different legal theories\"). Likewise, this Court will not stretch the reading of the word \"related\" to require the underlying cases to allege the exact same theories of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Policy's Limit Has Been Exhausted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The single \"Claim\" limit in the Policy is $2 million. [1-1] at 1. And, \"Claim Expenses,\" which include \"all reasonable and necessary fees, costs and expenses, including the fees of attorneys and experts, incurred by or on behalf of [Hiscox] in the investigation, defense, appeal and settlement of a Claim against the Insured,\" erode the Policy's limit. [1-11] at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   BRCI admits that Hiscox has paid more than $2 million in \"Claim Expenses\" in defending the underlying cases. [13] \u00b6\u00b6 8, 114. Therefore, because this Court finds that the underlying cases constitute a single \"Claim\" under the Policy, it also concludes that the Policy's limit is exhausted. Hiscox thus has no further duty to defend or indemnify BRCI under the Policy as to the underlying cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the reasons explained above, this Court grants Hiscox's motion for partial judgment on the pleadings [15].\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Claims-made liability policies \"limit coverage to claims made during the policy period.\"\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. Baker &amp; McKenzie\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878777\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/305/#p306\">\n     997 F.2d 305\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 306 (7th Cir. 1993). Because the first of the underlying cases was filed May 27, 2015, [1] \u00b6 30, the 2014-2017 policy is the only one at issue here. [1-11]. While BRCI references other earlier claims-made policies Hiscox issued to it in its Answer,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    [13] at 43, none of them are relevant to this dispute because their effective dates precede 2015,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    [26-1]-[26-6].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
