DIMITROULEAS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Defendant Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. (\"Defendant\" or \"RJA\")'s Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 51]. The Court has carefully considered the Motion, Plaintiff Jyll Brink (\"Brink\" or \"Plaintiff\")'s Response [DE 66/69], Defendant's Reply [DE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   80/82], Defendant's statement of facts and Plaintiff's opposition thereto [DE's 52, 67/70], the evidence submitted in the record, arguments by counsel at the October 5, 2018 hearing, and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 17, 2015, Plaintiff Jyll Brink, on her own behalf and on behalf of those similarly situated (collectively, the \"Customers\" or \"putative Class Members\"), filed the instant action against Defendant RJA. A First Amended Class Action Complaint was filed on September 18, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [DE 124]. Plaintiff asserts that RJA Customers were charged an unauthorized and unreasonable \"Processing Fee,\" sometimes labelled as a \"Misc. Fee,\" by RJA when it executed trades for these Customers in their \"Passport Investment Account Program\" (hereinafter the \"Passport Account\") - RJA's commission free based account. Plaintiff claims that, despite the fact that the Passport Agreement expressly provides that \"Processing Fees are not commissions,\" in fact, \"the Processing Fee charged by Raymond James contained up to a 1000% mark-up for profit in some instances (and a significant mark-up in all instances), and as such, was transaction based remuneration to Raymond James - an unauthorized commission in an account that is supposed to be commission free.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [DE 124].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges two claims against RJA pertaining to the processing fee: a claim for breach of contract (Count I) and a claim for negligence (Count II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant now moves for summary judgment as to both claims. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and negligence fail under Florida's voluntary payment doctrine because Plaintiff voluntarily, and without protest, paid RJA the Processing Fees at issue. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's negligence claim also fails because it is actually a claim under a private exchange rule that does not grant a private right of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under Rule 56(a), \"[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its summary judgment motion, Defendant submits that there are no disputed issues of material fact and it is entitled to summary judgment in its favor as to both claims. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and negligence fail under Florida's voluntary payment doctrine because Plaintiff voluntarily, and without protest, paid RJA the Processing Fees at issue. Defendant also contends that Plaintiff's negligence claim fails because it is actually a claim under a private exchange rule that does not grant a private right of action. The Court will address these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    I. Whether Florida's Voluntary Payment Doctrine Bars Plaintiff's Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff's claims that RJA beached the Passport Agreement every time it charged its Passport Account Customers a Processing Fee per transaction which was far in excess of the actual costs associated with executing and clearing of Customer's transactions,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by taking what amounts to a \"disguised commission.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its June 29, 2015 Order Denying Motion to Dismiss, to Strike, and for More Definite Statement, the Court found that Plaintiff sufficiently stated a claim for breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [DE 27]. The Court explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   RJA argues that Plaintiff fails to specify a provision of the parties' contract that RJA allegedly breached, that no provision exists in the Passport Agreement that RJA actually breached under the facts alleged in the Complaint, and that the Passport Agreement's express terms directly contradict Plaintiff's offered interpretation of the parties' contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court disagrees.

Moreover, to the extent that there is any ambiguity as to whether the parties' contract would allow RJA to charge, in the commission-free Passport Accounts, a Processing Fee per transaction which was far in excess of the actual costs associated with executing and clearing of Customers' transactions, the Court would construe any such ambiguity against RJA, as the drafter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Knutson v.

However, at this stage of the litigation, Plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on this claim, in the form of proffered expert testimony on the standard of care owed by similar professionals in the community of broker-dealers to customer/account holders such as Plaintiff, which include the duties to accurately disclose the fees and services for which Plaintiff was being charged, to not misrepresent\n   the cost of service provided to Plaintiff, and to not compute the actual cost after the fact for purposes of trying to justify an improper and unauthorized charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Accordingly, Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the negligence claim shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
