On April 1, 2015, the Plaintiff 504 Redevelopment LLC filed the instant action in state court [ECF No. 4] against SBA Communications Corporation and Prime Investment Management Corporation (\"Prime\"). The case was removed to federal court and the Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its claims against Prime [ECF No. 10]. On June 20, 2018, the Court granted the parties' stipulated motion to substitute the Defendant SBA Site Management, LLC, for SBA Communications Corporation [ECF No. 47].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant breached an antenna roof top management agreement relating to property owned by the Plaintiff (Count II), and seeks a declaratory judgment that the agreement is not enforceable against the Plaintiff (Count I), and ejectment of the Defendant from the property (Count III). On February 15, 2018, the Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment [ECF No. 35]. On April 3, 2018, the Plaintiff filed its response to the Defendant's motion for summary judgment, which contained a cross-motion for summary judgment [ECF No. 39 (Pl. Resp.) ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motions have been fully briefed and are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2010, nonparty EFN Gary Property, LLC (\"EFN\") owned the commercial building located at 504 Broadway, Gary, Indiana (\"Property\"). On June 10, 2010, EFN entered into an Antenna Site Roof Top Management Agreement (\"Agreement\") with Prime pursuant to which EFN allowed Prime to rent roof top and certain interior space of the Property (\"Premises\") to tenants for purposes of placing equipment that transmits and receives radio communications signals in exchange for the upfront payment of $600,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [ECF No. 36-2 (Agreement), \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5.] The Agreement defines \"Premises\" as \"[t]he areas shown as outlined on the floor plans attached and as further described on Exhibit A together with the non-exclusive right of use of the common areas of the Building and exclusive right of use of the roof except as described herein.\" (Agreement at 1.) Exhibit A to the Agreement includes a written description of the Premises as well as outlined floor plans of the roof top and floors 7-10 of the building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at SBA000049-54.) The term of the Agreement is 99 years.

Upon an Event of Default, the Building Owner has the option to terminate the Agreement, in which event the Manager shall immediately surrender all spaces used by the Manager in the building, including but not limited to, the Premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 11(2)(i).) Other available remedies include invoking any remedy allowed at law or in equity, including injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 11(2)(iii).) \"Neither party shall be deemed to have waived any obligations by the other party unless such waiver expressly is set forth in a written instrument signed by the other party.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section 15 of the Agreement addresses assignment and subletting: \"Manager may assign, sublet or otherwise transfer all or any part of its interest in this Agreement or in the Premises subject to the assignee assuming all of Manager's obligations herein....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 15.) Section 18 provides that \"[t]he provisions of this Agreement, except as herein otherwise specifically provided, shall extend to, bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto\n   and their respective personal representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 18). The Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Indiana. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   EFN and Prime also executed a Memorandum of Roof Top Lease Agreement (\"Memorandum\") [ECF No. 36-3 (Mem.) ]. The Memorandum was recorded in the Lake County Recorder's Office on June 25, 2010. The Memorandum states that EFN and Prime entered into the Agreement for a term of 99 years, and attaches Exhibit A to the Agreement, which describes the Premises and the easement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Premises shall consist of any and all rooftop areas of the [Property] including the penthouse structure located on the roof (Exhibit A-5), all of Suites indicated on Exhibits A-1 through A-4, and the right to utilize an additional 2,500 sq. ft. of reserved space as defined in Exhibit A-4. Building Owner further grants Manager a non-exclusive easement over and through the Building for the placement of transmission lines, utility lines, cable bridges and utilities from the Roof Top to its Equipment Shelter or to existing utility services necessary for the operation of Manager's or Manager's tenant's Communication Facilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Mem. at SBA000061.) It also includes the highlighted floor plans of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On or about September 22, 2010, Prime assigned all of its rights, title, claim and interest in the Agreement to the Defendant via an Assignment and Assumption of Roof Top Lease (\"Assignment Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   [ECF No. 36-4.] The Assignment Agreement was recorded in the Lake County Recorder's Office on October 7, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In early 2014, the Plaintiff purchased the Property from EFN. [ECF No. 39-10 (Kenney Aff.), \u00b6 2.] The Plaintiff was aware of the Agreement when it purchased the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Plaintiff reviewed the Agreement as part of its due diligence in acquiring the Property, and was aware that the Agreement's fee had been prepaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 19, 2015, the Plaintiff sent the Defendant a Notice of Demand for Information, Site Repairs, and Cure of Material Breaches (\"Demand Letter\"). [ECF No. 36-7 (Demand Letter).] The Demand Letter asserts that the Defendant was in default of the Agreement for failing to maintain portions of the Premises in a safe, clean, and orderly fashion. It attaches two written assessments of the Premises. The assessment dated April 11, 2013, suggests maintenance to the lattice towers on the Premises (\"2013 Assessment\"). The assessment dated February 18, 2015, suggests repairs and maintenance to several areas on the Premises (\"2015 Assessment\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Demand Letter demands that the Defendant perform all necessary maintenance and repairs raised by the assessments within twenty days pursuant to section 9 of the Agreement, and states that it considers the failure to perform the required maintenance to be a breach of the Agreement under section 11. It asserts that the breaches \"must be cured within thirty (30) days of this Notice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Defendant hired a contractor who conducted the repairs and cleanup work on the Premises. On April 1, 2015, the Plaintiff signed an acknowledgement of the contractor's site clean-up activities and failed to note any new conditions found as a result of the site clean-up activities. [ECF No. 36-9 (Acknowledgement).] On that same day, the Plaintiff commenced this action in state court [ECF No. 4 (Compl.) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Plaintiff's managing partner Vance R. Kenney (\"Kenney\") testified that all needed repairs had been remedied at the point of his deposition in September 2017. [ECF No. 36-6 (Kenney Dep.) at 53.] His affidavit states that \"[w]hile [the Defendant] commenced some remedial action within the given time period, a substantial majority of necessary repairs and maintenance were completed long after the thirty day period allowed by the Lease.\" (Kenney Aff., \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Summary judgment is warranted when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

These facts support the parties' intent that the Agreement run with the land. The Plaintiff asserts that the Agreement was not intended to run with the land because it has a term of 99 years. The Court disagrees. At least one Indiana court has found that a covenant's term of 25 years \"support[ed] the conclusion that the covenantors' intent was that the restrictive covenants were to run with the land.\"\n   <em>\n    Oakes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10900472\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/631/949/#p951\">\n    631 N.E.2d at 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The substantially longer 99-year term similarly supports the conclusion that the parties intended that the leasehold interest would run with the land. Given the language of the Agreement and the recording of the Memorandum, it is improbable that EFN and Prime intended the Agreement to be purely personal and not binding on subsequent grantees of the land. Thus, the Court finds that the facts surrounding the Agreement and the language used in it demonstrate an intent to create a covenant running with the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

Under the Agreement, the original covenantor EFN was landlord to covenantee\n   Prime. Section 15 of the Agreement provides: \"Manager [Prime] may assign, sublet or otherwise transfer all or any part of its interest in this Agreement or in the Premises subject to the assignee assuming all of Manager's obligations herein....\" (Agreement, \u00a7 15.) This provision expressly permits Prime to assign the Agreement. No similar assignment right was expressly provided to EFN. Citing no supporting legal authority, the Plaintiff maintains that EFN could not assign the Agreement, and thus, the Agreement allegedly prohibits EFN from creating privity as a landlord to subsequent title holders. In other words, the Plaintiff contends that because EFN could not assign the Agreement, the Plaintiff does not have the same landlord-tenant relationship with the Defendant that EFN had with Prime. But section 18 of the Agreement states that \"[t]he provisions of this Agreement, except as herein otherwise specifically provided, shall extend to, bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective personal representatives, heirs,\n   <em>\n    successors\n   </em>\n   and permitted assigns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 18 (emphasis added).) The Plaintiff ignores the term \"successors\" in this provision, and focuses on the \"permitted assigns\" as those permitted only by Prime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Defendant responds that EFN was allowed to assign the Agreement because the Agreement is silent on the issue, and cites authorities addressing a lessee's ability to assign a lease in the absence of a limiting language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 Ind.

The Defendant hired a contractor who conducted repairs approximately two weeks later, on April 1, 2015. On that same day, the Plaintiff commenced this action. The Plaintiff cites the 2013 Assessment as evidence that the Defendant had been in breach of the Agreement for almost two years prior to filing the lawsuit, and insists that it would be illogical to bar it from asserting breaches of the Agreement that had remained unresolved for years [ECF No. 45 (Pl. Reply) at 4]. The Defendant explains that the 2013 Assessment was prepared at its request before the Plaintiff acquired the Property, and relates to the conditions of lattice towers located on the roof of the building which are not part of the Premises or other occupant's personal property, and therefore, their condition could not constitute a breach of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Regardless of existence of the 2013 Assessment, the Plaintiff did not trigger the notice of default provision (and the remedies available under section 11(2) ) until it provided the Defendant with written notice of the alleged breaches of the Agreement on March 19, 2015. Per the terms of the Agreement, an Event of Default does not occur until the Defendant's failure to comply with the Agreement \"continue[s] for a\n   period of thirty (30) days after written notice of such default is given.\" (Agreement, \u00a7 11(1).) When the Plaintiff commenced this action on April 1, 2015, the thirty day cure period had not passed, and thus, no Event of Default had occurred. Because the Agreement requires notice and an opportunity to remedy before an Event of Default occurs, they are conditions precedent to commencing an action based on an alleged Event of Default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shadeland Hills Dev.

The Defendant relies on the Acknowledgment dated April 1, 2015, to assert that its contractor had completed all maintenance and repairs by that date, and that the improved condition of the building was acknowledged by the Plaintiff. The Acknowledgement states that \"Griff EE, Inc. contracted to remove abandoned telecommunications equipment\" on the Property. [ECF No. 36-9 at 2.] The Plaintiff signed it, \"acknowledge[ing] that the photos taken ...

(Kenney Dep. at 53.) In his affidavit, Kenney states that the Defendant \"commenced some remedial action within the given time period,\" and that \"a substantial majority of necessary repairs and maintenance were completed long after the thirty day period allowed by the [Agreement].\" (Kenney Aff., \u00b6 3.) Aside from this general statement, the Plaintiff fails to identify or offer any evidence of repairs or maintenance that were completed after the thirty day time period. \"It is well established that in order to withstand summary judgment, the non-movant must allege\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   facts creating a genuine issue for trial and may not rely on vague, conclusory allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Gabrielle M. v.

Given that the Plaintiff signed an acknowledgement that repairs were conducted on April 1, 2015, and fails to identify any repairs that were not completed by that date, Kenney's vague testimony as to the timing of the repairs is insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the Defendant completed the repairs within the thirty day cure period set by the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sommerfield v.

[ECF No. 36 at 12 (quoting Pl. Interrog. Resp. No. 9).] The Plaintiff responds that it \"does not seek to recapture monetary damages in this lawsuit,\" but rather, requests ejectment based on the Defendant's default and termination of the Agreement. (Pl. Resp. at 7 n.2.)

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15--17.) The Defendant argues that because there is no breach of the Agreement, the Plaintiff has no basis for its ejectment claim. The Court agrees. Because the Court grants summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, the ejectment claim similarly fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 35], and DENIES the Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 39].
