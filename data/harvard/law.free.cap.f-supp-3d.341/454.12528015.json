Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 31, 2017, minutes before the scheduled 6:00 p.m. start of trick-or-treating for the children of York, Pennsylvania on Halloween evening, Officer Steven Pickel (\"Officer Pickel\"), a patrol officer employed by the York City Police Department, was on routine patrol in the west end neighborhood of York. (Doc. No. 44 at 4:1-25, 5:1-3.) The west end is a high-crime area and, in Officer Pickel's assessment, experiences \"a lot of drug incidents, shooting incidents, homicides, aggravated assaults, burglaries, [and] robberies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:24-25, 6:1-2.) As a patrol officer, Officer Pickel regularly \"receive[s] reports of shots fired in the west end area\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:7-8), and during the months of October and November, he receives \"reports of shots fired ... multiple days per week\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:19-22). While a nearby neighborhood known as the college area also experiences a high level of crime, that criminal activity consists largely of \"burglaries, vehicle thefts, [and other] things of that nature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:20-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A few minutes before 6:00 p.m., just as the sun was going down, in a neighborhood of York that \"bridges the gap between the college area and the west end\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:10-13), Officer Pickel traveled west on King's Mill Road and \"turned north onto South Penn Street\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:20-21). As he turned the corner to proceed north onto South Penn Street, he encountered \"a male in a black car\" who \"threw ... both his arms out the window\" to flag down Officer Pickel, and did so in an excited manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   7:20-24, 58:1-9.) The eyewitness's hand gestures caused Officer Pickel to think \"that he was trying to flag [him] down to speak with [him].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:1-3.) Upon being confronted by the eyewitness, Officer Pickel stopped to talk to the eyewitness from his police vehicle, as the eyewitness \"had his window rolled down where he had his hands out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:11-13.) Officer Pickel recalled that the eyewitness \"was an older black gentleman\" with \"a salt-and-pepper beard\" who was wearing \"a black peacoat type jacket.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:15-17.) As to his conversation with the eyewitness, Officer Pickel testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   He told me - so he pointed and told me that - there was a male that was walking on the bridge, which was the east side of the bridge. He was the only pedestrian on the bridge. And he told me that that male, who was wearing a black jacket with his hood up, blue jeans, and black sneakers, pulled a gun out of his, out of like - like, off his person and fired it twice into the old factory building which is across the street on the west side.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:19-25, 9:1.) Officer Pickel further testified that he confirmed with the eyewitness that he was referring to the individual walking on the bridge, and that the eyewitness was \"adamant\" that this individual had \"fired two rounds\" into the building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:11-17.) Officer Pickel subsequently identified the man to whom the eyewitness was referring as Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Pickel then \"radioed to county control\" for assistance, knowing that at that time of the day, there were not \"as many people out in the street that would be able to help right away, so [he] got on the radio to get more units to get [police officers] out of the station to come assist.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:21, 10:2-5.) At this point, Officer Pickel began to follow Defendant - who was walking - from his patrol vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:6-7.) Officer Pickel testified that before he began to follow Defendant, he did not ascertain the eyewitness's name or the license plate number of the vehicle the eyewitness was driving. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:9-15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Observing that for the duration of his conversation with the eyewitness, Defendant continued to walk \"to the other side of the bridge and then Stone Avenue\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:18-20), Officer Pickel stated that \"based on [his] training and experience, if you allow people to get too far away ... [Defendant] could have gotten down breezeways [and] cut back through the little cuts that are all over the city where it would have been difficult to locate him if he did start to run away or cut down through one of those other ... areas\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:25, 11:1-6). Based on the information conveyed to him by the eyewitness, Officer Pickel viewed Defendant as potentially dangerous and \"felt that was imperative to make sure that [the police] figured out what was going on and make sure nobody got hurt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:9-15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Pickel further noted that \"because [he] was the only officer in the immediate area at that time, [he] felt it most important to make sure\" that he \"kept [his] eyes on [Defendant] instead of going immediately over [to the building], because if [he] would have gotten out of the patrol vehicle to look for shell casings or damage, then [Defendant] would\n   have been long gone by then.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:22-25, 13:1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While being followed by Officer Pickel, Defendant continued walking at a casual pace and proceeded \"north on the east side of South Penn Street.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:23-25.) Officer Pickel continued to follow Defendant in his patrol vehicle while he informed other police units of his and Defendant's respective locations and waited until more units were \"in the area to attempt to stop [Defendant] and see what was going on.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:1-4.) Officer Pickel waited for assistance from additional units due to the report that Defendant \"fired a firearm into a building\" and that, in light of such information, it was possible that \"there would have been somebody near the building\" at risk of being shot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:8-13.) Officer Pickel also stated that based on such possibilities, \"it was for the sake of officer safety and the safety of others around in the area\" to ensure that \"enough units [were] available to basically surround the subject and make sure that everything ... was contained.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:19-23.) As he followed Defendant, Officer Pickel noted that Defendant had seen him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:5-8, 18-25.) In addition, the eyewitness subsequently \"drove up next to\" Officer Pickel, whose driver's side window was up, and appeared to mouth something to Officer Pickel, who \"wasn't sure what it was\" that was being communicated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:5-12.) At this time, Officer Pickel \"was trying to stay focused on where [Defendant] was and what he was going, so [he] motioned for ... [the eyewitness] to continue [driving] ... because if something were to happen, [he] didn't want [the eyewitness] to be caught in the middle of it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:13-17.) Officer Pickel thought that he would have been able to speak with the eyewitness later, as he \"actually expected [the eyewitness] to stay back at the intersection of King's Mill and Penn Street, where he was on Penn Street\" and, therefore, Officer Pickel \"was actually surprised to see him roll up right next to [him] while [he] was on South Penn Street[,]\" noting that he \"motioned [for the eyewitness] to continue, because [he] didn't want him to be right in the middle of the incident.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:23-25, 24:1-3.) The dash camera in Officer Pickel's patrol vehicle then began recording.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:18-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As Officer Pickel approached South Penn Street from Princess Street and arrived at the edge of the intersection, he \"activated [his] emergency lights, which automatically activates the in-car camera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:10-12.) Officer Pickel then decided to stop Defendant after \"hear[ing] officers tell [him] that they were coming around the corner ... onto Penn Street\"; observing \"two units coming around the corner\"; and knowing that another officer \"was coming down Princess Street and was about one block off.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:23-25, 19:1-2.) At this point, Officer Pickel could see that Defendant \"was approaching the edge of the intersection\" and because there were \"three units in the back and one in the front\" and \"believ[ing] there might have been a second one coming from Princess Street, as well, [he] believed ... [there were] enough units in the area to handle the situation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:3-8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Upon exiting his vehicle, Officer Pickel drew his service weapon and ordered Defendant to the ground (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:17-22), testifying that he drew his service weapon and instructed Defendant to get on the ground \"[b]ecause at that point [he] knew, or at least [he] thought [he] knew, based on the information given to [him], that [Defendant] had a firearm and that he discharged it\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:25, 20:1-2). Not knowing \"what [Defendant's] plan was to do upon police arriving on scene[,]\" Officer Pickel \"thought that the best course of action for officer safety and those around [him] was to draw [his] firearm and match the potential force that [he] would face.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:5-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Two additional police officers - Officer Hatterer and Officer Hooper - assisted Officer Pickel in his encounter with Defendant at the intersection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:20-25, 22:1-6.) Officer Pickel testified that Officer Hatterer appeared to approach Defendant and \"put his knee down onto [Defendant's] back\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:24-25) before placing Defendant in handcuffs (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:1-2). A firearm was then recovered from Defendant's person. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:7-9.) Officer Pickel stated that he was unsure which officer recovered the firearm from Defendant, but he knew that after a verbal exchange between Defendant and the police, Defendant \"was placed in handcuffs and a firearm was recovered from his person.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:12-16.) The firearm was loaded, with one round in the chamber and seven located in the magazine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:17-21.) After the firearm was recovered, it \"was cleared and made safe by Officer Hooper, who ... then gave [it] to [Officer Pickel] in a manila envelope.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:17-25.) Defendant was then placed in the back of Officer Pickel's patrol vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:25, 23:1.) Further, after providing Defendant with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, Officer Pickel asked Defendant whether \"he had a license to carry a firearm,\" and Defendant replied that he did not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:5-6.) Defendant also informed Officer Pickel that he possessed the firearm for protection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:6-7.) Officer Pickel's review of county records subsequently revealed that the firearm had been reported stolen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:9-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 19, 2018, a federal grand jury returned a single-count indictment charging Defendant with possession of a firearm by a previously-convicted felon in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(e).

On April 9, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. (Doc. No. 22.) The Court held a suppression hearing on July 19, 2018. Defendant submitted a brief in support of his motion prior to the hearing. (Doc. No. 23.) Following the hearing, the Government filed a brief in opposition on July 31, 2018 (Doc. No. 46), to which Defendant filed a brief in reply on August 14, 2018 (Doc. No. 47).

(Doc. No. 44 at 20:1-9.)

Based on Officer Pickel's assessment that such detention of Defendant was necessary to ensure the safety of the police and those in the surrounding area, and noting that Defendant was suspected of shooting a firearm into a nearby building, the Court finds that the actions taken by the officers constituted \"reasonable steps to ensure that the scene was secure before investigating further.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5687139\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/442/#p447\">\n    592 F.3d at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As an initial matter, although \"an anonymous tip that a person has a gun, without additional corroboration, lacks the indicia of reliability needed to justify a stop under the reasonable suspicion standard ... an anonymous tip can be the basis for reasonable suspicion if accompanied by specific indicia of reliability.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, Officer Pickel testified that the eyewitness \"seemed like he wanted to talk to [him]\" (Doc.

Lastly, the fact that the tip concerned a firearm is significant, for the Third Circuit has indicated that a tip involving guns could suffice to establish reasonable suspicion in light of the inherent interest in public safety involved in investigating such tips.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roberson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042812\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/75/#p77\">\n    90 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   81 n.4. Accordingly, upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances, the Court concludes that the investigatory stop of Defendant was supported by reasonable suspicion and, consequently, did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendant's motion to suppress (Doc. No. 22), will be denied. An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, the facts recited herein are derived from the transcript of the suppression hearing held by the Court on July 19, 2018. (Doc. No. 44.) During the suppression hearing, the Court heard testimony from Officer Pickel (\"Officer Pickel\"), Officer Jonathan Hatterer (\"Officer Hatterer\"), and Defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The Court refers to this man as \"the eyewitness\" herein.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Officer Pickel also testified that he did not ask the eyewitness for his address or phone number. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 28:16-19.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Officer Pickel testified that he believed his conversation with the eyewitness had been recorded through his police body camera located on his chest. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11:16-24, 12:1-16.) As discussed during the suppression hearing, however, the conversation with the eyewitness was not captured by Officer Pickel's recording device. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 28:9-11.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Officer Pickel noted that after his patrol vehicle's brakes squeaked, Defendant turned around and observed him, and that \"to be truthful, [he] thought the gig was up there, but [Defendant] just maintained walking.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 16:3-8.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The video footage captured by Officer Pickel's dash camera was played during the suppression hearing. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18:5.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Officer Pickel testified that he did not lose sight of Defendant for the duration of these events. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 19:13-16.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Officer Pickel also believed his conversation with the eyewitness had been recorded (Doc. No. 44 at 11:16-18), which lends support to the Court's conclusion that Officer Pickel was able to ascertain the credibility of the eyewitness - who could have been subsequently identified, had the encounter actually been recorded - and that the tip was sufficiently reliable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Additionally, to the extent Defendant testified that on the date in question, he had taken a different path that was situated next to the bridge (Doc. No. 44 at 77:8-16), such testimony does not bear on the Court's reasoning as to whether the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion. Even if the Court were to credit such testimony, it is undisputed that the eyewitness informed Officer Pickel that Defendant was walking on the bridge, and the appropriate inquiry is not whether Defendant had actually committed the alleged criminal conduct, but, rather, upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances, whether Officer Pickel possessed an objectively reasonable suspicion to support the stop based on the information conveyed to him by the eyewitness.\n    <em>\n     See,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5687139\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/442/#p447\">\n     592 F.3d at 449\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    It also bears noting that at the time Officer Pickel received the tip from the eyewitness and followed Defendant, the sun was setting (Doc. No. 44 at 57:17-19), which weighs in favor of finding reasonable suspicion, in light of the safety risks inherent in possibly pursuing a suspect in the dark.\n    <em>\n     See,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Colon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4194244\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/654/326/#p333\">\n     654 F.Supp.2d at 333\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting safety concerns presented by \"pursu[ing] the [d]efendant through dimly lit streets\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    In a similar vein, the Court finds that it would not have been feasible for Officer Pickel to examine the area for shell casings prior to following Defendant, as the Court finds credible Officer Pickel's testimony that Defendant was walking \"further and further away\" and \"because [he] was the only officer in the immediate area at the time, [he] felt it most important to make sure [he] kept [his] eyes on [Defendant].\" (Doc. No. 44 at 12:22-25.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
