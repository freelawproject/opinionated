Plaintiffs Devon Prescott, Brooke Freeman, and Tasaneeporn Upright (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") filed a Response, (ECF No. 17), and Slide Fire filed a Reply, (ECF No. 22). For the reasons discussed herein, Slide Fire's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises from the tragic mass shooting that occurred at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival (the \"Festival\") on October 1, 2017, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Plaintiffs were attendees of the Festival on that evening when Stephen Paddock (\"Paddock\") opened fire on the concert goers from the thirty-second floor of his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 38, ECF No. 1-2). In approximately eleven minutes, Paddock killed fifty-nine Festival attendees and injured hundreds more. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40). Paddock's rifles were equipped with sliding rifle stocks, commonly known as \"bump stocks,\" which permit \"certain semi-automatic weapons to fire at a rate comparable or equivalent to a fully automatic weapon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Slide Fire is the designer, manufacturer, marketer, and seller of bump stocks, and holds itself out as the \"sole patent holder of bump fire technology.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43, 46). According to the Complaint, \"Slide Fire's bump stocks are purportedly designed for the disabled and intended to assist persons whose hands have limited mobility using firearms. However, statements made by Slide Fire inventor, Jeremiah Cottle, and [Slide Fire's] marketing,\" suggest that bump stocks are intended for consumers who seek a firearm that mimics a fully automatic weapon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53, 54-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their class action Complaint on October 6, 2017, bringing the following causes of action against Slide Fire: (1) negligence; (2) negligent infliction of emotional distress under a theory of bystander liability; (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress under a theory of direct liability; (4) negligent products liability; (5) strict products liability; and (6) public nuisance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-159). On February 23, 2018, Slide Fire filed the instant Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The Court thus turns to whether Slide Fire's contacts with Nevada are related to Plaintiffs' causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Relatedness of Contacts with the Forum\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that their claims directly relate to Slide Fire's contacts with Nevada because Slide Fire, through its website, marketing, and attendance at trade shows in Nevada, relied upon misrepresentations in promoting its bump stocks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 5:21-6:8). The Ninth Circuit has adopted a \"but for\" test for determining whether a plaintiff's cause of action arises out of a defendant's forum-related activities.\n   <em>\n    In re W. States Wholesale Nat.

Plaintiffs continue that these representations are inconsistent with their marketing \"which emphasizes that this product was intended for people-who 'love full auto'-to convert a legal firearm into an illegal machinegun absent the prohibitive price tag and requisite background check.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5:25-6:1) (citing Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55). According to Plaintiffs, \"Slide Fire made similar misrepresentations when attending and participating in trade shows in Nevada and otherwise promoting, marketing, and selling bump stocks in Nevada.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   6:2-8); (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Slide Fire argues that its attendance at the trade shows cannot establish relatedness because there is no allegation that \"Mr. Paddock attended this trade show, or that any of Slide Fire's products allegedly used during the incident were sold at the show.\" (Reply 4:21-23). Therefore, according to Slide Fire, Plaintiffs cannot establish that its claims arise out of Slide Fire's contacts with Nevada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   4:25-27). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations in support of its six causes of action are not as narrow as Slide Fire suggests. The first three claims incorporate allegations that Slide fire failed to adequately and properly market, sell, advertise, and promote the bump stock as a device to help individuals with limited mobility and negligently marketed, promoted, and sold the bumps stocks as an inexpensive device to circumvent federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 80, 92, 108). The fourth cause of action contains allegations that Slide Fire failed to exercise the proper standard of care in its manufacture, design, sales, and distribution to ensure it was safe for its intended and reasonably foreseeable use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123, 124). The fifth cause of action provides that Slide Fire \"knew and/or should have know[n] that by marketing, promoting, distributing, selling and/or advertising its defense product as one to circumvent federal law, it was foreseeable ... that [ ] individuals use such a device not for its intended purpose.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139). The sixth cause of action states that Slide Fire's negligent, reckless, or intentional manufacture, sale, or marketing ensured \"a steady flow of dangerous products in large quantities to persons with criminal purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In summary, at the root of each cause of action is the manner in which Slide Fire manufactured, promoted, distributed, or advertised its bump stocks, and the way in which the same created a foreseeable risk of the October 1 shooting. Because Plaintiffs assert that Slide Fire marketed, promoted, distributed, or sold bump stocks at the trade shows in Las Vegas, through its online sales, and marketing directed at Nevadans, it follows that Slide Fire's contacts with Nevada are causally related to Plaintiffs' claims. The Complaint further ties Slide Fire's promotional activities to Paddock with the allegation that \"Slide Fire designed, manufactured, marketed, distributed, and/or sold one or more of the bump stocks used by Paddock during the subject incident,\" and that Slide Fire holds itself out as the \"sole patent holder of bump fire technology.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 46). Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, the Court finds that Slide Fire's connections to Nevada are causally related to Plaintiffs' causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Reasonableness\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As Plaintiffs have sufficiently established the first two prongs of the specific jurisdiction analysis, the burden now \"shifts to the defendant to 'present a compelling case' that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Schwarzenegger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p801\">\n    374 F.3d at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burger King Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    471 U.S. at 477-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD 8:14-9:15); (Reply 4:6-5:16). Even if Slide Fire were to dispute this point, the Court would nonetheless find that jurisdiction is reasonable given Plaintiffs' and Nevada's robust interests in adjudicating the instant case in this forum. Moreover, Plaintiffs' uncontroverted allegation that Slide Fire recently attended trade shows in Las Vegas indicates that \"travel itself is not unduly burdensome.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Synthes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237266\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/1285/#p1297\">\n    563 F.3d at 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Court concludes that its exercise of jurisdiction over Slide Fire is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that it has personal jurisdiction over Slide Fire. Accordingly, Slide Fire's Motion to Dismiss, to the extent it is premised upon personal jurisdiction, is denied. Next, the Court turns to Slide Fire's argument that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (\"PLCAA\") requires dismissal of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

An \"accessory,\" in contrast, is \"a thing of secondary or subordinate importance,\" or \"an object or device that is not essential in itself but adding to the beauty, convenience, or effectiveness of something else.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Slide Fire argues that bump stocks are component parts of firearms because they are a type of rifle stock and rifle stocks are necessary for a rifle to be fired from the shoulder. (MTD 15:10-15). In support, Slide Fire cites to a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\") Guidebook (\"ATF Guidebook\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which identifies a stock as a component part of a rifle; a June 10, 2010 letter from the ATF to Slide Fire classifying the bump stock as a firearm part (the \"ATF Letter\"); and case law in which courts label stocks as component parts of firearms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   14:20-16:10). Plaintiffs counter that bump stocks are accessories rather than component parts because they are added after a consumer purchases a fully functional rifle, require post-purchase installation, and are advertised as a way to \"enhance\" or \"overhaul\" a rifle in Slide Fire's promotional catalog (\"Slide Fire Catalog\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 9:13-10:2). Plaintiffs also cite to cases in which courts have held that devices such as cable locks, sights, and compensators are accessories rather than component parts of firearms, as well as federal tax regulations that Plaintiffs suggest define\n   \"accessories\" to encompass bump stocks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10:3-11:7). For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that bump stocks are component parts of firearms and are, accordingly, qualified products under the PLCAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A bump stock consists of a block that replaces a rifle's pistol grip and a hollow shoulder stock that is attached to the rear of an AR-15-type rifle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ATF Letter, Ex. C to MTD, ECF No. 8-4). The hollow shoulder stock replaces a rifle's existing stock and enhances its capabilities by incorporating a \"sliding-stock type buffer-tube assembly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Slide Fire Catalog at 21-29, 32-37, Ex. B to MTD, ECF No. 8-3). Bump stocks require installation and come with a set of assembly instructions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ATF Letter, Ex. C to MTD). \"In order to use the installed device, the shooter must apply constant forward pressure with the non-shooting hand and constant rearward pressure with the shooting hand.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). This pressure, paired with a rifle's recoil, permits the trigger to rapidly reset as the bump stock slides back and forth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ); (Slide Fire Catalog at 4-5, Ex. B to MTD). This mechanism allows a user to discharge ammunition rounds in rapid succession, or \"bump fire.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ATF Letter); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MTD 2:22-24) (\" '[B]ump-firing' requires the trigger finger to remain steady while the combination of the rifle's recoil and pulling of the rifle forward causes the trigger to be pressed.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Preliminarily, the Court finds, and the parties do not dispute, that a \"stock\" is a component part of a rifle. (MTD 14:20-16:10); (Resp. 11:9-11). A stock is an integral component of a rifle as it permits the firearm to be fired from the shoulder. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ATF Guidebook at 16, Ex. F to MTD, ECF No. 8-7) (illustrating the \"primary characteristics exhibited in the rifle category\" including a stock, trigger, barrel, and bore);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1072, 1227 (11th ed. 2003) (defining \"rifle\" and \"stock\" to mean \"a shoulder weapon with a rifled bore,\" and \"the wooden part by which a shoulder arm is held during firing,\" respectively). A bump stock is a modified type of rifle stock that replaces the existing stock. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ATF Letter, Ex. C to MTD); (Slide Fire Catalog at 20-29, Ex. B to MTD). Thus, it follows that upon installation, the bump stock is a rifle's operative stock and, therefore, becomes an integral part of a rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   That bump stocks enhance a rifle's operation and are installed after purchase by an end user do not negate the fact that bump stocks are substituted in for the original stock rendering them essential units. On this point, Slide Fire persuasively analogizes bump stocks to snow tires on an automobile: \"[I]f a person were to replace their low-profile tires on an automobile with snow tires, Plaintiffs would argue that the snow tires are not a component part of the vehicle, but simply an accessory because they are not the original tires.\" (Reply 6:16-19). Just as tires are component parts of automobiles that can be replaced after market with enhanced tires, a rifle's stock can be replaced after market with a different, modified stock in place of the original.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, after-market installation,\n   as well as after-market enhancement, do not necessarily convert a component into an accessory. For this reason, the Court finds that Slide Fire's marketing materials, depicting bump stocks as ways to overhaul or enhance an existing rifle, is of limited probative value to the instant inquiry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 9:22-10:2); (Slide Fire Catalog, Ex. B to MTD).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs additionally argue that case law interpreting the PLCAA supports its contention that bump stocks are firearm accessories. (Resp. 10:4-18). In\n   <em>\n    Sambrano v. Savage Arms, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the New Mexico Court of Appeals held that a \"cable gun lock,\" an attachable cord enabling consumers to secure firearms, is an accessory.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=338%20P.3d%20103\">\n    338 P.3d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105 (N.M. App. 2014). In\n   <em>\n    Auto-Ordnance Corp. v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the court found that \"sights and compensators\" are accessories because \"the carbine will fire without the sights or compensator.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1723420,5630967\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/822/1566/\">\n    822 F.2d 1566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1570-72 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Unlike cable gun locks, sights, and compensators-without which a rifle is fully functionally-a rifle cannot operate as a rifle without a stock. As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds significant the fact that bump stocks replace existing stocks rendering them component parts, even if they are after-market enhancements. These cases, accordingly, are distinguishable on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs' reliance on federal tax law is likewise unavailing. (Resp. 10:19-11:7). Plaintiffs point to excise tax regulations on firearm manufacturers which define component parts to include items that \"would ordinarily be attached to a firearm during use and, in the ordinary course of trade, are packaged with the firearm at the time of sale by the manufacturer or importer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10:19-23) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2053.61\">\n    27 C.F.R. \u00a7 53.61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) ). The regulations further provide that nontaxable \"accessories\" include \"tools\" and \"optional items purchased by the customer at the time of retail sale.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2053.61\">\n    27 C.F.R \u00a7 53.61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(iv). Based on this authority, Plaintiffs contend that because bump stocks are not included at the time of sale and require a conversion kit for installation, they would be regulated as accessories. (Resp. 10:23-11:7). However, the same regulation also states that \"[c]omponent parts also include any part provided with the firearm that would affect the tax status of the firearm,\n   <em>\n    such as an attachable shoulder stock.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2053.61\">\n    27 C.F.R. \u00a7 53.61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(ii) (emphasis added). Indeed, because the Court finds that a bump stock constitutes a type of replacement shoulder stock, this regulation is not inconsistent with the Court's holding that bump stocks are component parts of a firearm. This is the case whether or not the replacement stock constitutes an after-market enhancement or modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that bump stocks are component parts of a rifle and, therefore, constitute qualified products under the PLCAA. In light of this finding, the PLCAA mandates that the Court dismiss the action if none of the statute's specified exceptions apply.\n   <em>\n    Ileto v.

(Resp. 12:12-14) (citing Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 53). Preliminarily, the Court agrees with Slide Fire that because its asserted false entry on its FFL is not alleged in the Complaint, the Court is without authority to consider it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   With respect to the second alleged predicate violation, Plaintiffs aver that Slide Fire informed the ATF that the bump stock was intended to assist \"persons whose hands have limited mobility,\" in order to legally sell the product under federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 13). The statute Plaintiffs rely upon is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), which \"prohibits giving false information in any matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The ATF Letter that Plaintiffs cite concerns whether the bump stock shall be regulated as a firearm or a firearm part. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ATF Letter, Ex. C to MTD). The letter describes how a bump stock functions and ends with the ATF's finding that \"the 'bump-stock' is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under [the] Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). While the letter alludes to Slide Fire's alleged misrepresentation, it is not clear that this influenced the ATF's conclusion. On this point, Plaintiffs have not come forward with any authority suggesting that a device's utility to those with disabilities impacts whether that device constitutes a firearm or firearm part. Significantly, if a device's marketability to those with disabilities was not a factor in the ATF's finding, then it follows that Plaintiffs cannot show that Slide Fire's misrepresentation proximately caused the injuries that are the subject of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(A)(iii) (requiring a defendant's alleged predicate violation be a \"proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought\"). Therefore, at this juncture, the Court is not satisfied that Slide Fire's alleged misrepresentation to the ATF gives rise to a predicate statutory violation under the PLCAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the PLCAA does not shield Slide Fire from liability. Moreover, Plaintiffs have not pointed to a statutory violation that would permit the Court to\n   find that an exception to the PLCAA applies. The Court, therefore, grants Slide Fire's Motion to Dismiss without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     LEAVE TO AMEND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits courts to \"freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\" Fed.
