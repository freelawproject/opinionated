Janis L. Sammartino, United States District Judge\n   Presently before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint. (\"MTD,\" ECF No. 47.) Also before the Court is Plaintiffs' Response in Opposition to, (\"Opp'n,\" ECF No. 48), and Defendants' Reply in Support of, (\"Reply,\" ECF No. 50), the Motion to Dismiss. Having considered the parties' arguments and the law, the Court rules as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Oceanside Organics is a \"not for profit closed loop marijuana collective\" operating in San Diego County, California. (Fourth Am. Compl. (\"FAC\"), ECF No. 46, \u00b6 19.) The other plaintiffs are Oceanside Organics' sixteen individual members and a corporation formed to purchase the property upon which Oceanside Organics grows its medical marijuana. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-18, 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs agreed to contact local law enforcement to ensure the legality and compliance of their collective. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) In mid-July 2014, Plaintiffs' counsel, Daniel Callaway, contacted Defendant Tim Clark, a Deputy Sheriff with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 29.) In the course of their correspondence, Plaintiffs' counsel provided to Defendant Clark \"copies of all valid recommendations\" for medical marijuana. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Defendant Clark told Plaintiffs' counsel that the Sheriff's Department considered medical marijuana recommendations invalid and only county-issued identification cards to be valid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) In response, some Plaintiffs also \"acquired state medical marijuana cards as requested by [D]eputy Clark.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiffs' counsel, \"Deputy Clark repeatedly indicated to [Plaintiffs' counsel] that no legal action would be taken against the collective operation and that nobody at the cultivation site would be subject to arrest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Clark \"thanked attorney Callaway for the transparency and stated that the collective members were 'golden' and the cultivation operation was operating legally.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Clark also communicated via text message with Plaintiffs' counsel. At some point, Clark stated via text that no one at the cultivation site would be subject to arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also confirmed to Plaintiffs' attorney that the collective was allowed six mature marijuana plants per valid state identification card. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite being told they were \"golden,\" Plaintiffs allege \"Deputy Clark conspired with [D]eputy Stevens to have an illegal search warrant issued[,] which was based on a knowingly false affidavit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 31.) According to Plaintiffs, the affidavit was false because both deputies knew that the collective cultivation operation was operating legally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) On September 12, 2014, the Sheriff's Department raided Plaintiffs' property, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29), and Defendants Clark and Stevens Plaintiffs arrested Shawn Smith and Kyle Sneller \"without probable cause ... for felony cultivation of marijuana,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50). The sheriffs also confiscated Plaintiffs' marijuana plants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) \"At the time of the raid ..., there were over 20 valid members of the collective and 31 medical marijuana plants on site.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Plaintiffs allege that\n   after the raid occurred, Defendant Clark admitted to Plaintiffs' attorney and Plaintiffs Sneller and Smith that the Department took the action because \"it is the position of the San Diego Sheriff's Department that no cultivation of marijuana is legal in San Diego County.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a result of Defendants' actions, Plaintiffs \"suffered loss of illegally confiscated medical marijuana, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, false arrest, [and] violation of civil rights under the Constitution of the United States and the State of California.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Plaintiffs allege Defendant County of San Diego is also liable because, among other reasons, it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-16\">\n   maintain[ed] a custom, policy and practice of violating the legal rights of valid medical marijuana patients in San Diego County by failing to properly train and supervise deputies ...

(Id. at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This Court previously found that Plaintiffs do not have either a procedural or substantive due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to possess marijuana. (See ECF No. 22, at 13-14 (\"Plaintiff[s] lack[ ] a federal Constitutional right to possess marijuana for medical purposes.\").) Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint does not assert that they have a substantive due process right in marijuana. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that their Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures was violated, which does not implicate a substantive due process right in marijuana. (See Opp'n 3 (\"The gravamen of plaintiffs' action is the right to be free from illegal police conduct.\").) Given the Court's prior holding and Plaintiffs' decision not to assert a due process right in marijuana, Defendants' arguments that marijuana lacks federal protection is not responsive to the operative complaint.

(\"Prior Order,\" ECF No. 45, at 14-15.) The Court also cited authority for the proposition that, \"[i]n determining the propriety of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, a court\n    <em>\n     may not\n    </em>\n    look beyond the complaint to a plaintiff's moving paper, such as a memorandum in opposition to a defendant's motion to dismiss.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11 n.2 (citing\n    <em>\n     Schneider\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716534\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/1194/\">\n     151 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1197 n.1 ).)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Despite these clear warnings, Plaintiffs took a different approach.

Defendant Clark communicated to Plaintiffs that that maximum amount allowed was six plants per state-issued identification card. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 29.)

The disparity between the thirty-one plants and the 120 plants necessary to establish probable cause makes this a closer question. However, Plaintiffs have the burden to demonstrate that Defendant Clark's misrepresentations or omissions were intentional or reckless.

The Circuit determined that the plaintiffs had not filed three substantially similar complaints alleging substantially similar theories-\"it [was] not accurate to imply that plaintiffs had filed multiple pleadings in an attempt to cure pre-existing deficiencies.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Although Defendants have not made any showing of prejudice, there is a strong showing that amendment would be futile because of Plaintiffs' repeated failures to cure known deficiencies. Here, Plaintiffs have had four opportunities to re-plead their causes of action with sufficient factual allegations to state a claim for relief. Unlike\n    <em>\n     Eminence Capital\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiffs have filed multiple pleadings in an attempt to cure the same factual deficiencies of the same claims. Although Plaintiffs removed two State law claims, and added two others after the first Motion to Dismiss Order, since that time, Plaintiffs have not amended their complaint to state different causes of action; rather, each amendment attempted to cure the factual deficiencies the Court noted in this and prior Orders. Thus, each complaint focused on the lack of factual detail sufficiently to state a claim, and each complaint failed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    After each iteration of the complaint, the Court provided in-depth decisions explaining the basis for dismissal, yet Plaintiffs still have failed to meet the required pleading requirements. Failure to correct identified deficiencies \"is a strong indication that the plaintiffs have no additional facts to plead.\"\n    <em>\n     Zucco Partners, LLC v.

There are several buildings and structures on the property, including greenhouse type structure and small tent.
