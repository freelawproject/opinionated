RAMBO, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this civil rights action, Pasquale T. Deon, Sr., and Maggie Magerko (\"Plaintiffs\") challenge the constitutionality of Section 1513 of the Pennsylvania Gaming Act, 4 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1513, under the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Presently before the court is Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. For the reasons that follow, the court will grant Plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts relevant to the disposition of this matter are not in dispute. Plaintiff Deon is a shareholder of Sands Pennsylvania Inc., a company owning a 90 percent interest in Sands Bethworks Gaming LLC (\"Sands\"), a privately held gaming business licensee under the Gaming Act. (Doc. 47, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2.) Plaintiff Magerko is the beneficiary of a trust that is the owner of Nemacolin Woodlands, Inc. (\"Nemacolin\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.) Nemacolin owns Woodlands Fayette, LLC (\"Woodlands\"), a privately held gaming business licensee under the Gaming Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11.) Both plaintiffs applied to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (\"Board\") to be licensed as a \"principal\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   under the Gaming Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 17.) Defendants are members or employees of the Board and the Attorney General of Pennsylvania and are tasked with the enforcement of the Gaming Act and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Deon filed the initial complaint in this matter on August 15, 2017. (Doc. 1.) Defendants filed an answer with affirmative\n   defenses on September 29, 2017. (Doc. 32.) On October 20, 2017, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and Defendants again filed an answer with affirmative defenses on November 3, 2017. (Docs. 34, 38.) Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for summary judgment on January 16, 2018. (Doc. 46.) The matter has been fully briefed and is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Section 1513 of the Gaming Act is unconstitutional under the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it prohibits certain classes of people,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   gaming-license applicants, licensees, and principals of licensees, from making any political contributions. In pertinent part, Section 1513 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The following persons shall be prohibited from contributing any money or in-kind contribution to a candidate for nomination or election to any public office in this Commonwealth, or to any political party committee or other political committee in this Commonwealth or to any group, committee or association organized in support of a candidate, political party committee or other political committee in this Commonwealth:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) An applicant for a slot machine license, manufacturer license, supplier license, principal license, key employee license, interactive gaming license or horse or harness racing license.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) A slot machine licensee, licensed manufacturer, licensed supplier, interactive gaming operator or licensed racing entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) A licensed principal or licensed key employee of a slot machine licensee, licensed manufacturer, licensed supplier, interactive gaming operator or licensed racing entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   4 Pa.

In the instant case, it is uncontested that the ostensible purpose of Section 1513 is to prevent\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   corruption and the appearance of such corruption. The legislative purpose section of the Gaming Act was recently amended to specifically provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The General Assembly has a compelling interest in protecting the integrity of both the electoral process and the legislative process by preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption which may arise through permitting any type of political campaign contributions by\n   certain persons involved in the gaming industry and regulated under this part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Banning all types of political campaign contributions by certain persons subject to this part is necessary to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption that may arise when political campaign contributions and gaming regulated under this part are intermingled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   4 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1102 (10.1) ; (10.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The stated purpose of the law is legitimate and commendable to the extent it seeks to prohibit corruption or the appearance of corruption, yet a laudable purpose is not dispositive as to the law's constitutionality. The Commonwealth's brief is largely dedicated to addressing two questions that are not in dispute: (1) that preventing corruption is a legitimate governmental interest; and (2) that a wholesale ban on political contributions would tend to inhibit political corruption. (Doc. 54, pp. 8-15.) The first was well-settled by\n   <em>\n    McCutcheon\n   </em>\n   and the second is beyond reasonable debate. The Commonwealth, however, had made no showing of a heightened need to preclude all political contributions beyond the purpose recognized in\n   <em>\n    McCutcheon\n   </em>\n   . The Commonwealth's justification appears to rely entirely on historical assumptions that gaming is an industry rife with potential for corruption. The legislative histories Defendants cite refer to neither actual instances of corruption in Pennsylvania, nor any studies done to determine if pervasive corruption exists, or discuss that a limitation only on large contributions was insufficient. Without any real evidence that the complained-of harm exists within the Commonwealth, the legislative purpose amounts to no more than the \"mere conjecture\" that the Supreme Court took issue with in\n   <em>\n    McCutcheon\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"But in general, courts have deferred to legislative determinations that contribution restrictions are a necessary prophylactic measure in combatting potential corruption.

The Commonwealth now argues that the legislative purpose amendment providing that political contributions in any amount rather than just large contributions are likely to result in\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   corruption cures the constitutional defect of a wholesale ban on political contributions. In reaching its decision, the\n   <em>\n    DePaul\n   </em>\n   Court cited the reasoning of a New Jersey intermediate appellate court and the Supreme Court of Louisiana that each found similar political contribution bans constitutional under their respective state constitutions.

Drawing this distinction, the Supreme Court noted that a small donation could result in the donor receiving some appreciable influence or access to a political candidate, whereas a large donation is more likely to be given specifically in return for political preference or specific favors.

Along with\n   <em>\n    DePaul\n   </em>\n   , both were decided prior to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    McCutcheon\n   </em>\n   . Initially, both Louisiana and New Jersey had a long and sordid history related to gambling, upon which the strict limitations were founded. The Supreme Court of Louisiana and the intermediate New Jersey appellate court both referred to the history of corruption and illegal activity associated with gambling in the respective jurisdictions. The court has no evidence of a similar historical background in Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although the Commonwealth correctly argues that a state's legislature may look to the experiences and studies of other jurisdictions instead of creating redundant investigations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DePaul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7258272,4192753,4192656,7258333\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/969/536/\">\n    969 A.2d at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the identification of a legitimate state interest does not license the legislature to enact any palliative measure, regardless of its restrictiveness. When the Commonwealth's chosen method of protecting its interest is a sweeping restriction on Constitutional rights, greater justification is necessary. Although it would be na\u00efve to assume that, prior to its legalization in 2004, there was no illegal gambling or other associated criminal activities in the Commonwealth, gaming has been a highly scrutinized and regulated industry in Pennsylvania for nearly fifteen years. There are numerous reporting laws and administrative oversight in the gaming industry that would limit corruption and unlawful activity. There is no evidence that, in Pennsylvania, legalized gaming is uniquely susceptible to corrupt influence beyond other state-licensed industries. This is not to say that a wholesale ban could never be constitutional, but merely that the Commonwealth has not demonstrated that the risk of corruption in gaming is so great that it requires a complete ban or that other, less restrictive measures have been inadequate to achieve this goal. In sum, there is no evidence of a justification for heightened campaign finance restrictions specific to gaming beyond a\n   restriction appropriate for restraining corruption from any other state-regulated industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, the restrictions in place in Louisiana and New Jersey were less restrictive than the Pennsylvania ban despite a greater justification for a wholesale ban. The Louisiana ban applied broadly to individuals associated with the industry, covering licensees and those who held an interest in licensees, and even extended to the spouses of those individuals. It was more limited, however, in the types of contributions that it prohibited as it did not extend to independent expenditures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The other cases relied upon by the Louisiana Supreme Court were similarly more narrow in their scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alaska Civil Liberties Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11666247\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/978/597/\">\n    978 P.2d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ban on campaign contributions applied only to out-of-district lobbyists);\n   <em>\n    Schiller Park,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=349%20N.E.2d%2061\">\n    349 N.E.2d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ban applied only to liquor licensees and their direct representatives);\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11641111\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/705/\">\n    168 F.3d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding complete bans on campaign contributions by lobbyists while the legislature is in session).

The Supreme Court has held that a contribution limit is unconstitutional if it is \"so radical in effect as to render political association ineffective ... and render contribution pointless.\"\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   , 528 U.S. at 297,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476357\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/377/#p392\">\n    120 S.Ct. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    DePaul\n   </em>\n   recognized the distinction between an effective limitation and an impermissible ban. The Court found that the legislature had determined that large contributions from those connected with the gaming industry were likely to result in the appearance\n   of corruption, as evidenced in the legislative purpose of the statute, yet, in amending Section 1513, the legislature banned all contributions of any amount. Indeed, the legislature did little more than replace the word \"large\" with the word \"any\" and assumed this rendered the ban constitutional. While the\n   <em>\n    DePaul\n   </em>\n   Court did not foreclose the possibility that a wholesale ban may be appropriate, the Court concluded that the legislature had not determined that such an expansive ban was necessary to achieve the substantially important purpose. Of course, further legislative investigation could have shown cause why the purpose should be amended to include contributions of any size, yet no such showing was made. The Supreme Court has since reiterated that a limitation must be proportional to the interest served.\n   <em>\n    McCutcheon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706989\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/185/#p191\">\n    572 U.S. at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579115,12706989\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1434/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, contrary to the Commonwealth's interpretation,\n   <em>\n    DePaul\n   </em>\n   did not countenance a typographical amendment in place of a showing that the restriction was reasonable and proportional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In order to be closely drawn, the specifics of the ban must hew closely to the needs of the actual legitimate governmental purpose: preventing\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   corruption. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    McCutcheon\n   </em>\n   did not hold that large contributions are inherently evil, but instead held that they are censurable because they have a demonstrable tendency to lead to corruption. This must be the actual goal and the actual effect of any abrogation of First Amendment rights. A wholesale prohibition of contributions of any amount by citizens with even an attenuated connection to the gaming industry far exceeds the necessary scope of a prohibition seeking to eliminate corruption. For example, under Section 1513, a donation of $1 would trigger the prohibitions and penalties in the Gaming Act, yet there is at most an infinitesimal chance that a political candidate would be influenced by or even notice such a small amount. In this context, Section 1513's breadth is excessive. It strains credulity to conclude that a contribution of a single dollar from the beneficiary of a trust that owns a minority stake in a holding company that, in turn, owns a gaming licensee would give even the barest suggestion of a corrupt influence. Under Section 1513, however, this conduct would be subject to fines and penalties and perhaps criminal prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The court considers partially enjoining the ban, yet doing so would require undue intrusion into the purview of the legislature. The line at which \"mere influence\" transforms into corruption is an admittedly fine one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCutcheon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706989\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/185/#p191\">\n    572 U.S. at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579115,12706989\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1434/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The line between\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   corruption and general influence may seem vague at times, but the distinction must be respected in order to safeguard basic First Amendment rights.

The court holds only that the ban in its current form goes much further than necessary to achieve its stated purpose of eliminating corruption and the appearance of corruption. By way of example, the legislature may more strictly define who is subject to the ban, limiting its purview to those with close connections to the gaming entity that may seek to exercise corrupt influence over lawmakers, or the legislature may heed the implicit suggestion of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that a limit on aggregate contributions may be the favored\n   method of preventing corruption.\n   <em>\n    DePaul,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7258272,4192753,4192656,7258333\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/969/536/\">\n    969 A.2d at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A statute that limited the size of contributions, rather than absolutely prohibiting any contributions, would be more narrowly drawn to accomplish the stated goal.\"). As it stands, however, Section 1513 is unconstitutionally disproportional to the government's interest in preventing\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   corruption or the appearance thereof and, accordingly, must be enjoined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that Section 1513 of the Gaming Act furthers a substantially important state interest, but is not closely drawn to achieve that interest. Thus, Section 1513 is an unconstitutional abrogation of the First Amendment right to political association of Plaintiffs and those similarly situated.
