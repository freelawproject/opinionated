Compl. \u00b6 23, ECF No. 15. The following month, Velez-Pagan arrived in Panama and commenced \"his role as a member of the Administrative and Technical Staff\" at the U.S. Embassy in Panama.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The Embassy provided Velez-Pagan with a pickup truck \"to accomplish his duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. While stationed in Panama, Velez-Pagan initiated a romantic relationship with a young Panamanian woman, Vanesa Itzel Rodriguez Chavarria (\"Rodriguez\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 19, 2014, Velez-Pagan and a colleague were ordered to provide firearm instruction to Panamanian National Police Units in Guarare, Panama.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. On June 22, Velez-Pagan, his colleague, and some Panamanian police officers spent the afternoon at a nearby beach. Pls.' Supporting Evidence 80, ECF No. 14. Rodriguez met up with Velez-Pagan and the others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At his trial for Rodriguez's murder, Velez-Pagan testified that they left the beach together in his Embassy-provided car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78. He stated that while they were driving, Rodriguez became aggressive, began arguing with him and, at one point, hit him in the face.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-79. In response, he punched her in the face.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79. Although Velez-Pagan testified that he\n   only punched her once or twice,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \"blood stains were found all over the passenger side of the [pickup truck],\" suggesting a more brutal beating. Am. Compl. \u00b6 29.

Velez-Pagan then \"repeatedly r[a]n over the body of [Rodriguez] to cover up the murder to make it appear [as though] her death was caused by a traffic accident.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.

A few minutes later, a Panamanian policeman found Velez-Pagan digging a hole with Rodriguez's body nearby.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The officer held Velez-Pagan at gunpoint while calling for assistance from his fellow officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When the other officers arrived, Velez-Pagan admitted he had killed her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Velez-Pagan was returned to the United States, tried by a military court, and convicted for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , unpremeditated murder, aggravated assault, and possession of steroids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 24, 2016, Rodriguez's Estate and both of her parents filed wrongful death administrative claims with the Army and the State Department, as required by the Federal Tort Claims Act to exhaust remedies.
