(ECF No. 21.) Allstate argues that Plaintiffs' insurance policy was voided, and the claim justifiably denied, either because Plaintiffs made material, post-loss misrepresentations with the intent to deceive or defraud Allstate, or because the undisputed material facts conclusively establish their civil arson defense. Plaintiffs responded on January 17, 2018, after receiving an extension of time. (ECF Nos. 30, 31.) Defendant replied on January 31, 2018. (ECF No. 37.) For the reasons that follow, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 19, 2016, a fire damaged David and Latusha Love's home. (ECF No. 31-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2.) The Memphis Fire Department responded to the scene and extinguished the fire. (ECF No. 36 at \u00b6 2.) The accident report prepared by the Fire Department suggests that the failure of a fan was to blame. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Allstate insured the home, and the Loves submitted a claim for the fire damage. (ECF No. 31-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.) Upon receiving the claim, Allstate began its own investigation. (ECF No. 31-3 at \u00b6 5.) It hired Rick Eley of Investigative Services Companies, LLC, to perform an \"origin and cause investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In Mr. Eley's opinion, while the fire originated near the HVAC system, the fire was not attributable to an electrical or mechanical failure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.) Instead, Mr. Eley concluded that \"the cause of the fire was someone igniting flammable [and/or] combustible materials in the hallway of the home.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.) In Mr. Eley's opinion, the \"fire spread and development\" shown on the video \"is too fast\" to have occurred without accelerants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.) Mr. Eley also reviewed a copy of a neighbor's video surveillance footage from the night in question. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The parties agree that, in the video, Mr. Love is shown leaving the house eleven to twelve minutes before the fire is visible, which occurred at 9:21 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. John Owens, an electrical engineer who also investigated the fire on behalf of Allstate, agreed with Dr. Eley that the fire was not attributable to an electrical or mechanical failure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Also as part of the insurance company's initial investigation, both David and Latusha Love submitted to examination under oath on October 31, 2016. Mr. Love testified that he worked until 6:45 p.m. the night of the fire, stopped at home and then at his mother's house around 7:00 p.m., and went to a friend's house for a barbeque afterwards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26.) He stated that he was at the barbeque until 10:00 or 11:00 p.m., when he received a call about the fire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28.) The video surveillance footage, however, shows that he stopped back at his home around 9:00 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) In an initial recorded statement taken on September 7, 2016, Mr. Love also failed to mention that he was at home at this time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While he now acknowledges the discrepancy between the video and the \"approximate times\" to which he initially testified (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27, 36), Mr. Love denies that he caused the fire. (ECF No. 36 at \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Also during the examination under oath, the Loves testified to Mrs. Love's whereabouts differently. Mr. Love testified that his wife had spent the night before the fire at her sister's house, and that she was not at home the night of the fire. (ECF No. 31-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 35.) As for the night of the fire, the parties dispute whether Mr. Love \"stated definitively\" that Mrs. Love was on \"a ladies' night out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) Mrs. Love testified that she spent the night before the fire at home, and that she was at work on the night of the fire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Allstate also questioned the Loves about their financial situation. In November 2015, Mrs. Love suffered an on-the-job injury and began receiving workers compensation, reducing her take-home pay from $1,400 to $800 every two weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 20.) As a result, the Loves \"fell behind financially.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.) At the time of the fire, the Loves \"were behind one month on their house note.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) Shortly before the fire, Mr. Love discovered \"a shorted wire in the vicinity of his hot water heater\" but \"did not have the estimated $150.00\" necessary to repair it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14, 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In December 2016, following its investigation, Allstate denied the Loves' claim. (Denial Letter, ECF No. 1-2 at 15.) Allstate based its decision on the conclusion that \"the fire was incendiary\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   in origin, and ... that [an insured person] caused or procured the fire loss.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Allstate claimed that the Loves \"made material misrepresentations in the presentment of [their] claim with the intent to deceive or defraud Allstate,\" including statements regarding Mr. Love's whereabouts before and during the fire and \"who was in the house prior to the fire.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both arson and intentional misrepresentations could provide grounds to deny coverage under the policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 31-3 at \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In May 2017, the Loves filed their Complaint in Shelby County Chancery Court, alleging that their insurance claim was wrongfully denied. (ECF No. 1-2 at \u00b6 13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The matter was subsequently removed to this Court.

Voiding a policy after a loss occurs is \"in the nature of a penalty or a forfeiture,\" and, as such, \"a strict construction should be adopted, and the forfeiture not enforced except on the plainest grounds, if at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Matthews v.

(ECF No. 21-1 at 8-9.) Plaintiffs dispute whether these misrepresentations were both material and intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Materiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At the outset, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' representations regarding Mrs. Love's whereabouts were not material. To be sure, Plaintiffs cannot both be correct when one says she spent the prior night at the house and one says she did not, or when one states that she was at a \"ladies' night\" the night of the fire and one believes she was at work. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 21-1 at 9.) But Allstate fails to explain how Mrs. Love's whereabouts the night prior to the fire were material to the investigation at all or why it mattered where she was the night of the fire. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) The material issue for the night in question is that she was not home, which both Loves stated and is not refuted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On the other hand, the materiality of fact that Mr. Love was at the house approximately twelve minutes-as opposed to two hours-before the fire started is obvious. Indeed, Plaintiffs concede that \"David Love's statements concerning the timing of the events on the evening of the fire could be material.\" (ECF No. 31-1 at 5.) As such, the Court will consider whether this misrepresentation was intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Indeed, Allstate points to little else but the fact of the misrepresentation. And Mr. Love offers an explanation-he forgot. (ECF No. 31-1 at 2-3 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   David Love Depo. Tr., ECF No. 32-1 at 20, 21.) Mr. Love claims that he \"had other stuff on his mind\" when he was initially questioned and that counsel \"didn't ask [him]\" whether he returned to the house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 24.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Love also specifically denies that \"[he] didn't want [counsel] to know\" that he had returned to the house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) As skeptical as the Court may be of Mr. Love's explanations, intent to deceive is a question of fact, and questions of credibility are more appropriately decided by the jury.\n   <em>\n    Wassom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8912252\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/173/775/#p782\">\n    173 S.W.3d at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 ;\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3964120\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/680/287/\">\n    680 F.Supp. at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A reasonable jury could find-if it found Mr. Love to be a credible witness-that Mr. Love did not intend to deceive Allstate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    477 U.S. at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Allstate makes much of the fact that Mr. Love consistently represented that he was at the barbeque until he was shown the surveillance video. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 21-1 at 9 ; ECF No. 37 at 2-3, 5, 7.) However, a reasonable jury could find that it is normal, once a thing has been forgotten, not to recover one's memory sua sponte-ordinarily, one must be reminded. In addition, the Court observes that Defendant's own expert reports state that Mr. Love\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   inform Mr. Eley on August 23, 2016-a date even more proximate to the fire than the initial statement, examination under oath\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the deposition-that \"he left home somewhere around 9PM.\" (ECF No. 39-3 at 12, 16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In an effort to distinguish Plaintiffs' case law on this issue, Allstate points out that Plaintiffs' explanation does not involve reliance on an Allstate agent or a lawyer's advice, and that mental stress will not absolve an otherwise knowing material representation. (ECF No. 37 at 5.) The Court agrees with both of these assertions, but does not believe that either is sufficient to wrest the credibility determination from the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Civil Arson Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Allstate next argues that summary judgment is appropriate because the undisputed material facts support a civil arson defense. In Tennessee, \"[t]o make out a defense of arson, a fire insurance company must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the loss was due to a fire of incendiary origin, that the insured had an opportunity to set the fire, and that he had a motive to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    McReynolds v. Cherokee Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9970730\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/815/208/#p211\">\n    815 S.W.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 211 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991). These elements \"may be proved by ... circumstantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9970730\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/815/208/#p211\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court agrees with Allstate that the undisputed evidence suggests that Mr. Love had both a motive to set the fire and that he had the opportunity to do so, and Plaintiffs do not explicitly challenge these conclusions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 31-1 at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   However, Plaintiffs do challenge whether the fire was \"of incendiary origin.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9970730\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/815/208/#p211\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) While Plaintiffs do not dispute that Mr. Eley arrived at this conclusion, they do dispute whether this conclusion is correct. (Response to Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, ECF No. 31-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-9.) Plaintiffs point to the Memphis Fire Department incident report, which suggests that the cause of the fire was the \"[f]ailure of equipment or heat source,\" specifically, a \"[w]orn out ... [f]an.\" (ECF No. 38-1 at 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs have also listed\n   Franklin Hobbs and Daniel Moore, the \"two firefighters who completed the official report concerning the fire,\" in their Rule 26 Expert Disclosure, in anticipation \"that said officers will testify that[,] in their opinion, the cause of ignition of the fire ... was failure of equipment or heat source; the malfunction of a worn out fan located in the house; and that no human factors contributed to ignition.\" (ECF No. 20-1 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant replies that the Court is not obliged to adopt a version of the facts that is \"wholly unsupportable\" in light of the surveillance footage.\n   <em>\n    Kinlin v. Kline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064196\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/573/#p576\">\n    749 F.3d 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576 (6th Cir. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p380\">\n    550 U.S. 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380-81,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p380\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p380\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Although the Court agrees with this statement as a general proposition, Defendant submitted the wrong video for consideration with its Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   More importantly, however, the agreed-upon description of the surveillance footage does not lead to an uncontested conclusion that Mr. Love started the fire. Mr. Love does not now dispute that he was at home, providing the opportunity necessary to support Allstate's civil arson defense. He\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   dispute that he started the fire. While it is certainly suspect that he was at the house shortly before the fire began, a reasonable jury could also find, based on his testimony, that it was coincidental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant also argues that the video should be viewed in conjunction with Mr. Eley's opinion that \"an accelerant must have been used to cause the fire to progress as quickly as it did.\" (ECF No. 37 at 9.) Defendant acknowledges, however, that Plaintiffs challenge the lack of expressed methodology related to this \"conclusory position,\" noting that it is \"unsupported by any test results or data.\" (ECF No. 31-1 at 2.) Indeed, Plaintiffs' Motion to Exclude Mr. Eley remains pending, and resolution in their favor may ultimately mean that this opinion is inadmissible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 39 at 5-6.) Even if it is not excluded, a jury could choose not to credit Mr. Eley's opinion on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court concludes that there is a genuine issue of disputed material fact as to whether the fire was incendiary in nature. As such, summary judgment on Defendant's civil arson defense is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Allstate is not entitled to summary judgment on either of its theories. As to whether Plaintiffs made material, post-loss misrepresentations with intent to deceive or defraud, Allstate has not carried its burden of demonstrating that the statements regarding Mrs. Love's whereabouts were material. While Mr. Love's omission of the fact that he was home shortly before the fire started was material, the Court finds that his deposition testimony creates a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether he intended to deceive or defraud Allstate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As to Allstate's civil arson defense, there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the fire was \"incendiary in origin,\" one of the elements of this defense. Plaintiffs challenge the reliability of Mr. Eley's conclusions, and point to the report of the Memphis Fire Department as creating a genuine issue for trial. Without weighing the evidence, the Court concludes that there is a disagreement sufficient\n   to require submission to a jury. As such, the Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , this 30th day of May, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Billy Joel,\n    <em>\n     We Didn't Start the Fire\n    </em>\n    (Universal Music Publishing Group 1989).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Court was unable, however, to review the relevant surveillance footage.

In addition, Allstate acknowledges the existence of the Fire Report in the Statement of Undisputed Material Facts. (ECF No. 36 at 2.)
