Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on its claims. Defendant GeneSYS ID, Inc. (\"GNID\") contends that the Notes are void as usurious, and accordingly moves to dismiss the complaint on usury grounds.

GNID disputes this characterization, and contends that GNID borrowed $35,000 and executed a promissory Note reflecting the same.

Failure to Honor Notice of Conversion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 28, 2016, AB submitted a Notice of Conversion to GNID for $5,000 of the Note to be converted into 439,560 shares of GNID Common Stock at $.011375 per share. SMF \u00b6\u00b6 36-38;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Goldstein Decl Exs. F, G (ECF Nos. 53-6, 53-7). The following day Lorraine Yarde, GNID's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), acknowledged receipt of the Notice of Conversion but stated that GNID would not be honoring it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Goldstein Decl.

GNID did not deliver the shares.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   GNID's 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2016 stated that the company \"terminated it transfer agent on September 6, 2016, preventing further toxic conversions and bringing all parties to the table to discuss a satisfactory settlement....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   10-Q at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Around December 15, 2016, AB emailed a Default Notice to Yarde.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Goldstien Decl. Ex. I (ECF No. 53-9). The Notice reiterated the terms of the Note and SPA, stated that GNID breached the Note by failing to tender the requested shares, and demanded immediate delivery of the requested shares.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To date, GNID has not delivered the requested shares.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   AB alleges that GNID has breached the following provisions of the Note: \u00a7 8(k), by failing to deliver the requested shares of Converted Stock; \u00a7 8(b), by breaching its representations that it would deliver the requested shares, maintain a share reserve, and repay the Note upon maturity; and \u00a7 12, by terminating its relationship with its transfer agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49, 52-55, 59, 61. It further alleges that GNID breached Section 3(c) of the SPA by failing to deliver the requested shares and terminating the transfer agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51, 59, 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   AB contends that as a result of this breach, GNID is in default and owes payments at the default interest rate as well as damages as provided for in the Note. GNID contends that the Note is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   as usurious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   AB filed the complaint commencing this action on February 16, 2017. ECF No. 1. AB filed an amended complaint on April 19, 2017, bringing claims for breach of the SPA, breach of the Note, unjust enrichment, anticipatory breach of the Note and SPA, and costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees. ECF No. 18 (\"FAC\"). That is the operative complaint in this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On January 16, 2018, GNID moved to dismiss this action pursuant to\n   Fed. R. Civ.

However, it contends that material issues of fact as to\n   the terms of these agreements remain. Essentially, GNID contends that the fact that the Note had an 8% interest rate is \"disputed\" because (1) the $2,000 payment to AB's attorney should be considered 6% \"hidden interest\"; (2) since the cash repayment option was only available for the first 180 days, the actual interest rate prior to conversion was 28%; (3) the discounted stock created an interest rate of at least 35%; and (4) the stock reservation represented a 400% interest rate.

Mar. 7, 2017) (option to redeem Notes for equity at discounted price should not be factored into interest analysis because \"though the initial transaction took the form of a loan, upon conversion to equity, the loans likely have the character of an equity investment, and are thus no longer vulnerable to a usury defense\");\n   <em>\n    Adar Bays\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522959\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/698/#p701\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Adar\n   Bays has at minimum stated a plausible claim that a right to convert loan principal into shares, even at a fixed percentage discount, is materially more uncertain than a right to receive cash and therefore should not be considered as interest in a usury calculation.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court agrees with AB that the 35% discount should not be included in the interest calculation. The conversion right was simply too uncertain at the time of contracting. As courts have noted, a myriad of circumstances could decrease the price of the stock, including that \"Defendant could become delinquent in its filings, become delisted, experience sudden decreases in its stock price, experience no demand for its stock, or simply cancel the reserve or refuse a conversion.\"\n   <em>\n    Adar Bays\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522959\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/698/#p701\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   702-03 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phlo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%201313387\">\n    2001 WL 1313387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"[I]t was not clear that any effective interest rate in excess of 25% would ever have to be paid, as the value of the warrants was uncertain.\"). Accordingly, GNID has not carried its burden of showing that the discounted stock price should be considered in the interest calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Share Reserve\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   GNID next contends that the share reserve that the Note required it to keep in order to effectuate conversions is part of the interest rate. Essentially, GNID argues that the initial reservation of 278,000 shares, and the requirement that it at all times reserve at least three times the amount of shares required if the Note were fully converted, is unlawful under \u00a7 5-511 as the reservation of a \"greater sum\" for the loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def Mem at 20-21. Per GNID's calculations, the value of the reservation at the time the Note was executed was $144,560.00 based on the $35,000 principal, or\n   <em>\n    400%\n   </em>\n   of the value of the original loan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%201313387\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   As AB states, GNID's argument does not hold. Chiefly, \u00a7 5-511 is the\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   usury statute, which \"cannot be asserted by a corporation\" such as GNID.\n   <em>\n    Adar Bays\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522959\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/698/#p701\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any event, GNID is not giving up the shares in reserve. They remain in control of GNID's agent while AB has the option to convert the shares, and are returned to GNID if AB does not exercise its option. As a court found when evaluating a similar Note, \"the reservation of shares was not an independent payment to Adar Bays, but merely a mechanism by which to effectuate the share conversion as envisioned by the Note and the SPA. Since the share conversion feature does not render the agreement usurious, neither does the reservation of shares provision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522959\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/698/#p701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    v. Default Rates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   GNID additionally seeks to add the 24% per annum default interest rate to the interest rate calculation. The parties debate whether New York's usury laws apply to default interest rates.

After reviewing state and federal cases, the court in\n   <em>\n    Madden\n   </em>\n   concluded that, while it is clear that \"the civil usury cap does not apply to defaulted obligations,\" the New York Court of Appeals has yet to rule on whether the criminal usury cap so applies and, were it to reach this issue, it likely \"would hold that the criminal usury cap limits interest charged on debts to 25% annually, even for defaulted debts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268018\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/130/#p138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268018\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/130/#p138\">\n    at 140-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Damages Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   GNID contends that the liquidated damages provisions of the Note bring the overall effective default interest rate above 25%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note \u00a7 8 (listing damages provisions). It relies on cases holding liquidated damages unlawful because they were grossly disproportionate to the possible loss and actual damages were not difficult to determine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Union Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201406278\">\n    2017 WL 1406278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (liquidated damages provision \"unenforceable penalty\");\n   <em>\n    Bristol Inv.

Indeed, as discussed above the Court strikes the liquidated damages provisions. Accordingly, they cannot be considered part of the effective interest rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Remedy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Finally, even if the Court had found that the Note was usurious, it would not necessarily be void.
