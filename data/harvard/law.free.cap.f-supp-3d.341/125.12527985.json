INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff, identified by the pseudonym John Doe, is a male and former student\n   enrolled at Defendant Syracuse University (\"Syracuse\" or \"the University\"). He was expelled from the University after having been found to have engaged in nonconsensual sexual intercourse with his classmate, Jane Roe. Plaintiff brings suit against Syracuse alleging that the University's disciplinary process and expulsion of him violated federal and state law. He asserts the following claims: (1) a violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title IX\")(Count I); (2) breach of contract (Count II\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ); and (3) negligence (Count III). Presently before the Court is Syracuse's motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted. Dkt. # 15. For the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, Syracuse's motion is denied with respect to Plaintiff's Title IX claims (Count I) and granted with respect to Plaintiff's state law claims (Counts II and III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. National Controversy Concerning Sexual Assaults on College Campuses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2011, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (\"OCR\") issued a \"Dear Colleague Letter\" to colleges and universities in order to explain its interpretation of Title IX. Compl. Dkt. # 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. The Dear Colleague Letter instructed colleges and universities that compliance with Title IX requires transparent and prompt procedures to investigate and resolve complaints of sexual misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8(a). The Dear Colleague Letter required colleges and universities to employ a \"more likely than not\" standard of proof in sexual misconduct cases; this standard was less exacting than the \"clear and convincing\" or \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standards utilized at some colleges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8(b). It also instructed universities that they should \"minimize the burden on the complainant,\" \"focus more on victim advocacy,\" and allow both parties the right to appeal a decision, which, according to Plaintiff, \"amounts to double jeopardy for an accused student.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8(c)-(e). Many colleges changed their sexual misconduct policies and procedures after the Dear Colleague Letter was issued.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8(f) ). In addition to the Dear Colleague Letter, the federal government pressured colleges to aggressively investigate sexual assaults through its own investigations of universities and potential lawsuits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. As of May 2014, the U.S. Department of Education was investigating at least 129 colleges for possible Title IX violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9(d). \"Schools, including Syracuse, are scared of being investigated or sanctioned by the Department of Education.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. In July 2016, then-Vice President Joseph Biden suggested that schools that do not comply with Title IX administration guidelines could be stripped of federal funding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10(e). According to Plaintiff, \"[i]n response to pressure from OCR, [the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") ], and the White House, educational institutions like Syracuse are limiting procedural protections afforded to male students, like [Plaintiff], in sexual misconduct cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10(a) (\"The Federal government has created a significant amount of pressure on colleges and universities to treat all those accused of sexual misconduct with a presumption of guilt.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Syracuse's Crackdown Amid Public and OCR Pressure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In recent years, and during the period preceding the disciplinary action against John Doe, there was substantial criticism of Syracuse, both in the student body and in the public media, accusing Syracuse of not taking seriously complaints by female students alleging sexual assault by male students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-18. In September 2014, students, faculty and staff gathered on the steps of Hendricks Chapel at Syracuse to protest the University's changes to sexual assault policies. An organization called \"THE General Body,\" a collective of student organizations, spent close to three weeks occupying the Syracuse administration building. Among the demands from\n   THE General Body were an increase in attention to the issue of sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13(c). In December 2014, Syracuse received a report from the Chancellor's Workgroup on Sexual Violence Prevention, Education, and Advocacy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. The report observed that much of the focus of preventing sexual assault at Syracuse is the prevention of acts by males.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14(a). The report says: \"The discourse on campus about sexual assault and relationship violence typically focuses on male-on-female violence involving students who are fulltime undergraduates, White, and heterosexual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In July 2015, New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law the \"Enough is Enough\" legislation to combat sexual assault on college campuses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Syracuse Chancellor Kent Syverud adopted the \"Enough is Enough\" legislation in summer 2015, making him the first private college chancellor or president to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Syracuse received national attention as a result of a September 2015 CNBC report titled, \"One of the most dangerous places for women in America.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. In 2016, Syracuse responded to some of the criticism that it was not taking the problem of sexual assaults on campus seriously.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. One Syracuse Dean responded to such allegations by stating, \"the university has expelled and suspended students and put students on probation for sexual misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17(b). In October 2016, Syracuse students dragged mattresses covered with messages in red tape to protest rape culture on campus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. The protesters described Syracuse as an \"institution that lets perpetrators walk free while survivors, activists, and our families must bear the injustice silently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Syracuse has been the subject of at least two investigations by OCR into how the school responded to allegations of sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. On June 22, 2016, OCR notified Syracuse that it was investigating an allegation that Syracuse failed to respond \"promptly and equitably\" to a \"report of sexual assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19(a). In connection with this investigation, OCR requested a significant amount of data and information from Syracuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On January 17, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   OCR notified Syracuse that it was investigating a second allegation that Syracuse failed to respond \"promptly and equitably\" to a \"report of sexual assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19(b). Officials from OCR were scheduled to visit Syracuse on January 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. According to the news report in response to this visit, Syracuse administration officials sought to emphasize their actions in this area to appease OCR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Syracuse Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the relationship between John Doe and Syracuse is governed by the Student Conduct System Handbook.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Plaintiff also contends that the Student Conduct System Handbook constitutes a contract between students and the school and, in particular, between John Doe and Syracuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22(a). The Syracuse Student Conduct System Handbook, attached to the Complaint as Exhibit A, contains a section entitled \"Syracuse University Policy On Sexual Assault, Sexual Harassment, Stalking Or Relationship Violence (the \"Sexual Misconduct Policy.\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. This provides that students who violate the Sexual Misconduct Policy will be disciplined under the University's Code of Conduct whether\n   or not a criminal prosecution occurs, and that violations of this policy may result in counseling, educational sanctions, disciplinary probation, suspension, expulsion, and referral to the proper law enforcement authorities for prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24(a-b). The Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   harassment, sexual assault, and relationship violence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. \"Sexual assault\" is defined as \"any actual or attempted nonconsensual sexual activity including, but not limited to: sexual intercourse, or sexual touching, committed with coercion, threat, or intimidation (actual or implied) with or without physical force ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25(b). Affirmative consent is required in order for the act to be considered consensual. In order for affirmative consent to be established, there must be proof of \"a knowing, voluntary and mutual decision among all participants to engage in sexual activity.... The definition of consent does not vary based upon a participant's sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.\" Dkt. 1-1, at p. 9. The Sexual Misconduct Policy further provides: \"Consent can be given by words or actions, as long as those words or actions create clear permission regarding willingness to engage in the sexual activity. Silence or lack of resistance, in and of itself, does not demonstrate consent.\" Compl. \u00b6 25(d)(i). In regards to intoxication, the Sexual Misconduct Policy states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Consent is required regardless of whether the person initiating the act is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol ... Consent cannot be given when a person is incapacitated, which occurs when an individual lacks the ability to knowingly choose to participate in sexual activity. Incapacitation may be caused by the lack of consciousness or being asleep, being involuntarily restrained, or if an individual otherwise cannot consent. Depending on the degree of intoxication, someone who is under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or other intoxicants may be incapacitated and therefore unable to consent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25(d)(ii). The Sexual Misconduct Policy specifically provides that \"[i]ntoxication of the respondent cannot be used as a defense to an alleged incident involving sexual assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Sexual Misconduct Policy contains a section referred to as the \"Bill of Rights.\" Under this section, Syracuse students have the right to \"participate in a process that is fair, impartial, and provides adequate notice and meaningful opportunity to be heard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26(a). The Student Conduct System Handbook explicitly guarantees \"Fundamental Fairness\" to students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Plaintiff alleges that, in addition to this explicit obligation, Syracuse has a duty under applicable accreditation standards to provide a disciplinary process that is consistent with the liberal values of fairness and due process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. The accreditation standards applied to the school require that Syracuse's \"policies and procedures are fair and impartial, and assure that grievances are addressed promptly, appropriately, and equitably.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33(b)(citing Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Standards for Accreditation and Requirements of Affiliation, Thirteenth Edition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Process for Investigation and Review of Sexual Misconduct Complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Attached to the Complaint are the University's Student Conduct System Procedures (the \"Syracuse Procedures\"), which govern the process to be followed upon receipt of an allegation of sexual misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 1-1 at 24-39. The initial step taken in response to a sexual misconduct/sexual violence complaint involves the designation by the University's Title IX Coordinator of a trained Title IX investigator\n   to conduct a comprehensive fact-finding. Each party (complainant and respondent) at this stage, and throughout the process, is entitled to an advisor of their choice, including University-trained procedural advisors.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 24-25. The Syracuse Procedures provide that \"[p]rocedural advisors, including attorneys where applicable, have no standing in the University investigation or in the University Student Conduct System proceedings, except to provide advice to their respective parties in a quiet non-disruptive manner. Advisors and attorneys when applicable, do not represent or speak for their respective parties. Any advisor, including attorneys, who fails to conform their behavior to these requirements will be removed from the proceedings and barred from acting as an advisor in future University Student Conduct System proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The fact-finding process led by the Title IX Investigator can include interviews with witnesses, as well as the parties. Upon completion of the interviews and information-gathering, the Investigator prepares a report summarizing relevant factual findings. Dkt. # 1-1 at p. 25. Both the complaining and responding parties are then given an opportunity to reply to the report, and those replies are shared by the Investigator with the parties (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the complainant is given respondent's reply, and respondent is provided with complainant's reply).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Upon receipt of this input from the parties, the Investigator submits a final report (\"Investigative Report\"), together with the written replies (if any) from the parties and a statement of the underlying charges to a three-member University Conduct Board, comprised of trained faculty and staff members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 25-26.

A complaint may also allege particular procedural flaws affecting the proof. However, allegations of a procedurally or otherwise flawed proceeding that has led to an adverse and erroneous outcome combined with a conclusory allegation of gender discrimination is not sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. The fatal gap is, again, the lack of a particularized allegation relating to a causal connection between the flawed outcome and gender bias. A plaintiff must thus also allege particular circumstances suggesting that gender bias was a motivating factor behind the erroneous finding.

Nonetheless, his allegations that the Investigator noted that Roe's description of events in Doe's room was \"splotchy;\" that witnesses describe Roe as \"drunk but able to walk in a straight line and talk without slurring her speech;\" that Roe appeared to utilize the disciplinary process as a means to punish Doe by alleging that he violated the No Contact Order when he entered the dining hall and by alleging that Doe \"physically assaulted\" another female student during a sexual encounter because Doe gave this student a hickey; that the investigation revealed that both Doe and Roe were highly intoxicated but applied the presumption of the inability to knowingly consent to sexual intercourse only to Roe; that Syracuse failed to adequately investigate and question Roe's credibility; that Syracuse limited questions and commentary of investigatory findings to Roe's emotional state and interactions with friends and family in the days and weeks after the alleged incident; that Syracuse \"failed to examine many of the blatant contradictions in Jane Roe's statements;\" and that the Investigator, the University Conduct Board, the Appeals Board, and the Syracuse official who ultimately reviewed the appeal chose to believe Roe's description of events in Doe's room even though Roe indicated that she had very little memory of the Incident, provide sufficient fact-based allegations to meet Plaintiff's minimal burden of casting some articulable doubt on the accuracy of the outcome of the disciplinary proceeding.

But, Doe argues, the Board made no similar recommendation to discipline Roe. Doe contends that Roe's conduct is com parable to that for which he was disciplined, and Syracuse's failure to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   initiate disciplinary proceedings against Roe evidences a gender bias by the University. Doe further contends that public and OCR pressure on the University to more aggressively discipline male sexual assault respondents (as discussed above with regard to the erroneous outcome claim) supports a plausible inference of discriminatory intent by Syracuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Although the fact that Doe filed no complaint against Roe would ordinarily defeat a selective enforcement claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prasad,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203212079\">\n    2016 WL 3212079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   here the University took the initiative to transform Roe's complaint into a claim that she did not intend.

However, none of these cases support Plaintiff's position; in other words, none stand for the proposition that, under New York law, accreditation standards give rise to a duty of care for colleges or universities. Indeed, Plaintiff concedes that \"New York does not appear to have addressed the issue.\" (Dkt. 17 at 26).
