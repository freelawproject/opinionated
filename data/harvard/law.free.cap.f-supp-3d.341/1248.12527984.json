Brooke Jackson, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the U.S. Department of State's motion seeking judgment on the administrative record on plaintiff Dana Zzyym's Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") claims and dismissal of the claims contained within the remainder of Dana's Complaint. ECF No. 35. The case was administratively closed in\n   November 2016 after I found that the administrative record did not show that the Department's decision-making process resulting in the gender policy was rational. ECF Nos. 55-56. I remanded the case to the Department for reconsideration of its policy. ECF No. 55. After reconsideration, the Department reaffirmed the gender policy in May 2017, and in June 2017 I reopened the case. The parties filed supplemental briefing with regard to the Department's motion seeking judgment on the administrative record and to dismiss. ECF Nos. 58, 65, 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After considering the briefings, oral argument, and relevant law, the Court determines that (1) the Department's gender policy is arbitrary and capricious under the APA, and (2) the denial of Dana's passport application is in excess of the Department's statutory authority (Counts I and II). Because the APA grants Dana relief, the Court need not resolve the motion to dismiss on the constitutional claims or Dana's claim under the mandamus act (Counts III, IV, V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dana Alix Zzyym is an intersex individual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 1 (Complaint). In September 2014 Dana submitted an application for a United States passport.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. Instead of checking the box labeled \"M\" for male or \"F\" for female on the application form, Dana instead wrote \"intersex\" below the \"sex\" category. ECF No. 34 at 2 (Administrative Record). By separate letter Dana informed the passport authorities that Dana was neither male nor female.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The letter requested \"X\" as an acceptable marker in the sex field to conform to International Civil Aviation Organization (\"ICAO\") standards for machine-readable travel documents. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It is undisputed that in every other respect Dana is qualified to receive a passport. However, the application was denied (and has since been denied a second time). ECF No. 34 at 18; Administrative R. [Dkt. 64-01 through 64-44] [hereinafter \"R.\"], 79-80. Dana sued, contending that the State Department's denials of Dana's application and its underlying binary-only gender policy violate the APA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as Dana's due process and equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1, 61 (Supplemental Complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Department issued its initial denial of Dana's passport application on September 24, 2014, explaining that \"[t]he Department of State currently requires the sex field on United States passports to be listed as 'M' or 'F[,]' \" and that the Department would be \"unable to fulfill your request to list your sex as 'X.' \" ECF No. 34 at 18.

The Department explained that Dana could still obtain a passport by reapplying and providing all required information on the passport application form-that is, checking either the box \"M\" for male or \"F\" for female. ECF No. 34 at 36. On February 26, 2015 Dana requested that the Department once again reconsider its decision or conduct a review hearing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2051.70\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

ECF No. 35. The Court held oral argument on that motion on July 20, 2016. ECF No. 51 (Transcript). On November 26, 2016, I ruled that the agency's decision-making process was not rational based upon the evidence in the record and remanded the case to the Department for reevaluation of its gender policy.\n   <em>\n    Zzyym v.

R. 67-69. The Department refused to issue the temporary passport but noted that it would soon complete its review of the policy. R. 75-76. On May 1, 2017 the Department denied Dana's passport application for a second time and issued a memorandum in which it explained its decision to maintain the gender policy. R. 79-80, 82-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This case was reopened at Dana's unopposed request, and as such the Department's\n   motion seeking judgment on the administrative record on plaintiff's APA claims and dismissal of the claims contained within the remainder of Dana's Complaint is ripe once more. ECF No. 35. On July 6, 2017 Dana filed a supplemental complaint to reflect the May 2017 denial of Dana's passport application. ECF No. 61. As reflected in the supplemental complaint, Dana seeks \"injunctive relief and a judicial declaration that the State Department has exceeded its authority under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) and has violated the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution through agency actions which occurred after October 25, 2015.\" ECF No. 61 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In October 2017 Dana filed a brief regarding the Department's May 2017 decision to maintain the policy.

ECF No. 51 at 18. However, the Department changed course and added a male and female checkbox.

ECF No. 55. The reasons provided by the Department for the policy failed to show a reasoned decision-making process and instead seemed to be ad hoc rationalizations for the binary nature of the gender field. I remanded the case to the Department for\n   reconsideration which, in effect, gave the Department an additional chance to bolster the record and show that the policy making underlying the gender policy was not arbitrary and capricious. The Department did indeed reconsider the policy, and it submitted an eight-page memorandum explaining its rationale and pointing to the evidence it relied upon in making its decision to deny Dana's application once more. R. 82-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Now, for me to find that the Department's policy making was not arbitrary and capricious, the May 2017 memorandum must display something more than what was before me in November 2016 that explains how and why the policy was created. In the Department's memorandum, the Department first notes that it is aware that some countries and the International Civil Aviation Organization (the UN agency that sets forth passport specifications) provide for the issuance of travel documents bearing an \"X\" in addition to \"M\" or \"F\". R. 82. The Department then provides five reasons for the gender policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   1.\n   <strong>\n    Sex Data Point Ensures Accuracy and Verifiability of Passport Holder's Identity\n   </strong>\n   : The policy is necessary to ensure that the information contained in US passports is accurate and verifiable, thus ensuring the integrity of the US passport as proof of identity and citizenship. Because the Department relies on third-party documentation issued by state, municipal, and/or foreign authorities who largely do not allow gender identifiers other than male or female to determine an applicant's identity, the Department would have a more difficult job verifying the identity of a passport holder if a gender aside from male or female was used.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    Sex Data Point is Used to Determine Applicant's Eligibility to Receive Passport\n   </strong>\n   : The policy is necessary because the sex of a passport applicant (male or female) is a vital data point in determining whether someone is entitled to a passport. In order to determine whether an applicant is eligible to receive a passport, the Department must data-match with other law enforcement systems. Because \"all such agencies recognize only two sexes,\" the Department's continued use of a binary option for the sex data point is the most reliable means to determine eligibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   3.\n   <strong>\n    Consistency of Sex Data Point Ensures Easy Verification of Passport Holder's Identity in Domestic Contexts\n   </strong>\n   : The policy is necessary to ensure that a passport can be used as a reliable proof of identity within the United States. The introduction of a \"new, third sex option in US passport applications and Passport data systems could introduce verification difficulties in name checks and complicate automated data sharing among these other agencies.\" The Department believes that this would \"cause operational complications.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   4.\n   <strong>\n    There is No Generally Accepted Medical Consensus on How to Define a Third Sex\n   </strong>\n   : The policy is necessary because there is no generally accepted medical consensus as to how to define a third sex, making it unreliable as a component of identity verification. \"Although the Department acknowledges that there are individuals whose gender identity is neither male nor female, the Department lacks a sound basis on which to make a reliable determination that such an individual has changed their sex to match that gender identity.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   5.\n   <strong>\n    Altering Department System Would Be Expensive and Time-Consuming\n   </strong>\n   : The policy is necessary because changing it would be inconvenient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Looking at the proffered reasons and cited evidence provided by the Department, I find that the Department's decision is arbitrary and capricious. I will address each of the Department's proffered reasons and explain why in my judgment they do not show that the gender policy is the product of a rational decision-making process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    i. Reasons One through Three Fail to Show Rational Decision Making\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Reasons one through three essentially boil down to the same argument-\n   <em>\n    the Department needs to maintain the binary gender classification system for passports because this will ensure accuracy and reliability in cross-checking gender data with other identity systems.\n   </em>\n   R. 82-86. The Department notes that the binary system is important at two points: (1) when determining if an applicant is eligible to receive a passport, and (2) when a passport holder seeks to use their passport as proof of identity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After reviewing the memorandum and administrative record, I find that the Department failed to add any substantive arguments or evidence that wasn't previously before the Court when I rejected this argument in my November 2016 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In that order, I noted that the Department's argument that the binary gender policy helped to ensure the accurate identification of passport applicants/holders failed when one looked deeper at the evidence in the administrative record. For example, I noted that the Department undermined its purported rationale when it informed Dana that Dana could receive a male passport if Dana provided a physician's letter attesting to that gender, even though Dana's Colorado driver's license listed Dana's gender as female. ECF No 55 at 10. The Department has established policies in place that passport specialists and consular officers must follow \"when an applicant indicates a gender on the 'sex' line on the passport application with information different from some or all of the submitted citizenship and/or identity evidence[,]\" R. 178; 7 FAM \u00a7 1310 App. M. By allowing this means of gender designation on the passport, the Department made it apparent that it did not actually rely on other jurisdictions' gender data to verify passport applicants' identities to the extent it argued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Further, I noted that the administrative record included evidence that \"not every law enforcement record from which data is input to this system designates an individual's sex,\" and \"a field left blank in the system is assumed to reflect that the particular datum is unknown or unrecorded.\" ECF No. 55 at 10 (citing declaration of Bennet Fellows, Division Chief at the Department). Therefore-in addition to the Department's admission that gender is just one of many fields used to crosscheck a passport applicant/holder's identity with other systems (other fields include one's social security number, date of birth, name, etc.)-the Department also admitted that in some systems the gender field isn't even used or reliable. As such, I held the Department's insistence that a binary gender data option is necessary to ensure accuracy and reliability simply was not the case under the evidence provided and therefore was insufficient to show that the policy was the product of rational decision making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Since that decision, the only \"new\" evidence in the record on this point cuts against the Department. Joining multiple countries and the International Civil Aviation Organization's recognition of a non-binary gender classification system, at least four U.S. states and territories now\n   issue identification cards with a third gender option.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department was on notice of this when it reconsidered its policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the Department's insistence that a binary gender system is necessary to accurately and reliably crosscheck a passport applicant/holder's identity ignores the reality that some American passport applicants will have gender verification documents that exclusively list a gender that is neither female nor male.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As support to its May 2017 letter, the Department offers a \"History of the Designation of Sex in U.S. Passports,\" to explain the basis for its 1976 decision to add a requirement that applicant's designate either \"male\" or \"female\" in passport applications. R. 87-90. This brief history explained that the decision to add a sex marker to passport applications was made under the direction of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which commissioned a panel of passport experts to address border security concerns resulting from the increase in international air travel. Apparently, the data field of \"SEX (M-F)\" was recommended because experts thought \"[that with] the rise in the early 1970s of unisex attire and hairstyles, photographs had become a less reliable means for ascertaining a traveler's sex.\" R. 88. In a 1974 report \"an ICAO panel confirmed that a holder's sex should be included on passports because names did not always provide a ready indication, and appearances from the passport photograph could be misleading.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Though this still doesn't answer the question of why a traveler's sex needed to be ascertained, the Department notes that at the time there was no consideration of a third sex marker as the passport book was based on the technical specifications of the ICAO, and the ICAO specified only male and female.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But as noted already, the ICAO standards for machine-readable travel documents now specify that sex should be designated by \"the capital F for female, M for male, or X for unspecified.\" ECF 1 \u00b6 35; ICAO Document 9303, Machine Readable Travel Documents, at IV-14 (7th ed. 2015) at 14. The Department does not explain its departure from adherence to this standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Overall, in these three rationales, the Department argues that the purpose of the sex designation on the passport is to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the document. The Department has maintained that the male and female markers \"help identify the bearer of the document, and ensure that the passport remains reliable proof of identification.\" ECF 35 at 24. Dana submitted multiple medical certifications from licensed physicians attesting that she is neither male nor female, but intersex. Dana's Complaint describes invasive and unnecessary medical procedures that doctors subjected Dana to as a child that attempted but failed to change Dana's intersex nature. ECF 1 \u00b6 15. I find that requiring an intersex person to misrepresent their sex on this identity document is a perplexing way to serve the Department's goal of accuracy and integrity. In sum, taking the Department's proffered rationales that I previously determined were inadequate with the new evidence in the administrative record regarding the growing body of jurisdictions that allow for a non-binary gender marker, I find that the Department failed to show that its\n   decision-making process regarding the policy was rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Reason Four Fails to Show Rational Decision Making\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Department's fourth asserted reason for maintaining the binary gender policy also fails. The Department argues that the policy is necessary because there is no generally accepted medical consensus as to how to define a third sex, making it unreliable as a component of identity. R. 85. However, by its own regulations, the Department relies upon a medical authority which plainly recognizes a third sex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 FAM \u00a7 1310(b). The Department defers to the medical \"standards and recommendations for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), recognized as the authority in this field by the American Medical Association (AMA),\" 7 FAM \u00a7 1310(b) App. M. WPATH recognizes a third sex. R. 646-763. In addition, the administrative record includes the opinions of three former U.S. Surgeons General and the American Medical Association Board of Trustees that describe non-binary sex categories. ECF No. 65 at 13-14. The Department recognizes that it is medically established that an intersex person is born with mixed or ambiguous markers of sex that do not fit into the typical notions of either male or female bodies. 7 FAM \u00a7 1360 App. M; R. 185, 605, 765. The Department's uncertainty about how it would evaluate persons \"transitioning\" to a third sex misses the ball - intersex people are born as they are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In the May 2017 letter, the Department highlights that it is unable to recognize a third gender \"partly due to the lack of consensus of what it means, biologically, for an individual to have a sex other than male or female.\" R 86. However, the information relied upon in the administrative record also reflect a lack of consensus as to how individuals born intersex could be classified as either \"male\" or \"female,\" R. 947-65.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This has not prevented the Department from requiring intersex people to elect, perhaps at random, as it doesn't seem to matter to the Department which one of those two categories Dana chooses. Even if the Court ignored the Department's deference to the WPATH, the justification that there is a lack of medical consensus, whereby \"there are a number of genetic, hormonal and physiological conditions in which an individual is not easily classified as male or female,\" R. 86, still fails to account for why the binary sex designation is preferable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Taking this evidence together, the Department's argument that the gender policy is necessary because there is no medically accepted consensus regarding a third sex is not rational and fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Reason Five is not Sufficient\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the Department arrives at what this Court suspects is the real reason that the Department has been so resistant to adding a third gender option to passports: money and time. The Department argues that switching the existing data systems-which are currently incapable of printing a passport that reflects a gender option other than \"M\" or \"F\"-would be considerably costly and timely. R. 86. However, the\n   Department admits that it has not undertaken a level of effort (LOE) estimation on the time and cost that it would take to add the third sex designation option to the U.S. passport biodata page.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This does not ring of a rational decision. Without record evidence of or even an attempt at determining the time, cost, or coordination necessary, the Court cannot defer to the Department's claims of administrative convenience.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Plyler v. Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187607\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/202/#p227\">\n    457 U.S. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227-28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187607\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/202/#p227\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187607\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/202/#p227\">\n    72 L.Ed.2d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) (\"There is no evidence in the record suggesting...any significant burden on the State's economy.\"). True, common sense would tell anyone that altering a system will necessary involve some effort and money. However, the Department's rational here is the product of guesswork rather than actual analysis, and it does not rise to the level of reliable evidence that is needed to show that the Department's policymaking was rational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In sum, the Department added very little to the evidence and explanations that were before this Court in November 2016 when I determined that the Department's policymaking was not the product of rational decision making. Even with the new memorandum and proffered reasons, I again find that the gender policy is arbitrary and capricious and not the product of rational decision making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Denial of Dana's Passport Application Exceeds the Authority Delegated to the Department by Congress,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n      5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2)(C) ).\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Dana challenges the policy under a second provision of the APA, section 706(2)(C), which empowers the Court to \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions\" that are \"in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(C).

I have already held that the Department has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in maintaining a gender policy that requires Dana to inaccurately select M or F, when the administrative record does not provide a rational basis for this requirement. Because neither the Passport Act nor any other law authorizes the denial of a passport application without good reason, and adherence to a series of internal policies that do not contemplate the existence of intersex people is not good reason, the Department has acted in excess of its statutory jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Injunctive Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In addition to declaratory judgment that defendant is in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, plaintiff's requested relief includes an injunction \"permanently restrain[ing] or enjoining Defendants from relying upon its male-or-female, binary-only gender maker policy to withhold the requested passport from Dana or any other individual.\" ECF No. 1 at 21.

Technically, however, because injunctive relief is available under the Administrative Procedure Act, and this relief is essentially identical to a writ of mandamus, the Court need not issue a writ of mandamus. Also, because the Administrative Procedure Act grants plaintiff relief, I will not proceed to the constitutional claims in Counts III and IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   I find that the administrative record does not show that the decision making process that resulted in the policy in question was rational. The withholding of the passport from Dana Zzyym is in excess of statutory authority. Recognizing the unreasonable delays Dana has faced in the issuance of a passport with an intersex marker, the Court enjoins the Department from relying upon its binary-only gender marker policy to withhold the requested passport from Dana.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Plaintiff explains: \" 'Intersex' is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. Intersex people are born with sex characteristics that do not fit typical binary notions of bodies designated 'male' or 'female.' In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth, while in others they are not apparent until puberty. Some variations may not be visibly apparent at all.\" Complaint, ECF No. 1, at \u00b6 11.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Dana also included a birth certificate that had been amended in 2012 to list Dana's sex as \"unknown.\" ECF No. 34 at 5; ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 10.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Since the date this case was filed, the Secretary of State has changed three times and therefore so has the named defendant in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    As defendant explains, although in the District of Colorado a plaintiff or petitioner typically files the opening brief when \"appealing\" a government agency's decision under the APA, the parties have agreed \"with the Court's approval, that defendants would file the first dispositive motion in this case,\" and that their motion would address the APA claims. ECF No. 35 at 6 n.1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    I noted in my last order, and will note again here that the term \"policy\" is a bit of a misnomer. The policy which the Department claims requires it to issue passports only marked \"M\" for male or \"F\" for female is really a collection of rules pertaining to gender contained within the Foreign Affairs Manual.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 34 at 20-27 (citing 7 FAM 1310 Appendix M, 7 FAM 1320 Appendix M, 7 FAM 1330 Appendix M, 7 FAM 1340 Appendix M, 7 FAM 1350 Appendix M, 7 FAM 1360 Appendix M, 7 FAM 1370 Appendix M, 7 FAM 1380 Appendix M, 7 FAM 1390 Appendix M). These rules do not explicitly state that the Department cannot issue a passport containing an alternative gender marking, and also do not contemplate the existence of a gender other than male or female. Rather, they simply explain how the Department deals with different issues related to gender on passport applications.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    These U.S. states are Washington, Oregon, California, and the District of Columbia. Further, at oral argument in June 2018, Dana represented that New York issued a birth certificate stating \"intersex\" in the sex field.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 85 at 7.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 189 (Department's acknowledgment that other jurisdictions considering non-binary gender policy).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Moreover, Plaintiff offers evidence of the potential harmful effects of forcing an arbitrary binary classification upon people born intersex.

Dana's Complaint reflects that attempts to sort intersex individuals into the categories of \"male\" or \"female\" upon birth have resulted in unnecessary and painful medical surgeries and harm to intersex individuals.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
