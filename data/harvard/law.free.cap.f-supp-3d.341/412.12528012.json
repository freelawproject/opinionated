BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court is well-acquainted with this case since its inception in December 2015. The case arises from the failed merger of Rite Aid and Walgreens. We have detailed the facts of the matter in prior orders and need not fully repeat ourselves here. However, to briefly summarize the pertinent history, Hering filed an Amended Complaint on December 11, 2017, (Doc. 83), alleging fraudulent misrepresentations made by Rite Aid and Walgreens related to the merger from October 27, 2015, to June 28, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1). These statements, Hering alleged, violated \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78t(a), as well as Rule 10b-5 promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Rite Aid and Walgreens separately filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim on February 14, 2018. (Docs. 89, 93). After providing the parties additional time for briefing, we granted Rite Aid's motion and denied Walgreens' motion. (Doc. 111). With respect to statements made by Walgreens, however, we noted that only the statements made on and after October 20, 2016, were actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 24, 2018, Walgreens filed the instant Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, (Doc. 125), arguing that our limitation on which statements were actionable removed Hering's standing, as his last alleged purchase of Rite Aid stock occurred prior to the first actionable statement of Walgreens. In response, Hering, while not denying his sudden lack of standing, argues that the preferred remedy is to proceed to class certification and the identification of a proper class representative. Nevertheless, Herring filed the Joint Motion to Intervene, (Doc. 132), on September 6, 2018, as a protective measure. Both motions have been fully briefed and are\n   ripe for review. (Docs. 126, 133, 134, 138, 139, 144).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Walgreens believes it is entitled to judgment on the pleadings because Hering lost standing when we dismissed his non-actionable claims. \"A motion for judgment on the pleadings should be granted if the movant establishes that 'there are no material issues of fact, and he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman v.

Hering, in this case, last purchased Rite Aid stock before the actionable statements by Walgreens. Thus, Walgreens argues that even if Hering did suffer an injury, he cannot show causation and standing is not satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Walgreens further argues that Hering lacks statutory standing to sue for a \u00a7 10(b) violation pursuant to Rule 10b-5's private cause of action. \"The plaintiff class under Rule 10b-5 is limited exclusively to actual sellers or purchasers of securities.\"\n   <em>\n    Winer Family Trust v.

Again, because Hering did not purchase Rite Aid stock after the actionable statements, he was merely a \"holder\" of securities during the relevant period. Moreover, Walgreens suggests that Hering, without the ability to bring suit for a \u00a7 10(b) violation, necessarily lacks standing to bring a claim under \u00a7 20(a) because \u00a7 20(a) requires liability on a predicate securities violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shapiro v.

Rather, Hering argues that the Court should permit\n   class certification to identify proper class representatives. Hering primarily supports his argument with a case decided in the District of Maryland. (Doc. 134 at 2) (citing\n   <em>\n    City of Cape Coral Mun. Firefighters' Ret. Plan v. Emergent Biosolutions, Inc., HQ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526451\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/676/\">\n    322 F.Supp.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.Md. 2018) ). In\n   <em>\n    Emergent\n   </em>\n   , a securities fraud class action, the District Court had denied the defendant's motion to dismiss but noted that the case went \"from puffery to fraud\" when certain statements were made, implicitly acknowledging that some of the alleged misstatements were not actionable.\n   <em>\n    Emergent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526451\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/676/\">\n    322 F.Supp.3d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff filed a class certification motion, which resulted in a dispute between the parties as to the proper class period; the plaintiff wanted the entire class period reflected in its allegations, while the defendant wanted a shortened class period to reflect the Court's tacit limitation on what statements were actionable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526451\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/676/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court decided that, although it had not \"made any\n   <em>\n    final determinations\n   </em>\n   regarding the materiality and actionability of any of the specifically alleged misstatements, it does recognize, as it did at the ... hearing on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" that the statement bringing the case \"from puffery to fraud\" was an appropriate starting point for the class period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526451\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/676/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in the original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the basis of the shortened class period, the plaintiff lost his standing and could not serve as a class representative.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526451\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/676/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The District Court reasoned, however, that the plaintiff could still serve as Lead Plaintiff, at least in part, because the parties could \"at a later date move this Court to expand the Class Period\" to include earlier statements \"should they later be found to be actionable based on information obtained in discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526451\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/676/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Emergent\n   </em>\n   decision differs from the case at bar in two important ways. First, the Court plainly stated that it had not made any \"final determinations\" as to the actionability of any of the statements. Thus, theoretically, the earlier statements that were excluded from the class period were still part of the case. Second, the Court's determination was simply that the\n   <em>\n    class period\n   </em>\n   should initially be set to cover less of a time period (and, thus, fewer statements), but that the class period would remain subject to modification depending on what facts might arise in discovery. The Court ruled that the plaintiff was precluded from serving as a class representative, but not as a lead plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The circumstances here are different. In our Order on Walgreens' Motion to Dismiss, we\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   make a final determination on the non-actionable statements, and dismissed any claims based on statements made prior to October 20, 2016. Those statements are no longer part of this action. Furthermore, we are not faced with deciding the proper class period in a motion for class certification; we are tasked with determining whether Hering's lack of standing eliminates our jurisdictional authority. We therefore find the\n   <em>\n    Emergent\n   </em>\n   decision unpersuasive and unhelpful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hering next points to\n   <em>\n    In re Cigna Corp. Securities Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5228507\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/459/338/\">\n    459 F.Supp.2d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.Pa. 2006). There, the District Court also permitted the plaintiff to serve as lead plaintiff, despite not being a proper class representative. However, the issue before the Court was not whether the plaintiff had\n   <em>\n    standing\n   </em>\n   , but whether the plaintiff could adequately plead economic loss. The difference between whether a plaintiff can ultimately succeed on a claim and whether a plaintiff has a legal right to bring or maintain a claim cannot be overstated. Therefore, we also find\n   <em>\n    In re Cigna\n   </em>\n   unpersuasive. Having carefully considered the parties' arguments, we ultimately agree with Walgreens based on the reasons that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While it appears that Hering possessed initial standing to commence this litigation, \"an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Genesis Healthcare Corp. v.

A third exception, colloquially termed the \"picking off\" exception to mootness, protects the integrity of class actions in situations where a defendant \"picks off\" named plaintiffs by mooting their private individual claims early in the litigation, such as through settlement offers, and thus cutting off the litigation before the class action procedure can unfold. The\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   court cited \"the general principle that 'the class action process should be able to \"play out\" according to the directives of Rule 23 and should permit due deliberation by the parties and the court on the class certification issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 281 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Weiss v.

Because the filing of a class action complaint provides equal notice of the plaintiff's intent to represent a class, the absence of a motion seeking certification should not be fatal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 288.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although the Third Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   may at first blush seem supportive of Hering here, the Court limited its holding to permitting relation back in the absence of a certification motion \"[w]hen an individual plaintiff's claim for relief\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     is acutely susceptible to mootness\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and it is clear from the complaint that the plaintiff is seeking to represent a class.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 286 (emphasis added). The Court's focus, in other words, was to prevent the undesirable circumstance of a defendant subverting the class action process by repeatedly mooting any named plaintiff's individual claims. As the Court noted, the exception applies \"when defendants are able 'effectively to prevent any plaintiff in the class from procuring a decision on class certification.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 285 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5919361\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/698/#p707\">\n    772 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   706 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the case before us, Hering's Amended Complaint plainly sets forth class action allegations, and it does appear that his claims were mooted before he could reasonably seek certification of a class. However, the mooting of his claims resulted from our dismissal of the non-actionable statements, not through any conduct of Walgreens, such as \"picking off\" named plaintiffs. His claims are not \"inherently transitory,\" \"capable of repetition, yet evading review,\" or \"acutely susceptible to mootness.\" In short, none of the special class action mootness exceptions applies, and the \"general rule\" controls here: \"the mooting of named a plaintiff's claims prior to class certification moots the entire case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 286. Therefore, we find that Hering has lost standing not only with respect to the merits of his individual claim, but also with respect to seeking class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Hering seeks to cure this jurisdictional defect with the Joint Motion to Intervene and arguing for both intervention as of right and permissive intervention.

Hering argues that the above case law is distinguishable because plaintiffs in those cases lacked initial standing, whereas here, Hering had initial standing but lost standing after we dismissed the non-actionable statements. However, we do not see a functional difference between a plaintiff who lacks initial standing and a plaintiff like Hering who loses standing after certain claims are dismissed. In both circumstances, there is no viable claim for the only plaintiff in the case and, consequently, no \"case\" or \"controversy\" before the Court. Thus, \"after dismissal, there is now no entity remaining with which to intervene.\"\n   <em>\n    Applebaum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7856769\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/109/661/#p665\">\n    109 F.R.D. at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
