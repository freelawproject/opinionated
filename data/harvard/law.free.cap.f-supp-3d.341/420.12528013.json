Conner, Chief Judge\n  In the early morning hours of December 19, 2014, plaintiff Erika Eberhardinger (\"Eberhardinger\") left a bar with Mason Millen (\"Millen\") and defendant Matthew Foster (\"Foster\"). Foster, who later admitted to consuming multiple alcoholic beverages that evening, drove Eberhardinger's vehicle. A police officer witnessed Foster violate several traffic laws and attempted to pull the car over. Instead of stopping, Foster began a high-speed chase, which eventually ended when another officer shot four times at Eberhardinger's vehicle. Tragically, several bullets struck Eberhardinger, causing serious injuries. Eberhardinger advances constitutional claims against the officer who fired the shots and the City of York, Pennsylvania (\"the City\"). She also brings contractual claims against her own automobile insurance provider, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\"State Farm\"), for denying certain coverage for her injuries. The officer, the City, and State Farm move for summary judgment on all remaining claims against them.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Events of December 19, 2014\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At approximately 1:45 a.m. on December 19, 2014, Eberhardinger, Millen, and Foster left the Banana Max Bar &amp; Grill in York, Pennsylvania in Eberhardinger's car. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 1; Doc. 61 \u00b6 1). Eberhardinger sat in the front passenger seat, Millen sat in the rear passenger seat, and Foster drove with Eberhardinger's permission. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 2; Doc. 61 \u00b6 7). Foster-who did not have a valid driver's license at the time-admitted that he consumed several beers and multiple shots of hard liquor over the course of the evening and that he was intoxicated when he left the bar. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28, 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Not long into the drive, York City Police Officer Benjamin Praster (\"Officer Praster\") witnessed Foster pause in an intersection even though he had the right of way. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 32; Doc. 61 \u00b6 10; Doc. 58-6 Ex. I at 5, 12). Officer Praster began following Foster, who increased his speed well above the legal limit and ran a stop sign. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6\u00b6 33-34; Doc. 58-6 Ex. I at 5). Officer Praster activated his emergency lights and siren and attempted to execute a traffic stop of Eberhardinger's car. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 35; Doc. 61 \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Foster did not pull over. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 11). He instead led Officer Praster on a high-speed pursuit through the streets of York, during which Foster ran multiple stop signs and traveled in the wrong direction on several one-way streets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 58-2 \u00b6\u00b6 86, 146-48; Doc. 58-6 Ex. N at 0:01-2:05). The chase lasted a little over two minutes, and it does not appear that any other occupied vehicles or pedestrians were encountered. (Doc. 58-6 Ex. N. at 0:01-2:05). During his pursuit, Officer Praster radioed that he was attempting to pull over a vehicle that was failing to stop. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 83). York City Police Officer Benjamin Smith (\"Officer Smith\") was on duty five blocks away; he heard Officer Praster's transmission on his police radio, engaged his emergency lights and siren, and drove to the general area of the pursuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-85, 87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When Foster reached West Gay Street-a single-lane, one-way road permitting only eastbound travel-he began driving the wrong way (westbound) down the street. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 12; Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 88). Officer Smith entered West Gay Street traveling eastbound facing Foster's approaching vehicle, and Officer Praster entered from the opposite end of the street following Foster from behind. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 13; Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 92). Foster was \"boxed in\" by the police cruisers, cutting off any exit. (Doc. 58-6 Ex. I at 15; Doc. 58-5 Ex. G, Smith Dep. at 17:13-18:7; Doc. 58-5 Ex. D, Foster Dep. at 20:5-15, 22:2-9). Officer Smith parked his vehicle in the middle of West Gay Street facing east, blocking Foster's path. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 14; Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 95). To Officer Smith's left (on the north side of West Gay Street) was a guardrail and a drop-off to railroad tracks, and to his right (on the south side of the street) were parked vehicles. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6\u00b6 90-91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Foster saw Officer Smith's patrol car parked in the street in front of him and stopped Eberhardinger's car. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 15). Immediately after Foster came to a stop, Officer Smith exited his patrol car with his service weapon drawn and started running on foot in pursuit of Foster, who had begun backing up in an eastbound direction. (Doc. 82, Eberhardinger Ex. Video Clip 2 (\"Pl.'s Video Ex.\") at 1:08-1:20\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 8). Officer Smith ran toward the reversing Eberhardinger vehicle and shouted \"Get your fucking hands up!\" (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 99; Doc. 65 \u00b6 99; Pl.'s Video Ex. at 1:21-1:22). Officer Smith was unaware that there were any passengers in the vehicle until after it later came to rest and Eberhardinger and Millen climbed out. (Doc. 58-6 Ex. I at 15, 16; Doc. 58-6 Ex. J at 16, 17). As Foster was driving backward, he struck a telephone pole with the rear of the vehicle and came to a stop. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 16). Foster briefly hesitated and then began driving forward in a westbound direction. (Pl.'s Video Ex. at 1:20-1:25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties vehemently dispute the facts and sequence of events that followed. The City and Officer Smith maintain that Foster\n   drove the vehicle directly toward Officer Smith, and that Officer Smith had to jump out of the way as Foster's vehicle \"came within inches of Officer Smith's body and he could feel the wind as the vehicle passed by.\" (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6\u00b6 105-07, 112). Officer Smith avers that he \"heard the tires squeal and the engine revving\" after Foster collided with the telephone pole, and that as the vehicle drove towards him at a high rate of speed he discharged his firearm \"in fear for his life,\" aiming at the center mass of the driver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 107, 109-10). Officer Smith contends that he \"could not get out of the way\" of Foster's vehicle because of the parked cars and the guardrail on either side of the street, and that\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he discharged his firearm, \"the vehicle swerved to the left [in his direction], [he] jumped to his right, hit a parked car with his body, and the vehicle passed him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111). He maintains that he \"stopped firing his firearm when the vehicle passed him completely and the threat was gone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Eberhardinger,\n   <em>\n    per contra\n   </em>\n   , avers that although Foster drove the vehicle forward after hitting the telephone pole, he never drove toward Officer Smith and was not driving fast. (Doc. 65 \u00b6\u00b6 100, 105, 107). According to Eberhardinger, Officer Smith was not in danger when he fired his service weapon, as he was already out of the way and standing safely between the parked cars on the south side of the street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106, 108, 111). She maintains that Officer Smith discharged his firearm after the vehicle had passed him or at least had partially passed him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109, 111, 113).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties agree that Officer Smith fired four shots at the vehicle. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 11). Police reports, which include an interview with the treating physician, indicate that Eberhardinger was struck by two of the bullets. (Doc. 58-6 Ex. I at 7, 30; Doc. 58-6 Ex. J at 4). Eberhardinger was taken from the scene to the hospital for treatment of gunshot wounds to her jaw, forearm, and hand. (Doc. 61 \u00b6\u00b6 24-26). Foster was taken into custody and eventually pled guilty to fleeing or attempting to elude an officer, driving while operating privileges are suspended or revoked, driving under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs, and three counts of reckless endangerment. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 137; Doc. 58-6 Ex. L at 4-5). He also pled no contest to a charge of aggravated assault in relation to Officer Smith. (Doc. 58-2 \u00b6 137; Doc. 58-6 Ex. L at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Insurance Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Eberhardinger had an automobile insurance policy with State Farm that was in effect at the time of the incident. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 34). The policy covered the vehicle involved, which Eberhardinger owned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49). She sought both Personal Injury Protection (\"PIP\") or Medical Payments Coverage for her medical treatment, as well as Underinsured Motorist (\"UIM\") benefits from State Farm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) State Farm denied PIP and UIM coverage, asserting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the gunshot-inflicted injuries and resultant treatment \"did not arise out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.\" (Doc. 61-9 Ex. K).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Eberhardinger commenced this action in December 2016. Following Rule 12 motion practice, Eberhardinger filed an amended complaint in October 2017, asserting a Section 1983 excessive force claim against Officer Smith (Count I), a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim for failure to train against the City (Count II), a state law negligence claim against Foster (Count III), breach of contract claims against State Farm for failure to make PIP payments (Count IV) and failure to make UIM payments (Count V), and a bad faith claim against State Farm for unreasonably\n   denying insurance coverage (Count VI). The City, Officer Smith, and State Farm move for summary judgment on all claims against them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motions are fully briefed and ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Through summary adjudication, the court may dispose of those claims that do not present a \"genuine dispute as to any material fact\" and for which a jury trial would be an empty and unnecessary formality. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). The burden of proof tasks the non-moving party to come forward with \"affirmative evidence, beyond the allegations of the pleadings,\" in support of its right to relief.\n   <em>\n    Pappas v.

She contends that the City improperly trains its officers regarding shooting at vehicles. She also alleges that the policy does not even mention shooting at windshields, despite the fact that many experts and other police departments-including the largest police department in Pennsylvania- have specifically addressed this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The York City Police Department's use-of-force policy specifically states that \"[f]iring a weapon at ... a moving vehicle\" is generally prohibited because \"it is rarely effective and is extremely hazardous to innocent persons.\" (Doc. 58-6 Ex.

The exceptions to this rule are (1) \"[i]f the occupants of another vehicle are using deadly force against the officer or another person, either with or from a vehicle,\" and (2) \"[i]f no other alternative is available based on the presenting circumstances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Police officers are provided with this policy, receive use-of-force training, and take a written test on the use of force.

She also cites the deposition of York City Chief of Police Wesley Kahley, who testified that he did not have specific training or research-based knowledge on shooting at windshields, that such a practice was not specifically prohibited by the City's use-of-force policy, and that he was not aware of other police departments' policies on shooting at windshields. (Doc. 66-3 at 23-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A reasonable juror could not find single-incident failure-to-train liability from such scant support.

Foster had led Officer Praster on a high-speed pursuit during which Foster ran stop signs and violated other traffic laws. When Officer Smith responded to the scene and parked his car in the middle of West Gay Street, he encountered Eberhardinger's car, which stopped and began moving quickly in reverse. Officer Smith then exited his vehicle\n   while drawing his service weapon and pursued Foster on foot. Foster hit a telephone pole as he was driving backward, but immediately began driving forward again. Officer Smith heard the engine revving and the tires squeal, and saw the car coming directly toward him at a high rate of speed. Fearing for his life and as a last resort, he discharged his firearm as the vehicle was driving at him and thereafter had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit by Foster. Foster later pled guilty to reckless endangerment and no contest to aggravated assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Eberhardinger's version of events differs substantially from Officer Smith's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. More importantly, the video footage of the incident contradicts many significant aspects of Officer Smith's account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The video demonstrates that, although Foster began to drive forward after hitting the telephone pole, he was not driving fast. (Pl.'s Video Ex. at 1:22-1:26). Furthermore, Foster appears to simply be driving down the street rather than driving \"at\" Officer Smith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The car, which initially was pointed to the left after it hit the pole, does change directions, but it merely adjusts from a left-pointed angle to a straight path following West Gay Street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:22-1:29). The video also provides clear audio evidence of the vehicle crashing into the pole and then pulling away, but contains no such evidence of the engine revving or tires squealing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:21-1:24). Most significantly, the video shows that Officer Smith fired most,\n   <em>\n    if not all\n   </em>\n   , of the shots\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he had moved out of the path of the vehicle and positioned himself near the parked cars on the south side of the street, and as the vehicle was passing him or after it had passed him completely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:22-1:28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   An inspection of Eberhardinger's vehicle after the incident provides further support for her version of events. According to a police report and the investigation by the York County District Attorney, three bullet impacts were located in the vehicle. (Doc. 58-6 Ex. I at 34; Doc. 58-6 Ex. J at 7). One bullet hole was found in the hood and the damage indicated that the shot had come from in front of the vehicle but originated from the left of the driver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Another bullet struck the lower right portion of the windshield \"near the driver's side A pillar,\" also coming from the left side of the driver. (Doc. 58-6 Ex. I at 9, 34; Doc. 58-6 Ex. J at 7). A third bullet struck the rear driver's side passenger door. (Doc. 58-6 Ex. I at 10, 34; Doc. 58-6 Ex. J at 7). Investigators believed that a fourth bullet entered the car through the partially open driver's side window and struck Eberhardinger. (Doc. 58-6 Ex. I at 34; Doc. 58-6 Ex. J at 7). This ballistic evidence suggests that all of the bullets were fired from a position to the left of the vehicle, and at least two of the shots were fired as the vehicle was passing or had completely passed Officer Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Eberhardinger, we are left with the following scenario. Around 2:00 a.m., Officer Smith responded to Officer Praster's radio communications that a vehicle had broken minor traffic laws and was fleeing from police. The pursuit lasted only two\n   minutes and no other vehicles or pedestrians were involved. Officer Smith encountered the suspect driving the wrong way on a one-way street and blocked the vehicle's path with his patrol car. The suspect's vehicle was \"boxed in\" by the police cruisers of Officers Smith and Praster, cutting off any exit. There were no other occupied vehicles, bystanders, or pedestrians in the immediate area. Officer Smith did not know there were any passengers in the suspect's car until later when the vehicle finally came to rest and all three occupants climbed out. When Foster began to reverse, Officer Smith exited his patrol car while simultaneously drawing his gun and ran towards the vehicle. After striking the telephone pole in reverse, Foster straightened out from a left-pointing angle and began moving forward at a slow rate of speed down West Gay Street. Officer Smith moved out of the middle of the street and took up a position several feet to the left of the vehicle a few seconds before the vehicle reached him. The forward-moving vehicle was not pointed in Officer Smith's direction when he began firing. Most importantly, Officer Smith-standing to the left of the slow-moving vehicle and apparently out of harm's way-fired four shots at the driver as the vehicle was passing him or had completely passed him, indicating that he used deadly force to stop the fleeing suspect rather than out of fear of immediate personal harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We find that using deadly force when confronted with such circumstances violates clearly established law.

Insurance Claims Against State Farm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We next consider Eberhardinger's insurance-related claims against State Farm. State Farm moves for summary judgment on all three counts: breach of contract for failure to pay PIP benefits, breach of contract for failure to pay UIM benefits, and bad faith. We will examine the breach of contract claims together before turning to the bad faith claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Breach of Contract\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It is undisputed that Eberhardinger had PIP or first-party \"Medical Payments Coverage\" as well as UIM coverage on her State Farm automobile insurance policy. The parties likewise agree that Eberhardinger sought payment from State Farm under these provisions for her gunshot-related injuries stemming from the December 2014 incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties disagree, however, whether these injuries qualify for coverage under the applicable language of the PIP and UIM provisions of her policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The pertinent language of the PIP policy states that State Farm \"will pay for\n   medical expenses for bodily injury to an insured\n   <em>\n    arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. 61-3 Ex. C at 12 (emphasis added) ). The UIM policy states, in relevant part, that State Farm will pay for bodily injuries sustained by the insured which are \"\n   <em>\n    caused by an accident that involves the ownership, maintenance, or use of an underinsured motor vehicle\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 (emphasis added) ). The parties acknowledge that, despite the slightly different wording, these clauses implicate identical interpretation issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   There is no question that Eberhardinger was an occupant of the insured vehicle when injured and that her injuries required extensive medical treatment. But State Farm maintains that the gunshot-related injuries do not arise out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. According to State Farm, that particular phrase has a well-settled meaning under Pennsylvania law. Pennsylvania courts have repeatedly interpreted that language-found both in automobile insurance policies and the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7\u00a7 1701 - 1799.7 -to require a causal connection between the injury and the use of a vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm argues that the gunshot injuries Eberhardinger suffered have no such connection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Eberhardinger counters that the phrase is ambiguous because it is subject to different interpretations. She posits that because the policy itself does not define the term \"maintenance or use,\" the insured must rely on extrinsic materials to understand the policy. This need to rely on outside materials, Eberhardinger argues, creates a genuine dispute of material fact that precludes summary judgment. Eberhardinger is incorrect for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   First, Eberhardinger's contention that the phrase is ambiguous because it is not defined within the policy is a nonstarter. There are, quite obviously, many terms and phrases within insurance policies and similar contracts that are not internally defined but are nonetheless unambiguous. As just one example, Eberhardinger's policy states that State Farm has \"the right to investigate, negotiate, and settle any claim or lawsuit ... for damages payable under this policy's Liability Coverage.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-3 Ex. C at 8). None of the specific phrases or terms in this clause is defined in the policy, yet there is no ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, the phrase \"arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle\" has been considered repeatedly by Pennsylvania appellate courts, which have found the phrase unambiguous and have consistently applied a well-settled meaning. \"Arising out of\" means that there is a causal connection between the injury and the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle; cause-in-fact is sufficient- proximate causation is not required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mfrs.

Most pertinent to the instant case, a passenger who was accidentally shot by a police officer firing multiple rounds at a driver-suspect could not recover first-party medical benefits for her gunshot injuries because those injuries lacked a causal connection to the use of a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Erie Ins.

Her gunshot wounds were sustained while she was riding in the insured vehicle, but they were not \"vehicle-caused injuries.\" The gunshot injuries are not \"attributable to common uses of a vehicle,\" but rather were the direct consequence of an \"intentional intervening act of a third party\" with only incidental vehicle involvement.\n   <em>\n    Squires\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715111\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/388/#p391\">\n    667 F.3d at 392-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That provision plainly states: \"There is no coverage ... for an insured whose bodily injury results from the discharge of a firearm.\" (Doc. 61-3 Ex. C at 26 (emphasis omitted) ). We reject Eberhardinger's contention that this policy exclusion is unenforceable because it is unconscionable. Under Pennsylvania law, a contract must be both procedurally and substantively unconscionable to be found avoidable on the basis of unconscionability.\n   <em>\n    Salley v. Option One Mortg.

There is a distinct absence of substantive unconscionability with the incorporation of a firearm-injury exclusion in an automobile insurance UIM policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We conclude that Eberhardinger is precluded from obtaining PIP benefits because her gunshot-related injuries did not arise out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. She is unable to claim UIM benefits for the same reason. Her UIM claim additionally fails because it is barred by the UIM firearm exclusion. State Farm's denial of coverage on these claims was appropriate and thus did not breach the instant insurance contract. We will grant summary judgment on Counts IV and V in State Farm's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Bad Faith Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Eberhardinger lastly asserts a bad faith insurance claim pursuant to 42 PA.

Indeed, the dashcam videos Eberhardinger combined and submitted were provided to her by the City and Officer Smith. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4). Second, Eberhardinger submitted the video in May 2018, and the City and Officer Smith have not raised any specific issue with its accuracy. Finally, the video files provided by the City and Officer Smith lack audio, a crucial element in the instant case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    State Farm also moved to dismiss the bad faith claim in Eberhardinger's amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 51). Because the bad faith claim does not survive Rule 56 scrutiny, we will dismiss the Rule 12(b)(6) motion as moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The only count in the amended complaint not challenged on summary judgment is Count III, state law negligence against Foster.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    We reject Officer Smith's assertion that Foster's convictions are dispositive as to Eberhardinger's excessive force claim.

We reject this eleventh-hour assertion because Eberhardinger fails to support it with record evidence, admits that she did not receive any medical treatment for non-gunshot-related injuries, (Doc. 61 \u00b6 31; Doc. 67 \u00b6 31), and does not appear to have sought reimbursement for any such injury from State Farm, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Doc. 72 at 6 n.8).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The parties agree that Pennsylvania law governs the interpretation of Eberhardinger's insurance policy and the state law claims for breach of contract and bad faith.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
