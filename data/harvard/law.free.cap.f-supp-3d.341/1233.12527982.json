Having reviewed the Motions, the Responses (Dkt. Nos. 88, 93), the Replies (Dkt. Nos. 96, 97) and all related papers, the Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion and DENIES Plaintiffs' Motion. The Court declines to hear oral argument on the matter.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises out of an insurance claim filed by Plaintiff Reverse Now VII, LLC (\"Reverse Now\") with its insurer, Defendant Oregon Mutual Insurance Company (\"Oregon Mutual\") regarding the extent of coverage provided under its insurance policy (the \"Policy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court and the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, which have been set forth in detail in the parties' briefing on these and other motions and in previous orders of this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. Nos. 40, 43, 73, 95.) Accordingly, the Court repeats only those facts relevant to its resolution of the present motions:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Reverse Now Retains HMA and Mr. Moreland\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2014, an apartment complex owned by Reverse Now and insured by Oregon Mutual was damaged by fire. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1.) Oregon Mutual accepted coverage and retained independent adjuster John Colvard to investigate the scope of repairs and adjust the loss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 24, Exs. 2, 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2014, Reverse Now retained public adjusters HMA Loss Consultants, Inc. (\"HMA\") and Paul Moreland to represent it in its insurance claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 14.) Oregon Mutual and Mr. Colvard were instructed to direct all further correspondence regarding the claim to HMA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Over the following months, Mr. Colvard and Mr. Moreland communicated concerning repairs to the apartment, and in particular, whether the exterior siding could be repaired or whether it required complete replacement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. 17, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Mr. Moreland Selects Mr. Gower as an Impartial Appraiser\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In December 2015, Mr. Moreland informed Mr. Colvard that Reverse Now intended to enter the appraisal process provided under the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 27.) The Policy provided that \"each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 13 at 15.) Reverse Now selected Randy Gower as its impartial appraiser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 27.) Oregon Mutual selected Gary Halpin as its impartial appraiser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 28.) The appraisal process concluded in February 2017, with the panel finding that Oregon Mutual owed an additional $188,544.23 for repairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. 3, 4.) Oregon Mutual paid the balance shortly thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July 2016, as the appraisal was ongoing, Reverse Now filed this action against Oregon Mutual asserting claims for breach\n   of contract; bad faith; and violations of the Insurance Fair Conduct Act (\"IFCA\") and the Washington Administrative Code. (Dkt. No. 1.) In December 2017, Reverse Now amended its complaint to include claims for fraud in the appraisal process and violation of the Consumer Protection Act (\"CPA\"). (Dkt. No. 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Mr. Moreland's Alleged Misrepresentation and Concealment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In April 2018, Oregon Mutual learned that Mr. Moreland was not licensed as a public adjuster in the State of Washington during his representation of Reverse Now. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 54.) While Mr. Moreland apparently applied for a license with the Washington Office of the Insurance Commissioner (\"OIC\") in June 2014, it was not issued due to his failure to supply a bond. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 55, Ex. A.) Mr. Moreland did not receive a valid license until November 2016. (Dkt. No. 85, Ex. J.) Nevertheless, Mr. Moreland held himself out as a public adjuster and performed the responsibilities of a public adjuster on behalf of Reverse Now for more than two and a half years in violation of RCW 48.17.060. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 32, Exs. 4, 5, 7, 13.) A knowing violation of RCW 48.17.060 constitutes a Class B felony. RCW 48.17.063.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Oregon Mutual also learned that Mr. Gower was not impartial, but instead had been \"best friends\" with Mr. Moreland for decades, that Mr. Gower and Mr. Moreland were former business partners, and that they often \"worked the same claims together.\" (Dkt. No. 55, Ex. B at 8:20-12:21, 35:10-36:7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   These facts were never disclosed by Reverse Now or Mr. Moreland, but were instead discovered by Oregon Mutual in its review of deposition transcripts in\n   <em>\n    Autumn Ridge West Ltd. LLP v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-313SAB (E.D. Wash.), an unrelated case in which Mr. Moreland and Mr. Gower testified. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 71 at \u00b6 3; Dkt. No. 55, Exs. A, B, C.) Unlike other cases in which he served as an expert witness,\n   <em>\n    Autumn Ridge\n   </em>\n   was not disclosed in Mr. Moreland's expert report. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 88 at 6, 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 49, Ex. 1; Dkt. No. 71, Ex. 1.) Nor was\n   <em>\n    Creel et al. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-400RMP (E.D. Wash. 2017), another case in which Mr. Moreland's lack of a valid public adjusters' license was raised in a deposition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In May 2018, the Court granted Oregon Mutual leave to amend its answer to include affirmative defenses of misrepresentation and concealment, which it contends voided the Policy. (Dkt. Nos. 73, 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Oregon Mutual now moves for summary judgment as to these and other affirmative defenses. Reverse Now separately moves for summary judgment as to its breach of contract, bad faith, IFCA, and CPA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

No. 24, Ex. 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Oregon Mutual contends that there is no dispute that Reverse Now misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning (1) the extent of loss, and in particular, whether the exterior siding required partial or complete replacement; (2) Mr. Moreland's lack of a valid public adjusters' license; and (3) Mr. Gower's lack of impartiality. Reverse Now disputes the materiality of each of these alleged misrepresentations and disputes whether Mr. Moreland's actions should be imputed to the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court concludes that, while disputed questions of fact preclude summary judgment as to any misrepresentation concerning the extent of loss, summary judgment is appropriate as to the other claims as there can be no reasonable dispute that Mr. Moreland materially and knowingly misrepresented and concealed facts concerning his licensure and his pre-existing relationship with Mr. Gower, and that these misrepresentations can be imputed to Reverse Now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Materiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court concludes that Mr. Moreland's misrepresentations are material to the insurance claim as a matter of law. Mr. Moreland held himself out as a public adjuster while operating without a license for more than two and a half years. During this time, he performed the responsibilities of a public adjuster on behalf of Reverse Now, including investigating its claim, evaluating the scope of repair, initiating the appraisal process and selecting an appraiser, and corresponding with Oregon Mutual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   While Reverse Now contends that Mr. Moreland's failure to maintain a license was merely a \"bureaucratic error\" that is \"irrelevant as a matter of law\" (Dkt. No. 88 at 8-9), the Court disagrees. That violation of RCW 48.17.060 constitutes a Class B felony indicates the legislature's intent that public adjusters scrupulously comply with licensure requirements. Mr. Moreland's failure to maintain a license-and his failure to disclose that he was unlicensed-are far from \"irrelevant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oregon Mutual would not have communicated with Mr. Moreland concerning the claim had it known that he was unlicensed, let alone relied upon his statements concerning the extent of repairs required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, Mr. Moreland failed to disclose his long-term relationship with Mr. Gower, another fact that is undoubtedly material. The Policy requires the appointment of an\n   <em>\n    impartial\n   </em>\n   appraiser (Dkt. No. 24, Ex. 13), and there can be no reasonable dispute that Mr. Gower was not impartial. In\n   <em>\n    Autumn Ridge\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Gower testified that he and Mr. Moreland had known each other since the late 1980s, had worked together at several insurance and claims adjustment companies, often \"worked the same claims together,\" were former business partners, and were \"best friends.\" (Dkt. No. 55, Ex. B at 8:20-12:21, 35:10-36:7.) Even assuming that Mr. Gower's relationship with Mr. Moreland did not impact his decision making in the appraisal process (Dkt. No. 88 at 6), its existence manifestly should have been disclosed to Oregon Mutual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Copper Oaks Master Home Owners Ass'n v.

(Dkt. No. 62 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.) Even to the extent that Mr. Kemege believed that such disclosure was not required, the Court finds that Mr. Moreland's knowledge of the misrepresentation and concealment-and his awareness of its materiality-may be imputed to Mr. Kemege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Reverse Now concedes that Mr. Moreland acted as its agent in the adjustment of the claim, and there can be no dispute that Mr. Moreland's communications-and lack thereof-with Oregon Mutual fell within the scope of that authority. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 88 at 10.)

With respect to his relationship with Mr. Gower, there is no dispute that Mr. Moreland was acting within the scope of his authority when he appointed Mr. Gower as an impartial appraiser. There is no dispute that\n   Mr. Moreland failed to disclose his pre-existing relationship with Mr. Gower to Oregon Mutual. Were Mr. Moreland's misrepresentation not imputable to Reverse Now, the insured could evade the Policy's requirement that it appoint a \"competent and impartial appraiser\" to the detriment of Oregon Mutual. (Dkt. No. 32, Ex. 13 at 15.) As a matter of public policy, an insured cannot be permitted to adopt a public adjuster's acts when they benefit him, and disclaim them where they do not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re ChinaCast Educ.

No. 88 at 10.) However, \"[a] public adjuster ... will almost never, if ever, be acting adverse to the insured when making misrepresentations.\" O'Donnell,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 670. While Mr. Moreland arguably was acting in his own interest-and adversely to Reverse Now-in misrepresenting his licensure status (and while Reverse Now may well have a claim against Mr. Moreland in this regard), the same cannot be said with respect to the appointment of Mr. Gower. Mr. Moreland's concealment of his pre-existing relationship with Mr. Gower clearly was not adverse to Reverse Now, as it-at a minimum-presented an opportunity for Reverse Now to reap the benefits of an interested appraiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court concludes that the knowledge requirement is satisfied, at least with regard to Mr. Moreland's failure to appoint an impartial appraiser, and GRANTS Oregon Mutual's Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to misrepresentation and concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
