This suit arose as a result of the Forest Service's decision to grant a special use permit to the United States Navy allowing the Navy to conduct electronic warfare training in the Olympic National Forest. FSEEE challenges this decision on two grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, FSEEE contends that the Forest Service lacks congressional authorization to grant permits for the purpose of military training. According to FSEEE, use of national forest land is circumscribed by the purposes set out in the Organic Administration Act of 1897 (Organic Act), the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (MUSYA), and several narrower statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20475\">\n    16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 528. Because the Navy's electronic warfare training does not fall within any of these purposes, the Forest Service lacked the power to grant the permit. In response, the Forest Service argues that section 551 of the Organic Act grants it broad regulatory power to control the uses of national forest land.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, FSEEE argues that the decision to grant a permit to the Navy violates the National Forest Management Act's (NFMA) requirement that all use permits comply with the agency's land management plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More specifically, FSEEE points to the Olympic National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan's (Forest Plan) requirements that the relevant use cannot reasonably be accommodated on private land, prioritizes the interests of the general public, and is in harmony with the surrounding landscape. The Forest Service contends that the Court must defer to the agency's interpretation of its own Forest Plan, under\n   which the Forest Service's decision satisfies all requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, FSEEE's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED in part and the Forest Service's Motion is GRANTED in part. The Court reserves one issue under the NFMA, as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In simplified terms, \"electronic warfare\" refers to the use of electromagnetic energy to disrupt or control access to the electromagnetic spectrum, which may be used for such purposes as navigation or communication. AR177874. To conduct training, the Navy must simulate the types of electromagnetic energy that an enemy would generate in order to practice detecting and controlling these systems. AR177875.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   One way that the Navy does this is through the use of trucks hauling the necessary equipment to emit an electromagnetic signal. AR177871. These trucks are basically Ford F-350s carrying trailers with large antennae. AR177872. To conduct training, the Navy drives these trucks to pre-selected locations and energizes the emitters, after which aircraft fly overhead and try to detect the signals. AR177871. According to the Navy, these trucks are important for electronic warfare training because they challenge aviators by simulating the mobility of an actual enemy. AR177875.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 16, 2015, the Navy submitted a revised application to expand the use of mobile emitter trucks in the Olympic National Forest. AR205704-20. During the comment period, FSEEE objected three times. [Compl., Dkt. # 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, Ex. 3-5]. However, on July 31, 2017, the Forest Service issued its decision granting a special use permit pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20251.50\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 251.50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which regulates the Forest Service's permitting process. AR205606.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The permit allows the Navy to park mobile emitter trucks at 11 designated sites alongside logging roads within the national forest. AR205579. On a typical day, three trucks will be present in the national forest at a time. AR205579. Once a truck is parked, Navy personnel set up a safety zone around the truck using warning tape and signage. AR205579. They then begin operations for an average of 12 hours each day, 250 days of the year. AR205579, 205586. All mobile emitter sites are within the Olympic Military Operations Areas, which is airspace designated for Department of Defense training. AR188404.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Congressional Authorization of Military Training as a Use of National Forest Land\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    1. Sufficiency of FSEEE's Pleadings to Raise the Congressional Authorization Argument at Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   FSEEE argues that the Forest Service could not grant the Navy a permit to conduct training on national forest land because no congressional statute authorizes such a use. However, the Forest Service counters that FSEEE is procedurally barred from raising this legal theory because the complaint makes no mention of it. Instead, the Forest Service contends that the complaint states only one claim for relief under the NFMA, and focuses solely on the facts underlying that claim. [Compl., Dkt. # 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 11-20]. As a result, the Forest Service argues that it was not put on notice of a claim based on congressional authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   FSEEE responds that the only fact necessary to support its congressional authorization claim is that the Forest Service issued the Navy a special use permit to carry out training, and this fact was pled. [Compl., Dkt. # 1, \u00b6 17]. Further, FSEEE argues that the complaint incorporates the FSEEE's objection to the draft decision to grant the permit, which lays out the congressional authorization argument. [Compl., Dkt. # 1, at \u00b6 16, Ex. 5]. Finally, FSEEE argues that, by invoking jurisdiction under the APA and stating that the Forest Service \"violated the NFMA,\" the complaint implicitly claims that the agency exceeded its authority. [Compl., Dkt. # 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that a complaint contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" The Ninth Circuit has explained that where \"the complaint does not include the necessary factual allegations to state a claim, raising such claim in a summary judgment motion is insufficient to present the claim to the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation v. U.S. Forest Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079418\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/1058/#p1079\">\n    535 F.3d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1079-80 (9th Cir. 2008). Following this logic, the court held that the plaintiffs failed to adequately present a claim that the NEIS did not consider certain risks when authorizing the use of artificial snow at a ski resort.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079418\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/1058/#p1079\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Ninth Circuit came to a similar conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co.\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff attempted to raise a disparate impact theory at summary judgment that was not pled in the complaint or raised during discovery.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11161404\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/1271/#p1292\">\n    232 F.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1292 (9th Cir. 2000). The court held that allowing the plaintiff to assert such a new theory would prejudice the defendant by forcing them to develop entirely new defenses that were not explored through discovery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11161404\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/1271/#p1292\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The Court determines that the Forest Service was not adequately put on notice of this claim. The complaint's \"Factual Background\" section focuses on the Navy and Forest Service's failure to conform to the Forest Plan in granting the permit. [Compl., Dkt. # 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 11-19]. The \"Claim for Relief\" section likewise states only that the Forest Service violated the NFMA by failing to meet the LRMP's requirements for special-use permits. [Compl., Dkt. # 1, at \u00b6 20]. Nowhere in the complaint does FSEEE mention congressional authorization or the limited permissible uses of national forest land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   FSEEE's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. While it is correct that the complaint likely contains sufficient facts underlying the congressional authorization argument, the legal theory itself was not pled or raised before summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11161404\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/1271/#p1292\">\n    232 F.3d at 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming the district court's refusal to allow the plaintiffs to go forward with a new legal theory at summary judgment). The complaint's mere references to the APA in the \"Jurisdiction and Venue\" section and the NFMA in the \"Claim for Relief\" section are insufficient to inform the Forest Service of the specific congressional authorization argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    OTR Wheel Eng'g, Inc. v. W. Worldwide Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517796,12517797\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/1008/\">\n    897 F.3d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1024 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding that citing section 43 of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , was not specific enough to put the defendant on notice of an unregistered trade dress claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   FSEEE's reference to and attachment of its objection to the Forest Service's draft decision is also insufficient to put the Forest Service on notice. [Compl., Dkt. # 1, at \u00b6 16, Ex. 5]. Although the objection lays out the congressional authorization argument, FSEEE's choice to leave that theory out of its complaint may well have led the Forest Service to believe FSEEE had consciously abandoned that argument in its judicial action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079418\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/1058/#p1079\">\n    535 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1080 n.27 (\"A party may raise a claim at the administrative proceedings, but forego that claim on judicial review.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the Forest Service was not on notice of FSEEE's congressional authorization theory, the proper course of action would have been for FSEEE to move to amend its complaint before moving for summary judgment. However the Court would likely allow FSEEE to amend its complaint at this stage of litigation, and the parties have fully argued the congressional authorization issue in their briefs. Consequently, the Court will address the merits of the argument below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Merits of FSEEE's Congressional Authorization Argument\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Section 551 of the Organic Act states that the Secretary of Agriculture may \"make such rules and regulations and establish such service as will insure the objects of [national forests], namely, to regulate their occupancy and use and preserve [them] from destruction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The broadest purposes are laid out in two statutes.

Instead of doing this, the Forest Service merely states in the record that \"the Navy considered alternatives and determined that the actions cannot be accommodated on private lands.\" AR205599. If the Navy made such a determination, it is not explained in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The record does identify several criteria that make locations acceptable for electronic warfare training. These include the existence of maintained roads, preexisting \"pull-outs\" for the trucks, lack of electronic spectrum interference, different elevations and angles for receiving signals, presence beneath a military operations area, and a clear line of sight to the west. AR177871, 177876, 205705. There are also factors that make other locations \"unreasonable,\" including scheduling conflicts, limited range time, lack of proximity to existing bases, and cost. AR205705. However, these criteria are never applied to explain why private land within the Olympic Military Operations Areas would not suit the Navy's needs. Instead, the Navy's Environmental Assessment and permit application use the criteria only to explain why national forest land is ideal for electronic warfare training, AR177871, and why Department of Defense locations are untenable, AR205705. This has little to do with private land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Forest Service identifies only one place in the administrative record where private land is actually depicted. Appendix A to the Forest Service's Decision contains seven pages of maps depicting the Navy's \"Proposed Mobile Emitter Sites\" and their surroundings. AR205609-16. However, these maps contain no analysis based on the criteria mentioned by the Forest Service. The legend identifies \"other land, including private\" with the color white, but the maps contain no details regarding the topography of private land. AR205609-16. The legend also only identifies \"Forest Service existing roads\" and seemingly does not label other roads. AR205609-16.

For Summ. Judg., Dkt. # 23, at 17]; AR205704. However, this requirement is only a barrier to using private land if the Navy can accommodate its use on government land. It follows that, if the Forest Service denied the Navy's application and there were no other public options, the Navy's policy would no longer limit its ability to consider private land. Furthermore, if the Navy does follow this policy, this would directly contradict the Forest Service's statement that the Navy determined its training \"cannot be accommodated on private lands.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR205599. The Navy could not have made such a determination if it had to exhaust government options first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In short, the Forest Service committed an error by failing to provide any reason for why the Navy's training could not be accommodated on private land, as required by the Forest Plan. Nonetheless, the rationale behind the Navy's policy of preferring government land seems compelling. Dealing with multiple private entities in order to lease or purchase land to conduct electronic warfare training would likely be costly for the Navy and invasive for the private parties. Indeed, even if suitable private land does exist, it strikes the Court as unlikely that such an option would be reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In light of this, the Court grants the Forest Service's request for further briefing on the issue of harmless error. The harmless error doctrine may be employed in the administrative context \"only when a mistake of the administrative body is one that clearly had no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of decision reached.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat.

The Forest Service's Prioritization of the Public Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In addition to requiring consideration of private land, the Forest Plan also requires that the \"interests and needs of the general public shall be given priority over those of the applicant.\" AR022641. FSEEE argues that allowing the Navy to limit the public's access to the area around the training sites subordinates recreational uses. Furthermore, FSEEE asserts that the 24-hour, nearly year-round access granted to the Navy will cause frequent conflicts with the public's use of the forests. AR205700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Forest Service responds that FSEEE overstates the impact of the training\n   activities. The Forest Service points out that only three vehicles may operate in the national forest at one time and they must use existing pull-off sites. AR205579. In addition, the Forest Service asserts that the Navy is required to use a different location if a camper is occupying the mobile emitter site, and if other recreational activities are ongoing the Navy must relocate if the public user wishes. AR205703.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court finds that the Navy's special use permit does not violate the Forest Plan's requirement to prioritize the general public. As the Forest Service stated, the Navy's operating procedures clearly require mobile emitter trucks to leave the area if public users would prefer. AR205703. Although the procedures do not state that a truck must vacate the area if a public user arrives after operations have begun, this is not necessary to satisfy the Forest Plan's requirements as interpreted by the Forest Service.\n   <em>\n    Weldon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623270\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/1043/#p1056\">\n    697 F.3d at 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the agency's interpretation is entitled to \"substantial deference\"). Consequently, the Forest Service did not subordinate the public interest and did not violate the NFMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    4. The Forest Service's Consideration of the Surrounding Landscape\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, the Forest Plan also requires that the use be \"compatible, and in harmony with, the surrounding landscape.\" AR022641. FSEEE argues that the Forest Service failed altogether to address this requirement, and further contends that the mobile emitter vehicles are not in harmony with their forested surroundings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Forest Service once again counters that it did consider effects on the surrounding area, even if it did not use the magic words from the Forest Plan. The Decision Notice states that the eleven mobile emitter sites are all located along existing roads and will not alter the visual character of the area. AR205590-91. The Decision Notice also determined there would be no significant impact on the public, vegetation, and wildlife. AR205586-96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court determines that the Forest Service did consider whether the electronic warfare training would be compatible and in harmony with the surroundings. This requirement is not very specific, and the Forest Service has the discretion to interpret it reasonably. Here, the Forest Service decided that it required considering such things as whether the training would physically alter the land, AR205591, whether it would interfere with park land or other designated areas, AR205591, and whether it would adversely affect surrounding flora and fauna, AR205588-90. This was a reasonable interpretation of the Forest Plan's requirement, and as a result the Forest Service did not violate the NFMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   FSEEE's and the Forest Service's Motions for Summary Judgment as to the NFMA claim related to private land are hereby reserved, pending further briefing.
