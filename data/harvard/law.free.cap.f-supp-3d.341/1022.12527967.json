R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). Plaintiffs have filed a memorandum in opposition (# 20), and Platinum has filed a reply in support. (# 24). Finding personal jurisdiction is lacking over Platinum, which cannot be remedied by jurisdictional discovery, this Court will dismiss Platinum from this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case, originally brought in St. Louis County Circuit Court, was removed to this Court on June 4, 2018, under diversity jurisdiction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Platinum filed a Motion to Dismiss on June 11, 2018, asserting this Court lacks personal jurisdiction-in particular, specific personal jurisdiction-over it. Plaintiffs disagree, arguing an underlying parent-subsidiary relationship causes Platinum to be subject to this Court's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The backbone of this lawsuit, resting principally on allegations that a defective boom lift caused the death of decedent Randall Lee Grant (\"Decedent\"), lies in the realm of product liability and negligence that occurred in Missouri. But, it is the relationship between the movant, Platinum, and fellow defendant BlueLine Rental, LLC. (\"BlueLine\") that precipitates the present jurisdictional dispute. Platinum is a Delaware-based limited liability company with its principle place of business in California. (# 5, p. 2). Platinum is a private equity investment firm that plaintiffs highlight \"specializ[es] in the merger, acquisition,\n   <em>\n    and operation of companies\n   </em>\n   \" conducting business in a range of different product markets. (# 20-7, p. 2 (emphasis in original) ). Platinum, itself, has no offices, property, or employees in Missouri, nor is it registered to do business in Missouri. (# 14-1, p. 2). BlueLine is also a Delaware-based limited liability company with its principle place of business in Texas; however, unlike Platinum, BlueLine-which operates more than 130 rental stores across North America-has a notable sales presence in Missouri, which plaintiffs assert includes at least three sales locations renting out lifts like the one that allegedly caused Decedent's death. (# 20-5; # 20, p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As mentioned, the present jurisdictional dispute revolves around the unique relationship between Platinum and BlueLine-Platinum is the parent company of BlueLine, one of Platinum's many subsidiaries. The history of their relationship, and how the lift involved in Decedent's death is entangled in that relationship, is briefly set forth:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The lift, a JLG Aerial Boom Lift, Model No. E450AJ, was first designed, manufactured, assembled, marketed, and sold by JLG Industries, Inc. (\"JLG\") to Midwest Aerials &amp; Equipment, Inc. (\"Midwest Aerials\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   on or about April 23, 2002, in Kansas City, Kansas. (# 5, p. 4; # 20, p. 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about August 30, 2010, Midwest Aerials sold the lift to non-party CBL &amp; Associates Properties (\"CBL\") located in Missouri. (# 20, p. 2; # 20-2). Sometime in late 2011 (or early 2012)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Midwest Aerials was acquired by Volvo Construction Equipment Rents, Inc. (\"Volvo Rents\"). (# 20, p. 2; # 20-3). On or about February 3, 2014, Platinum acquired Volvo Rents and later changed its name to BlueLine Rentals, LLC., the defendant here. (# 20, p. 2, 6-7; # 20-4; # 20-5). And, finally, on April 30, 2015, the lift (apparently rented to Decedent's employer at some point by CBL)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   allegedly caused the death of Decedent after he became trapped between the lift's control panel and a metal cross-bar protruding from the ceiling of a garage he was working in. (# 5, p. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   From these facts, the parties' dispute becomes clear. Plaintiffs, seeking jurisdiction, argue that Platinum, the parent, was in full control and dominion over BlueLine, its subsidiary, so as to result in Platinum being the mere alter-ego of BlueLine-a theory that, if sustained, causes Platinum to be subject to this Court's jurisdiction by way of the underlying parent-subsidiary relationship notwithstanding the lack of Platinum's own, direct contacts with Missouri. Platinum, seeking dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, sets forth two counterarguments: (a) it does not, in fact, dominate BlueLine's operations to such a degree that jurisdiction should reach it by way of the underlying parent-subsidiary relationship; and (b) in any event, it is impossible to find Platinum acted through its subsidiary, BlueLine, as to the sale of the particular lift in question into Missouri (the relevant contact for specific jurisdiction) because that sale occurred four years\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Platinum acquired BlueLine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a diversity action such as this one, the Court \"may assume jurisdiction over the nonresident defendants only to the extent permitted by the long-arm statute of the forum state and by the Due Process Clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Romak USA, Inc. v.

But, this is essentially an application of the Ninth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   test, which, as mentioned, was recently abandoned as unsalvageable under\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   .

Rather, as explained, the question to be answered for alter-ego liability is whether Platinum so totally and manifestly\n   <em>\n    dominated\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    controlled\n   </em>\n   BlueLine that it is reasonable to disregard BlueLine's corporate form and hold Platinum directly liable as if it had acted on its own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blanks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6894442\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/450/308/#p377\">\n    450 S.W.3d at 377, 379-380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this view, plaintiffs argue Platinum and BlueLine are one-and-the-same because Platinum assisted in a \"rebranding initiative\" by which Volvo Rents became BlueLine. (# 20, p. 7). They point to the fact that Platinum \"shaped\" and \"maintained\" BlueLine's customer base, and urge that this Court take note of the \"long-term operational stewardship\" and \"safety stewardship\" that Platinum has had over BlueLine. (# 20, p. 7). While admitting Platinum never directly sold lifts in Missouri, they point to the fact that Platinum \"marketed and reaped the benefit of BlueLine's presence and sales in Missouri.\" (# 20, p. 9). And they conclude BlueLine must be a mere \"instrument\" of Platinum-another way of saying Platinum and BlueLine are one-and-the-same-because Platinum's \"investment portfolio is expanded through its relationship with BlueLine.\" (# 20, p. 10). Plaintiffs grasp at straws. None of these allegations (many of which are loosely supported through links to press release articles) are of the quality or quantity to find that Platinum, in fact, dominates BlueLine.

And as for the remaining assertions, such as the fact that Platinum temporarily assisted in rebranding BlueLine after it was purchased, plaintiffs point to no law-and this Court can find none-to suggest this conduct permits the utilization of the alter-ego doctrine, which is an extraordinary remedy under Missouri law.\n   <em>\n    Blanks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6894442\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/450/308/#p377\">\n    450 S.W.3d at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Simply put, plaintiffs, at best, point to various allegations of Platinum's macro-management of BlueLine; but, macro-management is not a sufficient basis in itself for finding Platinum controlled and dominated BlueLine to such a degree that corporate formalities should be disregarded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278887\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1059/\">\n    793 F.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"a parent corporation may be directly involved in financing and macro-management of its subsidiaries without exposing itself to a charge that each subsidiary is merely its alter ego\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Indeed, \"when a plaintiff offers only speculation or conclusory assertions about contacts with a forum state, a court is within its discretion in denying jurisdictional discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415001\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/589/#p593\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shine Bros.

Iowa 2015) (commenting that \"the discovery process established by the Federal rules is not intended to establish jurisdiction\"). Here, the only potential argument remaining is that plaintiffs have not yet been able to discover the extent to which Platinum controls and dominates the day-to-day affairs of BlueLine for purposes of establishing jurisdiction under alter-ego liability. That said, the Court notes that Platinum has stated, by way of affidavit, that it is not involved in the day-to-day business affairs of BlueLine. (# 14-1, p. 1). And nothing plaintiffs have presented to this Court sufficiently counter Platinum's affidavit-being mostly press releases with broad, tangential statements about Platinum \"owning and operating\" rental businesses generally. (# 20-3, # 20-4, # 20-5, # 20-7, # 20-8). To the extent plaintiffs grasp to the word \"operating\" found in some of the press release materials, it is again noted that macro-management by a parent company over its subsidiary is insufficient to establish alter-ego liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278887\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1059/\">\n    793 F.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' claims of an alter-ego relationship between Platinum and BlueLine sound in pure speculation. This Court is satisfied upon the pleadings, affidavits, and exhibits that Platinum is not, in fact, the alter ego of BlueLine; rather, at most, Platinum had some macro-management control over BlueLine, which cannot support personal jurisdiction here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fastpath, Inc. v.
