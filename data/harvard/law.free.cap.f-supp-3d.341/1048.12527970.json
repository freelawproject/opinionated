COUSINS, United States Magistrate Judge\n   Plaintiffs are young immigrants who were abused, neglected, or abandoned by their parents. They seek classification as Special Immigrant Juveniles (\"SIJ\") as a pathway to lawful permanent residency in the United States. They contend that defendants-the United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), and individual officers in charge of those departments-have adopted a new policy that unlawfully denies them SIJ status by imposing requirements beyond the scope of the law. Plaintiffs now move for a preliminary injunction to enjoin that policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 6. Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, and the balance of equities and public interest weighs in their favor, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from effecting their new policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

USCIS's reliance on the SIJ regulation's definition of \"eligible for long-term foster care\" holds no weight when Congress explicitly disapproved of that language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Recognizing this discrepancy, USCIS characterizes the TVPRA changes as merely clarifying that petitioners do not need to be eligible for foster care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 45 at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, USCIS maintains that\n   its interpretation of the SIJ statute and regulation accords with the TVPRA because it only needs to ignore references to \"long-term foster care\" in the SIJ regulation and may continue to give weight to language requiring state courts to find that \"family reunification is no longer a viable option.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%205044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   However, the family reunification language cited by USCIS is tied to the definition of long-term foster care eligibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"eligible for long-term foster care means that a determination has been made by the juvenile court that family reunification is no longer a viable option.\"). In addition, the TVPRA did more than \"clarify\" that long-term foster-care eligibility was no longer necessary. By striking the long-term foster care eligibility requirement, the TVPRA also changed the reunification requirement. SIJ petitioners no longer need to show that family reunification is not viable-they only need to show that reunification with\n   <em>\n    at least one\n   </em>\n   of their biological parents is no longer viable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J)(i). Thus, the SIJ regulation's requirement that \"\n   <em>\n    family\n   </em>\n   reunification is no longer a viable option\" is no longer good law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). Indeed, under the plain language of the statute, a juvenile court order could suffice to establish SIJ eligibility even if it finds that reunification with\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   parent is viable, provided that it also finds that reunification with the other parent is not. USCIS's reliance on language that has been explicitly removed by Congress casts significant doubt on the validity of its interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Discerning USCIS's decision-making path is also made more difficult by USCIS's inconsistent application of the SIJ statutory regime to different states' statutory frameworks. For example, Maryland's implementing statute provides that its equity courts have jurisdiction over:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-50\">\n   custody and guardianship of an immigrant child pursuant to a motion for Special Immigrant Juvenile factual findings requesting a determination that a child was abused, neglected, or abandoned before the age of 18 for the purposes of \u00a7 101(a)(27)(J) of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Md. Family \u00a7 1-201(b)(10). That statute also provides that \"[f]or the purposes of subsection (b)(10) of this section, 'child' means an unmarried individual under the age of 21 years.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1-201(a). USCIS apparently has no issue with this statute and its attempts to distinguish it from California's statute are unconvincing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CHAP at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For example, USCIS reasons that Maryland's statute is distinguishable because it \"changed the definition of child.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But it is not clear that a state's definition of \"child\" is relevant. The SIJ statute does not mention \"child\" or \"children\" and the SIJ regulation broadly defines the limits of SIJ eligibility to include \"an alien under twenty-one years of age [and] unmarried ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). More importantly, the regulation explicitly contemplates the possibility that the SIJ statute may apply to individuals past a state's age of majority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 C.F.R. 204.11(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also supra\n   </em>\n   fn. 4. If Congress wished to tether the SIJ statutory regime to a state's age of majority, it could have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In any case, even if the SIJ statutory regime only applies to \"children,\" California law has a similar analogue to Maryland's Family Code \u00a7 1 -201(a). California law provides that \"[f]or the purposes of this division, the terms 'child,' 'minor,' and ward' include an unmarried individual who is younger than 21 years of age and who ... consents to the appointment of a guardian or extension of a guardianship after he or she attains 18 years of age.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201510.1\">\n    Cal.

USCIS makes no attempt to explain why California's consent requirement permits it to ignore the preceding language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   USCIS also attempts to distinguish Maryland's statute as giving \"the [equity] court jurisdiction over custody until 21 for SIJ purposes.\" CHAP at 8. This too is unconvincing. The California statute expressly grants its probate courts jurisdiction \"to make judicial determinations regarding the\n   <em>\n    custody\n   </em>\n   and care of children within the meaning of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act ....\" Cal.

USCIS does not dispute that being deported constitutes irreparable harm under\n    <em>\n     Winter\n    </em>\n    . Rather, USCIS argues that such harm is too speculative. The Court disagrees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    On January 25, 2017, the President issued an Executive Order directing federal agencies \"to employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.\" Executive Order 13768,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%208799\">\n     82 Fed. Reg. 8799\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Jan. 25, 2017). In response, the Department of Homeland Security issued a \"Policy Memorandum\" providing that \"USCIS will issue an [Notice to Appear] where, upon issuance of an unfavorable decision on an application, petition, or benefit request, the alien is not lawfully present in the United States.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 7-6, Ex. E (\"DHS Memo\") at 154. Although these documents do not demonstrate that removal is certain, they suggest that removal is at least likely to occur. The cases cited by USCIS to the contrary are unpersuasive because they were decided under different administrations with different enforcement priorities.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Carlsson v.
