GARDEPHE, U.S.D.J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Ruth Duarte alleges that her former employer, St. Barnabas Hospital (the \"Hospital\"), discriminated against her on the basis of her hearing disability, in violation of the New York City Human Rights Law (\"NYCHRL\"), N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 8-101\n   <em>\n    etseq\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a five-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in Plaintiff's favor, awarding her $624,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress, and $750,000 in punitive damages. (Verdict (Dkt. No. 144) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Hospital has moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 for a new trial and/or a remittitur concerning the damage awards. (Def. Mot. (Dkt.

(Trial Tr. (\"Tr.\") at 727, 768) In the late 1970s, at the age of 19, Plaintiff immigrated to the United States and settled in the Bronx. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 727-29) Plaintiff learned English, and she obtained a bachelor's degree in public administration in 1994, and a master's degree in social work in 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 731-37)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 9, 2007, immediately after receiving her master's degree, Plaintiff began work as a bilingual clinician at St. Barnabas Hospital's David Casella Children's Services program (\"DCCS\") in the Bronx. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 194, 741-43) DCCS is a clinic that provides mental health services to children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223) While employed at DCCS, Plaintiff provided psychotherapy services for children and adolescents through individual, family, and group therapies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 743) Plaintiff was employed at DCCS until August 7, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 746)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Edgardo Quinones was the divisional director for children's services throughout Plaintiff's employment at DCCS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 204) In that role, Quinones supervised more than thirty-five employees, including four clinical supervisors, who in turn directly supervised clinicians such as Duarte. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Milagros Arce-Tomala was Plaintiff's clinical supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 535) When Arce-Tomala was on vacation, Quinones served as Plaintiff's direct supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 785)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a clinician at DCCS, Plaintiff was required to attend two types of staff meetings, both of which occurred on Wednesdays and were conducted in a large conference room at DCCS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 342-43, 348, 567) At administrative meetings - which took place every other Wednesday - DCCS managers discussed,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , new policies, \"work performance and quality and levels of service,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the timely completion of paperwork. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 342, 346-47, 353, 755-56, 765) Attendees at administrative meetings included Quinones, Arce-Tomala, an intake worker, a family support worker, an administrative assistant, seven to ten clinicians (including Plaintiff), and - on some occasions - a registration clerk and a child psychiatrist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 340-41, 755)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Clinical team meetings took place on alternate Wednesdays. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 347) Quinones, Arce-Tomala, half of the clinicians, a clinical supervisor, and psychiatrists attended the clinical team meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198-99, 350) Because only half the clinicians attended clinical team meetings at a time, Plaintiff was present at clinical team meetings only once a month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 348)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Quinones presided at both the administrative and clinical team meetings (together, \"staff meetings\") unless he was unavailable, in which case Arce-Tomala presided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 578, 756) When Quinones was present, he sat at the head of the table, and Arce-Tomala usually sat next to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 571-72) Plaintiff's hearing disability made it difficult for her to hear what was said at these meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 760) Accordingly, Plaintiff generally sat next to Quinones, or Arce-Tomala, depending on who was leading the meeting, to ensure that she could hear the primary speaker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 571, 577, 579-80, 757)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2007, notwithstanding her proximity to Quinones at the staff meetings, Plaintiff sometimes could not hear what he was saying, and she would ask him to repeat his remarks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 760-61) Quinones would then call Plaintiff \"deaf,\" or ask her if she was deaf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 761)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2008, Duarte began bringing a hearing aid device to the staff meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 559, 594, 762) The device was a \"little rectangular box\" - about two by three inches in size - with ear-bud headphones\n   that Duarte wore during staff meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 200, 389) Rosa Torres - another DCCS clinician (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 558, 562) - testified that, at these meetings, Plaintiff \"would take out her\" hearing aid device and \"set it up.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 560) Plaintiff \"would always comment [that she] ha[d] to put [the hearing device] on, ... so [she could] hear the speaker,\" and she openly adjusted the device at staff meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 560, 562) Once Plaintiff started using the device, she brought it to every staff meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 357)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Even with her hearing aid, however, Plaintiff still had difficulty hearing at staff meetings, and she sometimes asked Quinones to repeat himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 763-65) Plaintiff testified that, when she made these requests, Quinones \"started to make such comments as ... you are deaf? You don't listen? Put your thing on. I want you to hear what I said. I don't want to hear later on that you say that you didn't hear me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 766) Quinones would \"sometimes add things like, I want you to hear what I'm going to say. I don't want to hear later that you didn't hear. You hear when it's convenien[t] to you.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After making these remarks, Quinones would slap the conference room table with his hands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 766-67)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Duarte, Quinones's hand-slapping on the table triggered painful memories for Plaintiff, and caused her to cry and remain silent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 766-67) During Plaintiff's childhood, her father verbally and physically abused her when she could not hear him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 768) Plaintiff testified that her father often asked her, \"are you deaf?\" and hit her, because he believed she \"was not obeying him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff told Quinones about her father's abuse. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 768-69, 784-85)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During 2009, Plaintiff continued to experience difficulty hearing during staff meetings, and continued to ask Quinones to repeat himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 769-70) According to Plaintiff, Quinones responded in the same fashion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 770) Quinones made comments about Duarte's hearing at staff meetings \"[t]wo or three times\" in 2009 before Plaintiff took medical leave in the fall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 790-91) Plaintiff was on medical leave from October 16, 2009, until August 16, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 877)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When Plaintiff returned to work in 2010, she resumed attending staff meetings, and again sat next to Quinones. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 770-71) Plaintiff continued to experience difficulty hearing during staff meetings, and asked Quinones to repeat himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 771, 773) When Duarte asked Quinones to repeat himself, he would call her \"deaf\" and say, \"[p]ut your things on your ear.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 773) Quinones continued to slap the conference room table at these moments, again triggering memories of Plaintiff's childhood and making her feel \"guilty [for] having [her] impairment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 774) Duarte testified that Quinones made comments about her hearing impairment on two or three occasions in 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 791-92)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff spoke with Quinones in 2010 about his remarks concerning her hearing impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 783-84) According to Duarte, these conversations took place in her office when Quinones was reviewing her progress notes for patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 786) Plaintiff told Quinones, \"I don't like when you say this. It is very hurtful to me. It hurts me. Can you please stop.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 784) Duarte reminded Quinones of the abuse she had suffered as a child, and told Quinones, \"I don't like it when [you] say that I'm deaf or when [you] ma[k]e remarks to remind me of my childhood, my adolescent days.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Duarte addressed these concerns with Quinones on two or three occasions in 2010, but there was no change in his behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 784-86)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Quinones's remarks concerning Duarte's disability continued through 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 774) When Plaintiff told Quinones during staff meetings that she could not hear him, he ridiculed her disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This occurred on approximately three occasions in 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 792) During 2011, Duarte had \"[t]wo or three\" more conversations with Quinones about his remarks concerning her disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 787) According to Duarte, Quinones referred to her as \"dumb\" or \"stupid\" during one of these conversations, which left her in tears. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 788)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff complained to Arce-Tomala about Quinones's remarks on two or three occasions in 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 793-95) According to Duarte, she pleaded with Arce-Tomala not to \"go on vacation. When you go on vacation, and [Quinones] reviews my [progress] notes, he tells me things that I feel bad about, such as remarks about my hearing disability.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 795) Arce-Tomala told Duarte, \"You've got to speak to him, you've got to deal with him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 796)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At staff meetings between 2011 and 2014, Quinones continued to ask Plaintiff if she was deaf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 585, 846, 849) Plaintiff again complained to Quinones about his behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 787-88) During a 2012 conversation, Duarte told Quinones that his remarks about her hearing disability upset her; that her hearing disability was \"not a joke\"; and that he \"need[ed] to stop.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 789) Quinones's only response was to \"step[ ] out of [P]laintiff's office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff eventually stopped confronting Quinones about his remarks concerning her hearing disability, because her complaints appeared to have no effect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 796)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff's hearing worsened during the period between 2007 and 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 849) She continued to ask Quinones to repeat himself in 2014, and he would respond: \"I know you're deaf. I forgot you're deaf. You had your thing on. Make sure you have your thing on.... I don't want you to say that you didn't hear me because you only hear when it is convenient to you.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 848)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Marcie Van Hoven-Hernandez - a union representative - testified about Quinones's treatment of Duarte at a 2014 disciplinary hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180-81) At that hearing, Quinones and Arce-Tomala criticized Plaintiff's job performance, stating,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , that she was not meeting numerical targets for therapy sessions with patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 187) According to Hoven-Hernandez, when Duarte tried to defend herself, Quinones raised his voice and banged his hand on the table (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 188), which caused Plaintiff to \"shak[e] and cry[ ] uncontrollably\" and to adjust her earpiece. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189) Quinones then said, \"What are you, deaf?\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 190), and Arce-Tomala laughed at Quinones's question. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 192) Hoven-Hernandez told Quinones and Arce-Tomala that they were being \"inappropriate, [and] disrespectful,\" but neither responded to her admonition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     PLAINTIFF'S EMOTIONAL DISTRESS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff testified that between 2009 and August 7, 2014 - when her employment at DCCS ended - she experienced anxiety \"every week\" from Tuesday night through Thursday morning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 865-66) Plaintiff explained that Wednesdays - the day on which staff meetings were conducted - \"were the days where [she] was mo[st] anxious at work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 865) Duarte was \"worried and unable to sleep [on Tuesday nights], thinking that Mr. Quinones come[s] on Wednesday[s] to the unit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Duarte also testified that - beginning in 2011 - Quinones's remarks about her hearing lowered her self-esteem, made her cry, and caused her to suffer from headaches, stomach aches, and \"panic attacks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 775) Plaintiff described her panic attacks as follows: \"I started [ ] feeling anxious, shaking.... I couldn't sleep the night before, scared of what is going to happen or what is going to transpire in that particular staff meeting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 775-76) Duarte's anxiety \"increased\" in 2014: \"Tuesday, Wednesday, and sometimes Thursday the whole day I was anxious.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 866)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Duarte testified that she still feels \"[a]nxious, scared, [and] angry,\" and that she \"blam[es] herself for not doing what [she] should have done\" - that is, \"speak up to a ... higher person.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 782) Duarte still experiences \"depressing time[s], anxiety, [and] panic attacks\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 870); has trouble sleeping; has \"lower self-esteem\"; and \"feel[s] less or [i]ncapable [of doing] what [she] did before coming to [DCCS].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 871) Plaintiff has not sought therapy, but has \"been trying to implement coping skills that [she] encourage[s] [her] patients to implement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff testified that - during her employment at DCCS - she discussed her emotional distress with her children and with four fellow DCCS clinicians - Torres, Carmen Lopez, Silva Dolman, and Janet Santa Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 775-76, 781) Plaintiffs' children were not called as witnesses at trial, however, and - other than Torres - the clinicians mentioned by Duarte were not called to testify. Torres testified as follows regarding Duarte's emotional distress:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Before the meetings, Ms. Duarte ... would call me to say please don't leave me alone. So I would go to her office and get her and already she was appearing, she was appearing nervous, and she would just grab my hand and say well, hopefully everything goes well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I said let's pray, let's pray that everything goes well and that there will be a miracle, Edgardo will cancel the meeting, you know, that he doesn't say any remark....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ... As we were walking, we were basically reiterating everything will be okay, you'll get through it. Then we [would] go into the staff meetings....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 613-14) Torres added that she and Plaintiff would \"pray[ ] for a miracle that Edgardo wouldn't show up, that he wouldn't come out and say those horrible things,\" such as \"are you deaf, are you deaf.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 615)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   According to Torres, when Quinones made remarks about Plaintiff's hearing disability at staff meetings, Duarte would \"sigh, 'Edgardo,' \" \"shake her head, bring it down[,] ... [and] shut down [for] the rest of the staff meeting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 589) \"[I]f the meeting went bad, meaning that Edgardo ... humiliated her in front of us, the co-workers, then [Duarte] would leave crying.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 616) Plaintiff would later cry in front of Torres and say, \"I don't understand why he does this.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 617) According to Torres, Plaintiff eventually stopped speaking up at meetings out of\n   \"fear that it would trigger Mr. Quinones.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 618)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     THE NOVEMBER 2013 WRITTEN WARNING AND PLAINTIFF'S REBUTTAL\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In November 2013, Plaintiff received a written warning for insubordination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In connection with a dispute with Arce-Tomala about whether Duarte could use a sick day for purposes of a doctor's appointment, Duarte allegedly warned Arce-Tomala, \"[o]ne day you will lose your power.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 797-98;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   PX 14 (Dkt. No. 73-4) ) On November 20, 2013, Plaintiff and her union representative - Kwame Shaw - met with Arce-Tomala and Quinones to discuss the warning. (Tr. at 539, 918-19, 921-22) During the meeting, Quinones said, \"it is not my fault that you are deaf, [or] something [along] those lines.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 919-20) Plaintiff broke into tears during the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 920)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After the meeting, Duarte told Shaw that Quinones's remarks about her hearing disability were \"very painful\" and that she \"want[ed] him to stop.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shaw suggested that Duarte prepare a \"rebuttal\" to the written warning.

Br. (Dkt.

As an initial matter, the Hospital does not dispute that a reasonable jury could have found that Quinones's conduct amounted to willful or wanton negligence, or recklessness, or demonstrated a conscious disregard of Duarte's rights or conduct so reckless as to amount to such disregard. Plaintiff testified that she complained about Quinones's discriminatory conduct on multiple occasions to both Quinones and Arce-Tomala, and that neither of these supervisors forwarded her complaints to Human Resources or acted upon them in any way. (Tr. at 787-89, 793-95) To the contrary, Plaintiff testified that Quinones ignored her complaints and that Arce-Tomala told Plaintiff that she had to \"deal with\" Quinones's discriminatory conduct on her own. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 795) The supervisors' failure to forward Plaintiff's complaints to Human Resources directly contravened the Hospital's written policies (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PX 7 (Dkt. No. 72-6) at 30 (\"Any [ ] supervisor or manager who receives a report or complaint of discrimination or harassment must report that alleged offense immediately.\") ) and raises questions about the adequacy of the Hospital's training. Arce-Tomala's testimony that she did not know the Hospital's\n   procedures for reporting discrimination (Tr. at 328-29) also suggests that the Hospital's anti-discrimination training programs were ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Moreover, as defense counsel conceded in closing argument, the Hospital received Plaintiff's November 25, 2013 rebuttal to her written warning (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 955-56), in which she explicitly complained about Quinones's discriminatory conduct (PX 15 (Dkt. No. 73-5) at 1), but never investigated Duarte's complaint.

N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 8-107(13)(b)(1)-(3). Section 8-107(13)(e) provides that proof of an employer's anti-discrimination policies and procedures \"shall be considered ... in mitigation of civil penalties or punitive damages which may be imposed ... and shall be among the facts considered in determining an employer's liability under\n    <em>\n     subparagraph three of paragraph b\n    </em>\n    of this subdivision.\" N.Y.C.

Admin. Code \u00a7 8-107(13)(b)(3).
