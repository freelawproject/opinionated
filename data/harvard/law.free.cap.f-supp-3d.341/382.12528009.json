A feedback interface provides feedback in response to the first data set. A main database maintains the first data set.

The feedback interface receives a feedback input signal and includes a display for displaying an appearance of a character based on the first set of personal data an din response to the received input signal.

The feedback manifests as a cartoon-like character who, based upon the user's behavior and the predetermined rules, responds accordingly. For example, the character appears in an encouraging pose when the user engages in behavior in line with the user's goals.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328722\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/159/463/#p466\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   fig. 7, 36a.

Def.'s Mem. at 14-15. In response, the plaintiff again emphasizes its system's use of a character. By including a character that changes appearance to encourage or discourage the user according to the user's goals and behavior, the plaintiff claims to have improved the technological process underlying other, more passive computer-based life-management tools. The plaintiff therefore contends that the '915 Patent contains a concept sufficiently inventive to render it patent eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With respect to improving an existing technological practice, the plaintiff asserts that its invention is analogous to the invention found patentable in\n   <em>\n    McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games America Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/\">\n    837 F.3d 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2016). The invention at issue in\n   <em>\n    McRO\n   </em>\n   was directed to a specific improvement in computer animation - it synchronized animated facial expressions and mouth movements in a manner that differed from the way in which human animators accomplished the same task.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/\">\n    at 1303-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Using a combined order of specific rules, the invention automated via computer an animation practice previously \"driven by [animators'] subjective determinations rather than specific, limited mathematical rules.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/\">\n    at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .The\n   <em>\n    McRO\n   </em>\n   invention thus did not transpose an old practice into a new environment, but used claimed rules to improve an existing technological process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In this case, using a character to display information plainly does not constitute a specific improvement to an existing technological process. The process of collecting, analyzing, and then displaying information is unchanged. Further, the character does not improve upon the display step; a coach, for example, would similarly encourage or discourage a client according to the client's goals and behavior. The plaintiff cannot claim a system for modifying behavior that differs from the way in which humans have carried out the task.\n   <em>\n    McRO\n   </em>\n   is thus distinguishable from this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moreover, although \"an inventive concept can be found in the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional [elements],\"\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bascom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1348\">\n    827 F.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Claim 1's abstract elements are ordered in a generic and conventional pattern - a user inputs information, the system collects and analyzes other relevant information, and then the system displays through a character the result of its analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitbit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20819235\">\n    2017 WL 819235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *17 (stating that certain claims were generically arranged because they \"follow[ed] a conventional order of how data is usually analyzed: data is first received, then processed, then compared against a condition, and the notification is triggered when the condition is met\").
