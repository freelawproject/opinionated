In this case, WMATA has not cited any language from the collective bargaining agreement or the settlement agreements demonstrating that the plaintiff agreed to resolve his statutory discrimination claims through arbitration.

After being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\"ADHD\") in June 2009, Pl.'s Decl. \u00b6 11, the plaintiff was prescribed Adderall to manage his symptoms, <em>id.</em> \u00b6 13, and he reported his Adderall usage to WMATA on June 26, 2009, <em>see</em> WMATA's Supp. Summ. J. Mot., Exhibit (\"Ex.\") F (Prescription Reporting Forms). He again reported his Adderall usage to WMATA on May 21, 2010, indicating that he had started taking Adderall \"last year\" and was taking it on an \"ongoing\" basis. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em>, Ex. F (Prescription Reporting Forms). After being referred to WMATA's medical department, on June 10, 2010, WMATA \"informed [the plaintiff] that use of Adderall was against [United States Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") ] policy for [commercial driver's license] holders. [The plaintiff] was instructed that [he] must have [his] prescription switched to a <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"8\" href=\"#p8\" id=\"p8\">*8</a>non-[S]chedule II medication prior to [him] being allowed to return to duty.\" Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 16. The plaintiff then began taking Strattera, a non-Schedule II medication. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> \u00b6 17. Thereafter, the plaintiff submitted a grievance to WMATA, challenging WMATA's directive that he stop taking Adderall, on the basis that \"the DOT and WMATA did not have a regulation prohibiting the use of Adderall.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 19. Then, after being involved in an accident in September 2010, the plaintiff filed an accident appeal form stating that the accident \"was the result of being removed from [Adderall].\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 21.</p><p id=\"p-12\">The plaintiff began taking Adderall again in September 2010, and submitted prescription reporting forms with WMATA on September 9, 2010; October 9, 2010; October 10, 2010; December 10, 2010; and January 18, 2011, advising WMATA that he was taking the medication. <em>See</em> WMATA's Supp. Summ. J. Mot., Ex. F (Prescription Reporting Forms). The Accident Appeal Board denied the plaintiff's accident appeal on January 18, 2011, and the following day, the plaintiff represents that defendant Lisa Cooper-Lucas, the head of WMATA's medical branch, \"informed [him] that [he] would not be allowed to continue taking Adderall based on a DOT prohibition,\" and that he \"was removed from duty pending having [his] prescription changed, evaluated[,] and approved for use by [ ] Cooper-Lucas.\" Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 31. The plaintiff informed Cooper-Lucas that he \"would take Adderall for the last time [on] [ ] January 23, 2011,\" <em>id.</em> \u00b6 32, and Cooper-Lucas informed the plaintiff that \"Adderall would be undetectable in his system [twenty-four] hours after [he] last took it\" and that \"she would clear ... [his] return to duty on ... January 24[, 2011],\" <em>id.</em> \u00b6 33. According to the plaintiff, Cooper-Lucas \"threatened [him] with a [thirty-]day suspension if [he] were to test positive for Adderall at any point in the future.\" <em>Id.</em></p><p id=\"p-13\">Following his return to work, the plaintiff suffered an on-the-job injury on January 25, 2011, and after receiving medical treatment, was \"transported to WMATA headquarters for a post[-]incident drug and alcohol urinalysis,\" and tested positive for the use of Adderall. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. The following morning, Cooper-Lucas suspended the plaintiff for thirty days, and on February 3, 2011, the plaintiff was released from pay status, required to enroll in the WMATA's Employee Assistance Program, and threatened with \"termination for violating the prescription drug section of WMATA's [s]ubstance abuse [p]olicy.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 49. The plaintiff contends that he was \"removed from the Category II [Employee Assistance] [P]rogram for 'intent' to use [Adderall],\" after he requested that WMATA \"put an answer in writing stating whether or not [he] would be allowed to take [his] doctor prescribed medication,\" i.e., Adderall. Pl.'s Decl. \u00b6 25. Thereafter, on February 28, 2011, the plaintiff represents that he was removed from the Employee Assistance Program on the ground that he \"ha[d] been non-compliant with [his] Category II Contract stipulation.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 60 (Employee Assistance Program Removal Letter).</p><p id=\"p-16\">Although the settlement agreement did not address the plaintiff's Adderall use, <em>see</em> Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 233 (Sept. 29, 2011 Settlement Agreement), WMATA unofficially granted the plaintiff's request to use Adderall<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by allowing him to report his Adderall usage to WMATA upon his return to duty, <em>see</em> WMATA's Supp. Summ. J. Mot., Ex. F (Prescription Reporting Forms) (showing that the plaintiff reported his Adderall usage to WMATA on October 17, 2011; November 11, 2011; November 23, 2011; December 22, 2011; March 24, 2012; and April 24, 2012).</p><p id=\"p-17\">On April 3, 2012, while taking Adderall, the plaintiff left a bus running unattended for an extended period of time and he testified during his deposition that he \"forgot the bus was back [where it was discovered running].\" <em>See</em> <em>id.</em>, Ex. C (McFadden June 13, 2014 Dep.) at 231:14-15; <em>see also</em> <em>id.</em>, Ex. C (McFadden June 13, 2014 Dep.) at 230:20-231:14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On February 1, 2012, the plaintiff filed a request for accommodations by WMATA, seeking permission \"to be waived from reporting\" his Adderall usage to WMATA, and for \"greater time to complete [his job-related] task[s].\" Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 137 (Accommodation Request). WMATA denied the plaintiff's accommodation requests, advising him that \"the ADA Panel has found [him] to be a direct threat in [his] current position, defined as a significant risk or substantial harm to [his]</p><p id=\"p-18\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"10\" href=\"#p10\" id=\"p10\">*10</a>health and/or safety or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\" <em>Id.</em>, Ex. 172 (Accommodation Request Denial) at 2. WMATA noted that its determination that the plaintiff posed a direct threat was \"based on documented history of preventable incidents and safety infractions,\" which included:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">(1) Physically leaving a bus running and unattended for several hours parked in an alley in a residential neighborhood;</p><p id=\"p-20\">(2) Repeated recklessness and excessive speeding while operating a forklift in the garage environment. ( [The plaintiff] ha[s] been observed and estimated to exceed 10 MPH while driving the forklift to the point it \"bounces\" off the ground); and</p><p id=\"p-21\">(3) Three instances of leaving the fuel nozzle locked on the bus and driving away while the nozzle is still attached.</p><p id=\"p-22\"><em>Id.</em>, Ex. 172 (Accommodation Request Denial) at 2. In making its direct threat determination, the ADA Panel considered testimony regarding these alleged incidents. <em>Id.</em>, Ex. 178 (Accommodation Request Appeal Denial) at 2. The plaintiff was medically disqualified as a bus mechanic that same day and placed into the \"Section 124 job placement program\" for medically disqualified employees. <em>Id.</em>, Ex. 168 (Medical Disqualification Letter). The plaintiff then obtained a non-safety sensitive station manager position with WMATA in March 2013. WMATA's Summ. J. Mot., Ex. A (Oct. 29, 2013 Arbitration Award) at 7-8.</p><p id=\"p-23\">The plaintiff initially brought Civil Action No. 12-940 (<em>Bey I</em> ) against WMATA and three WMATA employees, asserting claims for disability discrimination, retaliation, defamation, and civil conspiracy. <em>See</em> <em>Bey I</em> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 175-243. The plaintiff later filed his second civil suit, Civil Action No. 14-1115 (<em>Bey II</em> ), against defendants WMATA, the same three WMATA employees named in <em>Bey I</em>, four additional WMATA employees, two other individuals, and the Union, asserting violations of the Rehabilitation Act; the Americans with Disabilities Act; the Labor Management Relations Act; and common law claims for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy. <em>See</em> <em>Bey II</em> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-23. After WMATA moved for summary judgment in <em>Bey I</em>, the Court entered judgment for WMATA on some of the plaintiff's claims, but allowed the plaintiff's disability discrimination and retaliation claims against WMATA to proceed. <em>See</em> Order (Sept. 2, 2016), <em>Bey I</em>, ECF No. 95. The Court later consolidated <em>Bey I</em> and <em>Bey II</em>. See Order at 1 (Dec. 20, 2016), ECF No. 117.</p><p id=\"p-24\">In the now consolidated case, WMATA has filed a motion for summary judgment on the disability discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment claims asserted against WMATA and the defamation and civil conspiracy against the individual WMATA defendants in the <em>Bey II</em> Complaint, <em>see</em> WMATA's Summ. J. Mot. at 2, and subsequently filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment on the disability discrimination and retaliation claims asserted against WMATA in the <em>Bey I</em> and <em>Bey II</em> Complaints, <em>see</em> WMATA's Supp. Summ. J. Mot. at 1. The Union has filed a motion for summary judgment on the breach of duty of fair representation, civil conspiracy, and retaliation claims against the Union, <em>see</em> Union's Summ. J. Mem. at 8-24, as well as a motion to strike the plaintiff's objections filed in support of his opposition to the WMATA's and the Union's motions for summary judgment, <em>see</em> Union's Mot. to Strike at 1. The plaintiff then filed a cross-motion to strike the deposition transcripts submitted as exhibits <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"11\" href=\"#p11\" id=\"p11\">*11</a>with the Union's motion for summary judgment. <em>See</em> Pl.'s Mot. to Strike Mem. at 6.

The plaintiff first contends that his \"opposition and attached filings are not 'pleadings' as described in Rule 12\" and thus cannot be stricken under Rule 12. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 3. The plaintiff next contends that the Union's attorney has not made a sufficient showing of prejudice and harm to his reputation because the plaintiff merely alleged that the transcript \"appeared\" to have been altered and did not identify \"the potential wrongdoer.\" <em>Id.</em> at 5. The Union responds that a motion to strike is proper because it was \"the only possible avenue ... to strike these libelous contentions,\" and that its attorney sufficiently showed prejudice because \"by filing documents on behalf of his client, he has taken on the responsibility to <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"13\" href=\"#p13\" id=\"p13\">*13</a>uphold the laws and ethical rules which govern the [C]ourt,\" and that the objections \"are baseless allegations [that] could be potentially harmful to the reputation of counsel.\" Union's Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. to Strike at 3-4.</p><p id=\"p-37\">The Court first concludes that the Union has not met its burden to warrant granting its motion to strike. Rule 12(f) authorizes only the striking of pleadings. <em>See</em> Fed. R. Civ.

The plaintiff's submission that the Union seeks to strike does not fall under Rule 7(a)'s definition of a \"pleading,\" because it was filed in support of the plaintiff's opposition to WMATA's and the Union's motions for summary judgment, which is not the type of document identified in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See</em> Fed.

Like the plaintiff's objections filed in support of his opposition to WMATA's and the Union's motions for summary judgment, the deposition transcripts and interrogatory responses submitted in conjunction with the Union's motion for summary judgment are not \"pleadings\" that can be stricken under Rule 12, and therefore the Court must also deny the plaintiff's cross-motion to strike.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-39\">Accordingly, the Court must deny both the Union's and the plaintiff's cross-motions to strike.</p><p id=\"p-40\"><strong>B.

First, WMATA does not submit any evidence regarding the plaintiff's \"repeated recklessness and excessive speeding while operating a forklift in the garage environment.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 172 (Accommodation Request Denial) at 2. In its response to the plaintiff's medical disqualification appeal, WMATA claimed that its knowledge of the speeding was based on testimony before the ADA Panel, <em>see</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012111\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012111\">,</extracted-citation> Ex. 178 (Accommodation Request Appeal Denial); however, WMATA has not submitted any evidence, in the form of safety reports, affidavits, or ADA Panel transcripts, regarding these alleged instances of speeding. It is therefore unclear when these alleged instances occurred, if at all, and the Court is unable to make a determination, based on the evidence in the record, whether these events actually occurred and whether the plaintiff was actively using Adderall when they allegedly occurred. Second, WMATA has conceded that the three instances when the plaintiff moved a bus without first detaching the fuel nozzle occurred while the plaintiff was not using Adderall. <em>See</em> WMATA's Supp. Summ. J. Mem. at 3-4. Therefore, the only evidence that WMATA offers to prove that the plaintiff was unqualified is <em>one</em> instance when he left a bus running and unattended while he was using Adderall. <em>See</em> WMATA's Supp. Summ. J. Mot, Ex. C (McFadden June 13, 2014 Dep.) at 230:20-231:14. The Court is not inclined to make a direct threat determination based on a single instance of purportedly dangerous behavior. <em>See</em> <em>Dark v. Curry Cty.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3270945\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/1078/#p1088\">451 F.3d 1078</extracted-citation>, 1088, 1091 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that \"there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether [the employee] was qualified with reasonable accommodation\" when he suffered only one on-the-job epileptic <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"16\" href=\"#p16\" id=\"p16\">*16</a>episode); <em>cf.</em> <em>Wurzel v.

Because for summary judgment purposes WMATA has not offered sufficient evidence that the plaintiff's ADHD posed \"a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by [the use of Adderall],\" <em>see</em> <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012111\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111</extracted-citation>(3), there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to the plaintiff's ability to perform the essential functions of the bus mechanic position.</p><p id=\"p-52\">However, in order to succeed on his disability discrimination claim under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must also prove that WMATA failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation or accommodations. <em>See</em> <em>Solomon</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181448,4110384\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1/\">763 F.3d at </extracted-citation>9 ; <em>see also</em> <em>Ward v.

Cir. 2014) (explaining that to prevail on a failure to accommodate claim, an employee \"bears the burden of proving the[ ] <em>elements</em> [of the claim] by a preponderance of the evidence\" (emphasis added) ). The plaintiff requested three accommodations for his disability. The Court will address each in turn.</p><p id=\"p-54\">The plaintiff argues that WMATA denied his request for a reasonable accommodation by preventing him from taking Adderall while employed as a bus mechanic. <em>See</em> <em>Bey I</em> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-41, 59, 72-79, 182, 188. Although the plaintiff did not submit a formal request for an accommodation to WMATA to take Adderall to manage the symptoms of his ADHD, the record shows that he did informally request this accommodation on numerous occasions. <em>See</em> <em>supra</em> at 7-9 (noting that the plaintiff submitted a grievance challenging the WMATA's directive that he stop taking Adderall, filed an accident appeal stating that the accident was caused by him not being allowed to take Adderall, and requested in writing whether he would be allowed to take Adderall). Although WMATA initially denied the plaintiff's request, and he subsequently suffered an adverse employment action, <em>see</em> <em>id.</em> (discussing the circumstances that led to the plaintiff's termination), the plaintiff was ultimately reinstated to his position and was thereafter allowed to take Adderall while employed as a bus mechanic to manage his disability, <em>see</em> <em>supra</em> at 8-9. Therefore, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that WMATA denied his request to take Adderall, and his failure to accommodate claim regarding his request to use Adderall fails. <em>See</em> <em>Stewart v. White</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358691\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/321/#p325\">118 F.Supp.3d 321</extracted-citation>, 325 (D.D.C. 2015) (\" '[T]o create an issue for the jury[,]' [the] plaintiff must point to 'sufficient evidence' in the record showing that [ ]he requested an accommodation and 'that, after the request, [the defendant] refused to make an accommodation.\" (quoting <em>Stewart v.

Accordingly, the Court grants WMATA's motion for summary judgment on Count I of the plaintiff's <em>Bey I</em> Complaint regarding WMATA's alleged failure to permit him to use Adderall.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-56\">The plaintiff also contends that WMATA denied him a reasonable accommodation by denying his request to waive the prescription drug reporting requirement. <em>See</em> <em>Bey II</em> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 131. On February 1, 2012, the plaintiff submitted a formal request for accommodations with WMATA, seeking to have his current dosage of Adderall added to his medical file to document that he would test positive for the use of amphetamines and a waiver from having to report his use of Adderall to WMATA, unless the current dosage changed. <em>See</em> Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 137 (Accommodation Request). WMATA denied the plaintiff's request to add his current dosage to his medical file and for a waiver of the prescription reporting requirement, explaining that pursuant to <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2040\">49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 40</extracted-citation> and 655, \"safety sensitive employees are required to report prescribed medications every [thirty] days [ ] [and] [WMATA] does not have authority to waive this requirement.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2040\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2040\">,</extracted-citation> Ex. 172 (Accommodation Request Denial).

Therefore, the Union's decisions not to arbitrate all of the plaintiff's grievances and to settle without securing all of the plaintiff's requested relief are not evidence that the Union acted arbitrarily in its representation of the plaintiff.

First, the plaintiff offers no evidence to show that the Union did not prepare for arbitration hearings. By his own admission, the plaintiff spent time with the Union representative preparing for arbitration in August 2011, Pl.'s Decl. \u00b6 28, and in April 2013, and \"from previous interactions [he] knew [the Union representative] to be well prepared,\" <em>Bey II</em> Compl. \u00b6 93. Further, the fact that the Union chose not to submit evidence into the record during arbitration is at most \"an error of judgment, <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"25\" href=\"#p25\" id=\"p25\">*25</a>and not evidence of breach of the duty of fair representation.\" <em>See</em> <em>Castelli</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"297089\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/752/1480/\">752 F.2d at 1483</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-89\">Nor does the record support the plaintiff's contention that the Union's representation of the plaintiff was in bad faith. The plaintiff's conclusory allegations that the Union colluded with WMATA do not satisfy the \"demanding standard\" needed to prove bad faith. <em>See</em> <em>Int'l Union</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3615578,7413731\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/41/1532/\">41 F.3d at </extracted-citation>1537 ; <em>Gullaksen v.

The Plaintiff's Civil Conspiracy Claims Against the Union</strong></p><p id=\"p-92\">In alleging a civil conspiracy claim predicated on the tort of defamation against the Union, the plaintiff states that \"[e]ach of the individual [WMATA] defendants identified in the [eleven] counts of defamation and [the Union] are jointly and severally liable for each of the [eleven] counts of defamation\" asserted. <em>Bey II</em> Compl. \u00b6 183. The Union argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's civil conspiracy claim against it because \"the [p]laintiff has failed to show that any of the individuals [he has identified] are actually liable for defamation,\" Union's Summ. J. Mem. at 21 (identifying Gina Pervall, John Coleman, James Lipscomb, Cooper-Lucas, Donna Gaffney, and Dr. Leonard Hertzberg as the individuals that \"made false statements about him in the ADA hearing, arbitration, and the independent medical examination\"), and because the plaintiff would be unable to establish the \"threadbare essentials to [establish] a valid [civil conspiracy claim],\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325047\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/920/1/#p8\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325047\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/920/1/#p8\"> at 22</extracted-citation>.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court agrees with the Union.</p><p id=\"p-93\">As the Court previously noted, \" '[c]ivil conspiracy is not an independent tort but only a means for establishing vicarious liability for an underlying tort.' \" <em>Nader</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3650081,3542110\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/692/\">567 F.3d at 697</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Hill</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8342745\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/933/314/#p334\">933 A.2d at </extracted-citation>334 ). The plaintiff fails to identify any allegedly defamatory statement made by the Union against him; rather, he asserts that the Union is vicariously liable for the allegedly defamatory statements made by the individual WMATA defendants. <em>See</em> <em>Bey II</em> Compl. \u00b6 183. Having already dismissed the plaintiff's defamation claim against the individual WMATA defendants, <em>see</em> <em>supra</em> Part III.B.2.a., there is no underlying tort to serve as a predicate for the plaintiff's <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"26\" href=\"#p26\" id=\"p26\">*26</a>civil conspiracy claim for defamation against the Union, <em>see</em> <em>Nader</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3650081,3542110\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/692/\">567 F.3d at 697</extracted-citation>. And contrary to the plaintiff's contention, <em>see</em> Pl.'s Opp'n to Union's Summ. J. Mot. at 22 (arguing that he must only establish the elements necessary to show an illegal conspiracy), the lack of a predicate underlying tort extinguishes the plaintiff's ability to proceed with his civil conspiracy claim. Accordingly, the Court grants the Union's motion for summary judgment on Counts XXI through XXXII of the <em>Bey II</em> Complaint.</p><p id=\"p-94\"><strong>3. The Plaintiff's Retaliation Claim Against the Union</strong></p><p id=\"p-95\">The plaintiff asserts a retaliation claim against the Union under the Rehabilitation Act. <em>See</em> <em>Bey II</em> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 145-51. The Union argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on this claim because it was not the plaintiff's employer and therefore, the plaintiff is unable to establish a viable retaliation claim against it. <em>See</em> Union's Summ. J. Mem. at 23-24. The Court agrees with the Union.</p><p id=\"p-96\">In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must demonstrate that \"(1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity, (2) the employer was aware of the activity; (3) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\" <em>Duncan v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"741281\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/214/43/#p50\">214 F.R.D. 43</extracted-citation>, 50 (D.D.C. 2003) (citation omitted). The Union \"is a Labor Union which is organized for the purpose of collective bargaining with [WMATA],\" Union's Summ. J. Mem. at 22, and \"operates solely and exclusively as a bargaining unit for various classes of WMATA employees,\" <em>id.</em> at 23. The Union \"does not act as an employer for their members nor [is it] involved in the administration of the transit system. [And, a]t no time was the [p]laintiff employed by [the Union].\" <em>Id.</em> Furthermore, section 152 of the National Labor Relations Act states that \"[t]he term 'employer' ... shall not include ... any labor organization (other than when acting as an employer), or anyone acting in the capacity of officer or agent of such labor organization.\" <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152</extracted-citation>(2) ; <em>see also</em> Union's Summ. J. Mem. at 23 (noting that <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152</extracted-citation>(2) was \"formally adopted and cited in section 66 of the [WMATA] Compact\"). The plaintiff acknowledges that the Union was not his employer, <em>see</em> Pl.'s Opp'n to Union's Summ. J. Mot. at 22, and consequently, because the Union was not the plaintiff's employer and thus could not have taken adverse employment actions against the plaintiff in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, the Court grants the Union's motion for summary judgment on Counts V and VI of the <em>Bey II</em> Complaint.</p><p id=\"p-97\"><strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-98\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court denies both the Union's and the plaintiff's cross-motions to strike. The Court also grants the Union's motion for summary judgment, grants in part and denies in part WMATA's motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and grants in part and <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"27\" href=\"#p27\" id=\"p27\">*27</a>denies in part WMATA's supplemental motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-99\"><strong>SO ORDERED</strong> this 11th day of October, 2018.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
