Jan. 22, 2015) (Walton, J.), of this case have previously been set forth by the Court, the Court finds it necessary to briefly reiterate the current procedural posture of this case pertinent to the pending motions, and to discuss the plaintiff's work involving safety-related incidents and his use of the pharmaceutical, Adderall.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-11\">\n       Considering the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as the non-moving party in regards to the summary judgment motions, the record consists of the following regarding the plaintiff's involvement in safety-related incidents and his use of Adderall in his capacity as a WMATA bus mechanic. After being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\"ADHD\") in June 2009, Pl.'s Decl. \u00b6 11, the plaintiff was prescribed Adderall to manage his symptoms,\n       <em>\n        id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 13, and he reported his Adderall usage to WMATA on June 26, 2009,\n       <em>\n        see\n       </em>\n       WMATA's Supp. Summ. J. Mot., Exhibit (\"Ex.\") F (Prescription Reporting Forms). He again reported his Adderall usage to WMATA on May 21, 2010, indicating that he had started taking Adderall \"last year\" and was taking it on an \"ongoing\" basis.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        id.\n       </em>\n       , Ex. F (Prescription Reporting Forms). After being referred to WMATA's medical department, on June 10, 2010, WMATA \"informed [the plaintiff] that use of Adderall was against [United States Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") ] policy for [commercial driver's license] holders. [The plaintiff] was instructed that [he] must have [his] prescription switched to a\n      non-[S]chedule II medication prior to [him] being allowed to return to duty.\" Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 16. The plaintiff then began taking Strattera, a non-Schedule II medication.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 17. Thereafter, the plaintiff submitted a grievance to WMATA, challenging WMATA's directive that he stop taking Adderall, on the basis that \"the DOT and WMATA did not have a regulation prohibiting the use of Adderall.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 19. Then, after being involved in an accident in September 2010, the plaintiff filed an accident appeal form stating that the accident \"was the result of being removed from [Adderall].\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 21.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-12\">\n       The plaintiff began taking Adderall again in September 2010, and submitted prescription reporting forms with WMATA on September 9, 2010; October 9, 2010; October 10, 2010; December 10, 2010; and January 18, 2011, advising WMATA that he was taking the medication.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       WMATA's Supp. Summ. J. Mot., Ex. F (Prescription Reporting Forms). The Accident Appeal Board denied the plaintiff's accident appeal on January 18, 2011, and the following day, the plaintiff represents that defendant Lisa Cooper-Lucas, the head of WMATA's medical branch, \"informed [him] that [he] would not be allowed to continue taking Adderall based on a DOT prohibition,\" and that he \"was removed from duty pending having [his] prescription changed, evaluated[,] and approved for use by [ ] Cooper-Lucas.\" Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 31. The plaintiff informed Cooper-Lucas that he \"would take Adderall for the last time [on] [ ] January 23, 2011,\"\n       <em>\n        id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 32, and Cooper-Lucas informed the plaintiff that \"Adderall would be undetectable in his system [twenty-four] hours after [he] last took it\" and that \"she would clear ... [his] return to duty on ... January 24[, 2011],\"\n       <em>\n        id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 33. According to the plaintiff, Cooper-Lucas \"threatened [him] with a [thirty-]day suspension if [he] were to test positive for Adderall at any point in the future.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-13\">\n       Following his return to work, the plaintiff suffered an on-the-job injury on January 25, 2011, and after receiving medical treatment, was \"transported to WMATA headquarters for a post[-]incident drug and alcohol urinalysis,\" and tested positive for the use of Adderall.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. The following morning, Cooper-Lucas suspended the plaintiff for thirty days, and on February 3, 2011, the plaintiff was released from pay status, required to enroll in the WMATA's Employee Assistance Program, and threatened with \"termination for violating the prescription drug section of WMATA's [s]ubstance abuse [p]olicy.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 49. The plaintiff contends that he was \"removed from the Category II [Employee Assistance] [P]rogram for 'intent' to use [Adderall],\" after he requested that WMATA \"put an answer in writing stating whether or not [he] would be allowed to take [his] doctor prescribed medication,\" i.e., Adderall. Pl.'s Decl. \u00b6 25. Thereafter, on February 28, 2011, the plaintiff represents that he was removed from the Employee Assistance Program on the ground that he \"ha[d] been non-compliant with [his] Category II Contract stipulation.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 60 (Employee Assistance Program Removal Letter).\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-16\">\n       Although the settlement agreement did not address the plaintiff's Adderall use,\n       <em>\n        see\n       </em>\n       Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 233 (Sept. 29, 2011 Settlement Agreement), WMATA unofficially granted the plaintiff's request to use Adderall\n       <footnotemark>\n        3\n       </footnotemark>\n       by allowing him to report his Adderall usage to WMATA upon his return to duty,\n       <em>\n        see\n       </em>\n       WMATA's Supp. Summ.

WMATA denied the plaintiff's accommodation requests, advising him that \"the ADA Panel has found [him] to be a direct threat in [his] current position, defined as a significant risk or substantial harm to [his]\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-18\">\n       health and/or safety or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       , Ex. 172 (Accommodation Request Denial) at 2.

The plaintiff's submission that the Union seeks to strike does not fall under Rule 7(a)'s definition of a \"pleading,\" because it was filed in support of the plaintiff's opposition to WMATA's and the Union's motions for summary judgment, which is not the type of document identified in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Fed.

It is therefore unclear when these alleged instances occurred, if at all, and the Court is unable to make a determination, based on the evidence in the record, whether these events actually occurred and whether the plaintiff was actively using Adderall when they allegedly occurred.
