(\"South Shore\"), seeking a determination that National Casualty has no duty to defend or indemnify South Shore in a personal injury lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County,\n   <em>\n    Delgado v. South Shore, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Lans.%20Ch.%20013458\">\n    2013 L 013458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"Underlying Lawsuit\"). National Casualty initially named Julio Delgado (\"Delgado\") and GD Carriers, Inc. (\"GD Carriers\") as defendants in\n   the instant action; however, by way of the parties' stipulated agreement, both Delgado and GD Carriers were dismissed from this action, leaving South Shore as the sole defendant. South Shore has filed a three count Counterclaim: Count I seeks a determination that National Casualty has a duty to defend and indemnify South Shore in the Underlying Lawsuit; Count II sets forth a claim for breach of contract; and Count III sets forth a \"bad faith\" claim under 215 ILCS \u00a7 5/155. Before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. For the following reasons, the Court determines that National Casualty breached its duty to defend South Shore in the Underlying Lawsuit and has a duty to indemnify South Shore for the settlement of the Underlying Lawsuit; however, South Shore's \"bad faith\" counterclaim under 215 ILCS \u00a7 5/155 is dismissed with prejudice. Accordingly, National Casualty's motion is granted in part and denied in part; and South Shore's motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   South Shore is a structural steel company located in Chicago, Illinois. GD Carriers is a trucking company located in Chicago, Illinois. At all times relevant, Delgado was an employee of GD Carriers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2013, South Shore was providing steel components for a job site in Rochelle, Illinois (the \"Rochelle Project\"). South Shore manufactured the steel components and then loaded the components onto flatbed trailers at its facility in Chicago. South Shore did not transport the loaded trailers to the Rochelle Project. Rather, South Shire hired various trucking companies-including GD Carriers-to transport the loaded trailers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 4, 2013, Delgado drove a tractor owned by GD Carriers to South Shore's facility to pick up a trailer loaded with steel beams for delivery to the Rochelle Project. After Delgado arrived at South Shore's premises, he connected GD Carrier's tractor to the trailer that he was assigned to transport. At the time Delgado connected GD Carrier's tractor to the trailer, it was still being loaded with steel beams by South Shore employees. Once the trailer was fully loaded, Delgado began securing the load of steel beams for transport to the Rochelle Project. GD Carrier's tractor remained parked and connected to the trailer while Delgado was attempting to secure the load-the tractor/trailer never moved. While Delgado was attempting to secure the load on the trailer, he fell to the ground and was injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 25, 2013, Delgado filed the Underlying Lawsuit against South Shore and other parties in the Circuit Court of Cook County. Delgado's fourth amended complaint in the Underlying Lawsuit, filed on April 15, 2016, alleged that his injury was the result of South Shore's negligent acts or omissions, including: South Shore \"[i]mproperly loaded the flatbed trailer requiring [Delgado] to climb on top of the load in order to secure it\"; South Shore \"[p]ainted the steel beams which [Delgado] was to haul, causing them to become dangerously slippery\"; and South Shore \"failed to warn [Delgado] of the dangerously slippery condition of the recently painted steel beams.\" Pl.'s SOMF \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Ex. C (the \"Underlying Complaint\") \u00b6\u00b6 5-9. Delgado also alleged that on the date of his injury he was \"working as a truck driver employed by GD Carriers ... assigned to pick up a trailer of steel beams at ... South Shore['s] plant,\" and that he \"was a business invitee on the premises of [South Shore] for the benefit of [South Shore].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to Delgado's injury, National Casualty issued a commercial auto policy to GD Carrier's, Policy Number OP00042008, effective from July 15, 2013 to July 15,\n   2014, with a liability coverage limit of $1,000,000 (the \"Policy\"). The Policy provides as follows, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. WHO IS AN INSURED\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The following are \"insureds\":\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a.

The owner or anyone else from whom you hire or borrow a covered \"auto\" that is a \"trailer\" while the \"trailer\" is connected to another covered \"auto\" that is a power unit, or, if not connected, is being used exclusively in your business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Compl., Ex. A at 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By letter dated June 18, 2015, South Shore tendered the Underlying Lawsuit to National Casualty for a defense and indemnification. By letter dated July 31, 2015, National Casualty denied South Shore's tender of the Underlying Lawsuit on the basis that South Shore did not qualify as an \"insured\" under the Policy. National Casualty did not defend South Shore in the Underlying Lawsuit based on a reservation of rights or otherwise. National Casualty filed the instant declaratory judgment action on July 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 9, 2018, after the parties filed their initial briefs for the present motions, South Shore settled the Underlying Lawsuit with Delgado for $2.5 million. Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOMF, Ex. H. That same day, the Circuit Court of Cook County dismissed the Underlying Lawsuit with prejudice and retained jurisdiction only to effectuate the settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex.

National Casualty Has Breached Its Duty to Defend South Shore and Has a Duty to Indemnify South Shore For the Settlement of the Underlying Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The dispositive issue in this case is whether South Shore qualifies as an insured under the language of the Policy. As explained\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , if South Shore qualifies as an insured, National Casualty has breached its duty to defend South Shore and owes a duty to indemnify South Shore, up to the Policy limit of $1,000,000, for the settlement of the Underlying Lawsuit. There is also a secondary issue raised by the parties regarding whether the Court may examine evidence beyond the Underlying Complaint in determining National Casualty's duty to defend South Shore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   National Casualty argues that South Shore does not qualify as an insured under the Policy because: (1) South was not \"using\" GD Carrier's tractor, as required by the Policy; (2) even if South Shore was \"using\" GD Carrier's tractor, coverage is precluded by an exception in the Policy that removes insured status for certain persons, including South Shore, while \"moving property\" to or from a covered auto; and (3) GD Carriers did not \"hire\" or \"borrow\" the trailer from South Shore, as required by the Policy. Additionally, accordingly to National Casualty, the Court may properly consider evidence outside of the Underlying Complaint in determining its duty to defend and indemnify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Conversely, South Shore argues that it\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   qualify as an insured under the Policy because: (1) South Shore was \"using\" GD Carrier's tractor when Delgado was injured; (2) the Policy's \"moving property\" exception does not apply; and (3) GD Carriers was \"borrowing\" the trailer in question from South Shore. Further, according to South Shore, the Court is constrained to examining the Underlying Complaint alone in determining whether National Casualty breached its duty to defend. Finally, South Shore argues that National Casualty is estopped from raising coverage defenses due to its delay in filing this action; or, even if National Casualty is not estopped from raising coverage defenses, it still has a duty to indemnify South Shore based on the undisputed facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

South Shore, on the other hand, argues that it was \"using\" the tractor to transport steel beams to the Rochelle Project, which necessarily included the tractor being connected to the trailer and securing the load for transport. The Court agrees with South Shore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There is no dispute that South Shore hired GD Carriers to provide the tractor to transport a load of steel to the Rochelle Project. There is also no dispute that prior to Delgado's injury, he connected the tractor to the trailer while it was being loaded at South Shore's facility and that he was securing the load of steel beams in preparation for transport when he fell and was injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In order for GD Carrier's tractor to transport the steel beams for South Shore, Delgado had to connect the tractor to the trailer; secure the load of the steel beams; and finally, drive the load to the Rochelle Project. Thus, because the tractor was connected to the trailer, it was being \"employ[ed] for some purpose of the user\"-transporting the load of steel beams for South Shore. National Casualty essentially argues that because the tractor was not being operated while Delgado was injured, it was not being \"used.\" However, this narrow definition of \"use\" has been expressly rejected by the Illinois supreme court.\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   , 237 Ill. 2d at 402,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20Ill.%20Dec.%20429\">\n    341 Ill.Dec. 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=930%20N.E.2d%20943\">\n    930 N.E.2d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" '[U]se' is not limited to operating or driving a motor vehicle.\"). Accordingly, consistent with the definition of \"use\" provided in\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   , the undisputed facts show that South Shore was \"using\" GD Carrier's tractor at the time of Delgado's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court would reach the same conclusion even if it were to consider the Underlying Complaint alone. Delgado alleged in the Underlying Complaint that he was \"working as a truck driver employed by GD Carriers ... assigned to pick up a trailer of steel beams at ... South Shore['s] plant,\" and that he \"was a business invitee on the premises of [South Shore] for the benefit of [South Shore].\" Underlying Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.

While Delgado did not specifically allege that GD Carrier's tractor was connected to the trailer at the time of his injury, he also did not allege the tractor was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   connected to the trailer. Therefore, construing the allegations in favor of South Shore, the Underlying Complaint alleged facts indicating that South Shore was\n   <em>\n    potentially\n   </em>\n   \"using\" GD Carrier's tractor at the time of Delgado's injury, which is sufficient to trigger an insurer's duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    Midwest Sporting Goods Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059916\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/215/146/#p155\">\n    215 Ill. 2d at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=293%20Ill.%20Dec.%20594\">\n    293 Ill.Dec. 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=828%20N.E.2d%201092\">\n    828 N.E.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The \"Moving Property\" exception does not apply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Next, National Casualty argues that even if South Shore was \"using\" GD Carrier's tractor, South Shore's insured status would be removed by the \"moving property\" exception in the Policy. The \"moving property\" exception provides that an \"insured\" is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   b. Anyone else while using with your permission a covered \"auto\" you own, hire or borrow\n   <em>\n    except:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (4) Anyone other than your \"employees\", partners (if you are a partnership), members (if you are a limited liability company), a lessee or borrower of a covered \"auto\" or any of their \"employees\", while\n   <em>\n    moving property\n   </em>\n   to or from a covered \"auto\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Comp., Ex.

National Casualty contends that this exception applies because Delgado's injury was caused by South Shore's negligence in improperly loading, or\n   <em>\n    moving\n   </em>\n   , the steel beams onto the trailer. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, the Court rejects that the proper time frame to consider for insurance coverage is limited to the period during which a negligent act or omission occurs. National Casualty relies on a single case from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in support of this argument.\n   <em>\n    Float-Away Door Co. v. Cont'l Cas.

South Shore had finished loading the trailer and Delgado was securing the load for transport at the time he was injured. Accordingly, the above exception does not remove South Shore's insured status because it only applies \"while [the insured is]\n   <em>\n    moving property.\n   </em>\n   \" Compl., Ex. A at 64 (emphasis added). National Casualty points to no other exception in the policy that would remove South Shore's insured status as a permissive \"user\" of GD Carrier's tractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court concludes that South Shore was an insured under the Policy because it was \"using\" GD Carrier's tractor at the time of Delgado's injury and because the \"moving property\" exception does not apply. Thus, there is no need for the Court to consider the parties' arguments regarding whether GD Carriers was \"borrowing\" the trailer in question from South Shore, within the meaning of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

The Policy provides, in relevant part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   We will pay all sums that an \"insured\" legally must pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" ... to which this insurance applies, caused by an \"accident\" and resulting from the ownership maintenance or use of a covered \"auto.\" ... We will have the right and duty to defend any \"insured\" against a \"suit\" asking for such damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Compl., Ex A at 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , South Shore is an insured under the Policy, because it was \"using\" GD Carrier's tractor to transport steel beams at the time of Delgado's injury. Moreover, it is undisputed that Delgado was injured while he was attempting to secure the load of steel beams for transport. Thus, Delgado's injury resulted from South Shore's \"use\" of GD Carrier's tractor and National Casualty owed a duty to defend South Shore in the Underlying Lawsuit, wherein Delgado sued South Shore for the injuries he sustained while attempting to secure the load of steel beams. However, it is undisputed that National Casualty denied South Shore's tender of the Underlying Lawsuit.

However, South Shore also admits that Illinois courts have not adopted a bright line rule in regards to what constitutes a \"reasonable time.\" Nonetheless, South Shore argues that National Casualty should be estopped from raising coverage defenses because it waited thirteen months to file this declaratory judgment action after South Shore tendered the Underlying Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that National Casualty filed this declaratory judgment action prior to the settlement of the Underlying Lawsuit-in fact, this action was filed more than\n   <em>\n    seventeen months\n   </em>\n   prior to the settlement. Further, National Casualty sought declaratory relief only four months after the fourth amended complaint was filed in the Underlying Lawsuit. Thus, National Casualty did not delay its filing of this declaratory judgment action until the Underlying Lawsuit was resolved or until trial or settlement was imminent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As for the \"reasonable time\" standard, the Court rejects that National Casualty waited an unreasonable amount of time to file this action, given the protracted procedural history of the Underlying Lawsuit-South Shore waited nineteen months to tender the Underlying Lawsuit to National Casualty and the fourth amended complaint was filed only four months prior to the filing of this action. Further, the fact that the Underlying Lawsuit was settled prior to the resolution of this action does not make it untimely.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , 186 Ill. 2d at 374,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=238%20Ill.%20Dec.%20126\">\n    238 Ill.Dec. 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=710%20N.E.2d%201228\">\n    710 N.E.2d 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court agrees, as there is no dispute that the Underlying Lawsuit was settled for $2.5 million. Thus, the Court must consider whether the Underlying Lawsuit and resulting settlement falls within the Policy's coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   National Casualty makes two arguments against indemnification: (1) South Shore is not an insured under the Policy; and (2) the other conditions of indemnification in the Policy have not been satisfied. As previously discussed at length by the Court, South Shore is an insured under the Policy. Therefore, the only remaining issue is whether the conditions of indemnification in the Policy have been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Policy provides in relevant part that: \"[National Casualty] will pay all sums that an 'insured' legally must pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' ... to which this insurance applies, caused by an 'accident' and resulting from the ownership maintenance or use of a covered 'auto.' \" Compl., Ex. A at 64. Here, it is undisputed that South Shore settled the Underlying Lawsuit with Delgado for $2.5 million, wherein Delgado claimed that he was injured in an\n   <em>\n    accident\n   </em>\n   caused by South Shore's negligent acts and omissions. Further, the Court has already concluded that Delgado's injury resulted from South Shore's \"use\" of GD Carrier's tractor because Delgado was injured while he was attempting to secure the load of steel beams for transport. South Shore argues that \"there is nothing in the record before [the] Court that would indicate that [South Shore] is not entitled to be indemnified by [National Casualty.]\" Def.'s Mem. in Opp.'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 12. The Court agrees. Based on the undisputed facts before the Court, National Casualty has a duty to indemnify South Shore for the settlement of the Underlying Lawsuit up to the Policy limit of $1,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    C. South Shore is Not Entitled to \"Bad Faith\" Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, the Court addresses Count III of South Shore's counterclaim, in which it seeks attorneys fees and sanctions under 215 ILCS \u00a7 5/155, based on National Casualty's alleged unreasonable and vexatious behavior. More specifically, South Shore claims that National Casualty's actions were unreasonable and vexatious because it had no valid basis to deny South Shore coverage and it failed to file this action in a timely manner. National Casualty argues that South Shore's bad faith claim fails as matter of law because there was a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute concerning coverage and National Casualty filed this action in a timely manner to resolve that\n   dispute. For the following reasons, the Court agrees with National Casualty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Section 155 of the Illinois Insurance Code states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (1) In any action by or against a company wherein there is in issue the liability of a company on a policy or policies of insurance or the amount of the loss payable thereunder, or for an unreasonable delay in settling a claim, and it appears to the court that such action or delay is vexatious and unreasonable, the court may allow as part of the taxable costs in the action reasonable attorney fees, other costs, plus an amount not to exceed any one of the following amounts:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (a) 60% of the amount which the court or jury finds such party is entitled to recover against the company, exclusive of all costs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (b) $60,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (c) the excess of the amount which the court or jury finds such party is entitled to recover, exclusive of costs, over the amount, if any, which the company offered to pay in settlement of the claim prior to the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   However, \"where a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute concerning coverage exists, costs and sanctions are inappropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

However, in denying South Shore's tender of the Underlying Lawsuit, National Casualty's conduct was not unreasonable or vexatious; therefore, Count III of South Shore's Counterclaim is dismissed with prejudice.
