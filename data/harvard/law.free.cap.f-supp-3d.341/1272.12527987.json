JOHNSON, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS MATTER comes before the Court upon Plaintiff's Motion to Remand to State Court, filed July 5, 2018\n   <strong>\n    (Doc. 23).\n   </strong>\n   Having reviewed the parties' briefs and applicable law, the Court finds that Plaintiff's Motion is well-taken and, therefore, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . This matter is therefore\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   to the Eleventh Judicial District Court, County of San Juan, State of New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a class action asserting a violation of New Mexico Minimum Wage Act. Plaintiff was a lease operator for Defendant XTO Energy, Inc., in San Juan County, New Mexico. Plaintiff filed a complaint against both XTO Energy, Inc. and Michael Marriott, alleging that they failed to pay him and sixty other lease operators overtime as required under the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act. Under the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act (\"NMMWA\"), \"[a]n employee shall not be required to work more than forty hours in any week of seven days, unless the employee is paid one and one-half times the employee's regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty hours.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMSA \u00a7 50-4-22(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a lease operator, Plaintiff maintained oilfield equipment, measured the level of oil in tanks, and input data into spreadsheets regarding the amount of oil a well produces. Defendant Marriott was the senior superintendent for Defendant XTO in New Mexico, and was allegedly the senior supervisor in New Mexico. There were two layers of supervisors - foremen and assistant superintendents - between Defendant Marriott and the lease operators. Plaintiff alleged that Defendant Marriott had the authority to make personnel, scheduling, and compensation decisions, which Defendants dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The citizenship of the parties appears to be uncontested based on the face of the complaint and the Notice of Removal. Plaintiff is a New Mexico citizen, and Defendant XTO Energy is incorporated in Delaware, with its principal place of business in Texas.\n   <strong>\n    Doc. 1, p. 3.\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Marriott is a citizen of New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 4, 2018, Defendants filed a Notice of Removal\n   <strong>\n    (Doc. 1)\n   </strong>\n   on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Although Defendant Marriott is a citizen of New Mexico and therefore non-diverse with Plaintiff, Defendants allege that Defendant Marriott was fraudulently joined. Specifically, they assert that he is not an \"employer\" under the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act, and therefore no claim under the Minimum Wage Act can be asserted against him. Defendants included, as an appendix to their Notice of Removal, a declaration by Defendant Marriott which purports to assert facts showing that he was not an employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 11, 2018, Defendant Marriott filed a Motion to Dismiss\n   <strong>\n    (Doc. 12)\n   </strong>\n   under Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), arguing that claims against him should be dismissed, because he cannot be an employer under the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 5, 2018, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Remand on the basis that the Court lacks diversity jurisdiction, and Defendant Marriott was not fraudulently joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Removal and Diversity Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction; thus, there is a presumption against removal jurisdiction, which the defendant seeking removal must overcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fajen v.

Therefore, to support removal, Defendants bear the burden of showing with complete certainty that there is no possibility of a claim against Defendant Marriott. Defendants attempt to do so here by arguing that Defendant Marriott cannot be an 'employer' under the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     There is no controlling law interpreting the definition of \"employer\" under the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Whether a supervisor is an \"employer\" under the NMMWA appears to be an issue of first impression. Although the NMMWA defines employer, there is no case law construing the definition of employer under that act in New Mexico or in the Tenth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under the NMMWA, an employer \"includes any\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   , partnership, association, business trust, legal representative or any organized group of persons employing one or more employees at any time, acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.\" NMSA \u00a7 50-4-21(B) (emphasis added). This language is exceedingly broad. The plain language of the definition provides that individuals employed by a company may be an \"employer\" themselves when they take certain actions in relation to employees on behalf the corporate employer. There is no controlling law in New Mexico or the Tenth Circuit discussing how this definition applies to individuals who act in a supervisory or managerial role. On this basis alone, the Court concludes that Defendant has not shown there is \"no possibility\" that Plaintiff has a claim against Defendant Marriott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants propose that the court should apply the \"economic reality\" test under the FLSA to determine whether Defendant Marriott is an employer. Initially, the Court notes that it is unclear whether New Mexico would apply the economic reality test under the FLSA to determine whether a\n   <em>\n    supervisor\n   </em>\n   was an \"employer\" under the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act. Because the definition of employer is similar in both the Minimum Wage Act and the FLSA, New Mexico courts may look to case law interpreting similar language under the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.
