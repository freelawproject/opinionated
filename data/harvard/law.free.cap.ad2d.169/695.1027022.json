The defendant Bernhardt\u2019s car cut off Berton\u2019s vehicle, causing it to leave the road and strike a tree. The appellant suffered multiple injuries, including a ruptured spleen with hemorrhage and retro-peritoneal hemotoma, a fractured pelvis, a fracture of his spine, a tear of his left diaphragm, a tear of his pericardium, and a concussion resulting in loss of consciousness. The appellant subsequently underwent an operation for removal of his spleen which had been irreparably damaged. An additional operation was required to repair damage to his jaw and teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">The principal injury suffered by the appellant as a result of the accident was a comminuted compression fracture to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>fifth lumbar vertebra of his spine as well as a fracture of the left traverse process of the second, third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. While the appellant was hospitalized, various painkilling drugs were administered to alleviate the pain emanating from his back. During his third operation, his spine was fused by the implantation of \"Harrington rods\u201d. After this surgery he was placed in a body cast which extended from his neck down to his buttocks. According to the appellant, he was in constant pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The appellant further testified that following the accident he could no longer play sports with his friends, nor dance, because of the pain in his back. Moreover, his medical expert indicated that he is at increased risk of succumbing to infections because his spleen has been removed. The undisputed medical testimony further indicates that for patients with \"Harrington rods\u201d implanted in their spines, future surgery is necessary to avoid the dangerous complications that arise from indefinite implantation.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In view of the nature and extent of the appellant\u2019s injuries, we find that the award of damages was inadequate to the extent indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">We have reviewed the appellant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Sullivan, J. P., Eiber, Harwood and Balletta, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
