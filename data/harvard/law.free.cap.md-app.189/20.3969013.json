At his jury trial in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, he claimed that he did not intend to steal the vehicle, and took it because he mistakenly believed that he was God. The jury convicted appellant of both offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">On appeal, Gregory presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">I. Did the trial court err in failing to properly advise the appellant about his right not to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">II. Did the trial court err in allowing appellant to be impeached with his prior convictions for robbery and theft when appellant was on trial for attempted theft?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">III. Did the trial court err in failing to give the jury instruction on mistake of fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">IV. Was the evidence sufficient to sustain the convictions for attempted unlawful taking of a motor vehicle and attempted theft over $500?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">Finding no error, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">The following evidence was adduced at the trial in November 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">On May 17, 2007, Brenda Huffman lived on Laurel Road in Mardela Springs and owned a 2004 Hummer H2 truck. She testified that, on that date, she went out with her mother, and the two returned to her home at approximately 3:35 p.m. At that time, she saw an unfamiliar truck in her front driveway, which was running. In her rear driveway, where her 2004 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Hummer H2 was parked, Huffman discovered appellant sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, with \u201chis hands ... in the floorboard area.\u201d At trial, she identified appellant as the individual she observed on the driver\u2019s side of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">When Huffman asked appellant \u201cwhat he was doing,\u201d appellant exited the Hummer and told Huffman that he \u201cneeded to take the truck.\u201d Huffman asked appellant \u201cwhat was wrong[,]\u201d because he \u201cjust didn\u2019t seem right and he kept saying he was in distress.\u201d Appellant replied \u201cthat God told him [that] he could take the truck.\u201d After appellant told Huffman that \u201che wasn\u2019t going to leave without the truck[,]\u201d Huffman called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Huffman had left the Hummer unlocked, although the keys to the Hummer were not in the vehicle. She examined the interior of the vehicle and saw \u201cwiring hanging\u201d underneath the dashboard of the Hummer. These wires were not hanging down before appellant entered her vehicle. Huffman purchased the Hummer for $49,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Joyce Caudill, Huffman\u2019s mother, testified that she drove her daughter home on May 17, 2007. Upon arriving, they saw a man in her daughter\u2019s truck. Ms. Caudill identified appellant as the man. Ms. Caudill and her daughter approached appellant and asked him what he was doing. Appellant told them that \u201cGod had told him to take the truck,\u201d and he could not leave without it. While inside of the truck, appellant was leaning toward the floorboard of the vehicle. Ms. Caudill told appellant to get out of the truck and he complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Trooper Richard Lee Hagel, Jr. of the Maryland State Police, responded to Huffman\u2019s home at approximately 3:59 p.m. He saw appellant \u201cstanding approximately [twenty] feet behind the Hummer[.]\u201d Appellant\u2019s vehicle, a 1991 or 1992 Blazer, was parked at the end of the driveway, and it was running. Appellant, who was cooperative, told the trooper that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">he was driving by and ... heard a voice inside his truck that told him [that] he had to take the Hummer. So he stopped, pulled into the driveway, and attempted to take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Hummer. He said that the voice he had heard in his truck, he believed there was a device in his truck that allowed ... God to speak to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The defense moved for judgment of acquittal. As to the charge of motor vehicle theft, appellant\u2019s attorney argued that \u201cthe State has not shown that the Defendant\u2019s actions were knowing and willful____\u201d The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Appellant was the sole witness for the defense. We quote from his direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: [0]n May 17th at any time during the day were you in Mardela ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">[APPELLANT]: At Brenda Huffman\u2019s place, the place where I was arrested, that\u2019s where I was but I had been there well before the police was called, possibly an hour or two hours before the police was called.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: When did you arrive there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">[APPELLANT]: [Approximately [fifty] minutes to an hour before her daughter\u2019s school bus arrived. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And what were you doing there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">[APPELLANT]: I was having vehicle trouble. My intention was to pull in her driveway, [make a] three point turn [and] head back to where I just came from[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, after you pulled into her driveway, what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-12\">[APPELLANT]: My truck\u2014well, when I went to slow down to pull into her driveway, there was an issue about this truck coming to a stop....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-13\">So I came in at a speed more than enough to slow down and I buckled into their driveway____So I got in there and I heard this sound, which I hadn\u2019t heard before, as if something snapped----And I hit like it went in gear ... but the tires just spun....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>So I was just at this house and I seen the driveway facing, there\u2019s a house right there, I see a Hummer truck[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">... I\u2019m just sitting there, I\u2019m thinking about this Hummer, I\u2019m looking at the Hummer, I\u2019m looking at the truck, I\u2019m like[,] well[,] I keep going through so much stuff with my truck, I keep having to get it fixed every now and then[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">So I said well, I\u2019ll keep going through the stuff. So it told me that this Hummer truck, ... once the voice said that, it told me that, said this Hummer, the only thing in the yard said this Hummer, it said, told me the Hummer was mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The voice told you to take the Hummer? Did you know whose voice it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">[APPELLANT]: ... I actually thought that my truck was communicating with me----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">Anyhow, I got that telepathy, it was telepathed to me that message there that this Hummer was mine----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">And so anyway, ... I\u2019m looking at the Hummer. I opened the door.... I did not get inside of it. And then I closed the door. And I was headed back to my truck. [A]t that exact time, ... the school bus was coming up. And it was a girl, I suppose she was about [eleven] or [thirteen] years old[.] And ... what I said to the little girl, I said listen. I said I am God and my truck knows that I am God. I said my truck will not leave your yard. I said that I want your family to let me have this Hummer.... And she said, well, you want me to get my dad. I said, yeah. And she was off. And she went to the house. And so I expected that her father was ... going to come outside----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">... I didn\u2019t immediately go into the Hummer. I waited out there [for] three minutes, five minutes, ... I\u2019m looking at this Hummer because now I\u2019m confident that I\u2019m going to get this Hummer because also even if it was about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>money, I could afford the Hummer. And so I\u2019m looking at the green paint and ... the wheels ... and I seen that the windows are tinted. So I was like, well, she\u2019s going to tell him ... I\u2019m out here about this truck, so I\u2019m going [to] look inside the truck. So I\u2019m like[,] they know I\u2019m here, ... so I opened the door. And I sat in the driver\u2019s seat____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">And from my left I could see a black Dodge Nitro ... coming up[J And ... I saw it was two ladies____I got out of the truck [and] went straight to them____I told them, exactly what I said, I have an emergency, I need this Hummer, ... I said I need this truck, and I am God. And she said something, that\u2019s all good you have an emergency, she said, but what are you doing in my truck. And I said listen, I don\u2019t want [you to] tell anybody, I said I\u2019m God____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you intend to steal the Hummer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">[APPELLANT]: No. I wasn\u2019t even thinking about the Hummer at all until it was mentioned. Once I had got in that yard and that voice put that thought in my head about the Hummer, which it told me that it\u2019s mine, which I believe everything is mine anyway because I truly believe that I am God, but I know the world don\u2019t have to agree with that, ... so I try to live and make it throughout the world not causing trouble. So until they put that in my mind, I wasn\u2019t going to take their Hummer, I was going to let her know ... the secret, listen, I do believe I am God and I actually told her I am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">During the State\u2019s cross-examination of appellant, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: So the voice told you to take the truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">[APPELLANT]: No, the voice didn\u2019t tell me to do anything, the voice spoke to me, just posed it out there, just threw it in my head that the Hummer is yours, it\u2019s yours, and my truck broke down at the same time it tells me that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>[THE PROSECUTOR]: Is the truck titled in your name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">[APPELLANT]: So are you asking me do I believe that, of course, I knew I didn\u2019t have ownership of the Hummer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: The truck wasn\u2019t yours and you knew it wasn\u2019t yours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">[APPELLANT]: Excuse me, my intention was to make the Hummer mine by getting it from this family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The first contention concerns the advisement appellant received as to his rights to testify or remain silent. We pause to review additional facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Following the close of the State\u2019s case, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: [Appellant], as I have explained to you in the back there a few moments ago, the State has rested [its] case. This is now your case and you will have the opportunity to testify or decline to testify, as I explained to you. If you elect to testify, you must do so under oath from the witness stand right up there as you\u2019ve seen the other witnesses do, and you will be subject to cross-examination, that is the State\u2019s Attorney may ask you questions and the Court, if [it] chooses to, may also ask you questions. You are not required to testify, you have the right to testify. If you decline [to] testify, the Court will make no inference and will instruct the [jury], if you request, to make no inference of your refusal to testify as to your guilt or innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">Do you understand your right to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">[APPELLANT]: I do not decline to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you wish to testify? [APPELLANT]: I wish to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He wishes to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>THE COURT: The only other thing and maybe [defense counsel] told you this, [appellant], is that if you have a criminal history which contains what are known as impeachable offenses, then perhaps the State can ask you questions about those or bring it to the jury\u2019s attention, do you understand that? Subject to various restrictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APo\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Essentially if the State wishes to, [it] could ask you about your prior criminal record, okay. To indicate to the jury that a person with a criminal record like this shouldn\u2019t be believed, would be [an] attack upon your credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aps\">Prior to the State being able to do that, the Court must essentially hold a hearing and do a balancing test as to whether or not those instances would be more prejudicial than illuminating to the jury. But it\u2019s a possibility that the State could ask you about your prior record, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">Do you still wish to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">[APPELLANT]: Ido.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Thereafter, as noted, appellant testified in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Appellant challenges the advisement by the court and defense counsel, characterizing it as \u201cfacially erroneous.\u201d In particular, he complains that the \u201ccourt and defense counsel\u2019s on-the-record advice of rights ... was not accurate as to what prior convictions could be used to impeach\u201d him if he elected \u201cto take the stand.\u201d He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">[T]here can be no question that not every felony conviction can be used to impeach a criminal defendant.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> Notwithstanding that fact, the appellant in this case was led to believe that his criminal history and criminal record could be used to impeach him if he chose to testify. Additionally, neither the trial court nor defense counsel informed appellant that the conviction could not be more than fifteen years old. Md. Rule 5-609(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cAs a result of defense counsel\u2019s incomplete advice,\u201d claims appellant, he \u201clacked sufficient legal information necessary to make a knowing and intelligent decision whether to testify.\u201d <em>See Martin v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 597, 601-02, 535 A.2d 951 (1988) (a defendant \u201c \u2018cannot be charged with a waiver of the [right not to testify] unless [the defendant] voluntarily and intelligently elected to refrain from asserting it\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>People v. Chlebowy, </em>191 Misc. 768, 78 N.Y.S.2d 596, 600 (1948)). According to appellant, the court \u201cwas put on clear notice that [appellant] was not sufficiently informed (by his lawyer) of the constitutional rights that he was deciding whether to exercise or waive,\u201d and therefore \u201cthe court had a <em>sua sponte </em>duty to intervene to assure that he was properly informed about his rights.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the \u201ccourt committed reversible error [by] failing to intervene [and] accurately ... explain his constitutional right [to testify] or to instruct defense counsel to do so[.]\u201d <em>See Tilghman v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 542, 564, 701 A.2d 847 (1997) (stating that \u201cif it is ... manifest to the court that [a] defendant is deciding whether to testify on the basis of erroneous legal advice that will render his decision unknowing and involuntary, the court must take action to assure that the defendant is correctly advised\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>349 Md. 104, 707 A.2d 90 (1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The State counters that, because appellant \u201craised no objection below to the ... court\u2019s advisement, ... he should not be heard to complain now.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 8-131(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>claim is preserved, the State contends that the court\u2019s advice was not \u201cincomplete\u201d and \u201cdefense [counsel\u2019s] advice to [appellant] was not inherently, overtly, or facially erroneous.\u201d Moreover, the State insists that there is no evidence \u201cthat the court was on notice that [appellant] did not understand his rights\u201d or that appellant \u201crelied\u201d on defense counsel\u2019s advice, to his detriment, \u201cin deciding whether to testify.\u201d Thus, the State maintains that the court did not err in failing to intervene and correct defense counsel\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that appellant\u2019s contention is preserved, we conclude that the court did not err in advising appellant as to his testimonial rights. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u201cThe Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution guarantee the accused in a criminal case the right to testify on his own behalf.\u201d <em>Tilghman, </em>117 Md.App. at 553, 701 A.2d 847 (citing <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 52, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987)). Because the right to testify is essential to due process in a fair adversary system, it may only be waived knowingly and intelligently, pursuant to the waiver standards established for fundamental constitutional rights in <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). <em>See Rock, </em>483 U.S. at 51, 107 S.Ct. 2704; <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 819-20 n. 15, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination is guaranteed under both Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,[] and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment^ ]\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>394 Md. 184, 210, 905 A.2d 315 (2006); <em>see also Gray v. State, </em>368 Md. 529, 549-50, 796 A.2d 697 (2002); <em>Bhagwat v. State, </em>338 Md. 263, 270-71, 658 A.2d 244 (1995). No adverse inference can be drawn against a defendant who elects to exercise this privilege. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2006 Repl.Vol., 2009 Supp.) \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article; <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 101 S.Ct. 1112, 67 L.Ed.2d 241 (1981). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Morales v. State, </em>325 Md. 330, 335-36, 600 A.2d 851 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">The decision whether or not to testify is a significant one and must be made with a basic appreciation of what the choice entails. If a defendant elects to remain silent, he or she waives the constitutional right to testify on his or her own behalf. Conversely, if a defendant testifies, he or she waives the constitutional right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">If a defendant is represented by counsel, however, a rebuttable presumption arises that counsel has fully advised his client of the right to testify or remain silent. <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 91-92, 622 A.2d 727 (1993); <em>accord Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 639, 612 A.2d 258 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 931, 113 S.Ct. 1312, 122 L.Ed.2d 700 (1993); <em>Hamilton v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 140, 150, 555 A.2d 1089, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 550, 560 A.2d 1118 (1989). Moreover, there is no provision that requires that the waiver be obtained in any particular form, that it be placed on the record, or that it be done in open court. <em>See Tilghman, </em>117 Md.App. at 555 n. 5, 701 A.2d 847. In <em>Tilghman, </em>this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">In the trial of a <em>pro se </em>criminal defendant, the court must advise the defendant of his constitutional rights to testify and to remain silent, so that he may make an informed choice to invoke one right and waive the other. When the defendant is represented by counsel, no such requirement exists. On the contrary, Maryland law recognizes a presumption, premised on the permitted inference that attorneys, as officers of the court, \u201cdo as the law and their duty require them,\u201d that a represented defendant has been told of his constitutional rights, by his attorney. Thus, even though the right to testify must be waived by the defendant personally, the trial court is entitled to assume that counsel has properly advised the defendant about that right and the correlative right to remain silent and, if the defendant does not testify, that he has effectively waived his right to do so.[]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN\"><em>Id. </em>at 554-55, 701 A.2d 847 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Notably, the <em>Tilghman </em>Court also said, <em>id. </em>at 557, 701 A.2d 847:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>It is not necessary that a defendant be told of the potential for impeachment with prior convictions for his decision whether to testify to be made knowingly and intelligently. <em>Martin v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 597, 535 A.2d 951 (1988) (Wilner, J.). The risk of impeachment is not a \u201cfundamental attribute\u201d of the right to testify, knowledge of which is essential to an understanding of the right itself. <em>Hamilton [v. State, </em>79 Md.App.] at 143, 555 A.2d 1089. Rather, it is a potential consequence of exercising the right to testify that is of largely strategic, not essential, import.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM3\"><em>See also Morales, </em>325 Md. at 337-39, 600 A.2d 851 (while a trial judge is not required to inform the defendant of the risk of impeachment by prior convictions, a judge who decides to do so must provide accurate advice).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">With respect to a defendant\u2019s testimonial decision, Maryland Rule 5-609 is relevant. It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">Rule 5-609. Impeachment by evidence of conviction of crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">(a) Generally. For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from the witness or established by public record during examination of the witness, but only if (1) the crime was an infamous crime or other crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility and (2) the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or the objecting party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">(b) Time limit.

Charged with first degree murder and related offenses, Thanos was advised by his counsel that, if he elected to testify, he would be subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor, who \u201ccould inquire into any prior convictions\u201d that Thanos had. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 81, 90, 622 A.2d 727 (emphasis in original). Thanos subsequently waived his right to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 90, 622 A.2d 727. After he was convicted, Thanos contended on appeal that, because \u201che had several prior convictions which, for various reasons, were not admissible for impeachment purposes,\u201d his counsel\u2019s \u201cadvice was incorrect[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 90, 622 A.2d 727. Moreover, claiming that he relied on that \u201cincorrect advice,\u201d Thanos argued that \u201che did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to testify[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 622 A.2d 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Affirming Thanos\u2019s convictions, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">In <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>320 Md. 637, 579 A.2d 744 (1990), <em>[cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1110, 111 S.Ct. 1024, 112 L.Ed.2d 1106 (1991),] we reaffirmed a long-standing rule that criminal defendants represented by counsel are presumed to have been informed of their constitutional rights, including the right to testify. Thus, trial judges have no affirmative duty to inform represented defendants of their right to testify except \u201cwhere it becomes clear to the trial court that the defendant does not understand the significance of his election not to testify or the inferences to be drawn therefrom. ...\u201d <em>[Id.] </em>at 652-53, 579 A.2d 744. We held further that an ambiguity in an on-the-record colloquy between the defendant and his counsel concerning the right to testify will not necessarily undermine a knowing and intelligent waiver of that right:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">Where there is no indication that the defendant has a misperception of his right to remain silent and the effect of exercising that right, and where he expressly indicates [that] he has been fully advised of and understands the right, as well as the effect of a waiver, then an ambiguous statement made by defense counsel during an \u201con the record\u201d explanation does not result in reversible error if the trial court fails to intervene and clarify counsel\u2019s ambiguous statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\"><em>Id., 320 </em>Md. at 656, 579 A.2d 744....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Gilliam </em>controls the instant case. The record gives no hint that counsel\u2019s questionable advice influenced Thanos\u2019s decision not to testify. Before the trial began, Thanos stated on the record that he had no intention to testify. He confirmed to the court at that point that he had discussed with counsel his right to testify and desire to forego that right. Defense counsel subsequently indicated no fewer than three times that the defense would present no evidence. It was only at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case that defense counsel made the ambiguous statement about prior convictions to Thanos in explaining his right to testify; but nothing in Thanos\u2019s responses suggests that counsel\u2019s statement caused him to change his mind about testifying, for the record clearly reflects that he had already decided not to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">Here, Thanos was represented by competent counsel whose ambiguous statement as to prior convictions did not affect Thanos\u2019s choice not to testify. Under our decision in <em>Gilliam, </em>the trial court did not err in failing to intervene and correct counsel\u2019s statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 91-92, 622 A.2d 727 (citations omitted). <em>See Oken, supra, </em>327 Md. at 641, 612 A.2d 258 (affirming Oken\u2019s waiver of his right to testify where there was \u201cno clear indication that the ... court\u2019s advice regarding Oken\u2019s right to testify had any influence on his decision not to testify\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\"><em>Tilghman, </em>117 Md.App. 542, 701 A.2d 847, also provides guidance. There, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked: \u201cDo you understand if the States Attorneys [sic] cross exams [sic] you here, and if it\u2019s indicated to me that you have a prior conviction that he will ask you about those convictions?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550, 701 A.2d 847. On appeal, the defendant argued that this advice was misleading because it implied that all prior convictions could be used to impeach his credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 551-52, 701 A.2d 847. We held that a trial court has no duty to intervene when a defense attorney provides advice to a client about the risk of impeachment unless the advice is \u201cintrinsical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ly and facially incorrect,\u201d which, the Court ruled, Tilghman\u2019s attorney\u2019s advice was not. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 701 A.2d 847. We said, <em>id. </em>at 564-65, 701 A.2d 847:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">In this case, counsel\u2019s advice was not inherently, overtly, and facially erroneous. Her admonition that appellant\u2019s prior convictions could be used to impeach him was not framed as an incorrect proposition of law that could be readily identified as such by the court. Nor did counsel provide appellant with specific advice that was incorrect on its face.[ ] Although counsel\u2019s advice was specific to appellant and to his circumstance, its legal accuracy depended upon, and could not be ascertained fully without knowledge of, appellant\u2019s criminal record. To the trial judge, who did not know, and had no reason to know, the nature of appellant\u2019s prior convictions, or even if he had any convictions, counsel\u2019s advice would not have appeared to be incorrect. Given that counsel\u2019s advice was not erroneous <em>per se, </em>the presumption of proper advice remained in force, and the trial court did not err.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We reach a similar conclusion here. Before advising appellant on the record regarding his rights to testify and not to testify, defense counsel stated that he had discussed both rights with appellant off the record. Moreover, appellant told the court twice before defense counsel\u2019s advisement, and once afterwards, that he intended to testify. Because there is no evidence that defense counsel\u2019s advice, even if ambiguous, influenced appellant\u2019s decision to testify, the court did not err in failing to intervene and correct any ambiguity in defense counsel\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The court correctly advised appellant that, if he chose to testify, the State could \u201cask [him] about or bring ... to the jury\u2019s attention\u201d any \u201cimpeachable offenses\u201d included in his \u201ccriminal history.\u201d But, appellant was also told that the State could only mention Gregory\u2019s \u201cimpeachable offenses ... [subject to various restrictions.\u201d Thus, appellant was not told that his <em>entire </em>criminal history could be used for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Moreover, as the State points out, there is no indication that the trial court knew of Gregory\u2019s criminal record or prior impeachable convictions. Nor has appellate counsel revealed what was on Gregory\u2019s criminal record that would not have been admissible for impeachment purposes. As the State explains, \u201cthe legal accuracy of the advice to Gregory\u201d depended upon his criminal record. <em>See Tilghman, </em>117 Md.App. at 565, 701 A.2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Even if Gregory was erroneously advised of his rights, the record is devoid of any evidence showing that Gregory relied on the advice in deciding to testify. Detrimental reliance on the erroneous advice is a necessary element in determining that the defendant did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his constitutional right to remain silent. <em>Morales, </em>325 Md. at 339, 600 A.2d 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\"><em>Morales </em>stands in marked contrast to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Unlike in this case, the appellant in <em>Morales </em>initially told the trial judge that he was going to testify in his own defense, and only changed his mind after the judge erroneously advised him concerning the law of impeachment. <em>Id. </em>at 334, 600 A.2d 851. The Court of Appeals articulated: \u201c... Morales apparently changed his decision to testify based on the trial court\u2019s incorrect implication that all of his prior convictions could be used to impeach him----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339, 600 A.2d 851. Having found a causal relationship between the court\u2019s advice and the change in the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify, the Court of Appeals concluded that Morales\u2019s \u201cdecision to waive his constitutional right to testify\u201d was not knowing, intelligent or voluntary. <em>Id. </em>In our view, the element of a causal relationship (between the trial court\u2019s advice and the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify) was critical to the holding in <em>Morales. See Yoswick v. State, </em>347 Md. 228, 244, 700 A.2d 251 (1997); <em>Oken, </em>327 Md. at 636-42, 612 A.2d 258 (court found no indication that the trial court\u2019s remarks influenced Oken\u2019s decision not to testify in this case; it denied relief under Morales); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 203, 231, 655 A.2d 1311 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Appellant contends that the court erred in allowing him to be impeached with his prior convictions for robbery and theft, because he was on trial for attempted theft. Before addressing this contention, we pause to review additional facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">During cross-examination of appellant, the State asked to approach the bench, where the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I would like to inquire of [appellant] whether he was convicted of robbery in Delaware in 1998. Convicted of [misdemeanor] theft in Delaware also in 1998---- Georgetown, Sussex County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">THE COURT: What year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: [19]98. So we\u2019re within [fifteen] years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">THE COURT: It\u2019s within the [fifteen] years, it\u2019s an infamous crime, it certainly bears on credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">What do you want to tell me, [defense counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APi\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, the rule says for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness the State can bring these up only if the Court determines that the probative value of admitting the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-11\">Now, my issue with this is with regard to attacking his credibility. Is the State attempting to prove by admission of these prior offenses that [appellant] is not, in fact, God because that\u2019s what he\u2019s testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-12\">THE COURT: Well, it can bear on other matters of credibility, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-14\">But, I mean, the Court has heard the discourse of [appellant] and for the State to come up and say, oh, I\u2019m going to attack his credibility to me is an absurdity. The prejudice would clearly outweigh the probative value of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-15\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Well, he has denied saying he was going to take the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>THE COURT: I find the probative value of any such testimony outweighs [the] danger of any unfair prejudice on [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">After the parties returned to their tables, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: [Appellant], isn\u2019t it true in 1998 in Sussex County you were convicted of robbery second degree?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">[APPELLANT]: In 1998 I did take a plea to a robbery second degree charge and one theft charge in a plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Theft under, you were convicted of that at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">[APPELLANT]: Taking a plea you are pleading guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Because \u201cthe admission of [his] prior convictions was far more prejudicial tha[n] probative[,]\u201d argues appellant, the court abused its discretion in allowing him to be impeached with the convictions. <em>See </em>Rule 5-609(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he only purpose of admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s prior convictions[,]\u201d he claims, \u201cwas to paint the picture for the jury that appellant was a bad person and since he did it before, he was more likely to have committed this crime.\u201d <em>See Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 703, 436 A.2d 906 (1981) (\u201cThe danger in admitting prior convictions as evidence to impeach [a] defendant ... [w]here the crime for which the defendant is on trial is identical or similar to the crime for which he has been previously convicted [is that] the jury may conclude that because he did it <em>before </em>he most likely has done it <em>again.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original)). <em>Accord State v. Westpoint, </em>404 Md. 455, 479, 947 A.2d 519 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The State counters that \u201c[t]he record demonstrates that the ... court properly applied the appropriate balancing test and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>made specific findings regarding the probative value versus the prejudicial effect of the prior convictions.\u201d <em>See Facon v. State, </em>144 Md.App. 1, 47, 796 A.2d 101 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>375 Md. 435, 825 A.2d 1096 (2003). According to the State, \u201cthe prior convictions possessed high impeachment value\u201d and appellant\u2019s \u201ctestimony and the centrality of his credibility ... weighed heavily in favor of admitting the prior convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In <em>Fac\u00f3n, </em>we reviewed the law governing the admission of prior convictions for impeachment purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">Maryland Rule 5-609 ... essentially creates a three-part test for admissibility [of prior convictions for impeachment purposes]. First, the conviction must be within the \u201celigible universe\u201d of convictions that may be used to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-609(a). Second, the conviction must not be more than fifteen years old, reversed on appeal, or the subject of a pardon or a pending appeal. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-609(b), (c). Third, the trial court must weigh the probative value of admitting the conviction against the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-609(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">In resolving impeachment questions concerning prior convictions, courts consider several factors when weighing the probative value of a past conviction against its prejudicial effect. These include: (1) the impeachment value of the prior crime; (2) the point in time of the conviction and defendant\u2019s subsequent history; (3) the similarity between the past crime and the charged crime; (4) the importance of the defendant\u2019s testimony; and (5) the centrality of the defendant\u2019s credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\"><em>Facon, supra, </em>144 Md.App. at 47, 796 A.2d 101 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Notably, we said in <em>Fac\u00f3n, id. </em>(citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">... To be sure, the similarity of ... prior convictions and [a] charged offense weights] against admissibility. But, prior convictions that are similar to the crime for which the accused is on trial are not automatically excluded under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Rule 5-609. Indeed, whether the prior convictions are similar to the charges for which an accused is on trial is only one consideration in the balancing process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Here, the State sought to impeach appellant with his Delaware convictions for second degree robbery and misdemeanor theft.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These convictions may be used to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 269-70, 619 A.2d 105 (1993) (a prior conviction of theft is \u201cadmissible <em>per se </em>for impeachment purposes\u201d (italics added)); <em>Passamichali v. State, </em>81 Md.App. 731, 736, 569 A.2d 733 (a prior conviction of robbery is <em>\u201cper se </em>admissible for impeachment purposes\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>319 Md. 484, 573 A.2d 808 (1990). Moreover, appellant\u2019s convictions occurred in 1998, well within the fifteen-year limit established by Rule 5-609. Although appellant\u2019s prior theft conviction is similar to the crimes charged in this case, the similarity is \u201conly one consideration in [our] balancing process.\u201d <em>Facon, supra, </em>144 Md.App. at 47, 796 A.2d 101. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s prior robbery conviction is not similar to the charges of which he was convicted here. Given that appellant testified that a \u201cvoice\u201d authorized him to take Huffman\u2019s Hummer, his credibility was central to his defense. Because four of the five factors enunciated in <em>Falcon </em>weighed in favor of the admissibility of appellant\u2019s prior robbery conviction, and three factors weighed in favor of the admissibility of appellant\u2019s prior theft conviction, the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to impeach appellant with the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Next, appellant complains that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury on mistake of fact. We turn to review facts pertinent to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">At the close of evidence, defense counsel asked the court to propound the following jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">You have heard evidence that [appellant\u2019s] actions were based on a mistake of fact. Mistake of fact is a defense and you are required to find [appellant] not guilty if all [of] the following three factors are present: one, [appellant] actually believed he was God; two, [appellant\u2019s] belief and actions were reasonable under the circumstances; three, [appellant] did not intend to commit the crime of attempted theft or attempted taking of a motor vehicle and [appellant\u2019s] conduct would not have amounted to these crimes if the mistaken belief had been correct, meaning if the true facts were what [appellant] thought them to be, [appellant\u2019s] conduct would not have been criminal. In order to convict [appellant,] the State must show that the mistake of fact defense does not apply in this case by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of the three factors previously stated was absent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The court declined to give the instruction. After appellant \u201cexcept[ed] to the Court\u2019s refusal,\u201d the court responded: \u201cI don\u2019t see any applicability of that instruction to this particular case. So your exception is noted. It\u2019s denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">According to appellant, \u201cthe proposed instruction ... was clearly a correct statement of the law[,] clearly generated by the testimony[,] and ... not fairly covered by any instruction actually given.\u201d Therefore, he contends: \u201cIt was ... error for the ... court not to instruct the jury on mistake of fact.\u201d The State concedes that appellant\u2019s requested instruction correctly stated the applicable law and was not fairly covered in the court\u2019s other instructions. But, it maintains that appellant\u2019s \u201calleged mistake would not be a defense to the ... crimes charged,\u201d and therefore the \u201cmistake of fact [instruction] was not generated[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>'In <em>General v. State, </em>367 Md. 475, 789 A.2d 102 (2002), the Court of Appeals reviewed the defense of \u201cmistake of fact.\u201d It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">As a general rule, mistake of fact is a recognized common law defense to certain crimes. Mistake or ignorance of fact exists when the actor does not know what the actual facts are or believes them to be other than as they are. In essence, a mistake of fact is a defense when it negates the existence of the mental state essential to the crime charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">Whether a[n] instruction [on mistake of fact] must be given depends upon whether there is any evidence in the case that supports the instruction; if the requested instruction has not been generated by the evidence, the trial court is not required to give it. Whether the evidence is sufficient to generate the requested instruction in the first instance is a question of law for the judge. In evaluating whether competent evidence exists to generate the requested instruction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 486-87, 789 A.2d 102 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Here, appellant contends that the court was required to give a mistake of fact instruction because, at the time of the events that led to the charges in this case, he mistakenly believed that he was God. This belief, however, did not negate the willfulness of his actions or his intent to deprive Huffman of the Hummer. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2002, 2009 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 7-104(a) and 7-105(b) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, appellant testified that, knowing that he did not own the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Hummer, he willfully and knowingly entered it with the intent to \u201cget\u201d it from Huffman and her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Because appellant acted willfully and knowingly, his mistaken belief that he was God was not a defense to the crimes of which he was charged, and was insufficient to generate his requested mistake of fact instruction. The court did not err in declining to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Appellant contends that, because \u201cno evidence was presented that established that [he] was attempting to willfully or knowingly remove the Hummer from the possession of ...

The State counters that \u201cthe evidence presented was more than sufficient\u201d to sustain the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The standard for appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency in a criminal case is well settled. We must determine whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v.

In essence, he complains because the advisement suggested that his entire criminal record could be used to impeach him, even though only certain convictions qualified under Rule 5-609. Nevertheless, believing that his whole record was fair game, he elected to testify, without realizing that only certain convictions could be used to impeach him. Even assuming any error in the advisement, if appellant chose to testify under the belief that he was subject to more impeachment than the court ultimately permitted, it is not clear how he was harmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\">.
