EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Ronald B., Britny C., and Lavar D., appellants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were charged in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, in separately filed delinquency petitions, with assault and related offenses, arising out of an altercation between appellants and the victims, Sarah Kreager and Troy Ennis, on a Mass Transit Administration (\u201cMTA\u201d) bus on the afternoon of December 4, 2007. After proceedings, the circuit court, sitting as a juvenile court, found each appellant involved as to charges of assault in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the first degree, assault in the second degree, conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree, disorderly conduct, and reckless endangerment. Appellants were acquitted of several other charges. Subsequently, the court placed each appellant under the control of the Department of Juvenile Services for community-based placement and other rehabilitative services, and also required each appellant to complete fifty hours of community service. On May 19, 2008, Lavar D. and Britny C. noted appeals. On May 23, 2008, Ronald B. noted an appeal. On September 11, 2008, we consolidated the cases for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In this Court, appellants raise several questions for our consideration. They are, as phrased by appellants, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">1. Where appellants were charged with assault and related offenses and the judge, sitting as fact-finder, recognized that self-defense \u201chas been raised in this case,\u201d did the judge impermissibly shift the burden of proof when he stated that \u201cthe burden of proving self defense rest[s] upon the person accused of the assault\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">2. Where defense counsel proffered that the alleged victim had testified in the disposition hearing of a co-respondent, held before the same judge sitting as fact-finder in the present case, that her children were not in custody solely because of this incident, did the court err in prohibiting defense counsel from cross-examining the victim as to whether she had a pending charge for distribution of narcotics, where the alleged sale of drugs occurred in the presence of her three children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">3. Is the evidence sufficient to establish that each appellant is a delinquent child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">4. Where the interrogating officer urged Mr. B. to \u201c[hjhelp [sic] yourself\u2019 before \u201cfour [other respondents] tell me exactly what happened and exactly what you did\u201d and emphasized that \u201c[a]fter now is too late\u201d did the lower court err in finding that the resulting custodial statement was not the product of police inducement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">5. [Appellants\u2019 argument # 5 was withdrawn].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>6. Did the lower court err in precluding cross-examination of Mr. Ennis concerning past domestic violence of Ms. Kreager?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">7. Did the lower court err in allowing the State to introduce statements by co-respondents with blank and omitted passages containing redacted statements implicating the other respondents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">8. Did the lower court err in prohibiting the accused from refreshing one victim\u2019s recollection of whether he had made prior false statements to the police when it ruled that \u201cyou can\u2019t use a document he didn\u2019t prepare to refresh his recollection\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">We shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">On January 31, 2008, the first day of pretrial motions hearings, appellants moved for suppression of their statements to MTA police, arguing that the statements were coerced. When the State attempted to play the taped statements for the court, counsel for Nakita M. argued that \u201cif the State is going to play the one part,\u201d as to the voluntariness of the statement, \u201cI would ask that the State play both parts or the whole thing.\u201d Subsequently, the following colloquy ensued, in pertinent part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">THE STATE: Your Honor, the State\u2019s intent is to, there are certain portions that the State does not believe are admissible and the State, it\u2019s planning to stop at those points. Counsel does have a copy of a transcript that indicates those stoppage points. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what counsel\u2019s referring to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">THE COURT: Could you help me out, [counsel for Nakita M.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">COUNSEL FOR NAKITA M.: Yes, I can, Your Honor. If the State intends to play one part, the State should play every part of the tape. But at this point, Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>THE COURT: Well, but the only thing that\u2019s relevant at this time is whether or not, you raised an objection, I believe, to the voluntariness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">COUNSEL FOR NAKITA M.: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">THE COURT: So that\u2019s, that\u2019s what\u2019s relevant. So the\u2014 what\u2019s germane to this hearing is the part of the tape that goes to the issue of whether or not your client\u2019s statements were freely and voluntarily given so that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">COUNSEL FOR NAKITA M.: Well, at this point, Your Honor, if the State is picking and choosing what they choose to let the [cjourt hear,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">THE COURT: Well, unless, if I decide [counsel for Nakita M.] that it\u2019s not freely and voluntarily given, none of it comes in. If I, so for me to watch the whole tape means the cat\u2019s out of the bag, doesn\u2019t it? So the part you all don\u2019t want me to see I\u2019ve then seen. What\u2019s at issue here is whether or not this statement is freely and voluntarily given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">(Whereupon, counsel approached the bench and the following ensued:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">THE COURT: See, I thought it [sic] I can see the whole thing if this were a jury trial. But I\u2019m the trier of fact so once I see it, you know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">COUNSEL FOR LAVAR D.: But, Your Honor, this is the same issue I was discussing in the office. They cannot redact <em>Bruton</em><footnotemark><em>[2]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>on their own. The solution in this kind of case is to sever these trials so that if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-14\">THE COURT: This isn\u2019t <em>Bruton. </em>Only, this is a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A71\">COUNSEL FOR LAVAR D.: It is <em>Bruton.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-15\">COUNSEL FOR NAKITA M.: It is <em>Bruton, </em>Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>THE COURT: [Counsel for Lavar D.], see this? I\u2019ve determined this isn\u2019t a <em>Bruton </em>situation----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The State then again attempted to play the tape, and offered to the court what was marked for identification as State\u2019s Exhibit # 2, a copy of a transcript of the tape-recorded interview, prepared by the State, with redactions. Counsel for Lavar D. objected, and the following transpired.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">COUNSEL FOR LAVAR D.: This is the [cjourt redacting <em>Bruton </em>issues and it is not appropriate. I mean the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. The State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office is not a licensed, certified transcription. We don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve transcribed out any exculpatory evidence. This is not a solution to get rid of the <em>Bruton </em>issues which are the implication by certain respondents of other respondents. It is not appropriate. I suggested it at the arraignment. I have suggested it at every single hearing since because severance of the trials is the remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">THE COURT: [Counsel for Lavar D.], and you didn\u2019t get severance of trials, okay? So that horse is dead. Subject to the motion. Thank you. Continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">COUNSEL FOR NAKITA M.: ... [W]hat the State has requested be introduced was transcribed by a person in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. I would ask that it not be introduced into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">* * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">THE COURT: I haven\u2019t looked at the transcript----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">(Whereupon, a taped interview was played for the [c]ourt.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">During the playing of the tape, counsel again objected to the State\u2019s starting and stopping of the tape, and the following transpired, in pertinent part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-13\">COUNSEL FOR LAVAR D.: [Tjhis is [the State\u2019s] version of the tape. And that\u2019s where they\u2019re stopping and start<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ing---- The evidence is the tape in its entirety. The evidence, if it has <em>Bruton </em>issues, should have been severed. The State doesn\u2019t get to come in here and stop and start like this. Just like everyone said and then put it down on what they\u2019re claiming is some sort of official transcript which they typed up in their office based on their version of things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">THE COURT: But didn\u2019t you get [the State\u2019s redactions]? COUNSEL FOR NAKITA M.: I got it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">Hi Hs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">COUNSEL FOR NAKITA M.: ... [B]ut in redacting it for the purpose of the motion ... why stop it and start it, stop it and start it. You\u2019re talking about voluntariness, stop it and start it. Who\u2019s to say that one of the parts that you missed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">THE COURT: Oh, I thought the only part, when you said play the whole thing I then said play the whole thing with the exception of the part that they said they could redact which incriminates other people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">\u2756 H\u00ab *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">THE COURT: I mean, well not redact but skip over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-13\">\u2756 H:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-14\">THE STATE: I presented to counsel each of the set of statements. I told them that they had been redacted by <em>Bruton.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-15\">H&lt; Hi Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-16\">COUNSEL FOR LAVAR D.: I don\u2019t want their version of events. I want the tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-17\">THE COURT: But you got the tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-18\">Hi \u2756 Ht</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-19\">THE COURT: But when you\u2019ve got the tape, you can do your own version.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-20\">COUNSEL FOR LAVAR D.: Then I want my whole tape played, every single bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>THE COURT: Then when we come to your tape. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">COUNSEL FOR SHAMIRA B.: Your Honor, I just want to note, if I may, the continuing objection to the stopping and starting and the redaction of the tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Over continuous objections, the taped interview was played, with the State skipping portions of it. At some point, counsel for Shamira B. objected again on the basis that \u201c[tjhere were so many people [in Nakita M.\u2019s tape-recorded statement] about corespondents.... \u201d Subsequently, a bench conference was held, and the following transpired, in relevant part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">COUNSEL FOR SHAMIRA B.: Your Honor, the statement I\u2019m objecting to----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">COUNSEL FOR SHAMIRA B.: \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d in response to a question \u201cwho kicked the young lady.\u201d That was played in open court. Your Honor heard it. I object to it on grounds of <em>Bruton </em>and I move for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">THE COURT: Yeah, but it doesn\u2019t identify anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">THE COURT: How\u2019s that <em>Bruton </em>if it doesn\u2019t identify anyone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-12\">COUNSEL FOR SHAMIRA B.: Your Honor, we\u2019re in a corespondent case. She\u2019s talking], she\u2019s giving direct testimony about other people involved in the assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-13\">THE COURT: But she doesn\u2019t identify anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-15\">COUNSEL FOR SHAMIRA B.: Your Honor, think the [e]ourt can reasonably infer in a co-respondent case like this\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-16\">THE COURT: No,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-17\">COUNSEL FOR LAVAR D.: There were 35, 40 people on the bus\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>THE COURT: As a matter of fact, I\u2019ve done cases involving barroom brawls, counsel, where there\u2019s a hundred people fighting. That doesn\u2019t say anything. That\u2019s not <em>Bruton.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Counsel for several of the other appellants also noted continuing objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">After appellants\u2019 objections were overruled, the State attempted to continue playing the tape; however, counsel for Shamira B. again objected stating that \u201c[w]hen they refer to other co-respondents to the extent that it corroborates what witness testimony against the co-respondent is a <em>Bruton </em>issue\u2014.\u201d The court again noted the continuing objections, and denied Shamira B.\u2019s motion. Nevertheless, as the tape was played again, counsel for Shamira B. again objected, and the following ensued.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">COUNSEL FOR SHAMIRA B.: Early in the interview [of Nakita M.], Detective Fleming asks Ms. M. about her and the other people who are being detained\u2019s involvement, in this particular line at the end of the tape\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">COUNSEL FOR SHAMIRA B.:\u2014Detective Fleming states \u201cwhy didn\u2019t ya\u2019ll, why didn\u2019t anybody beat him up?\u201d [Nakita M.] testified on the tape, it was just played in open court, they did beat him up. It doesn\u2019t get any more incriminating than that, Your Honor. It doesn\u2019t get any more prejudicial. I raise the same objection\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">COUNSEL FOR SHAMIRA B.:\u2014and move for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">THE COURT: And it\u2019s noted. It still doesn\u2019t identify anybody. It doesn\u2019t say who \u201cthey\u201d are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-13\">COUNSEL FOR SHAMIRA B.: Your Honor, earlier in the tape, they\u2019re talking about Ms. M. and the other people that are detained in the same building. My point is that the [cjourt can make a reasonable inference, the trier of fact can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>make a reasonable inference from that that Detective Fleming is referring to the other people being detained\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">THE STATE: I don\u2019t think that this is a <em>Bruton </em>issue. I think that what is said is so general, there\u2019s a Southern expression of \u201cyou all\u201d and I think that, in an abundance of caution I tried to take everything out that\u2019s <em>Bruton </em>related. I do not think this is <em>Bruton </em>material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think it is either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know who it relates to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">On February 4, 2008, during a continuation of the pretrial motions hearing, after more discussion with respect to the tape-recorded statements, the court ordered that the recordings be transcribed and certified by a court reporter. The State then asked the court to have appellants\u2019 counsel review the tape-recordings and transcripts for Bruton issues, so that any problems in that regard could be resolved before trial. The court responded that counsel should resolve <em>Bruton </em>issues, and \u201c[m]ake sure they\u2019re appropriately redacted to [appellants\u2019 counsel\u2019s] satisfaction, for your client----\u201d Counsel for one of the appellants responded that \u201c[t]hey shouldn\u2019t be redacted ...,\u201d and the following transpired.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">THE STATE: [T]hey claim they shouldn\u2019t be redacted, and I disagree. That they are redacted for <em>Bruton </em>purposes. They can\u2019t claim that they shouldn\u2019t be redacted for <em>Bruton </em>and then come back on appeal and say, well, the [c]ourt\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKv\">THE COURT: I agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">THE STATE:\u2014was prejudice[d], because they weren\u2019t redacted. [Counsel for Lavar D.] has been saying, well, the State can\u2019t redact for <em>Bruton. </em>Well, the State can redact for <em>Bruton, </em>it must redact for <em>Bruton, </em>and that\u2019s what the Supreme Court has said that it is. I have given them copies [of the transcripts]. I have asked for their cooperation, Your Honor, and I\u2019m not getting it to the degree as to what\u2019s <em>Bruton </em>or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>THE COURT: (indiscernible) see\u2014here's\u2014yeah. You all, whatever you all get should be everything. You all, whatever you all get should be everything. What the [c]ourt gets should not be everything. So they should redact, so that I\u2019m not\u2014your clients aren\u2019t implicated by what\u2019s in a statement of somebody else. That\u2019s the <em>Bruton </em>redact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">On February 7, 2008, during a further continuation of the pretrial motions\u2019 hearing, the court verified that counsel had done the <em>\u201cBruton </em>redactions,\u201d and verified that the \u201credactions are both satisfactory to the State and the Defense____\u201d Both the State and counsel for each appellant responded in the affirmative, the agreed upon transcripts of the tape-recordings were received by the court, and several of the tape-recordings were played for the court. Of particular relevance is a portion of the December 4, 2007 statement of Ronald B. during an interview by an MTA detective, Detective Sergeant Kenneth Combs, which follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">SGT. COMBS: You understand something. It\u2019s on video and there\u2019s witnesses. And then you go to court lying to me about what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">[RONALD B.]: I don\u2019t know (INAUDIBLE)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">SGT. COMBS: Help yourself cause I guarantee you out of that group out there, nine people, four of them are going to tell me exactly what happened and exactly what you did then what are you going to do? Eighteen years I been doing this job. I know what I\u2019m doing so now you can tell me the truth or we can put down what you just told me and we can go to court and say, not only did he lie[ ] about it and has no remorse over what he did at all. You understand what I\u2019m saying? So what\u2019s the judge going to do at that point? He did it. I see he did it. I\u2019ve got witnesses that say he did it and he going to sit there and lie about it and basically don\u2019t care that he did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">[RONALD BJ: (Inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>SGT. COMBS: Well then explain it to me. If these people did something to make you do this then you\u2019ve got to explain that to me right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">[RONALD B.]: Yeah, they was (INAUDIBLE)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">SGT. COMBS: After now is too late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">[RONALD BJ: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">SGT. COMBS: After now is going to be too late. So they were trying to do what? They tried to hit you, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKt\">[RONALD BJ: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">SGT. COMBS: And then what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">[RONALD BJ: I hit them back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">SGT. COMBS: You hit them back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">[RONALD BJ: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">SGT. COMBS: Who did you hit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">[RONALD BJ: I think ... I hit the girl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-15\">SGT. COMBS: You hit the girl, okay. [Y]ou kick her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASU\">[RONALD B.]: I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-16\">SGT. COMBS: There was a whole group around you that started stomping on her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-17\">[RONALD BJ: It was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-18\">SGT. COMBS: Yes. And you were in that group, correct? [RONALD BJ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-19\">SGT. COMBS: Yes. So you kicked her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-20\">[RONALD BJ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-21\">SGT.

COMBS: You just kicked her when she was being held down outside the bus, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-26\">[RONALD BJ: Ah huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-27\">SGT. COMBS: Okay. Who else kicked her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-28\">[RONALD B.]: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>* <em>* </em>\u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">SGT. COMBS: How many times did you kick her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHu\">[RONALD B.]: Once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">On February 13, 2008, during a further continuation of the pretrial motions\u2019 hearing, counsel for Ronald B. argued that Ronald B.\u2019s statement to police, as replicated above, should be suppressed as it was a product of police inducement. Counsel argued that the inducement was that \u201cRonald [B.] needs to confess before the other kids confess\u201d; that he needed to \u201cconfess now\u2014confess now before the other kids confess \u2018cause\u2014and\u2014because once the other kids confess I can\u2019t help you.\u201d The court denied Ronald B.\u2019s motion to suppress, stating the following.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">THE COURT: There\u2019s another ... argument that was made that the [cjourt will address and that is, that somehow ... Sgt. Combs, tricked or otherwise induced the respondent into making a statement by saying that he needed to help himself. In <em>In Re Lucas F, </em>as well as <em>Tobert versus State, </em>free and voluntariness is impacted on by whether or not the statement was extracted by threats or threats of violence, whether or not it was obtained by indirect or implied promises, or whether or not there was some exertion of improper influence. The [cjourt is not satisfied that any of that\u2019s been shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The court also denied motions to suppress, on constitutional grounds, the statements of Shamira B., Wesley B., Lavar D., and Nakita M. The court granted Britny C.\u2019s motion to suppress her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">On March 3, 2008, the adjudicatory proceedings began. The State called Sarah Kreager as its first witness. On direct-examination, Ms. Kreager testified as follows, in relevant part.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">On the afternoon of December 4, 2007, at approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>3:00 p.m., she and her \u201chusband\u2014boyfriend,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Troy Ennis, were at Chestnut Pharmacy in Hampden filling a prescription for Xanax for Ms. Kreager. Ms. Kreager also takes Paxil for anxiety and is on the \u201cMethadone program\u201d for an addiction to prescription painkillers. At the time, Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis, who had three children together, were living in a shelter because Mr. Ennis had lost his job. The children were not staying in the shelter, but were living with Ms. Kreager\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">After leaving the pharmacy, Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis decided to wait for the bus because it was a very cold day. She and Mr. Ennis, who was also on the \u201cMethadone program,\u201d had to go get his medication after leaving the pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">When the bus arrived, Ms. Kreager and Mr.- Ennis got on, using their \u201cday pass.\u201d Ms. Kreager greeted the bus driver, and then turned to look for a seat to sit in. Ms. Kreager stated that the bus was very crowded and she noticed that there were a lot of students on the bus, so she proceeded to the back of the bus where there were two vacant seats together so that both she and Mr. Ennis could sit down. As Ms. Kreager sat down, Mr. Ennis told her that he would rather stand, as they did not have that far to go. Mr. Ennis also had a duffel bag with him, which he did not want to leave in the aisle because it may have \u201cgotten in the ... way for people to get through.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">According to Ms. Kreager, the bus was loud and \u201cstudents were laughing and carrying on,\u201d which was \u201cthe norm, when you would get on the bus at that time with students____\u201d When Ms. Kreager sat down, she \u201cheard a voice from behind [her] and it said: This\u2014that\u2019s my home girl\u2019s seat.\u201d Ms. Kreager turned to look and saw a girl whom she later identified as Nakita M. The girl told Ms. Kreager that she \u201cneeded to move.\u201d Ms. Kreager glanced around\u2014thinking that she may possibly have taken someone\u2019s seat\u2014to see if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>perhaps there was someone standing whom she had not noticed before. Ms. Kreager did not see anyone standing or waiting for the seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">When Ms. Kreager realized that no one was waiting for the seat, she became confused, and she \u201calmost was not sure if [Nakita M.] was even talking to [her], although she was looking dead at [her].\u201d Ms. Kreager stated that she did not respond, but rather \u201ckind of, shook [her] head as to not understanding and just turned around.\u201d As she did so, she heard giggling behind her, but she just \u201cignored it as children, juvenile.\u201d At that point, Ms. Kreager heard someone say, \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want to move, we\u2019ll move that bitch.\u201d When Ms. Kreager heard that, she became alarmed because of the \u201ctone of voice\u201d and because of \u201cthe fact that something could be taken so serious [sic] to even call [her] that name.\u201d At that point, Ms. Kreager decided to go stand with Mr. Ennis, who was standing \u201cdown the steps right near the back ... door\u201d of the bus. When she reached Mr. Ennis, she told him \u201cI believe these girls are trying to start something with me.\u201d Ms. Kreager said that she spoke in Mr. Ennis\u2019 ear because the \u201cbus was kind of loud.\u201d Mr. Ennis responded to her, \u201cWell, come up here with me. You know how kids are these days. Hayley<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> has more manners than they do.\u201d At that point, Nakita M. stood up, and in a raised voice, asked Mr. Ennis what he had said. Nakita M. turned to the back of the bus and said, \u201clook, she has a little boyfriend with her,\u201d and \u201c[y]ou white motherfuckers think you own shit. This is our bus.\u201d Ms. Kreager realized the situation was escalating, so she tried to dissolve it by saying, \u201cLook, you can have the seat. It\u2019s not a big deal. Have the seat.\u201d Nakita M. did not sit down, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">After that exchange, Ms. Kreager turned to Mr. Ennis because she wanted to tell him that she wanted to get off at the next stop, but as she went to face Mr. Ennis, Nakita M. swung at her, struck her in the face, and pulled her hair. Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Kreager stumbled backwards and her body twisted around, and Nakita M. was still trying to pull her by her hair. Ms. Kreager became nervous, and could hear uproar, noise, and commotion \u201ccoming from everywhere.\u201d She could hear someone yelling \u201c[s]top\u201d from the front of the bus. Nakita M. still had her by her hair, and another female came over and grabbed her by her hair as well. Both girls tried to pull Ms. Kreager by her hair into \u201cthat crowd that was beginning to get ... very anxious or excited; aggressive.\u201d At that point, Ms. Kreager felt someone grab her jacket and tug, and she realized that it was Mr. Ennis trying to pull her back. Mr. Ennis threw Ms. Kreager, who was on the ground on all fours, behind him. The crowd of students then began to \u201ccharge Mr. Ennis,\u201d and Ms. Kreager saw someone try to kick him in his face. Mr. Ennis began yelling to the bus driver to open the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">When the bus door opened, Ms. Kreager crawled out \u201con all fours,\u201d and Mr. Ennis kicked the duffel bag out and told her to grab her purse. Once outside the bus, Mr. Ennis helped Ms. Kreager to her feet. Ms. Kreager stated that she \u201chad chunks of hair falling out,\u201d and that she \u201cwas pulling [her] hair, trying to put [her] hair back up.\u201d Ms. Kreager was expecting the bus to pull away, but instead, she saw the group of kids moving towards the front of the bus. Mr. Ennis attempted to hold the bus doors closed, but there were students pushing through the door. The students were climbing over a bus passenger in a wheelchair to get to the front of the bus. After the bus doors \u201cburst out,\u201d a large group of 20 to 30 students got off the bus and a group of approximately 7 to 12 of them \u201cbegan circling\u201d her. Ms. Kreager did not know where Mr. Ennis was at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">At some point, Ms. Kreager was facing Nakita M., and Nakita M. had \u201csome sort of weapon in her hand.\u201d Ms. Kreager thought it was a nail file. Nakita M. kept asking Ms. Kreager, \u201cwhat\u2019s good? What\u2019s good?\u201d Ms. Kreager was becoming nervous and realized that she was going to be attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Ms. Kreager testified that she was struck in the back of her head, and as she turned around, saw that it was a male who had struck her with a closed fist. She was then \u201ccharged\u201d and \u201ctackled\u201d by Nakita M. and another female. Ms. Kreager fell to the ground and felt someone, whom she believed to be the male that had struck her in her head, on her side. Ms. Kreager stated that she ended up on the ground in the gutter with her hands covering her face and her body \u201ctuck[ed] into a ball,\u201d \u201ctrying to block the punches and the kicks that were coming around\u201d her. She then felt a piercing in her head. Ms. Kreager described the attack as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">I felt kicking in my ribs. I felt piercing over and over in my head. I could feels fists, being hit in my head. I could feel kicks in my back, all over my body, over and over and over. There was, you know, no stop, no pause, and they were getting harder and harder. And I felt more and more, which, I felt as though more people were coming over, because I could\u2014at that time\u2014as progressed, you would feel more kicks. You know, as I went up to feeling kicks or hits in my ribs, by the end I was feeling double of that amount. I just felt that there was more people over there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">At that point, I felt someone try to pull my hair\u2014pull me by my hair and lift my head up, and I was trying to fight by keeping my head down and resisting\u2014trying to resist that. I felt someone else grab the other side of my hair and they lifted my hair up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">And, when my hair was lifted up, I looked up. I could see a male with boots on. I want to say, like, a butter colored boot, jeans, green jacket. As I started to look up at him, I heard a female behind me say: Kick that\u2014kick that bitch. And then the male kicked me in my eye, which immediately was excruciating pain. I could feel something almost crack or crunch in my eye, and my eye immediately swelled shut. So, I could not\u2014I could not open my eye. I was almost scared that I may have lost an eye, because I couldn\u2019t see. I just\u2014everything went black\u2014everything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Ms. Kreager believed that the voice she heard saying \u201ckick that bitch\u201d was that of Nakita M. After Ms. Kreager was kicked in her eye, she began yelling \u201cMy eye. Stop, my eye. Please stop.\u201d Ms. Kreager then heard a woman\u2019s voice say, \u201cStop; that is a woman you are hitting. You\u2019re going to kill her, you animals.\u201d Ms. Kreager did not know where the woman came from because she was on the ground; she could only hear her voice. Ms. Kreager also heard the woman, later identified as Joyce King, say that she was going to call the police, at which point the students got off of Ms. Kreager and ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Ms. Kreager stated that there was blood coming from her nose and her eye. Ms. Kreager testified that her eye had \u201cswelled shut\u201d and that it \u201cgave her sharp pains in [her] head and eye, sinus pain immediately.\u201d It also caused her \u201cnose to bleed\u201d and she \u201cwas in a lot of pain____\u201d Ms. King helped Ms. Kreager up, and told her that she had called the police. Mr. Ennis came over to where Ms. Kreager was, and told her that \u201c[t]hey got [him] on the other side of the bus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">When the police arrived, Mr. Ennis and Ms. Kreager pointed out her eye injury, and told the officer that some of the students were still standing on the corner. Other students had apparently kept running.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Ms. Kreager was transported by ambulance to Sinai Hospital. She stated that in addition to her eye injury, she was also \u201cvery sore,\u201d and had \u201capproximately four to five stab wounds in the top of [her] head.... \u201d Ms. Kreager stated that before the attack on the bus, her eye was \u201cnormal,\u201d and she did not have any other injuries on her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Ms. Kreager was at Sinai for about 7 or 8 hours before returning to the shelter. About 2 or 3 hours later, however, she became nauseous and began throwing up blood. The shelter workers called 911 and Ms. Kreager was transported to the emergency room at Johns Hopkins, and subsequently upstairs to the Wilmer Eye Clinic. Ms. Kreager obtained a prescription for an antibiotic and for a painkiller, and was released from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>During cross-examination by counsel for Ronald B., the following transpired, in relevant part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">COUNSEL FOR RONALD B.: Now, Ms.\u2014this\u2014you\u2014 you\u2019ve made a victim impact statement<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> previously, have you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">MS.

Counsel for Wesley B. also asked the court to reconsider its ruling that counsel could not question Ms. Kreager as to the alleged incident on October 18, 2007, arguing that an arrest was probative as to Ms. Kreager\u2019s veracity. The court again refused to allow cross-examination in that regard. Counsel for Nakita M. asked Ms. Kreager whether her eye was \u201cpurple\u201d when she got on the bus that day, to which Ms. Kreager responded that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">On redirect-examination, the State asked Ms. Kreager whether she had a black eye before boarding the bus, and Ms. Kreager responded that she did not. The State also asked Ms. Kreager whether \u201canyone [had] attack[ed][her] or punch[ed][her] before the December 4th attack on the bus,\u201d to which Ms. Kreager responded, \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d On recross-examination, counsel for Wesley B. asked whether \u201cMr. Ennis [had] ever struck [her] prior to December 4th?\u201d The State objected to the question, and the court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Dr. Mahajabin Ali, an emergency room physician at Sinai Hospital, testified to the following, in relevant part.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Dr. Ali attended to Ms. Kreager in the emergency room. After receiving a call from paramedics, Dr. Ali and her staff \u201cprepared to take care of a trauma patient,\u201d as the paramedics had \u201cdesignated that this patient had the potential for serious life threatening injury____\u201d When Dr. Ali first made contact with Ms. Kreager, Ms. Kreager was \u201cextremely anxious and agitated,\u201d and she had a \u201cvery significant injury\u201d to the area surrounding her left eye. Dr. Ali stated that Ms. Kreager\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>eye was \u201cmarkedly swollen and she had great difficulty opening it,\u201d and that there was also \u201cmarked tenderness.\u201d Over the course of a few hours, while Ms. Kreager was in the emergency room, her eye developed increased \u201cechimosis, or bruising----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">According to Dr. Ali, Ms. Kreager stated that \u201cshe had been kicked and punched and, in particular, that no objects had been used.\u201d A CT scan of Ms. Kreager\u2019s face \u201cindicated that she did, indeed, have quite a severe injury to the eye with the potential for loss of vision.\u201d Those injuries included \u201cmultiple orbital fractures,\u201d \u201centrapment of the inferior rectus muscle,\u201d and an \u201cintraocular hemorrhage.\u201d Dr. Ali could not determine by looking at the scan how old the fractures were, and could not determine whether Ms. Kreager\u2019s eye injury was preexisting, or whether it was possibly obtained prior to December 4. Dr. Ali did not find \u201cany physical signs,\u201d however, that \u201cindicated that the injury was older than reported by\u201d Ms. Kreager, and stated that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that the bruising around Ms. Kreager\u2019s eye occurred three days prior. An examination of Ms. Kreager also revealed lacerations on her scalp. No internal injuries were noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Dr. Ali testified that Ms. Kreager was \u201canxious, agitated, and uncooperative,\u201d but that the administration of pain medication caused her to be less so. This was not significant to Dr. Ali, because, according to Dr. Ali, while Ms. Kreager was initially exhibiting \u201cdrug seeking behavior,\u201d after \u201cfurther exam and getting the results of her CT scan [Ms. Kreager] did, in fact, have a painful injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Troy Ennis testified as follows, in pertinent part.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">On December 4th, he and Ms. Kreager boarded the MTA bus after leaving a pharmacy. The bus was \u201crowdy\u201d and \u201cpeople were screaming and yelling.\u201d Mr. Ennis stood by the back of the bus, and Ms. Kreager also went towards the back of the bus. Shortly after they got on the bus, Ms. Kreager came to Mr. Ennis and whispered in his ear, telling him that \u201c[t]hese girls in the back are trying to start with me over a seat.\u201d Mr. Ennis looked to where the girls were sitting and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\u201cthey were looking at [him], like, laughing and smiling....\u201d Mr. Ennis told Ms. Kreager, \u201cMy daughter has more manners than they do.\u201d At that point, a \u201cheavyset girl jumped up and said, like, what the ... hell did you say, or something like that and started screaming in [Ms. Kreager\u2019s] face.\u201d The girl was yelling in Ms. Kreager\u2019s face and another girl, who was wearing glasses, came up behind her. Ms. Kreager turned her head away and the \u201cheavy set girl\u201d took a swing at her. Another girl grabbed Ms. Kreager\u2019s hair and tried to pull her towards the back of the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">While the girls were trying to hit Ms. Kreager, Mr. Ennis grabbed her by her jacket and \u201cthrew her behind\u201d him. At that point, \u201cpretty much the whole front of the bus and the back of the bus, everybody just came towards where\u201d Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis were to \u201ctry to ... bum rush [them].\u201d The crowd began kicking Mr. Ennis while he \u201cballed up\u201d to try to protect himself. Ms. Kreager was still behind him, and he was covering her. Mr. Ennis yelled for the bus driver to let them out, and was able to push open the doors. He grabbed Ms. Kreager, her purse, and his duffel bag, and they got off of the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">After they got off of the bus, Ms. Kreager began pulling the loose hair out of her head, saying that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe what happened over a seat.\u201d Mr. Ennis noticed people running towards the front of the bus, and he ran to the bus doors to try to hold them shut. Ms. Kreager told Mr. Ennis to let go of the doors, and when he did, the doors came open and people came out. Three or four people \u201ccame towards\u201d Mr. Ennis, \u201ctrying to fight\u201d him. They were swinging at him and kicking at him. Somebody tackled Mr. Ennis, and he \u201cballed up\u201d on the ground. There were five or six males trying to kick Mr. Ennis.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">While Mr. Ennis was on the ground, he could see six or seven people \u201cover top\u201d of Ms. Kreager, kicking her. At that point, \u201c[s]ome lady came out of the house yelling,\u201d telling the kids to \u201c[g]et off that girl. That\u2019s a woman you\u2019re beating,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>and stating that she had called the police. Mr. Ennis stated that the kids began running away towards the corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">After the kids ran away, the lady helped Ms. Kreager out of the gutter. Mr. Ennis testified that Ms. Kreager\u2019s \u201ceye was bad,\u201d \u201cher nose was bleeding and she was bleeding from her head.\u201d Soon after, the police arrived and Mr. Ennis told them what had happened. According to Mr. Ennis the inside of the bus was \u201cbeat up,\u201d the \u201cfront of the seats were loose,\u201d and a \u201ccouple of the windows were ... like, flapping.\u201d He stated that the bus did not look that way when he boarded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Mr. Ennis could still see the kids, who were \u201c[j]ust at the next comer,\u201d and he pointed them out to an officer who \u201cgot in his car and went down there.\u201d Shortly thereafter, officers took Mr. Ennis and the bus driver to the location where the kids were to identify the attackers. Out of 15 or 16 kids who the officers had sitting on the ground, Mr. Ennis \u201cpicked the kids out who assaulted [him] or who [he saw] assaulting\u201d Ms. Kreager.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">On cross-examination, counsel for Ronald B. asked Mr. Ennis whether he had ever used the name \u201cTroy Stinson\u201d <footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> before, to which Mr. Ennis responded, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d Counsel then asked Mr. Ennis whether he was \u201cfamiliar with where [he was] on ... October 18, 2007?\u201d During a subsequent bench conference, counsel told the court that he had \u201cinformation\u201d that Mr. Ennis had \u201cidentified himself as Troy Stinson on a previous date,\u201d and that he was attempting to rebut Mr. Ennis\u2019s testimony that he had never used that alias before. After the court told counsel to lay a foundation for the line of questioning he was pursuing, the following ensued.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">COUNSEL FOR RONALD B.: On the date of October 18, 2007 did you have any contact with the Baltimore City Police Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">THE STATE: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-13\">MR.

The court sustained further objections to the same or similar questions about Mr. Ennis\u2019s use of an alias as \u201casked and answered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Joyce King testified as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">On December 4 at approximately 3:00 p.m., she was sitting at her dining room table when she heard a loud noise that caused her to look up. There is a bus stop outside of her dining room window. When Ms. King looked up, she saw a bus that had slammed into the curb and saw the back doors of the bus \u201cfly open, and a girl,\u201d who she later identified as Ms. Kreager, \u201ccome flying out, and a whole bunch of kids came behind her.\u201d Ms. King thought there were approximately 15 to 20 students who got off of the bus behind Ms. Kreager. Ms. King then saw Ms. Kreager down on the ground, and \u201cas she tried to get back up, they all started kicking and punching her. All the children came off the bus ... they just kicked and punched.\u201d According to Ms. King \u201c[e]very body that jumped off [the] bus,\u201d was involved in hitting, punching, and kicking Ms. Kreager. Ms. King jumped out of her chair and ran outside. She saw Ms. Kreager struggling to get to her feet, and then saw her kicked again, \u201cand she went down.\u201d Ms. King started screaming, \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill her. Leave her alone.\u201d Ms. Kreager tried to get up again, but \u201c[e]very-one was around her\u201d and they \u201ckicked her across the rest of the sidewalk into the gutter.\u201d Ms. King did not see Ms. Kreager strike anybody. Ms. King ran over to where Ms. Kreager was and picked her up onto the curb. She then yelled for her daughter to call 911. While she was holding Ms. Kreager, she noticed that the \u201cbus was rocking\u201d violently. She thought that \u201cthere was something going on on the other side of the bus, but [she] couldn\u2019t see that.\u201d Ms. King thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>that there \u201cwas a riot on the bus because it was rocking so hard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">When Ms. King\u2019s daughter came back outside of the house and yelled out that the \u201cpolice are on their way,\u201d the \u201ckids start[ed] running. They got about halfway down the block and stopped. They started running again when the police started showing up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Ms. King testified that there was also a man in a wheelchair, a man on a cell phone, the bus driver, and Mr. Ennis present at the scene. Ms. King stated that when she first came into contact with Ms. Kreager, her eye \u201clooked like it had exploded,\u201d and she was \u201cbleeding from the top of her head.\u201d Ms. King could not identify the children involved, and could not provide a description of them other than that they were \u201cstudents and they were black.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Lieutenant Robert Rosendale, shift commander for the Northern District MTA Police, testified that when he arrived on the scene, Baltimore City officers already had a group of approximately 20 to 25 individuals seated on the ground. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Ennis and the bus driver were at the scene, and Lieutenant Rosendale asked them if they recognized anyone involved in the assault. Mr. Ennis and the bus driver identified nine suspects, six of whom were male. The other individuals were released.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Officer Larry Ball, with the MTA police, testified that when he arrived on the scene, there were six black male juveniles and three black female juveniles being detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Counsel for Lavar D. stipulated that an olive green jacket belonged to Lavar D.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Detective Combs testified that nine individuals were brought to his office as part of the investigation, which he was supervising. Detective Combs learned during the investigation that one of the individuals involved in the incident had been wearing a green coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Detective Combs went to the hospital to interview Ms. Kreager after the incident. At that point, Ms. Kreager\u2019s eye was \u201cswollen shut,\u201d but he did not believe that it was purple. A few days later, Detective Combs saw Ms. Kreager again, and \u201c[a]round her eye was turning purple.\u201d Detective Combs did not note any injuries on any of the individuals who had been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Daniel Williams, the MTA bus driver, testified as follows, in pertinent part.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On December 4, he was driving a \u201cschool run,\u201d meaning he picked up children from Robert Poole Middle School. Prior to making the \u201cschool run,\u201d he conducted a \u201cpre-trip\u201d to make sure \u201call seats [were] normal, the mirrors sufficient---- No dents, no doors broken, anything like that....\u201d Prior to the \u201cschool run\u201d nothing was broken on the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">At approximately 3:00 p.m., Mr. Williams picked up about 43 students from the middle school. At first, \u201cit was a normal school ride.\u201d Subsequently, Mr. Williams picked up three more passengers: a female, a middle-aged male, and an elderly male. Mr. Williams stated that there were three empty seats on the bus, one of which \u201cwas the seat behind the back door where there was one girl kneeled over filing her nails that was taking up two seats.\u201d Mr. Williams described the girl as \u201cbrown skinned\u2014dark skinned, kind of medium hair, hair went almost to her shoulder, kind of heavy set girl.\u201d According to Mr. Williams, the female passenger, who he identified as Ms. Kreager, \u201ccould not sit down because the student would not let her sit down.\u201d Mr. Williams did not notice anything unusual about Ms. Kreager\u2019s eye when she boarded the bus, and stated that it \u201c[l]ooked fine.\u201d He also testified that Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis were not arguing when they got on the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Mr. Williams heard the heavy-set girl tell Ms. Kreager, \u201cyou can\u2019t sit down,\u201d and heard the middle-aged male passenger, who he identified as Mr. Ennis, say \u201c[l]eave my girlfriend alone.\u201d After hearing the exchange, Mr. Williams said, \u201c[w]hy don\u2019t you leave the woman alone and let her have a seat?\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>then picked up a wheelchair passenger. After the passenger in the wheelchair boarded the bus, \u201cit went crazy.\u201d According to Mr. Williams, Ms. Kreager and the \u201cfemale that was filing her nails was screaming at each other,\u201d and then the \u201cwhole back of the bus jumped on\u201d Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis. Mr. Williams did not hear any racial slurs and did not see Ms. Kreager spit on anyone. He also did not see Mr. Ennis with a knife. Mr. Williams estimated that \u201cmaybe thirty\u2014twenty-six, thirty students had\u201d Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis \u201cat the back of the door.\u201d Mr. Williams characterized the noise level on the bus at the time that \u201cthe riot broke out\u201d at \u201cabout a seven because the children in the front was not participating that much with the wildness going on in the rear.\u201d As soon as Mr. Williams stopped the bus, the \u201cwhole back door flung open ... the left side of the door flung open\u201d and Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis were \u201cforced out on the ground being beaten, kicked, and stomped.\u201d Prior to being forced out of the bus, Mr. Williams observed the heavy set girl striking Ms. Kreager, and \u201cthen the other students followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Mr. Williams observed about six students around Mr. Ennis before he fell out of the back door. After Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis went out the back door, approximately 18-20 students also exited the back door and \u201cthey were beating [Ms. Kreager]. She was laying on the ground.\u201d Some students who could not get out the back door ran to the front of the bus and \u201cstarted kicking the front door while [Mr. Ennis] was holding the front door trying to keep them inside the bus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Mr. Williams helped the elderly man off of the bus, and as he was doing so he was kicked, pushed, and punched. When he got the elderly man off of the bus, he saw a male kicking Ms. Kreager in the face. Mr. Williams hollered to the students to \u201cget off the woman, you gonna kill her,\u201d and then Ms. Kreager stood up with blood running down her face. Shortly thereafter, a woman came running out of a house near where the bus was parked, and a couple of minutes later, an ambulance arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Mr. Williams stated that during the attack, he saw the girl who had been filing her nails on the bus hitting Ms. Kreager in the head constantly while a boy also hit her. Mr. Williams called 911 and the MTA for assistance, and identified his voice on a tape-recording stating that \u201cthese kids are going crazy.\u201d After the students \u201cfinished beating\u201d Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis, they \u201cwalked down the street, strolled.\u201d Once the police arrived, they asked Mr. Williams and Mr. Ennis if they could identify any of the students involved in the attack. Mr. Williams \u201cpointed to the ones\u201d he knew, making a total of nine identifications. Mr. Williams stated that he was \u201c[o]ne hundred percent\u201d certain that he had identified the right individuals, and that he was so certain because \u201c[i]t was devastating what happened on that coach. I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Mr. Williams testified that after the incident, he noticed that one of the back windows of the bus was broken and the back door was broken. One of the front seats of the bus was also broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">On March 11, 2008, during the continuation of the adjudicatory proceedings, counsel for the appellants stipulated to the admission of the transcripts of the tape-recorded interviews with the <em>Bruton </em>redactions. The relevant portions of the redacted transcripts follow.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">TAPED STATEMENT OF NAKITA M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">[NAKITA.

On March 13, 2008, appellants began their case, calling Officer Andrew McCarty as a witness. Officer McCarty testified that on October 18, 2007, he was working undercover looking for drug activity. In that capacity, he came into contact with an individual who identified himself as \u201cTroy Stenson.\u201d He stated that the person identifying himself as \u201cTroy Stenson\u201d identified Ms. Kreager as his wife. Subsequently, the State and appellees agreed to a stipulation, namely that on October 18, 2007, Mr. Ennis gave the name \u201cTroy Stenson\u201d to a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Floyd Gross, Jr. testified to the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">On December 4, 2007, at approximately 3:00 p.m., the bus driver, i.e., Mr. Williams, helped him<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> onto the bus, which was \u201cfull of school kids.\u201d When Mr. Gross got onto the bus, he noticed that \u201cthere was some commotion going on in the back of the bus,\u201d and that there was \u201ca lot of confusion and people were running back and forth on the bus.\u201d Mr. Gross was facing forward, towards the front of the bus. He could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>not see what was happening in the back of the bus, and did not turn around to look in the back of the bus because he \u201cdon\u2019t turn around to [sic] good,\u201d but he could \u201chear the rumbling of what was going on,\u201d and noticed that the \u201cbus driver ... tried to get some ... order on the bus by hollering to the back of the bus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">After the bus driver failed to get control over the commotion, Mr. Gross heard the \u201cback door of the bus come open,\u201d and then the students who had been on the bus got off of the bus. Just prior to the back door being \u201ckicked open,\u201d Mr. Gross heard \u201ca white couple ... saying that they was being attacked or being bothered by the students in the back of the bus____\u201d When the students got off of the bus, Mr. Gross observed \u201c[a] white lady ... outside the bus ranting and raving to one of the students that was on the bus.\u201d Mr. Gross did not notice anything unusual about the woman\u2019s face or eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Mr. Gross testified that about 5 or 6 children tried to get off the front of the bus, near where he was sitting, but that he put out his hand to keep them from passing him. One of the girls that he stopped, who he identified in court as Nakita M., told him that \u201cthe lady outside the window had spit on her.\u201d After Nakita M. told him that the lady outside of the bus had spit on her, the group \u201ccalmed down for a minute and the lady on the outside was still ranting and raving up at the bus.\u201d At that point, one of the group that he had stopped \u201creached across [him] and opened the window and said something to her.\u201d Mr. Gross stated that the lady outside \u201cwas the lady that ... had gotten hurt,\u201d and that when she was outside of the bus, she had threatened the group inside the bus \u201cby closing her hands in a balled fist,\u201d and \u201cact[ing] like she wanted to fight them.\u201d The other people on the bus \u201cwere running back and forth on the bus\u201d and there was \u201ca lot of confusion.\u201d The group that Mr. Gross stopped got off of the bus at some point, but Mr. Gross did not \u201cpay any attention\u201d to where they had gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Mr. Gross stated that he did not see the \u201cwhite man,\u201d who was with the lady outside of the bus, with a knife. He stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that while the white man was on the bus, however, he \u201cwas saying that he was tousling with three to four kids in the back of the bus. That he held his own. And more like a boast or brag.\u201d He testified that after the bus driver helped him to get off of the bus, he saw the white woman, who showed him her eye. Mr. Gross stated that at that time, her eye was \u201cswollen closed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">On cross-examination, Mr. Gross agreed that he did not remember Nakita M. saying anything about spitting until after he spoke to counsel for Nakita M.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Unique Curtis testified to the following, in pertinent part.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">On December 4, 2007, at about 3:00 p.m., she was on the school bus coming from Robert Poole Middle School. While on the bus, Ms. Curtis observed a white woman and a white man board. The lady was walking in front of the man. According to Ms. Curtis, the woman sat down, and the man stood in the \u201cback doorway\u201d of the bus. Ms. Curtis noticed that the woman had a black eye. She testified that everyone on the bus \u201cwas laughing at her eye,\u201d and that the woman \u201cgot mad,\u201d and \u201c[t]urned around, said something to Nakita.\u201d Nakita M. then \u201cwaved her off\u2019 and \u201cgot up to move.\u201d After Nakita M. got up, the woman whispered something in the man\u2019s ear, and the man \u201cturned around and said, \u2018spit on those nigga\u2019s.\u2019\u201d Ms. Curtis described the subsequent events as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">That\u2019s when Nakita was like, no ain\u2019t nobody going to spit on me, ain\u2019t nobody going to spit on me. The lady took off her book bag, was like don\u2019t talk to him like that, don\u2019t talk to him like that. And Nakita was like, well ain\u2019t nobody going to spit on me. That\u2019s when the white man was like, well I\u2019ll beat y\u2019all ass. That word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">That\u2019s when the lady was, don\u2019t talk to him like that. And Nakita was like, well ain\u2019t nobody going to spit on me. That\u2019s when the lady banged Nakita.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Ms. Curtis stated that after \u201cthe lady\u201d struck Nakita M., Nakita M. \u201ckind of stumbled down. Almost fell. And then somebody went over there and helped her up.\u201d After Nakita M. got up, she started fighting with \u201cthe lady,\u201d and \u201cthe man had grabbed the boy....\u201d After the lady and the man began fighting with the kids, the bus driver started \u201cfussing at them,\u201d and he \u201ctold them to get off the bus. That they shouldn\u2019t be fighting with no kids.\u201d At that point, the commotion moved to the front of the bus, although the man who was with the lady was still in the back of the bus. The man grabbed one of the boys off of the bus, \u201ctying to beat him up,\u201d and \u201ctrying to shut his head in the back doors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">At some point, \u201cthe lady had got off the bus,\u201d and the bus driver shut the doors. The lady, who Ms. Curtis identified as Ms. Kreager, kept \u201cbanging on the bus,\u201d and yelling that she was going to call the police. The bus driver told the kids to get off of the bus. Ms. Curtis, Nakita M., and some others got off of the bus and started walking away down the street. Ms. Curtis did not see Nakita M. hit anyone when she got off of the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Ms. Curtis stated that \u201ceverybody that was on the bus,\u201d \u201cstarted walking down,\u201d but that \u201cbefore [they] could hit the corner, the police came and ... told [them] all to sit down on the ground.\u201d Subsequently, the \u201cbus driver and the lady boyfriend had came down and started pointing people out. Who they thought was in it, or who they said they seen was in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On cross-examination, Ms. Curtis created a diagram that indicated that Ronald B. and Britny C. were seated in the rear of the bus with Nakita M. and Ms. Kreager when the fighting occurred. Ms. Curtis could not remember where Lavar D. was sitting. Ms. Curtis also testified that while Nakita M. and Ms. Kreager were fighting, \u201cthe man\u201d was \u201c[s]winging on people,\u201d both girls and boys. Ms. Curtis did not see the man or the lady with a knife. She did remember a man in a wheelchair seated toward the front of the bus, and stated that she was directly behind Nakita M. when they went to get off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>of the bus, but did not remember the man in the wheelchair putting out his hand to keep them from getting off of the bus. When they got off of the bus, Ms. Curtis saw Ms. Kreager sitting on the curb with another lady.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">After Ms. Curtis\u2019s testimony, appellants rested. The State called Detective Smith as a rebuttal witness. Detective Smith testified that he was present during an interview of Mr. Gross on December 18. At that time, Mr. Gross did not say anything about trying to prevent anyone from getting off of the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">On March 18, 2008, closing arguments were presented, during which the State argued as follows, in pertinent part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnD\">The culpability of [these] respondents rest[s] in the conspiracy theory and the fact that these respondents are co[-]conspirators. There\u2019s a meeting of the minds that Sarah Kre[a]ger and Mr. Ennis get beat up. And anyone participating in the conspiracy should be found facts sustained on each and every count, stemming from the original agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">Evidence shows that the assault started between Nakita and Sarah Kre[a]ger, while two other girls assisted Nakita. Mr. Ennis grabbed Ms. Kre[a]ger, Mr. Ennis pulled ... her behind him in an attempt to protect and defend her. The male students rose up against Mr. Ennis. The fight spilled out onto the street. The students damaged the bus in order to get at Ms. Kre[a]ger, Mr. Ennis or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">Every respondent sitting on the front bench, was identified as an active participant, a co-conspirator, and as such is guilty of ... or ... should be found facts sustained of every count charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">The State relies on Grandison vs. State,<footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark> which holds as to conspiracy, where the existence of a conspiracy is established, the law imposes upon a conspirator, full responsibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>ty for the logical and natural consequences of acts committed by his fellow conspirator if such acts are done in the pursuance in the common design or purpose of the conspiracy-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">During his closing arguments, counsel for Ronald B. argued, in part, that the only \u201cshred of evidence\u201d that indicated that the students were involved in \u201cany of the acts\u201d on the bus, was Ronald B.\u2019s statement to police, after he had been detained for hom*s and interrogated by Sergeant Combs, who had told Ronald B. to \u201chelp [himself], here\u2019s your way out,\u201d that he had hit Ms. Kreager.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">During her closing arguments, counsel for Lavar D. argued, in part, that Lavar D. \u201cdenied all involvement in this offense, if [it\u2019s] an offense at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Counsel for Britny C. argued, in part, that there \u201cis no evidence here linking Brittany [sic] C. to the assault on Sarah Kre[a]ger. None.\u201d Counsel continued that while Britny C. was on the bus, \u201cpossibly in the back, that fact was not enough to accuse her of assaulting Ms. Kre[a]ger, or conspiring with others to assault Ms. Kre[a]ger.\u201d Counsel argued that the only reason Britny C. was in court, was \u201cbecause the driver of the bus pointed her out in a field identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Following closing arguments, the court announced its verdict, stating the following, in relevant part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">Before announcing the verdicts, or the decisions, findings with respect to the individual petitions, I\u2019m going to set forth, what I believe is, the applicable law with respect to the various counts of the petition along with key provisions of Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">\u2756 * \u2756</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">The court then set forth, in depth, the law with respect to first degree assault, second degree assault, reckless endangerment, conspiracy, disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct, and malicious destruction of property. The court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>In terms of self defense, which has been raised in this case, <em>[Morris v.

Subsequently, with respect to Ronald B., the court found that the \u201cevidence is sufficient to find facts sustained beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d as to first and second degree assault, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, reckless endangerment of Ms. Kreager, and reckless endangerment of Mr. Ennis. With respect to Lavar D., the court found that the \u201cevidence is sufficient to find facts sustained beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d as to as to first and second degree assault, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, reckless endangerment of Ms. Kreager, and reckless endangerment of Mr. Ennis. With respect to Britny C., the court found that the \u201cevidence is sufficient to find facts sustained beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d as to first and second degree assault, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and reckless endangerment of Ms. Kreager.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">We shall incorporate additional facts as necessary in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">We shall address each argument, as presented by appellants, and set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Appellants\u2019 first contention is that the circuit court committed \u201cfundamental and reversible error in shifting \u2018the burden of proving self defense [to] the person accused of the assault.\u2019 \u201d Appellants point to the court\u2019s reference, during its review of the applicable law at the end of the proceedings, where it stated that the \u201cburden of proving self defense rest[s] upon the person accused of the assault,\u201d and cited case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The State counters that appellants\u2019 argument \u201cfails for lack of preservation and on the merits.\u201d With respect to lack of preservation, the State asserts that, \u201c[notwithstanding the presence of six defense attorneys and three prosecutors, no objection was raised so that the court\u2019s reference could have been expanded or clarified. As such, [appellants\u2019 contention on appeal was waived.\u201d The State continues that even if we should address the merits, \u201cthe record fails to support [appellants\u2019 claim of error.\u201d The State avers that it \u201cis not at all clear from the record that the court misunderstood the allocation of the burden of proving self-defense,\u201d and, in fact, a \u201cfair reading of the record suggests that the court correctly set forth the allocation of the burden as to self-defense, but misspoke when it referred to the initial burden of producing evidence to generate the defense as the burden of proof.\u201d In any event, argues the State, any error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as \u201c[o]f the three juveniles raising this contention on appeal, none would have been entitled to the self-defense defense,\u201d as there \u201cwas no evidence to suggest that any of the juveniles ... acted in self-defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">This case was tried nonjury; thus, we review it on both the law and the evidence. Maryland Rule 8-131(c). We shall address the merits, and we agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">As correctly noted by appellants, it is well settled in Maryland that where the defense of self-defense\u2014which is a defense to the crime of assault, <em>see, e.g., Bryant v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 237, 246, 574 A.2d 29 (1990) (noting that \u201cthe simple and frequently neglected truth is that the defense of self-defense applies to assaultive crimes generally\u201d)\u2014is generated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>in a case, the burden lies with the State to prove that the accused did not act in self-defense. <em>See Jacobs, </em>32 Md.App. at 514, 363 A.2d 257 (holding \u201cthat where self-defense has been fairly generated by the evidence as an issue in the case, the burden is upon the State of negating such self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt as a necessary element of its proof of guilt.\u201d). It is equally well settled that the defendant bears the initial burden of producing \u201csome evidence\u201d sufficient to generate the defense of self-defense, although the evidentiary threshold necessary in that regard is minimal. In fact, \u201c[i]f there is any evidence relied on by the defendant which, if believed, would support his claim that he acted in self-defense, the defendant has met his burden.\u201d <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 217, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990). Once the defendant has met the initial burden of producing evidence to generate the defense, \u201cthe baton is passed to the State. It must shoulder the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the defendant did not [act] in self-defense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">To reiterate, in this case, in setting forth the applicable law, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">In terms of self defense, which has been raised in this case, <em>[Morris v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 328, 242 A.2d 582 (1968)], the burden of proving self defense rest[s] upon the person accused of the assault. <em>And then </em>in <em>[Jacobs v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 509, 363 A.2d 257 (1976)], the trier [of] fact has to determine whether or not the evidence is fairly been gen\u2014 the issue has been fairly generated in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The court then cited additional cases and stated: \u201c[I]t\u2019s for the trier of fact[ ] to determine whether the person accused of assault was justified in meeting force with force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Appellants take issue particularly with the court\u2019s first statement, i.e., that \u201cthe burden of proving self defense rest[s] upon the person accused of the assault,\u201d along with its cite to <em>Morris, </em>which held that the \u201cburden of proving self-defense rested upon the appellant,\u201d but which was decided prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), which held that a law requiring a defendant to establish that he acted in the heat of passion in order to reduce the homicide charge from murder to manslaughter, was unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 704, 95 S.Ct. 1881. Following <em>Mullaney, </em>this Court noted that <em>Mullaney </em>applies to affirmative defenses generally, and that the State has the burden to negate the defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., Evans v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 640, 349 A.2d 300, (1975). Thus, argue appellants, \u201cit is beyond cavil that the [cjourt erroneously required the defense to prove the existence of self-defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">We disagree with appellants\u2019 reading of the record. Instead, it appears that the court merely made a misstatement when it stated that \u201cthe burden of <em>proving </em>self defense rest[s] upon the person accused of the assault,\u201d instead meaning to say the burden of <em>production, ie., </em>the initial burden of producing evidence sufficient to generate the defense of self-defense, rests upon the person accused of the assault. This is bolstered by the fact that the court next states that it has to determine whether the issue of self-defense has been fairly generated by the evidence, and cites to <em>Jacobs, </em>which, as set forth above, held \u201cthat where self-defense has been fairly generated by the evidence as an issue in the case, the burden is upon the State of negating such self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt as a necessary element of its proof of guilt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>32 Md.App. at 514, 363 A.2d 257. The court continues that once the trier of fact determines whether the defense has been generated, it then has to determine whether the person accused of the assault was justified in using self-defense. Absent the apparent misstatement, the court correctly set forth the law as to self-defense. Moreover, in announcing the verdicts, the court stated, prior to each finding of \u201cinvolved,\u201d that the \u201cevidence is sufficient to find facts sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Thus, the court was clearly aware of the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In any event, even if the court\u2019s misstatement could be considered error, we would nevertheless conclude that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) (In a criminal context, an error is harmless if \u201ca reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d). It is evident from the record that none of the appellants on appeal sought to prevail or could have prevailed on the defense of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">According to their statements, Lavar D. claimed that he was not involved in the assaults on either Ms. Kreager or Mr. Ennis, and that he remained on the bus during the attacks, and Ronald B. claimed that he \u201creally couldn\u2019t see what happened\u201d on the bus. Furthermore, during closing arguments, counsel for Britny C. and Lavar D. asserted that their clients denied all involvement in the attacks. Counsel for Ronald B. asserted that his client denied involvement, arguing instead, as he does again on appeal, that Ronald B.\u2019s statement implicating himself was the product of police inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Appellants\u2019 next contention is that the court erred in limiting cross-examination of Ms. Kreager regarding \u201ca pending charge for distribution of cocaine,\u201d because the \u201caccused had the right to explore the veracity\u201d of her statement in \u201ca prior hearing<footnotemark>[13]</footnotemark> where she had testified under oath before the same judge, that the alleged assault was the sole reason why her children were not in her custody____\u201d In support of this contention, appellants assert that although \u201can event, such as an arrest,\u201d is \u201cnot independently admissible for impeachment purposes,\u201d if a witness \u201ctestifies untruthfully about that event,\u201d the witness may then be cross-examined about it, as the untruthful testimony is then relevant to an assessment of the witness\u2019 veracity. <em>Citing, e.g., State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 179, 468 A.2d 319 (1983). Appellants contend that \u201cso long as they were able to proffer another reason,\u201d unrelated to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201calleged assault, why Ms. Kreager\u2019s children were not in her custody,\u201d i.e., because she \u201cwas arrested selling drugs to an undercover officer with [her] three children present\u201d on October 18, 2007, the court should have allowed them to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The State counters that appellants\u2019 contention was not properly raised below, but that even it was, it should be rejected on the merits. The State asserts that appellants\u2019 argument \u201crests on the assumption that Kreager lied in her victim impact statement when she represented that reunification with her children was being delayed as a result of the present case,\u201d which assumption is not supported by the record. The State explains that neither a copy or a transcript of Ms. Kreager\u2019s victim impact statement was provided to the court, and that absent counsel\u2019s proffer that \u201c \u2018her testimony in the victim impact was that this incident is the reason she doesn\u2019t have the kids,\u2019 the record fails to indicate that Kreager identified the present case as the \u2018sole\u2019 reason for foster care placement.\u2019 \u201d Rather, \u201cthe record shows that Kreager\u2019s children were not in her custody throughout the entire proceeding because she was homeless\u201d; thus, \u201ceven if the foster care placement occurred as a result of Kreager\u2019s arrest, this fact would not render Kreager\u2019s victim impact statement false.\u201d Moreover, avers the State, even if the record did establish that Ms. Kreager \u201ccited the present case as the \u2018sole\u2019 reason for foster care placement, which it does not, this fact would not permit impeachment with evidence regarding the circumstances of Kreager\u2019s arrest,\u201d as facts surrounding her arrest \u201cremained collateral to the issues before the juvenile court,\u201d and, as correctly noted by the court, and as appellants expressly acknowledge, \u201carrests are not generally admissible for impeachment.\u201d We agree with the State, and shall briefly address the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">To restate, appellants assert that Ms. Kreager made a victim impact statement, under oath, at Shamira B.\u2019s disposition hearing, testifying that the \u201csole reason\u201d her children were not in her custody was because of the incident on the bus. Appellants argue that that statement opened the door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>for them to cross-examine her with respect to an arrest in the presence of her children on October 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">First, it is unclear from counsel\u2019s proffer to the court that Ms. Kreager testified during the victim impact statement that the only reason that her children were in foster care was because of this incident. Notably, the record fails to indicate that Ms. Kreager identified the present case as the \u201csole reason\u201d for her children\u2019s placement in foster care. In fact, nothing in the record indicates why Ms. Kreager\u2019s children were placed in foster care\u2014whether it be because she was distributing narcotics while they were present, or because she was arrested, or because she was homeless. A copy or transcript of the victim impact statement was not provided to the court, and during the proceedings at issue here, Ms. Kreager testified that her children were in foster care because she was homeless. She also agreed only that the bus incident was \u201cpart of\u2019 what was keeping her from her children, as the question posed by counsel for Ronald B. during the adjudicatory proceedings was whether, in her victim impact statement, Ms. Kreager had \u201cindicated that this incident was part of the incident [sic] keeping [her] from [her] kids?\u201d Ms. Kreager\u2019s affirmative response did not negate the possibility that there were other reasons that her children were placed in foster care, including the reasons given by Ms. Kreager during the proceedings at issue here, nor did it necessarily render her testimony false.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In any event, even if Ms. Kreager had cited the present case as the \u201csole reason\u201d for foster care placement during her victim impact statement, that fact would not permit impeachment during these proceedings with evidence regarding the circumstances of her arrest, as the facts of her arrest were irrelevant and collateral to the issues before the juvenile court. The proffer by counsel did not include an assertion of evidence that the arrest was a reason why Ms. Kreager did not have her children. Thus, because arrests are not generally admissible for impeachment, and there is no indication that Ms. Kreager\u2019s arrest had any bearing on her credibility, or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>she testified untruthfully about her arrest, we perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Appellants\u2019 third contention is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the court\u2019s findings of involved as to any appellant, with the exception of Ronald B.\u2019s assault on Ms. Kreager based upon his affirmation that he \u201ckicked\u201d her. More specifically, first, appellants assert that the State failed to prove, with respect to Lavar D. and Britny C., \u201canything more than their presence, at the scene [of] the incident and, with regard to Ronald B., anything more than the fact that he struck Ms. Kreager \u2018once\u2019 in response to her and Mr. Ennis\u2019s aggression.\u201d In support of this contention, appellants argue that no witness at trial stated what, \u201cif anything,\u201d any of the appellants did during the incident. Thus, \u201cthe only evidence produced by the State to demonstrated appellants\u2019 criminal agency was the fact that each was identified by either Mr. Ennis or Mr. Williams in an on-scene, show-up identification, minutes after the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Secondly, appellants aver that there \u201cis no evidence which shows that any appellant inflicted or attempted to inflict a serious physical injury,\u201d tantamount to a first degree assault. Appellants credit this lack of evidence to \u201cthe State\u2019s failure to prove what any of the appellants did,\u201d asserting that \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence to establish that any appellant engaged in conduct which created a risk of serious physical injury, let alone evidence that appellants engaged in activities which demonstrated that they had the requisite specific intent to cause a serious physical injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Thirdly, appellants contend that the evidence is insufficient to establish the crime of conspiracy to commit first degree assault because there was no evidence of the \u201cgravaman of the offense: an agreement between each appellant and another to engage in the act of first-degree assault.\u201d Appellants continue that here, \u201cdue primarily to the failure of the State to prove what, exactly, any appellant did (other than Mr. B. struck Ms. Kreager \u2018once\u2019 in self-defense) and, specifically, the failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>prove that any appellant engaged in an act with the specific intent to cause serious injury, in equal force the State cannot prove that the appellants harbored both the specific intent to agree, with others, to engage in the first-degree assault of Ms. Kreager, nor the specific intent \u2018to assist in some way in causing that crime to be committed.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Finally, appellants contend that the evidence is insufficient to establish that they acted in a disorderly manner or disturbed the public peace because, again, \u201cdue to the State\u2019s failure to prove what, if anything, any appellant did during this incident, the State clearly did not prove (a) that any appellant acted in a disorderly manner; (b) that any appellant disturbed the public peace; or (c) assuming that either was shown, that any appellant did so with the specific intent required by the statute.\u201d Appellants opine that \u201c[a]t most, the State proved that each appellant was on board a rowdy bus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The State counters that (1) the State\u2019s theory of the case was that appellants conspired to commit the acts against Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis, and that the evidence adduced at trial, which included both Mr. Williams\u2019s and Mr. Ennis\u2019s testimony that they identified the individuals involved in the attack; Ms. Curtis\u2019s diagram showing that both Britny C. and Ronald B. were seated at the rear of the bus with Nakita M. and Ms. Kreager at the time of the attack; Ms. Kreager\u2019s testimony that someone wearing a green jacket kicked her; Lavar D.\u2019s identification as the only suspect wearing a green jacket; and, the testimony of each witness regarding the attack, supported a finding that each appellant \u201cparticipated in the mass assault on Kreager and [Ennis]\u201d; (2) the testimony of Dr. Ali, describing Ms. Kreager\u2019s injuries, established the \u201ccriteria for serious physical injury\u201d necessary to support a finding of involved as to the charges of first degree assault, and that from the evidence establishing that each appellant was an active participant in hitting, punching, and kicking Ms. Kreager, the court was \u201cpermitted to draw the inference that the juveniles intended to inflict serious physical injury\u201d; (3) testimony from Ms. King, Ms. Kreager, and Mr. Ennis estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>lished that the group of juveniles was \u201cacting in unison,\u201d which is sufficient to establish the elements of conspiracy; and, (4) again, as set forth previously, the evidence established that appellants \u201ctogether created the disturbance by acting in concert in a disorderly manner.\u201d We agree that the evidence was sufficient to find each appellant involved as to the crimes of first degree assault, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and acting in a disorderly manner or disturbing the peace, and shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Preliminarily, we note the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">A delinquent act is an act which would be a crime if committed by an adult. Maryland Code (2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-8A-01 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d). As with a criminal proceeding, in an adjudicatory hearing in a juvenile delinquency proceeding, the State must present evidence sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile committed the delinquent act or acts. Maryland Rule 11\u2014114(e)(1); C.J. 3-8A-18. <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). <em>See also, e.g., In re Ondrel M., </em>173 Md.App. 223, 230-31, 918 A.2d 543 (2007) (recognizing that in juvenile delinquency proceedings, the delinquent act must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is \u201cwhether, after considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 313, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>see State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533, 823 A.2d 664 (2003), We give \u201cdue regard to the [fact finder\u2019s] finding of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Harrison v. State, </em>382 Md. 477, 488, 855 A.2d 1220 (2004) (quoting <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 474, 701 A.2d 675 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1151, 118 S.Ct. 1173, 140 L.Ed.2d 182 (1998) (other citation omitted)). Furthermore, when an action has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tried without a jury, we will review the case on both the law and the evidence, and we will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 8-131(c). \u201cWe do not measure the weight of the evidence; rather we concern ourselves only with whether the verdict was supported with sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial, which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 474, 701 A.2d 675 (citing <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478-79, 649 A.2d 336 (1994)). This same standard of review applies in juvenile delinquency cases. <em>In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. 371, 380, 681 A.2d 501 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The standard for assessing the sufficiency of the evidence applies to all criminal cases, including those resting upon circumstantial evidence. <em>Jensen v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 103, 117-20, 732 A.2d 319 (1999). In fact, there is \u201cno difference between direct and circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hebron v. State, </em>331 Md. 219, 226, 627 A.2d 1029 (1993). \u201cCircumstantial evidence is as persuasive as direct evidence. With each, triers of fact must use their experience with people and events to weigh probabilities.\u201d <em>Mangum v. State, </em>342 Md. 392, 400, 676 A.2d 80 (1996) (citation omitted). Thus, \u201c[circumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to support a conviction, provided the circumstances support rational inferences from which the trier of fact could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Painter v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 1, 11, 848 A.2d 692 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We shall turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">During closing arguments, the State explained that it was basing its theory of the case on <em>Grandison, </em>which holds that \u201cone who encourages, aids, abets, or assists the active perpetrator in the commission of the offense is a guilty participant, and in the eye of the law is equally culpable with the one who does the act,\u201d 305 Md. at 703, 506 A.2d 580, and that where the existence of a conspiracy is established, \u201cthe law imposes on a conspirator full responsibility for the logical and natural consequences of acts committed by his fellow conspirators if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>such acts are done in the pursuance in the common design or purpose of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this theory, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the juvenile court\u2019s adjudication of involved as to all appellants and as to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">As stated above, appellants first assert that although \u201c[d]ue process requires the State to establish every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which the defendant is charged, including his criminal agency, beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>Robertson v. State, </em>112 Md.App. 366, 375, 685 A.2d 805 (1996), the \u201conly evidence produced by the State to demonstrate appellants\u2019 criminal agency was the fact that each was identified by either Mr. Ennis or Mr. Williams in an on-scene, show-up identification, minutes after the incident\u201d; thus, the State failed to prove \u201canything more than the presence\u201d of appellants<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> at the scene, which, according to appellants, is insufficient pursuant to <em>Johnson v. State, </em>227 Md. 159, 175 A.2d 580 (1961) and <em>Woodard v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 300, 295 A.2d 789 (1972). We disagree, and without restating all of the evidence adduced at the hearing, as we have already done so in detail above, note that the evidence presented tended to establish the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Both Mr. Williams and Mr. Ennis testified to the activity that they observed, both on and off of the bus, and identified appellants shortly thereafter as the individuals involved in that activity. Specifically, after hearing an exchange between Ms. Kreager and a heavy-set girl on the back of the bus, Mr. Williams observed the \u201cwhole back of the bus\u201d jump on Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis. When Mr. Williams stopped the bus, he saw Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis \u201cforced out ... being beaten, kicked, and stomped.\u201d He also observed the \u201cheavyset girl\u201d strike Ms. Kreager, and then the \u201cother students\u201d following. Before Mr. Ennis fell out of the back door of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>bus, Mr. Williams noticed about six students around him. He also saw 18-20 students exit the back door, and then saw them beating Ms. Kreager. The students who could not get out of the back of the bus ran to the front and started \u201ckicking\u201d the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">After the attacks, Mr. Williams selected nine individuals, whom he identified as being involved in the beatings. Mr. Williams stated that he \u201cpointed to the ones\u201d he knew, and that he was \u201c[o]ne hundred percent\u201d certain that he had identified the correct individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Mr. Ennis testified that after a \u201cheavy-set\u201d girl began fighting with Ms. Kreager, another girl grabbed Ms. Kreager\u2019s hair. After Mr. Ennis tried to get Ms. Kreager behind him, the \u201cwhole front of the bus and the back of the bus\u201d came towards them, trying to \u201cbum rush\u201d them. After he and Ms. Kreager got off the bus, several of the juveniles attacked him and Ms. Kreager. Once police arrived, Mr. Ennis identified the \u201ckids ... who assaulted [him] or who [he saw] assaulting\u201d Ms. Kreager.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Ms. Kreager also testified to the activity on the bus. She testified that Nakita M. hit her and grabbed her hair, while another female came over and also grabbed her by her hair. Both girls tried to pull Ms. Kreager into the \u201ccrowd\u201d that was becoming aggressive. Ms. Kreager identified a male wearing a green jacket as the individual who kicked her in the face. Lavar D. was the only individual identified wearing a green jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Ms. King testified that she saw \u201c[a]ll of the children [that] came off the bus\u201d kicking and punching Ms. Kreager.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Ms. Curtis created a diagram indicating that Ronald B., and Britny C. were sitting in the back of the bus with Nakita M. when the fighting occurred. As stated, Ronald B. admitted to kicking Ms. Kreager.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The cases relied on by appellant are factually distinct, <em>see Johnson, supra, </em>(finding that although the accused was present at the scene, the evidence was not sufficient to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>robbery conviction where there was no direct evidence, nor any evidence to support a rational inference that the accused was either a principal or an aider and abettor); <em>Woodard, supra, </em>(finding that the accused\u2019s presence in the store at the time of the robbery was the only affirmative evidence offered by the State to support its charge that he was a participant in the robbery), and otherwise inapposite. Unlike in those cases, in the present case, there was ample evidence to conclude that each of the appellants was actively involved in the assaults on Ms. Kreager, Mr. Ennis, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">We now turn to appellant\u2019s second sub-argument, i.e., that the evidence was insufficient to establish that appellants committed the crime of first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">First-degree assault is defined in Maryland Code (2002 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-202(a)(l) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d): \u201cA person may not intentionally cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury to another.\u201d \u201cSerious physical injury\u201d is defined as physical injury that \u201ccreates a substantial risk of death.\u201d CL \u00a7 3-201(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In <em>Chilcoat v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 394, 843 A.2d 240, <em>cert. denied, </em>381 Md. 675, 851 A.2d 594 (2004), we explained that \u201cserious physical injury\u201d may be proved</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD3\">by evidence establishing that the defendant inflicted physical injury by \u201can act performed under circumstances that create a substantial risk of death.\u201d This definition of serious physical injury focuses on the circumstances in which the defendant performed the act that caused physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_1\"><em>Id. </em>at 403, 843 A.2d 240 (quoting <em>Konrad v. Alaska, </em>763 P.2d 1369, 1376 (Alaska Ct.App.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Furthermore, we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">the statute prohibits not only causing, but attempting to cause, a serious physical injury to another. Although the State must prove that an individual had a specific intent to cause a serious physical injury, <em>see Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 239, 772 A.2d 283 (2001) [parallel citation omitted], a jury may infer the necessary intent from an individual\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>conduct and the surrounding circumstances, whether or not the victim suffers such an injury. <em>See Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 703, 705 n. 9, 625 A.2d 984 (1993) [para\u00fcel citation omitted]. Also, the jury may \u201cinfer that \u2018one intends the natural and probable consequences of his act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704, 625 A.2d 984 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><em>Chilcoat, </em>155 Md.App. at 403, 843 A.2d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We have already established that the evidence was sufficient to conclude that each of the appellants was an active participant in the group of juveniles involved in the attack. Thus, we are only left with the question of whether the assaults were in the first-degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Pursuant to Dr. Ali\u2019s testimony, we have little difficulty concluding that the injuries to Ms. Kreager satisfied the criteria for a \u201cserious physical injury.\u201d Dr. Ali testified that she was \u201cprepared to take care of a trauma patient,\u201d as the paramedics had designated that Ms. Kreager \u201chad the potential for serious life threatening injury....\u201d Dr. Ali stated that Ms. Kreager had a \u201cvery significant injury\u201d to her left eye, and a CT scan of Ms. Kreager\u2019s face revealed \u201cquite a severe injury to the eye,\u201d including \u201cmultiple orbital fractures.\u201d According to Dr. Ali, the injuries had the \u201cpotential for loss of vision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Moreover, as we stated above, the evidence established that Lavar D., Britny C., and Ronald B. were active participants in a group of individuals who repeatedly hit, punched, and kicked Ms. Kreager. From these acts, the court was permitted to draw the inference that the juveniles intended to inflict serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Appellants\u2019 third sub-argument is that the evidence was insufficient to establish the elements of conspiracy to commit first degree assault. The thrust of appellants\u2019 argument is that the State failed to prove \u201can agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">In <em>Cooper v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 257, 737 A.2d 613 (1999), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The elements of a criminal conspiracy are (1) the combination of two or more persons, (2) to accomplish some unlawful purpose. Although the essence of a criminal conspiracy is an unlawful agreement, the State is not required to offer proof of any formal arrangement; rather, a conspiracy can be inferred from the actions of the accused. The agreement need not be formal or spoken, provided there is a meeting of the minds reflecting a unity of purpose and design.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 267, 737 A.2d 613 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">To reiterate the testimony briefly, after Ms. Kreager sat down and Nakita M. told her that she needed to move, she heard someone say, \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want to move, we\u2019ll move that bitch.\u201d Ms. Kreager then told Mr. Ennis that she believed \u201cthese girls\u201d were trying to start something with her. Nakita M. then stated that this \u201cis our bus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">After the verbal exchange, Nakita M. struck Ms. Kreager, and then Ms. Kreager heard uproar, noise, and commotion \u201ccoming from everywhere.\u201d Nakita M. and another girl had her by her hair and were pulling her into the crowd, that was becoming anxious, excited, and aggressive. When Mr. Ennis threw Ms. Kreager behind him, the crowd of students charged Mr. Ennis.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">When Mr. Ennis and Ms. Kreager got off the bus, she saw the group of kids on the bus moving towards the front. Mr. Ennis tried to hold the doors closed, but there were students pushing through the door, and then the doors \u201cburst out\u201d and a large group of students got off the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Off of the bus, Ms. Kreager was charged and tackled by Nakita M. and another female. A male struck her with a closed fist. She ended up on the ground, and \u201cmore people were coming over\u201d and kicking her. She felt more than one person lift her head up and heard a female say, \u201ckick that bitch.\u201d A male then kicked Ms. Kreager in her eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">In addition to Ms. Kreager\u2019s testimony, eyewitnesses also testified that a group of students descended on Ms. Kreager and Mr. Ennis after Nakita M. hit Ms. Kreager, as well as after Ms. Kreager got off of the bus. We have already set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>forth that testimony above. The evidence in this case established the requisite elements for conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Appellants\u2019 last sub-argument is that the evidence was insufficient to establish that appellants acted in a disorderly manner or disturbed the public peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Section 10-201(c)(2) of the Criminal Law Article provides that \u201c[a] person may not willfully act in a disorderly manner that disturbs the public peace.\u201d The \u201cgist of the crime of disorderly conduct ... is the doing, or saying, or both, of that which offends, disturbs, incites, or tends to incite, a number of people gathered in the same area.\u201d <em>Spry v. State, </em>396 Md. 682, 914 A.2d 1182 (2007) (other citations omitted). Again, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of disorderly conduct as to each appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The evidence established that a group of juveniles conspired to assault Ms. Kreager and/or Mr. Ennis on the bus that day. During the attacks, Ms. King saw the bus \u201crocking\u201d violently and thought that there was a \u201criot on the bus.\u201d Mr. Williams reported that a group of juveniles on the bus \u201cwent crazy,\u201d and that a \u201criot broke out.\u201d The interior of the bus was d\u00e1maged during the attacks. We fail to see how this, as well as all of the other evidence adduced, does not support a finding of disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Next, appellants contend that the court erred in failing to suppress Ronald B.\u2019s custodial statement to police, because the statement was made in response to police inducement. Relying on <em>In re Lucas F., </em>68 Md.App. 97, 510 A.2d 270 (1986), appellants argue that \u201cit is clear that Mr. B.\u2019s statement was the product of police inducement,\u201d because in \u201cexhorting Mr. B. to \u2018[h]help [sic] yourself before \u2018four [other respondents] tell me exactly what happened and exactly what you did,\u2019 \u201d was an inducement for Ronald B. to give a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">The State counters that Sergeant Combs\u2019 explanation to Ronald B. during the police interview, as set forth above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201cdid not constitute either an implied promise of leniency or threat of harm,\u201d and \u201cthere was no inducement or reliance thereon.\u201d Rather, contends the State, Sergeant Combs was \u201ccommenting on the videotape that he believed would be forthcoming that would clearly identify the actions of the juveniles.\u201d Even if the comments could be read \u201cas constituting an implied promise,\u201d however, \u201cRonald B.\u2019s claim of inducement fails because there was no evidence that Ronald\u2019s decision to make a statement was the product of these comments.\u201d In fact, \u201cRonald gave his statement in response to Combs\u2019 suggestion that Ronald reacted to Kreager\u2019s and Ennis\u2019 use of force.\u201d In any event, opines the State, any error was harmless \u201cbecause the evidence of his involvement, excluding his statement, was overwhelming.\u201d Again, we agree that there was no implied promise, and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415 (1979), the trial judge found as a fact that a police officer investigating a homicide told Hillard that if he was telling the truth about his involvement, the officer would \u201cgo to bat\u201d for him by telling the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office and the court that he had cooperated, that he had told the truth, and that he was not knowledgeable with regard to the homicide. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 406 A.2d 415. The Court of Appeals concluded that this finding \u201cconfirmed that the officer had promised the defendant help if he would make a statement ... [and] ... established the statement ... was involuntarily obtained .... \u201d <em>id., </em>and held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">if an accused is told, or it is implied, that making an inculpatory statement will be to his advantage, in that he will be given help or some special consideration, and he makes remarks in reliance on that inducement, his declaration will be considered to have been involuntarily made and therefore inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 153, 406 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The Court also noted that \u201cany decision concerning the voluntariness of a statement necessarily must rest on the facts of the case involved----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 406 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Cases subsequent to <em>Hillard </em>explained further that while \u201c[a] mere exhortation to tell the truth is not enough to make a statement involuntary,\u201d an \u201centreaty to \u2018tell the truth\u2019 coupled with a promise that there would be benefits to the suspect ... can render the statement involuntary,\u201d <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>327 Md. 494, 507, 610 A.2d 782 (1992) (other citations omitted), and that the \u201crule in <em>Hillard </em>announces that a statement is rendered involuntary if it is induced by an <em>official </em>promise which redounds to the benefit or desire of the defendant.\u201d <em>Pappaconstantinou v. State, </em>352 Md. 167, 176, 721 A.2d 241 (1998) (emphasis in original) (citing <em>Reynolds, </em>327 Md. at 508-09, 610 A.2d 782).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">In <em>In re Lucas F., </em>relied on by appellants, ten-year-old Lucas was suspected of the assault of a seven-year-old playmate. 68 Md.App. at 100, 510 A.2d 270. After initially denying involvement, and providing the police with descriptions of fictitious assailants, Lucas became a suspect in the assault, which left his playmate with amnesia. <em>Id. </em>During police questioning of Lucas, outside of the presence of his mother, Lucas verbally admitted that he had fabricated the earlier story concerning the assailants, and said that his playmate was accidentally injured when he hit his head on some rocks in the creek where the boys were playing. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 510 A.2d 270. With respect to this statement, a police detective testified that he had told Lucas that \u201ceventually [his playmate] would remember what happened____ If what Lucas had told me was not the truth and was not everything that had occurred, that now was the time to tell me so that there would be no problem later if [his playmate] recalled a different account of the incident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 510 A.2d 270. We reversed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">It is abundantly clear that [the police detective\u2019s] testimony represents an inducement to Lucas to tell the truth \u201cso there would be no problem later.\u201d That exhortation by the detective might have sown, and probably did sow, the seeds of a subauditur in Lucas\u2019s mind that if he related the events that had transpired at the creek, he would avoid subsequent problems. The inducement, we think, flies straight in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>face of <em>Hillard </em>and, consequently, was impermissible. For that reason alone, Lucas\u2019s statement should have been suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\n<em>Id,.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Appellants assert that the \u201cinducement <em>sub judice </em>is indistinguishable from that in <em>Lucas,\u201d </em>and that Sergeant Combs\u2019 statement to Ronald B. to explain to him what had happened, \u201c[a]fter now is too late,\u201d was improper inducement. Particularly, appellants take issue with the emphasized portions of Ronald B.\u2019s police interview, below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">SGT. COMBS: You understand something.

Based on the facts of this case, we can not conclude that there was either any inducement, nor that Ronald B. relied on anything Sergeant Combs said in making his statement. We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>5.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">6.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Appellants\u2019 next argument is that the court erred in precluding the defense from cross-examining Mr. Ennis about his alleged past domestic abuse of Ms. Kreager. Appellants assert that they had presented evidence that Ms. Kreager had a black eye when she boarded the bus, and that the evidence that her only \u201csignificant injury was preexisting had an obvious impact in assessing Kreager and Ennis\u2019s allegations that they were assaulted on the bus,\u201d and also \u201cwas evidence of an \u2018obvious motive\u2019 for Mr. Ennis to ascribe the existence of the black eye to someone else----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The State counters the court exercised its discretion and excluded irrelevant evidence. In support of this contention, the State asserts that the \u201cissue raised by the juveniles, i.e., whether Ms. Kreager\u2019s injury was pre-existing,\u201d was irrelevant, even if true, because \u201cwhether Ennis had been abusive to Kreager prior to the bus attack or the fact that Kreager may have filed for a protective order<footnotemark>[17]</footnotemark> was not relevant to the issues before the court,\u201d and, in any event, there was ample evidence that Ms. Kreager did not have a preexisting injury. We agree, and briefly explain.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">The conduct of the trial \u201cmust of necessity rest largely in the control and discretion of the presiding judge,\u201d and an appellate court should not interfere with that judgment unless there has been error or clear abuse of discretion. <em>See Wilhelm v.

State, </em>383 Md. 116, 128, 857 A.2d 88 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">In the present case, and based on the foregoing, we disagree with appellants that the court abused its discretion in precluding the defense from cross-examining Mr. Ennis about alleged past domestic abuse of Ms. Kreager. The issue raised by appellants at trial was whether Ms. Kreager\u2019s injuries were pre-existing. Appellants put forth some evidence, i.e., the testimony of Ms. Curtis, that Ms. Kreager boarded the bus with a black eye. Appellants contend that a prior injury \u201chad an obvious impact in assessing [Ms.] Kreager and [Mr.] Ennis\u2019s allegations that they were assaulted on the bus,\u201d and that this area of cross-examination was \u201ccrucial to exposing a key reason why the witness would shade his or her testimony, or establishf ] a key theory of the case for the defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Ms. Curtis\u2019s testimony, as well as the statements of some of the respondents, notwithstanding, there was other evidence before the court that Ms. Kreager did not have any injuries to her eye when she boarded the bus, and that she was attacked by a group of juveniles both on and off the bus, and suffered injuries. Moreover, there was substantial evidence that, even if a preexisting injury existed, it was much worse after the incident. Even if Mr. Ennis did physically abuse Ms. Kreager prior to the bus incident, any evidence of such abuse was irrelevant and collateral to the issues before the court, and would not negate the fact that appellants conspired to, and did in fact, assault Ms. Kreager, causing serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">7.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Appellants next assert that the court erred in allowing the use of statements containing \u201comitted and deleted passages implicating other respondents.\u201d According to appellants, the admission of the redacted statements was inconsistent with <em>Bruton, </em>n. 2, <em>supra, </em>and <em>Gray v. Maryland, </em>523 U.S. 185, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 140 L.Ed.2d 294 (1998), because the \u201cblank and blacked-out passages raise obvious questions about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>what might have been said in those omitted passages,\u201d and the statements \u201cclearly impl[ied] the participation of the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The State counters that appellants waived this argument when appellants agreed to \u201cthe admission of the transcripts of the statements with the <em>Bruton </em>redactions,\u201d and that nevertheless, even if properly before this Court, appellants\u2019 argument fails because \u201cit was clear that more than forty juveniles were on the bus at the time of the attack, and the testimony established that\u201d \u201cseveral juveniles involved in the assault ... were not part of the present proceeding, including Shamira B \u2014 thus, \u201cthe redacted statements would not cause the court to infer participation based on the omissions from the statements.\u201d Again, we agree with the State, and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">First, with respect to preservation, as is set forth above, the court ordered that counsel consult on the redactions prior to trial, and subsequently verified that the \u201credactions are both satisfactory to the State and the Defense ...\u201d Both the State and counsel for each appellant responded in the affirmative, and at the adjudicatory hearing, counsel clearly agreed to the admission of the transcripts of the statements with the redactions. Thus, we agree that appellants\u2019 argument is not preserved. Nevertheless, we shall briefly address the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">In <em>Bruton, </em>petitioner Bruton and his co-defendant, Evans, were tried jointly on the charge of armed postal robbery. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 124, 88 S.Ct. 1620. A postal inspector testified at that trial that Evans had orally confessed to him that he and Bruton had committed the armed robbery. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, relying on <em>Delli Paoli v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957), affirmed Bruton\u2019s conviction because the trial judge had instructed the jury that although Evans\u2019 confession was competent evidence against Evans, it was inadmissible hearsay against Bruton and therefore had to be disregarded in determining Bruton\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 125, 88 S.Ct. 1620.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari to reconsider the question of \u201cwhether the conviction of a defendant at a joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>trial should be set aside although the jury was instructed that a co-defendant\u2019s confession inculpating the defendant had to be disregarded in determining his guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123-24, 88 S.Ct. 1620. In considering the question, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">[Tjhere are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored. Such a context is presented here, where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial. Not only are the incriminations devastating to the defendant but their credibility is inevitably suspect, a fact recognized when accomplices do take the stand and the jury is instructed to weight their testimony carefully given the recognized motivation to shift blame onto others. The unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. 1620 (internal citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Thus, the Court held that a defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment were violated by the introduction, at a joint criminal trial, of a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession which named and incriminated the defendant, and that a limiting instruction to the jury was not \u201can adequate substitute for [a] petitioner\u2019s ... right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 88 S.Ct. 1620.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Following <em>Bruton, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the circumstance where the prosecution redacted the co-defendant\u2019s confession by substituting for the defendant\u2019s name in the confession a blank space or the word \u201cdeleted.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>523 U.S. at 188, 118 S.Ct. 1151. In <em>Gray, </em>Anthony Bell confessed to the police that he, Gray, and another man, who subsequently died, participated in the beating that caused the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Stacy Williams. <em>Id. </em>The State tried Bell and Gray jointly. <em>Id. </em>When the trial judge permitted the State to introduce a redacted version of Bell\u2019s confession, the detective who read it to the jury said \u201cdeleted\u201d or \u201cdeletion\u201d whenever the name of Gray or the deceased participant appeared. <em>Id. </em>Immediately after the police detective read the redacted confession to the jury, the State asked, \u201cafter he gave you that information, you subsequently were able to arrest [Gray]; is that correct?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188-89, 118 S.Ct. 1151. The detective responded, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 118 S.Ct. 1151. The State also introduced into evidence a written copy of the confession with those two names omitted, leaving in their place blank white spaces separated by commas. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Considering <em>Bruton, </em>and a later case, <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987), the Supreme Court held that a redaction that \u201creplaces a defendant\u2019s name with an obvious indication of deletion, such as a blank space, the word \u2018deleted,\u2019 or a similar symbol ... falls within <em>Bruton\u2019s </em>protective rule.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>523 U.S. at 192, 118 S.Ct. 1151. That is not the situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In the present case, the redacted statements do not implicate co-respondents. First, there was testimony that there were at least 40 students on the bus when the attacks occurred. The testimony also established that not all of the juveniles involved in the attacks were parties to the adjudicatory proceedings. Contrary to appellants\u2019 contention, it is not clear that the statements were \u201conly redacted to omit reference to the juveniles who were on trial.\u201d In fact, it is not at all clear from the redacted statements who, if anyone, was being implicated. We do not agree that the blanked out passages would cause the court to infer participation of any one individual based on the omissions from the statements, and the redacted statements do not, on their face, inculpate any individual. We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">8.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Finally, appellants argue that the court erred when it sustained the State\u2019s objection to its attempted use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>document to refresh Mr. Ennis\u2019s recollection regarding whether he had contact with the police on October 18, 2007. They argue, first, that it \u201cis clear that the trial court was incorrect in ruling that a party \u2018can\u2019t [use] a document he didn\u2019t prepare to refresh his recollection ...,\u201d and, second, that as \u201cone of the key issues at trial was the credibility of Mr. Ennis and Ms. Kreager,\u201d an \u201cadmission from Mr. Ennis that he had provided false information to the police ... would have an obvious impact in assessing the veracity of the information provided to police on ... December 4, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The State counters, initially, that appellants\u2019 argument is not preserved because \u201ccounsel failed to bring to the court\u2019s attention the court\u2019s apparent misstatement with regard to using a document to refresh the witness\u2019s recollection,\u201d i.e., because the court \u201cconfused the distinction between the doctrine of present recollection refreshed, and that of past recollection recorded.\u201d Secondly, the State avers that \u201cno prejudice inured to the juveniles as a result of the court\u2019s failure to permit counsel to refresh Ennis\u2019 recollection regarding his contact with police,\u201d because even if Mr. Ennis\u2019s memory could have been refreshed, that evidence still would have been inadmissible based on the trial court\u2019s prior ruling that an arrest could not be used to impeach a witness\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Furthermore, the \u201conly testimony which may have benefitted the juveniles would be Ennis\u2019 refreshed recollection that he did, in fact, use an alias when he came into contact with police,\u201d and it was stipulated that Mr. Ennis had give the name \u201cTroy Stenson to a police officer\u201d on a prior occasion. We agree with the State on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Initially, we note that any confusion on the part of the court between the doctrine of present recollection refreshed and that of past recollection recorded notwithstanding, <em>see Butler v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 345, 667 A.2d 999 (1995), as we explained above, the court had already appropriately ruled that Ms. Kreager\u2019s arrest, at the same time and under the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>circumstances as Mr. Ennis\u2019s arrest, could not be used to impeach the witness, and that the facts of the arrest were irrelevant and collateral to the issues before the court. The same principle applies to Mr. Ennis\u2019s arrest. Moreover, however, even if the court would have allowed Mr. Ennis\u2019s recollection to be refreshed, the only testimony which may have benefited appellants would have been his refreshed recollection that he did, in fact, use an alias when he came into contact with police. This evidence was before the trier of fact, both through the testimony of Officer McCarty, and through the stipulation that Mr. Ennis gave the name \u201cTroy Stenson\u201d to a police officer on October 18. Thus, any error was harmless. <em>See Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-11\">.
