To some extent, the issues are muddled because we have two judicial trains running largely on parallel tracks, with different engineers. As we shall see, however, in this matter the tracks have crossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">On June 4, 2004, the County Executive of Anne Arundel County filed a Complaint with the Commission against appellees, claiming that they violated Public Ethics Law, Article 9, \u00a7 5-105 <em>(\u201c </em>\u00a7 9-5-105\u201d) of the Anne Arundel County Code (the predecessor to \u00a7 7-5-105 of the County Code).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a hearing that began in November 2005, the Commission found in the County\u2019s favor. It issued an Order on March 13, 2006 (the \u201cOrder\u201d), requiring appellees to cease their participation in the litigation against the County and to accept no further compensation for their work. The circuit court subsequently affirmed (Harris, Jr., J.). However, in related litigation, the circuit court (Caroom, J.) denied the County\u2019s motion to disqualify Scheibe from his role as counsel for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Because appellees allegedly failed to comply with the Commission\u2019s Order, the Commission filed in the circuit court a \u201cPetition for Permanent Injunctive Relief, Imposition of Fines and Other Appropriate Relief\u2019 (the \u201cPetition\u201d). At issue here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>is the circuit court\u2019s ruling on December 28, 2007, denying the Petition (Harris, Jr., J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Appellant presents three questions for our review, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">I. Did the circuit court err by applying traditional equitable principles in a case involving a statutory injunction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">II. Did the circuit court err by reconsidering and relying upon matters that are barred by res judicata?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">III. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion or err as a matter of law by relying on laches, hardship to private litigants, the failure of the Ethics Commission to pursue alternative remedies through the Attorney Grievance Commission, and other factors set forth in its decision?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Scheibe and Dvorak each worked for the County for many years, in various capacities. Among other positions, Scheibe served as County Attorney for three years, beginning in 1967, and again from December 1994 until May 1999, when he retired. Dvorak worked for the County for about 23 years, including service as the Director of the Department of Planning and Code Enforcement. He also served as the Chief Administrative Officer from 1994 until his retirement in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">The underlying matter is rooted in the case of <em>Halle Development, Inc., et al. v. Anne Arundel County, </em>Case No. C-2001-69418-AA, a class action suit. Suit was filed on February 21, 2001, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, by Greiber &amp; Scheibe, the law firm in which Scheibe is a principal (sometimes referred to as the <em>\u201cHalle </em>litigation\u201d or \u201cthe impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>fee\u201d litigation).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Scheibe entered his appearance as co-counsel for the <em>Halle </em>plaintiffs on December 13, 2002. The suit alleged that, between 1988 and 1996, Anne Arundel County mishandled and unlawfully used the development impact fees it collected. Greiber &amp; Scheibe hired Dvorak in 2000, before filing the impact fee suit, to examine the County\u2019s public financial records. <em>See Dvorak, </em>400 Md. at 447-48, 929 A.2d 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">On December 15, 2006, in the <em>Halle </em>case, the circuit court entered judgment against the County in the amount of $4,719,359, with five percent interest, measured from the date of payment of each fee. The circuit court also awarded attorneys\u2019 fees, equal to thirty percent of the total recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">On June 4, 2004, some three years after the <em>Halle </em>case began, and about eighteen months after Scheibe entered his appearance, the County Executive, Janet Owens, filed an ethics complaint with the Commission (the \u201cComplaint\u201d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> alleging violations of Public Ethics Law \u00a7 9-5-105 of the County Code, based on appellees\u2019 participation in the <em>Halle </em>litigation. Owens averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">In my opinion, the actions of former County Attorney Phillip F. Scheibe and former Chief Administrative Officer and Director of Planning <em>&amp; </em>Code Enforcement Robert Dvorak in assisting and representing plaintiffs in certain cases against the County, constitute violations of the Anne Arundel County Public Ethics Law. While employed by the county, [appellees] participated substantially in matters that are now the subject of the litigation, and both had informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tion not generally available to the public when they undertook the assistance and the representation of the plaintiffs<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Section 9-5-105, on which Owens relied, provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOj\">\u00a7 5-105. Representation by former employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">(a) A former employee may not assist or represent a party other than the County in a case, contract, or other specific matter for compensation if the matter involves the County and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">(1) the former employee participated significantly in the matter as an employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">(2) the former employee had information not generally available to the public when the former employee undertook the assistance or representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Notably, \u00a7 9-5-105 became effective on November 5, 2008, <em>after </em>appellees had retired from County service.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, it replaced \u00a7 9-3-109 of the County\u2019s Public Ethics Law, which was in effect during the time that appellees were employed by the County. Section 9-3-109 provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">\u00a7 3-109. Representation by former employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">(a) A former employee may not assist or represent a person in connection with a specific matter in which the former employee, as a County employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\">(1) acted on behalf of or represented the County in a matter involving substantial responsibility on the part of the employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>(2) with reference to which the former employee acquired information not generally available to the public when the former employee undertakes the assistance or representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Based on the ethics Complaint, the Agency issued subpoenas duces tecum to appellees, requiring them to appear for a deposition and produce documents. Scheibe and Dvorak responded with a \u201cMotion for Protective Order\u201d on August 20, 2004, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commission lacked jurisdiction over them and that it sought information relating to attorney work product that was \u201cnot subject to discovery.\u201d The Commission denied the motion on August 23, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Thereafter, on August 26, 2004, the Agency filed in the circuit court a \u201cPetition to Enforce a Subpoena.\u201d On August 30, 2004, appellees filed a \u201cPetition For Appeal\u201d in the circuit court, challenging the Commission\u2019s denial of their motion for protective order. They argued that Dvorak was hired \u201cfor the sole purpose of examining and reporting his findings only as regards the financial records of Anne Arundel County, which are public records and are readily available to any citizen\u201d; that thjfe Complaint \u201cas it relates to Phillip F. Scheibe [was] spacious\u201d; and that the Complaint was \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d Following a hearing on March 3, 2005, the court (Lemer, J.) issued an Order of that date, granting the Agency\u2019s petition to enforce the subpoenas and directing appellees to comply. When appellees failed to appear, the Agency filed a \u201cPetition for Civil Contempt.\u201d By Order dated June 16, 2005, the court (Hackner, J.) found Scheibe and Dvorak in constructive civil contempt of the Order of March 3, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">As to the ethics Complaint, Dvorak and Scheibe filed a motion with the Commission on November 10, 2005, seeking its dismissal. They argued that the documents on which the Complaint was based are public and are not \u201cprivileged or confidential.\u201d They also averred that \u201cit was not possible for them to receive a fair and impartial hearing before the Commission\u201d; that the Commission lacked jurisdiction over matters of professional misconduct applicable to Scheibe; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u00a7 9-5-105 is \u201cvague, arbitrary and capacious [sic] in that it is devoid of any reasonable provisions that limit the amount of time the Commission may exercise its jurisdiction [after] a former employee\u2019s departure from County service.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">The Commission held an evidentiary hearing over the course of several days in November 2005, December 2005, and January 2006, pursuant to the County\u2019s Public Ethics Law, Article 9, \u00a7 4-102(d) (stating that \u201cthe Commission shall proceed to a hearing on the complaint, conducted in accordance with this title\u201d). James Cannelli, an employee of the Planning and Zoning Department; Yolanda Takesian, a former Planning and Zoning Department employee; Gregory Nourse, a former Budget Office employee; and Raymond Elwell, the assistant Budget Officer who worked with Dvorak on the capital budget when Dvorak became Chief Administrative Officer, testified regarding Dvorak\u2019s work with the County and his involvement in the impact fee program. In addition, Robert Pollock, Assistant County Attorney, testified that when Scheibe was County Attorney, he asked Pollock to research and present him with a written opinion concerning the County\u2019s impact fee law. The parties also introduced numerous exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the Commission asked the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Although the Agency submitted proposed findings, appellees failed to do so. Instead, on March 7, 2006, appellees\u2019 counsel filed a \u201cSupplemental Motion for Dismissal,\u201d claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellees could not \u201cbe charged for ethics violations of law or applicable standards which were nonexistent [sic] during their terms of employment with the County, nor can the Commission assume jurisdiction over [them] for charges based upon laws and standards that were recently enacted subsequent to their retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">On March 13, 2006, the Commission issued its \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\u201d (\u201cFindings\u201d), a 35-page document that addressed numerous issues. It determined that it had jurisdiction to consider whether appellees\u2019 involvement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the <em>Halle </em>litigation \u201cviolated any provision of the current Public Ethics Law, notwithstanding the fact that [appellees] left County employment before 2003____\u201d Moreover, it found, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellees did not \u201cestablish any substantive differences between the law that was applicable to [appellees] prior to 2003 [i.e., \u00a7 9-3-109] and the law that is applicable to them afterwards [i.e., \u00a7 9-5-105]\u201d ... because \u201c[t]he 2003 amendments did not remove the restrictions placed on the [appellees\u2019] post-employment activities by the earlier Public Ethics Law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">The introductory language of prior \u00a7 3-109(a), \u201cA former employee may not assist or represent a <em>person in connection </em>with a specific matter ...,\u201d was changed to \u201cA former employee may not assist or represent a <em>party other than the county in a case, contract, or other </em>specific matter <em>for compensation </em>----\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cPerson\u201d was merely clarified to mean \u201cparty other than the county,\u201d and ... the addition of the terms \u201ccase\u201d and \u201ccontract\u201d provides more fact scenarios to which post-employment restrictions apply. By contrast the addition of \u201cfor compensation\u201d narrows the overall applicability of the provision ... for purposes of this proceeding the Commission finds these changes have no substantive effect on this case.<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">In addition, the Commission found that Dvorak was a former employee of the County within the meaning of \u00a7 9-5-105, as well as former \u00a7 9-3-109, and that he had been paid \u201cabout $2500 to date for his assistance in the <em>[Halle] </em>case.\u201d Further, it determined that Dvorak possessed knowledge of the County\u2019s impact fee program, gathered from his \u201cvarious capacities as the director of the Department of Inspections and Permits, the Planning and Zoning Officer, the Director of Planning and Code Enforcement, and as the Chief Administrative Officer of the County----\u201d It also determined that, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>County employee, Dvorak had acquired information not available to the public, within the meaning of both \u00a7 9-5-105(a)(2) and former \u00a7 9-3-109(a)(2).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the Commission found that he \u201cparticipated \u2018significantly in\u2019 (within the meaning of present \u00a7 5-105) and had \u2018substantial responsibility for\u2019 (within the meaning of former \u00a7 3-109) the specific matter at issue [in the <em>Halle </em>case], i.e., the County\u2019s administration of the impact fee program, while he was an employee of the County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The Commission also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">In the present case, the factual findings support the conclusion that Mr. Dvorak significantly participated on a regular basis in the administration of the impact fee program. His participation involved precisely the same matters that are involved in the <em>[Halle] </em>case____ Mr. Dvorak\u2019s participation in the administration of the impact fee program encompassed several years of regular managerial decision-making. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">As to Scheibe, the Commission found that when he was the County Attorney, he asked Assistant County Attorney Robert Pollock to \u201creview the County\u2019s impact fee law to determine if in fact the County could use impact fees ... for renovation of existing facilities in the County\u2019s existing school buildings.\u201d Mr. Pollock submitted a written opinion to Scheibe on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>subject. Based on this testimony, the Commission determined that \u201cMr. Scheibe participated \u2018significantly in\u2019 (within the meaning of present \u00a7 5-105) and had \u2018substantial responsibility for\u2019 (within the meaning of former \u00a7 3-109) the specific matter, i.e., the County\u2019s administration of impact fees, as an employee of the county.\u201d It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">Mr. Scheibe\u2019s participation was more limited [than that of Mr. Dvorak], but equally significant. Mr. Scheibe\u2019s solicitation of a legal opinion from Mr. Pollock effectively constituted a review of an important legal issue in the <em>[Halle] </em>case. While Mr. Scheibe claims that his involvement was at best \u201cinaction,\u201d the legal conclusion of the memo provided \u201cassistance\u201d in the formulation of the allegations in the <em>[Halle] </em>complaint that the County misused impact fee money for renovation and remodeling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">The Commission also found that appellees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abo\">were in positions of responsibility with the County, they were decision makers with access to other decision makers, and they both participated in the resolution of impact fees issues. They had information, albeit not necessarily documentary, that was not generally available to the public when, in 2002, they undertook to assist and represent the plaintiffs in [the <em>Halle </em>litigation] ... As long-time, experienced County employees, Mr. Dvorak and Mr. Scheibe should have been aware of the post-employment restrictions and other provisions of the Public Ethics Law, part of the County Code that they were obliged to uphold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The Commission concluded that appellees \u201cviolated \u00a7 5-105 of the Public Ethics Law with regard to their participation and assistance rendered in the <em>[Halle] </em>case.\u201d Notably, it also said: \u201cTo the extent it may be applicable here to actions prior to 2003, we reach the same conclusion under former \u00a7 3-109.\u201d On the same date (March 13, 2006), the Commission issued an \u201cOrder of Compliance.\u201d It directed Scheibe \u201cto terminate his participation and assistance to the plaintiffs\u201d in the <em>Halle </em>litigation, and \u201cto accept no further compensation for the assistance he has already provided to the plaintiffs____\u201d As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>to Dvorak, the Commission recognized that he \u201cmay have concluded the bulk of his assistance to the plaintiffs,\u201d but ordered him \u201cto terminate his participation and assistance to the plaintiffs,\u201d and not to accept any further compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Scheibe and Dvorak subsequently sought judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Findings and Order, pursuant to Code, \u00a7 7-4-105. They argued that the Commission lacked jurisdiction because \u00a7 9-5-105 was not in effect during their employment with the County, and the Agency \u201cfailed to produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of possible violations of the Anne Arundel County Ethics laws.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In their \u201cMemorandum Pursuant to Rule 7-207,\u201d appellees asked the circuit court to reverse the Commission\u2019s \u201cFindings.\u201d They argued that counsel for the County in the <em>Halle </em>case, Linda Schuett, admitted at the hearing before the Commission that, \u201cfrom day one,\u201d she knew of appellees\u2019 \u201calleged prior involvement in impact fees\u201d and yet \u201cbrought no such evidence\u201d to the attention of the court during the class certification hearing in 2003 (Davis-Loomis, J.). As a result of Ms. Schuett\u2019s \u201cinaction,\u201d claimed appellees, the Commission was foreclosed by waiver. Further, appellees averred that they were not afforded due process because the County Executive, who initiated the ethics Complaint, appointed the members of the Commission and asked them to resolve a dispute in which the County Executive had a vested interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In its response, the Agency argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commission had jurisdiction over appellees under both \u00a7 9-5-105 and its predecessor, \u00a7 9-3-109, and that, in any event, any changes in the law were \u201cpurely stylistic\u201d and \u201cinsubstantial.\u201d If anything, claimed the Agency, the current provision \u201cimpos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>es a more onerous burden of proof on complainants.\u201d The Agency also insisted that appellees \u201ccould not have relied <em>in good faith </em>on the inactivity of the County in pursuing ethical misconduct\u201d because, as cabinet level officers in County government, knowledge of the ethics law was imputed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In the meantime, on May 8, 2006 (almost two months after the Commission issued its Order of March 13, 2006, and while the judicial review action was pending), the County filed in the <em>Halle </em>litigation a \u201cMotion to Disqualify\u201d Scheibe and his law firm as counsel for the plaintiffs, pursuant to the Maryland Lawyers\u2019. Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d). <em>See </em>MRPC 1.9, \u201cDuties to Former Clients\u201d; MRPC 1.11, \u201cSpecial Conflicts of Interest For Former and Current Government Officers and Employees.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In opposition, Scheibe argued that the County had waived any right to disqualification because of its inordinate delay, measured from the institution of suit in 2001 to the filing of the motion to disqualify in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The circuit court heard the motion to disqualify <em>before </em>it ruled on appellee\u2019s petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Order of March 13, 2006. Because the appeal of the Commission\u2019s Order had not yet been decided, the County did not ask the judge in the impact fee matter \u201cto apply the Commission\u2019s Order.\u201d <em>Anne Arundel County v. Halle, supra, </em>No. 2552, slip op. at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">On June 5, 2006, in the <em>Halle </em>case, the circuit court (Ca-room, J.) denied the County\u2019s motion to disqualify Scheibe and his law firm. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">[T]he County chose to delay this filing more than five years until 2006. The Ethics Commission investigation and opinion added little to the motion\u2019s factual basis. Even if the Ethics Commission investigation were construed as an appropriate and necessary first step for the filing of the motion, there is no sufficient explanation of why that investigation was delayed for three years</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>... This Court finds that the County waived its right to ask for the removal of Plaintiffs [sic] counsel due to the inordinate delay in seeking this drastic remedy [of disqualifying counsel].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The court also noted that it had to \u201cconsider additional factors embodied in the Rules and case law which were not considered by the Ethics Commission\u201d and that appellees \u201cmay contest the Commission\u2019s fact finding in that separate litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">As noted, the circuit court awarded a judgment of $4,719,359 against the County in the <em>Halle </em>litigation, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees to counsel for the plaintiffs. In its appeal from that judgment, the County challenged, <em>inter alia, </em>the circuit court\u2019s denial of its motion to disqualify Scheibe. In an unreported opinion, a panel of this Court stated: \u201cWe find no reversible error on the part of the circuit court in its denial of disqualification____\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See Anne Arundel County v. Halle, </em>No. 2552, <em>supra, </em>slip op. at 37. Writing for the panel, Judge Rodowsky explained, <em>id. </em>at 36:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">[T]he circuit court focused on the acknowledgment by the County Attorney in her affidavit that she was aware that the files in her office contained documents relating to impact fees that had been addressed to Scheibe or on which he was copied. It found no explanation why the County had not earlier initiated its investigation by examining its own files or by interviewing holdover staff. In addition, the circuit court placed heavy emphasis on the factor of prejudice to Owners. It said: \u201cThere can be no question that, as this case draws nearer to its conclusion, after dozens of dispositive motions, thousands of pages of transcripts, two interlocutory appeals, etc., that obtaining new Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for this class action would be difficult, costly, and very time consuming.\u201d Based on its consideration of all of the factors stated above, the court found that, due to inordinate delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>on its part, the County had waived its right to seek disqualification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The panel reasoned, slip op. at 87:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">We find no reversible error on the part of the circuit court in its denial of disqualification sought under the MRPCs. First, we do not interpret the court\u2019s reference to ruling as a matter of law to mean that the court believed that it lacked discretion to grant the motion. Indeed, in a footnote to its opinion, the circuit court observed that if the motion had been filed promptly in 2001 \u201cthe result likely would have been the opposite.\u201d ... We hold ... that the procedure followed by the trial court was, in effect, governed by Maryland Rule 2-502.n Disqualification was a separate issue that was decided under Rule 2-502, which permits the court to draw inferences from the facts presented. The finding of inordinate delay was not clearly erroneous. Substitution of new counsel for Owners, in litigation that has been pending for almost seven years, that has produced eight file boxes of court records, undoubtedly even more volume for the files of Counsel, and 6,568 pages of record extract, would have extended the delay in the resolution of this matter, increased expense, and further reduced the fund to be distributed to Owners.

Noting that appellees had the burden to \u201cshow by clear and satisfactory evidence that the Commission\u2019s decision is illegal or unreasonable,\u201d Judge Harris said: \u201cIt is not this court\u2019s role to substitute its judgment for the expertise of the [Commission] in reviewing the Commission\u2019s Findings....\u201d On September 11, 2006, appellees filed a \u201cMotion to Alter, Amend\u201d the Order of August 30, 2006, arguing that the court failed to consider numerous issues that they had raised in their May 25, 2006 memorandum. The court denied the motion on October 4, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Appellees appealed the circuit court\u2019s ruling in the ethics case to this Court on October 16, 2006. Before this Court considered the matter, the Court of Appeals granted certiorari, 397 Md. 396, 918 A.2d 468 (2007). But, the Court subsequently dismissed the appeal, for lack of appellate jurisdiction. <em>See Dvorak, supra, </em>400 Md. 446, 929 A.2d 185. In its opinion of July 31, 2007, the Court of Appeals pointed to Md.Code (2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which states: \u201cUnless a right to appeal is expressly granted by law, \u00a7 12-301 of this subtitle does not permit an appeal from a final judgment of a court entered ... in reviewing the decision of the District Court, an administrative agency, or a local legislative body.\u201d The Court explained that there is \u201cno provision of Anne Arundel County law that confers a right of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in this kind of case____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 929 A.2d 185. Moreover, it stated that Dvorak and Scheibe \u201cfailed to raise any question concerning the Circuit Court\u2019s jurisdiction \u2018to sit in review of such a judgment____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 929 A.2d 185 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">On September 10, 2007, pursuant to County Code \u00a7 7-8-101 and \u00a7 7-8-102,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the Agency filed in circuit court a \u201cPetition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>for Permanent Injunctive Relief, Imposition of Fines, and Other Appropriate Relief\u2019 (the \u201cPetition\u201d), to \u201ccompel compliance\u201d with the Commission\u2019s Order of March 13, 2006. In its Petition, the Agency averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">Dvorak and Scheibe have been in violation of the ethics law on a continuous basis beginning on February 1, 2001 and continuing through the present time, for a minimum total of approximately 2040 days, with each day constituting a separate violation of the law ... The [appellees] are continuing to assist and represent the plaintiffs in the <em>Halle </em>case as evidenced by [an] affidavit ... and [other] accompanying documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Agency asked the court to permanently enjoin appellees \u201cfrom continuing to assist and/or represent the plaintiffs in the <em>Halle </em>case\u201d; enjoin them from accepting any compensation from or on behalf of the plaintiffs; require them to \u201cdisgorge any and all compensation received to date\u201d from the <em>Halle </em>case; and to impose a civil fine of an \u201cappropriate amount up to $1,000.00 for each day the violation occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Appellees moved to dismiss the Petition on September 24, 2007. They argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction, and claimed that the request violated Articles 17, 19, and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Appellees also claimed that the Commission\u2019s Order of March 13, 2006, was \u201cbarred under the doctrines of waiver, judicial estoppel, and preclusion,\u201d and was \u201cmooted\u201d by Judge Caroom\u2019s Order of June 5, 2006, denying the County\u2019s motion to disqualify Scheibe.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>On December 18, 2007, the circuit court (Harris, Jr., J.) held a motion hearing. The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">THE COURT: [Bjecause the County was so long in filing to get this whole thing started Judge Caroom, I believe, ruled that it would be prejudicial to the Plaintiffs [in the <em>Halle </em>litigation] to toss their attorneys out 80 percent into the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor, but what he said was that the County had waived its right to pursue any conflict of interest. We are not the County. We were not party to the case. We had no chance to argue that case. The ethics law was not a question in that case. The ethics law was not even involved in that case. We weren\u2019t party to that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">THE COURT: [H]ere is the problem I am having. If I were to go ahead and grant your injunction, which you may be entitled to, quite frankly because this [ethics] case has run its course. It went up [to] the Appellate Court ... it went to the highest Appellate Court and they said that the appeal was dismissed. So my decision stands in that regard, but if I were to grant your injunction, wouldn\u2019t that undermine what Judge Caroom already has in the works?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor, because Judge Caroom\u2019s decision [to deny the motion to disqualify] was based on waiver and waiver only applies to the government when it\u2019s a corporate decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged that \u201cafter four years it doesn\u2019t seem to have much value to impose an injunction ... it doesn\u2019t have any practical purpose ... The <em>[Halle] </em>case is almost over.\u201d She indicated that appellant\u2019s primary concern was that appellees \u201caren\u2019t unjustly enriched because of this egregious violation,\u201d asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">Now they have, knowing since 2004 that this was a problem, continued to participate in this case. To me, if they are getting attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness fees, it would be totally inappropriate. They have violated the ethics law. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>you look at the findings of fact and conclusions of law, which you affirmed, those violations are egregious, absolutely phenomenally so. For them to receive profit as a result of those actions, would absolutely make the ethics law worthless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The court asked if appellant meant for it to be an \u201call-or-nothing proposition,\u201d by which appellees would get no compensation for their work on the <em>Halle </em>litigation. Appellant\u2019s counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">That\u2019s right and they should not have started this work. I daresay Mr. Scheibe, having been a former County attorney and Mr. Dvorak, having been a cabinet member should have known darn well that they were not legally permitted to get involved in this kind of situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">Now the fact that they chose to ignore the law and they chose to fight us for the last four years, does not mean that it is okay for them now, because they have worked so hard, to get their attorney\u2019s fees and their witness fees for this. They have been perpetuating the wrong that they have started in\u2014that Mr. Scheibe and Mr. Dvorak got involved in less than two years after they left the County government. They knew what they were getting into and they have been wrong from the get go.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Appearing <em>pro se, </em>Scheibe argued, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">I don\u2019t believe this Court has the right to grant the [appellant\u2019s] request for relief and there are two salient reasons in particular as to why this request for permanent injunctive relief must be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">The first centers on the legal effect of Judge Caroom\u2019s opinion and order of June the 5th of 2006, which if the relief sought is granted would effectively render Judge Caroom\u2019s opinion and order null and void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">Anne Arundel County, the government of Anne Arundel County, elected in the <em>Halle </em>class action litigation to file a motion to disqualify counsel for participating in the litigation based exclusively upon the Ethics Commission\u2019s administrative findings. There were no other facts----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>[O]f course you know the Court rejected that. The [appellant] now argues they are not bound by the doctrines of res judicata or judicial estoppel or preclusion because the [appellant] is not a party to the <em>Halle </em>case, but if it may please the Court, how is it possible that they are not a party to the <em>Halle </em>case? Isn\u2019t the Anne Arundel County Ethics Commission a part of the Anne Arundel County government? Isn\u2019t the <em>Halle </em>class action case against the same County government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">The Ethics Commission is a political body that is appointed by the County executive and the County executive was Janet Owens and it was she who filed the ethics charges against the [appellees]---- She was filing ethics charges on behalf of the Anne Arundel County government, not anybody else \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">\u20221* H' ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">So now the question before the Court is, can the Anne Arundel County\u2019s Ethics Commission administrative decision take precedence over Judge Caroom\u2019s order and opinion of June the 5th of 2006. Bear in mind, the Ethics Commission findings were dated March 13, 2006____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">Secondly, under what theory of law may this Court claim it has the jurisdictional authority to grant injunctive relief which would effectively discipline an officer of this Court by preventing him from engaging in pending litigation, which has been granted by another Circuit Court judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">\u2022 Scheibe accused appellant\u2019s counsel of asking the court to \u201cback door it\u201d by having Judge Harris tell Judge Caroom that appellees can no longer participate in the <em>Halle </em>case. Scheibe also reiterated arguments advanced in his earlier submissions regarding jurisdiction, ex post facto application of the County Code provisions, the availability of information to the public, and the lack of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">Counsel for Dvorak stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-15\">[W]hat we are looking at is the ability to file the Ethics complaint four years later, in July of 2004 unless they have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>waived that right and that is what Judge Caroom said. That is cutting to the chase. That is exactly what he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">We come back and on January of 2003 and 4, before another member of this bench there was a class action certification hearing. An amazing thing occurred there, Mr. Scheibe voir dire [sic] and qualified Mr. Dvorak and the County was present, no objection----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">Did one of your counterparts, an associate Judge of this bench, Nancy Davis-Loomis address that issue? She sure did. In her opinion she said as follows, \u201cThe qualifications of Plaintiffs counsel are fully outlined in the motion for class certification and the subsequent response: they are more than adequate. The County does not dispute the ability or the experience of Plaintiffs attorneys.\u201d She said this too in the body of her opinion, \u201cThe Court is directed to look for an absence of conflict of interest as well as vigor, experience and diligence of counsel. No conflict of interest has been brought to the attention of this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Noting that the County Executive did not file her ethics Complaint until after the circuit court ruled on the liability of the County in the <em>Halle </em>litigation,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Dvorak\u2019s counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-C\">They said, \u201cHey file an ethics complaint. We will bootstrap that to a later motion to disqualify and we will get rid of everybody,\u201d but they got sidetracked a little bit because Judge Caroom wouldn\u2019t buy that. He asked the same thing, \u201cWhy, when you had in your files from day one and you admit knowledge of day one, did you not look at it, did you not call somebody?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>It is the Plaintiffs who suffer in [the Halle] case. Because of what? Because of the County\u2019s inability to bring this timely. They have waived it. They are estopped. Whether you look at an issue preclusion, judicial preclusion, they simply have no ability to bring the ethics complaint in the first instance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Dvorak\u2019s counsel acknowledged the court\u2019s comment that perhaps Scheibe and Dvorak should have realized that their involvement in the <em>Halle </em>case might be problematic. But, he argued: \u201cWhy did not the County object when they first knew of their employment in that case? ... You can\u2019t simply sit by, draw somebody in and after the liability hammer drops, come out and say \u201cWe are now offended by your participation in the case.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In response, appellant\u2019s counsel maintained that the Commission is an independent body, separate from the County, pursuant to Article X, \u00a7 1001 of the Anne Arundel County Charter.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> She also averred that the Commission merely responded to a Complaint, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">The Ethics Commission received this complaint in 2004, which was scarcely two years after Mr. Scheibe says he entered his appearance for <em>Halle. </em>Under a statute of limitations that would be under three years. Under laches that would be less than three years. The Ethics Commission responded to a complaint it received. By law, that is all the Commission can do. It must take a complaint. It must investigate it and it must pursue it. That is what the Ethics Commission did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">The Ethics Commission was not a party to <em>Halle. </em>They were not sued by Mr. Scheibe or Mr. Dvorak. They were not privy to any of the pleadings filed in that case. The fact of the matter is the Ethics Commission did not know that case was going on. God help us if we are responsible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>know every County action that is going on without being told.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">In addition, appellant\u2019s counsel pointed out that Judge Harris had affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision that appellees had \u201cviolated the ethics law, that they had participated significantly as employees, turned around and sued the County and that they had information not available to the public when they did so.\u201d Further, she argued that the Commission cannot go to the AGC and complain about Scheibe\u2019s conduct because the Commission\u2019s job is not to enforce the Professional Rules of Conduct. Rather, its job is to enforce the post-employment provisions of the County\u2019s ethics law. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">THE COURT: Think about who is going to be harmed by this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The citizens of the County Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">THE COURT: [The Halle] Plaintiffs, [appellees\u2019] clients are going to be harmed by it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And so are the citizens of the County. If these Respondents receive their attorney\u2019s fees. If the citizens of this County are told \u201cWell yeah, they violated the ethics law, but you know they have been working on this case so long they ought to get paid for it.\u201d What does that tell the County citizens? That\u2019s okay, charge them with an ethics law violation, but let\u2019s get real here, that doesn\u2019t matter____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">The following exchange is also noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">THE COURT: ... When you calculated th[e] amount of days that you want me to sanction them on, are you going back to the period of time where they first started representing their clients in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-13\">THE COURT: [E]ven when your client was lax in pursuing this? That is like sitting back and waiting for someone to do all the work and then coming in at the last minute and pulling the rug out from under them. It makes no sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The Anne Arundel County executive is not our client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">THE COURT: Well, who is your client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The people of Anne Arundel County, the citizens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">THE COURT: There has already been a decision all of the way up the ladder that they are in violation. That\u2019s not\u2014 [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So what you are saying is that Yes, they have been working so long in this, you know, how can I deny them all of this money they earned even though they violated the ethics law clearly. You know that is no big deal.\u2019 That is what you will be saying if you don\u2019t sanction them in some significant way. You will be saying that their unethical conduct pales in comparison to the work they put into this lawsuit and the fees that they should be earning____ That certainly is not what the ethics law is about.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Dvorak\u2019s counsel asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">Again, to me the salient issue, if I were sitting in your position is, does her client, the County executive on behalf of the County have the ability to initiate the complaint and she clearly did not because Judge Caroom said: \u2018You waived that right.\u201d You have to initiate your response from day one. You can\u2019t just sit idly by and wait to see how things shake down and that is exactly what they did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">At the close of the hearing, Judge Harris delivered an oral ruling, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-13\">My involvement, I thought stopped at the point the Court of Appeals, the highest Appellate Court had basically dismissed the appeal. Now I am being asked today to, in effect, punish the Petitioners in this case and the punishment that the County or the Ethics Commission is asking is a rather Draconian punishment quite frankly, to make them forfeit all of their prior compensation that they may have earned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>I am sure this case was taken on some sort of a contingency fee. For them not to participate in the litigation while there is a case pending in our appellate courts right now and then the bitterness that has gone back and forth in this case between the people I am seeing today I think has compromised the true victims in this case and that is their clients, the litigants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">Whether it is Mr. Scheibe and Mr. Dvorak or another attorney and someone else pursuing this case, they, in all probability, would have prevailed but you are asking me to issue an injunction that quite frankly I am not inclined to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">I am not inclined to do it for several reasons.... <em>I feel, that if I were to go ahead, and grant your relief today that in effect I would be interfering with progress with Judge\u2019s Caroom\u2019s case because I think both of our orders would be in direct conflict with each other. </em>Maybe I would think differently if this case were just starting. You know, if this whole thing had\u2014because I think timeliness is something that permeates this entire case. Everything that has happened of any significant consequence seems to have been done in an untimely fashion and that includes the involvement when the ethics complaint was first filed, but that is something that I don\u2019t have to concern myself with today. There are innocent litigants in this case and I think if I were to grant your relief and the injunction, it would undermine everything that has progressed up to this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">I don\u2019t know whether Mr. Scheibe and Mr. Dvorak are going to eventually get paid in this case. <em>I don\u2019t know what other mechanism there would be to block their compensation, </em>but up until the last ten minutes of this argument, the whole thing has been going through my mind is the issue of the Attorney Grievance. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The court also said: \u201cThe fines I think is [sic] a very unreasonable request when it is in line with also asking them to forfeit their compensation that they may have already earned in this case.... This is a Court of equity and I just don\u2019t think that is the right thing to do under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>stances and the totality of everything that I know about this case.\u201d The court entered an Order denying the Petition on December 28, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"AEz\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">As noted, to \u201ccompel compliance\u201d with the Commission\u2019s Order of March 13, 2006, appellant filed its Petition, in which it sought injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 7-8-102.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Appellant contends that, in denying the Petition, the circuit court erred by applying traditional equitable principles to a matter involving a statutory injunction. Although the Commission concedes that it \u201cis generally true that a court sitting in equity has broad discretion to issue injunctive relief,\u201d it relies on <em>State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Talbot County Detention Ctr., </em>370 Md. 115, 803 A.2d 527 (2002), for the proposition that, \u201cwhen injunctive relief is sought pursuant to statutory authority, the court\u2019s discretion to grant or deny relief is more limited.\u201d The Commission argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">Judge Harris erred by failing to apply the appropriate statutory guidelines in rendering his decision. He failed to consider the public interest in ensuring the ethical conduct of government employees. He failed to consider the legislature\u2019s interest in proscribing and prohibiting unethical conduct. He failed to consider the legislature\u2019s mandate to enjoin unethical conduct. He failed to consider the irreparable harm that is inherent in a violation of a public ordinance and he failed to consider the Ethics Commission\u2019s inability to independently enforce the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Because the Commission\u2019s Order of March 13, 2006, was affirmed on judicial review, argues appellant, the Order \u201cbecame valid and binding upon Scheibe and Dvorak.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Commission posits that \u201cJudge Harris\u2019 refusal to grant injunctive relief means that there is <em>no </em>remedy available for Scheibe and Dvorak\u2019s violations of the ethics law. A violation of law without a remedy is the very definition of irreparable harm.\u201d In addition, appellant maintains that the Commission\u2019s \u201cenforcement authority \u2018would be inherently limited\u2019 without judicial action,\u201d and would enable appellees to \u201ccontinue to violate the law and [become] unjustly enriched as a result of their misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Asserting that the \u201cLegislature\u2019s interest in preventing and proscribing unethical conduct by government employees is ... beyond dispute,\u201d appellant insists that it \u201cestablished a violation of the ethics law,\u201d and that it sought an injunction to \u201cprotect the public interest.\u201d According to appellant, \u00a7 7-8-102 permits the circuit court to issue \u201can order to cease and desist\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cgrant other injunctive relief,\u201d but the court \u201cdoes not have the discretion to wholly disregard ... the public interest in enforcement.\u201d It contends that, \u201cwithout the benefit of judicial enforcement, its ability to compel compliance with the law is wholly non-existent [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Further, appellant argues that the court \u201cimproperly refused to grant injunctive relief on the erroneous assumption that the petition ... is an attempt to \u2018punish\u2019 Scheibe and Dvorak.\u201d According to the Commission, the court\u2019s \u201cdistress over the effect on Scheibe and Dvorak ultimately punish[es] the citizens-the real victims of this flagrant disregard of the Public Ethics Law.\u201d Appellant avers: \u201cWhile [its requested] relief may effectively deprive Scheibe and Dvorak of ill-gotten gains (whether it is considered punishment or justice) [enforcing the Petition] is at the heart of the administrative responsibility imposed upon the Ethics Commission by the General Assembly and the Anne Arundel County Council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Appellees counter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">The lower courts of Maryland have always had the authority to exercise sound discretion in determining whether to grant or deny requests for injunctive relief. The Appellant does not assert the lower court abused its inherent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>authority to exercise sound discretion, but more particularly proclaims, the lower court was simply without any such discretion whatsoever, and therefore, was duty bound to grant the injunctive relief sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">According to appellees, appellant \u201cwould have this Court adopt the irrational legal concept that any violation of a statutory or constitutional provision thereby mandates granting permanent injunctive relief, without the court\u2019s freedom to make an independent assessment of the equities, its jurisdiction and other matters of public interest.\u201d They argue that, if we were to adopt appellant\u2019s position, \u201cthe court would serve no useful purpose, except merely \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 any request for permanent injunctive relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In our view, the Commission\u2019s decision, finding that appellees violated the County\u2019s public ethics law, is now cast in stone; it was upheld by the circuit court and the Court of Appeals subsequently dismissed the appeal of that ruling. But, the companion ruling in the related case, denying the County\u2019s motion to disqualify Scheibe, is also cast in stone; the denial of the disqualification was affirmed by a panel of this Court, and the panel\u2019s decision was later affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, principles of res judicata apply to both rulings. <em>See R &amp; D 2001 v. Rice, </em>402 Md. 648, 663, 938 A.2d 839 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Therefore, we are satisfied that, in reaching its decision as to the Petition, the circuit court was entitled to consider the ruling of Judge Caroom in the parallel case. Nevertheless, to the extent that the circuit court focused on harm to appellees and the <em>Halle </em>plaintiffs, without considering the importance of the public interest in the enforcement of the public ethics laws, it erred or abused its discretion. Moreover, it erred or abused its discretion by failing to address an appropriate fee award or sanction for Scheibe and Dvorak. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">At the outset, we note that the \u00a7 7-1-102 of the Public Ethics Law provides, in part, that the County Council recognizes that the County\u2019s \u201csystem of representative government is dependent upon the people maintaining the highest trust in County officials and employees.... \u201d The County\u2019s ethics law derives from the analogous State statute. <em>See </em>S.G. \u00a7 15-101 <em>et. seq. </em>In enacting the State\u2019s Public Ethics Law, the General Assembly sought to ensure that \u201cthe people maintain! ] the highest trust in their government officials and employees,\u201d and to assure the \u201cimpartiality and independent judgment of those officials and employees----\u201d S.G. \u00a7 15-101(a). <em>See Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Gudis, </em>319 Md. 558, 575, 573 A.2d 1325 (1990) (stating that Montgomery County\u2019s ethics law, like the State\u2019s ethics law, \u201chas been read as manifesting the \u2018General Assembly\u2019s strong desire to assure the impartiality and independent judgment of public officials\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Further, the Legislature intended that the ethics provisions be \u201cliberally construed to accomplish this purpose.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 15-101(c). <em>See Carroll County Ethics Comm\u2019n v. Lennon, </em>119 Md.App. 49, 71, 703 A.2d 1338 (1998). As this Court said in <em>Lennon, </em>119 Md.App. at 64, 703 A.2d 1338, \u201c[i]t is almost axiomatic ... that the Ethics Commission is an agency that \u2018represents the interests of the public and the State in carrying out [its] duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Board of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs v.

Section 4 of Article 49B of the Maryland Code was at issue. It stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">At any time after a complaint has been filed, if the Commission believes that appropriate civil action is necessary to preserve the status of the parties or to prevent irreparable harm from the time the complaint is filed until the time of its final disposition, the Commission may bring action to obtain a temporary injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">After the circuit court denied the request for injunction, the MCHR appealed. In reversing, the Court of Appeals recognized that the MCHR is \u201can independent agency\u201d that is \u201ccharged with investigating complaints of discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations under Article 49B ... and bringing legal and equitable actions pertaining to those violations.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 122, 803 A.2d 527. We quote at length from the Court\u2019s analysis, <em>id </em>at 128-29, 803 A.2d 527:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">[T]he degree of discretionary authority a court maintains when considering injunctions sought pursuant to, and authorized by, a specific statute is a novel question, not explored by this Court to date. Federal jurisdictions, including the United States Supreme Court, have had the opportunity to consider the inherent differences that exist when a court is asked to issue injunctive relief under its equitable powers versus when the court entertains requests for injunctive relief pursuant to a specific statute and have outlined some considerations for determining whether equi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>table powers are usurped by statutory mandates. On one end of the spectrum, in <em>Tennessee </em>[Valley] <em>Authority v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978), the Supreme Court held that Congress, in the Endangered Species Act, clearly circumscribed the courts\u2019 jurisdiction in equity because the statute contained a blanket prohibition against \u201cjeopardiz[ing] the continued existence of endangered species;\u201d thus, upon a concession that the Tellico Dam would destroy the snail darter, the court was required to issue an injunction. <em>Id. </em>at 193-95, 98 S.Ct. at 2301-02, 57 L.Ed.2d at 146-47.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In other cases, however, the Supreme Court has refused to find that other statutes spawned an absolute duty upon courts to issue injunctive relief. Most recently, in <em>United States v. Oakland Cannibus [Cannabis] Buyers Co-op., </em>[532 U.S. 483, 121 S.Ct. 1711, 149 L.Ed.2d 722 (2001)], the Supreme Court emphasized that its ruling in <em>Hill [ supra, </em>437 U.S. 153, 98 S.Ct. 2279], i.e. that the District Court lacked discretion to deny an injunction, was based solely on the fact that an injunction in that case was the \u201conly means of ensuring compliance\u201d with the statute and the \u201corder of priorities\u201d established by Congress would otherwise be \u201cdeprived of effect.\u201d <em>Oakland Cannibus [Cannabis] Buyers Co-op., </em>532 U.S. at 496-97, 121 S.Ct. at 1721, 149 L.Ed.2d at 735-36. <em>See also [Weinberger v.] Romero-Barcelo, </em>456 U.S. [305,] 313, 102 S.Ct. [1798,] 1803, 72 L.Ed.2d [91], 99 [(1982)] (stating that while \u201cCongress may intervene and guide or control the exercise of the courts\u2019 discretion, ... we do not lightly assume that Congress has intended to depart from established principles [of equitable jurisdiction]\u201d)(internal quotations omitted). As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Romero-Barcelo, supra, </em>\u201c[t]he grant of jurisdiction to ensure compliance with a statute hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances, and a federal judge sitting as chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law.\u201d 456 U.S. at 313,102 S.Ct. at 1803, 72 L.Ed.2d at 99.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are not presented with requests to enjoin actions which violate the law; rather we are presented with requests to enjoin actions which arguably impede the Commission from performing a lawful task, i.e. conducting an uninhibited investigation, actions for which irreparable harm must be evidenced. Section 4 of Article 49B grants the Commission the power to bring a civil action for injunctive relief, outlines when and where such action can be brought, and further establishes the criteria under which an injunction may be sought and granted, i.e. \u201cto preserve the status of the parties or to prevent irreparable harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The Court concluded that although Article 49B \u201cdoes not expressly eliminate the circuit court\u2019s discretionary authority or expressly create an automatic injunction, it does, in a sense, \u2018narrow\u2019 the circuit court\u2019s discretionary authority by replacing the considerations in equity with the statutory criteria----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129-30, 803 A.2d 527. The Court considered \u201cthe propriety of the court\u2019s decision to deny injunctive relief with the understanding that the court\u2019s equitable discretion is limited to the extent that the Legislature articulated the applicable guidelines for injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 803 A.2d 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In an injunctive action of this type, when the legislation at issue is one that affects or pertains to the public interest, courts need not necessarily adhere to a traditional balancing of the equities. In <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, Inc., </em>337 Md. 441, 654 A.2d 449 (1995), a class action lawsuit, businesses, trade associations and tobacco companies sought an interlocutory injunction delaying implementation of a Division of Labor and Industries regulation prohibiting smoking in an enclosed workplace. <em>Id. </em>at 451-52, 654 A.2d 449. The circuit court granted the injunction. On appeal, the Court recognized that the \u201csubject regulation was promulgated by the Commissioner of the Division of Labor and Industry ... for the purpose of protecting Maryland employees from the hazards associated with environmental tobacco smoke.... \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 446-47, 654 A.2d 449.

There, the Carroll County Ethics Commission found that an attorney who was engaged in private practice and also sat as a County Official on the County\u2019s Planning and Zoning Commission violated the County\u2019s ethics laws by representing a client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>who was subject to regulation by the Zoning Commission. The Ethics Commission determined that Lennon\u2019s \u201cactions constituted \u2018malfeasance in office\u2019____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 703 A.2d 1338. Lennon filed a complaint for injunctive relief in the circuit court, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Ethics Commission erred as a matter of law in its interpretation of the Ethics Ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 52, 703 A.2d 1338. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the Ethics Commission. <em>Id. </em>After Lennon filed a motion for reconsideration, the court reversed itself and granted summary judgment in favor of Lennon, concluding that he did not violate the ethics law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The Commission appealed. Lennon argued that the case had become moot, because he had voluntarily resigned from the Zoning Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 703 A.2d 1338. Nonetheless, the Court reached the merits, because the case involved \u201c \u2018matters of public importance that are likely to recur if not decided now.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 703 A.2d 1338 (citation omitted). The Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 61, 703 A.2d 1338:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">We can think of few issues more important than the public\u2019s confidence in government officials. In ferreting out alleged ethical violations, the Carroll County Ethics Commission performs an essential public function. The issue is perhaps even more acute when it occurs, as in this case, at the local government level, where the government and its citizens have greater contact with one another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Turning to this case, \u00a7 7-8-102 does not articulate specific guidelines or criteria for the court\u2019s consideration with respect to a request for injunctive relief. Nor does it \u201cdirectly eliminate a court\u2019s discretion by mandating a certain outcome.\u201d <em>Talbot, </em>370 Md. at 130, 803 A.2d 527 (emphasis omitted). Put another way, \u00a7 7-8-102 enables the Commission to pursue compliance with ethics laws that promote the public interest, but the plain language of the provision does not <em>compel </em>such compliance. Rather, it states that a court <em>\u201cmay </em>compel compliance ...\u201d by providing certain remedies. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>461 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>U.S. 677, 706, 103 S.Ct. 2132, 76 L.Ed.2d 236 (1983), \u201c[t]he word \u2018may,\u2019 when used in a statute, usually implies some degree of discretion.\u201d <em>See also Spencer v.

The circuit court also expressed its view that the <em>Halle </em>plaintiffs would suffer if the court were to enforce the Commission\u2019s Petition, and that a decision granting the requested injunctive relief would \u201cpunish\u201d Scheibe and Dvorak. Yet, the court did not appear to consider the purpose of the County\u2019s ethics laws, which are intended to protect the citizens of Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Although the statutory language of \u00a7 7-8-102 does not require the court to grant injunctive relief upon a finding of a violation of the ethics laws, the court\u2019s decision must be based on a proper consideration of all the facts and circumstances. When a legislative body enacts a provision for the purpose of benefiting or protecting the public interest, the circuit court must consider the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">As Judge Rodowsky observed in <em>Anne Arundel County v. Halle, </em>No. 2552, <em>supra, </em>slip op. at 38-39, \u201cScheibe\u2019s unsuccess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ful efforts to overturn that order [of the Commission] have been exhausted.... The Circuit Court had no discretion or power to decline to enforce, <em>on waiver grounds, </em>the Commission\u2019s Order.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, the court should have considered \u201can appropriate manner of enforcing the Commission\u2019s order,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 39, even if it did not enforce the precise terms of that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Nor did Judge Harris explain how Judge Caroom\u2019s decision had any bearing on the enforcement of the Commission\u2019s Order as to Dvorak, who is not an attorney and was not subject to Judge Caroom\u2019s ruling. As to Dvorak, the circuit court erred because, in denying the Petition, it erroneously relied on Judge Caroom\u2019s ruling, denying the County\u2019s motion <em>to disqualify Scheibe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Notably, in his June 5, 2006 Opinion, Judge Caroom recognized that \u201cthe County\u2019s motion [to disqualify] cannot directly disqualify Robert Dvorak from being a witness as he does not act as an attorney or \u2018officer of the court.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, Judge Caroom recognized that the <em>Halle </em>litigation and the ethics litigation are \u201cseparate actions with separate issues,\u201d and he observed that he had to \u201cconsider additional factors embodied in the Rules [of Professional Conduct] and case law which were not considered by the Ethics Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Ethics Commission, an independent agency pursuant to Anne Arundel County Charter \u00a7 1001, was not a party in <em>Halle, </em>nor were the County\u2019s ethics laws at issue in that matter. And, as this Court pointed out in <em>Anne Arundel County, </em>No. 2552, slip op., at 34, \u201cThe circuit court, acting under the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct ... would have no basis for addressing Dvorak\u2019s conflict of interest____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In sum, we conclude that the circuit court erred in denying the Petition as to Dvorak, because it relied on the denial of the motion to disqualify, which pertained only to Scheibe. As to Dvorak, the Commission\u2019s Order of March 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>2006, was in force, as it had been affirmed by the circuit court, and the Court of Appeals later ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to consider a challenge to it. Thus, there was no impediment to the entry of an injunction barring Dvorak\u2019s participation in the case and acceptance of compensation. Therefore, we shall reverse the circuit court\u2019s ruling as to Dvorak.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">With regard to Scheibe, we agree with the circuit court that it was entitled to consider Judge Caroom\u2019s decision, in which he did not disqualify Scheibe.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the court should have considered an appropriate way to enforce the Commission\u2019s Findings, even if it was not coextensive with the sanctions set forth in the Commission\u2019s Order. We are confident that a sanction that includes adjustment of attorney\u2019s fees to Scheibe can be fashioned, which does not do indirectly what we have said cannot be done directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Accordingly, we shall reverse the circuit court\u2019s ruling as to Dvorak, vacate its ruling as to Scheibe, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The Commission also contends that the circuit court erred by considering issues that were \u201cpreviously litigated and are barred by res judicata.\u201d According to appellant, the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the Commission\u2019s Findings in its ruling of August 30, 2006, which became final on July 31, 2007, when the Court of Appeals dismissed appellees\u2019 appeal, \u201cis now an absolute bar as to all matters that were litigated in that proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Appellant claims that the court \u201cerred by reconsidering the timeliness (laches) of the Ethics Commission enforcement action----\u201d The Commission avers that this issue was \u201cproperly raised and rejected by Judge Harris during his judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Findings and Order,\u201d and it cannot be revisited.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In particular, appellant points out that appellees argued laches in their response to the Complaint; their \u201cMotion to Strike Petition for Contempt\u201d; their motion to dismiss the Complaint; their May 25, 2006 memorandum in support of their petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Findings and Order of March 13, 2006; and in their \u201cMotion to Alter/Amend\u201d the circuit court\u2019s judgment of August 30, 2006, affirming the Commission\u2019s Findings and Order of March 13, 2006. Despite Judge Caroom\u2019s finding that \u201cthe County had waived its right in the <em>Halle </em>proceeding to seek disqualification because of its delay in so doing,\u201d the Commission maintains that waiver based on delay is not applicable to the ethics proceedings. It states: \u201cBecause the issues of laches and equitable estoppel were already litigated and because rejecting this defense was \u2018essential to the judgment\u2019 affirming the Ethics Commission\u2019s Findings and Order, the issue is now conclusive in the present action on the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In their brief, appellees do not respond to appellant\u2019s contentions regarding <em>res judicata. </em>Instead, they reiterate many of the arguments that they advanced in earlier proceedings, and dispute the Commission\u2019s Findings.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>revisit any of these arguments here, as we agree with appellant that they have already been litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The Court of Appeals summarized the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>in <em>R &amp; D 2001, supra, </em>402 Md. at 663, 938 A.2d 839:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGr\">The doctrine of claim preclusion, or <em>res judicata, </em>\u201cbars the relitigation of a claim if there is a final judgment in a previous litigation where the parties, the subject matter and causes of action are identical or substantially identical as to issues actually litigated and as to those which could have or should have been raised in the previous litigation.\u201d <em>Board of Ed. v.

The doctrine embodies three elements: (1) the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier litigation; (2) the claim presented in the current action is identical to that determined or that which could have been raised and determined in the prior litigation; and (3) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><em>See also Comptroller of Treasury v.

Subsequently, he denied appellees\u2019 \u201cMotion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Alter, Amend\u201d that judgment. Thereafter, appellees noted an appeal, which was dismissed by the Court of Appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction. <em>See Dvorak, supra, </em>400 Md. 446, 929 A.2d 185. Consequently, the matter has been fully and finally litigated; the Commission\u2019s finding of violations of the ethics laws cannot now be attacked. What remains for determination is the proper sanction to be enforced, given the limitation we have previously discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">It is not our role to review the administrative findings, as those were already reviewed by Judge Harris and affirmed in a final judgment. As the Court of Appeals said in <em>R &amp; D 2001, supra, </em>402 Md. at 668, 938 A.2d 839 (citation omitted): \u201c \u2018When an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment ... the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Community Ass\u2019n, </em>361 Md. 371, 387, 761 A.2d 899 (2000); <em>Brown v.

Therefore, issues decided by the circuit court, or essential to that judgment, such as the timeliness of the ethics Complaint or retroactivity, cannot be re-litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART.

The Commission has both prosecutorial and quasi-judicial responsibilities. <em>Cf. Consumer Protection Division v. Consumer Publishing Co., Inc., </em>304 Md. 731, 762-70, 501 A.2d 48 (1985).

Dvorak was not involved in those cases. The Commission concluded that there was no evidence that Scheibe had violated the ethics law by participating in those cases, because in one, Scheibe withdrew his appearance, and in the other, the County was dismissed as a party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b75-14\">. Effective November 9, 2005, \u00a7 9-5-105 was repealed and reenacted as \u00a7 7-5-105, to conform its language to Md.Code (2004 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.), \u00a7 15-504 of the State Government Article (\"S.G.\u201d). The Commission\u2019s findings were made when \u00a7 9-5-105 was in effect. In any event, \u00a7 7-5-105 is substantively the same as \u00a7 9-5-105. <em>See Dvorak, </em>400 Md. at 448 n. 3, 929 A.2d 185.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b78-11\">.

In any event, the Commission ruled in the alternative, finding that appellees\u2019 conduct violated both \u00a7 9-5-105 <em>and </em>\u00a7 9-3-109.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\">. As to the possession of \"information not generally available to the public,\u201d the Commission commented:</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Information not generally available to the public certainly includes confidential documents that are exempt from public disclosure under the Public Information Act, but it also includes the verbal communications, thought processes, or mental impressions of county officials that simply cannot be assessed through a document file search ... Modern technology notwithstanding, the information that a person has stored in his or her memory is not generally available to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">If it were correct that only documentary evidence were relevant to an ethics violation under \u00a7 5-105(a) (or its predecessor), Respondents\u2019 argument that all documents are public records would imply that there exists no information that is <em>not </em>generally available to the public. In other words, the provision prohibiting former employees from using to the County\u2019s detriment information not generally available to the public would be meaningless....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\">. On or about April 21, 2006, appellees filed a \"Motion to Stay Order of Compliance.\u201d Following a hearing on August 2, 2006, the circuit court granted that motion.

Notably, Judge Rodowsky also said:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">We disagree that the appropriate period for determining waiver includes the period when the County\u2019s complaint was pending before the Commission. The circuit court, acting under the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC), would have no basis for addressing Dvorak's conflict of interest, and the complaints against both Dvorak and Scheibe were sufficiently interrelated for economies of time to dictate consolidation in one proceeding.

For example, appellees characterize as \"the acme of absurdity\u201d appellant\u2019s continued assertion that \"it is not bound by the past conduct of the County government or judicial determinations in the <em>Halle </em>class action case.\u201d They reiterate that the Commission lodged \"bogus ethics charges\u201d against appellees \"3)4 years after the commencement of class action litigation,\u201d which were \"politically motivated for the specific purpose of derailing a multimillion dollar class action lawsuit against the County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In addition, as to the Commission\u2019s Findings, appellees assert, once again, that in the ethics Complaint filed on June 4, 2004, \"Appellant merely alleges by fiat\u201d that the information in issue was <em>\"not generally available to the public </em>appellant \"failed to introduce a single docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ment into evidence marked as <em>privileged, confidential, or prohibited by law from disclosure to the public\"; </em>and that the information in issue was \"always ... generally available to the public,\u201d under the Maryland Public Information Act, Md.Code (2004 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.), \u00a7 10-611 of the State Government Article and \"County Charter provisions \u00a7\u00a7 1004-1005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6\">Furthermore, appellees reiterate that the \u201cCommission was without subject-matter jurisdiction for failing to acknowledge clear and uncontroverted [sic] evidence of an independent source of information inapposite of it\u2019s [sic] claims the Appellees utilized information that was 'not generally available to the public.\u2019 \u201d Dvorak and Scheibe rely on a report dated May 1, 1996, which they introduced into evidence during the administrative proceedings. The report, according to appellees, \u201cdepicted a myriad of alleged unlawful expenditures of impact fees, dating back to a period of 1988-1996, as well as, alleged captured impact fees, which this report asserted were subject to refunds under the provisions of former Article 24, Title 7 of the Anne Arundel County Code.\u201d Scheibe and Dvorak argue that the Commission's decision not to consider the Report \"as an outside source of information is tantamount to a tribunal refusing to give weight to exculpatory evidence, and rises to the level of a denial of due process</p>\n<p id=\"A54\">Appellees also reassert that the Commission erred in retroactively applying County Code \u00a7 9-5-105, which \"was <em>passed into law 2 years and </em>7 <em>months </em>after the <em>Halle </em>lawsuit was filed, and years after the Appellees retired from government service.\u201d They characterize as \u201cvaporous\u201d appellant\u2019s argument that \"the \u2018old law\u2019 and \u2018new law' represent no more than <em>\u2018stylistic </em>changes, and closely resemble one another.\u201d (In this regard, appellees overlook that the Commission found that they violated both the law in effect when they were County employees and the later enactment).
