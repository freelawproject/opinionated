The jury acquitted appellant of carrying a handgun, transporting a handgun on a roadway, of obliterating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the identification number of a firearm, and of resisting arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sentencing court imposed a five-year term of incarceration, without parole, for each conviction, with the terms to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Appellant presents three questions for our review, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">1. Did the lower court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the firearm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">2. Did the trial court err in allowing the jury to return inconsistent verdicts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">3. Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider the prior motion for judgment of acquittal? For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgments below.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The following facts were adduced at a suppression hearing held on August 24, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">On April 25, 2007, Officer Noah Waters and Officer Kevron Gottlieb, of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, were working a \u201cspecial overtime assignment\u201d in Oxon Hill. About 11:02 p.m., the officers observed a blue four-door sedan parked at the gas pumps of a Shell gas station located at Wheeler Road and Southern Avenue. Two people occupied the vehicle: a driver, later identified as Milton Lee Jennings, and appellant, who was seated in the front passenger seat. The vehicle was not running, its lights were off, and the occupants were not pumping gasoline. The officers observed the vehicle and its occupants, who remained sitting in the car, for about 15 minutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Officer Waters then observed Jennings get out of the vehicle. He testified that \u201canother person approach[ed] him, they didn\u2019t have conversation, and it appeared to be a hand-to-hand\u2014... There was no conversation. I observed the gentleman approach [Jennings] and exchange and just walk away.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Officer Waters testified that he had been trained in the \u201crecognition of drug transactions\u201d and had been involved in many drug arrests. His testimony continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">[STATE]: Describe the hand-to-hand. What were the things that you were taught in your training that were the characteristics of a hand-to-hand transaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">WATERS: Usually, it\u2019s a manner that is obscured, so you really don\u2019t see what item is being exchanged. It is not a customary handshake that I guess we\u2019re used to, but it\u2019s an action with the palms touching palms and sliding through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">[STATE]: What, if any, items in this case did you see exchanged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">WATERS: I did not see what item was exchanged. I just saw the activity which was suspicious to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">[STATE]: Do you have any experience working in this area itself of Wheeler Road and Southern Avenue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">WATERS: Yes, sir, that is my assigned area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL1\">[STATE]: How long have you worked in that particular area. WATERS: Approximately two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">[STATE]: Based on your experience, can you describe that area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-15\">WATERS: There\u2019s a lot of drug activity in that area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-16\">After observing the \u201chand to hand,\u201d Officers Waters and Gottlieb, both in uniform, approached the vehicle without guns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>drawn. Officer Waters asked Jennings what they were doing and \u201cwhat did you just exchange with the gentleman that walked away.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Officer Waters directed Jennings to remove the car keys, which he then placed on the roof of the vehicle, \u201cordered\u201d him to produce identification, and \u201cordered him out of the vehicle.\u201d He then did a \u201cpat down\u201d of Jennings for \u201cofficer safety.\u201d Officer Waters was also \u201clooking for what [he] felt would be the result of a drug transaction.\u201d He did not, however, find any drugs, drug paraphernalia, or weapons on Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">After Officer Waters completed his pat down of Jennings, Officer Gottlieb \u201cordered\u201d appellant out of the vehicle \u201cand he stepped out.\u201d Officer Gottlieb described what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">GOTTLIEB: I positioned [appellant] with his face away from me towards the car, and told him ... to interlock his fingers and put his hands over his head and he didn\u2019t do it. He said, you know, \u201cI ain\u2019t done nothing, why are you messing with me,\u201d and started to turn towards me a little bit and I was pushing him back towards the car and asked him to do it again. He said, \u201cI ain\u2019t done nothing.\u201d And he was looking back towards me. I just attempted to control him. And at one point he threw his right elbow back at me, missed, and got on the grass and ran toward the back of the car. I ran after him and caught up to him at the back of the car, pulled him to the ground, and Officer Waters came over and assisted and he was, basically, fighting us, elbowing us, trying to get away from us. At one point I said,[\u201c Wou\u2019re under arrest for assault, stop resisting.1\u201d1 And he continued to struggle until we got control of his wrist and were able to handcuff him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">$ $ $ $ $ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>[STATE]: Once you had gotten the defendant on to the ground, what, if anything, did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">GOTTLIEB: After we got him down on the ground and we got him handcuffed, then he was under arrest, and I got him up in order to search him before transporting him. At one point I reached into his right front pocket and I pulled out a black handgun and it turned out to be a Davis Industries .380 automatic handgun. We cleared it for safety reasons. It had a round in the chamber and two in the magazine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">[STATE]: Why did you place him under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">GOTTLIEB: Because he assaulted me and he assaulted Officer Waters. Officers Waters and Gottlieb were the only witnesses at the suppression hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Defense counsel argued that the handgun recovered from appellant should be suppressed because the police did not have probable cause or a reasonable articulable suspicion justifying the stop and frisk of appellant. The court denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">THE COURT: All right. As both sides know, I have to look at the totality of the circumstances. When [the driver] and the defendant, Hicks as a passenger, were sitting at a gas station for 10 to 15 minutes ... not purchasing gas, just sitting there, and then somebody comes up and one of the officers observes what appears to him by his training and experience [to be] a hand-to-hand transaction, that is reasonable articulable suspicion to investigate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">What you\u2019re overlooking, [defense counsel], is the fact that they\u2019re sitting there at a gas pump for 10 to 15 minutes doing nothing. That is not [sic] in a high drug area. As far as this member of the bench is concerned, that certainly gives them reasonable articulable suspicion to investigate. That\u2019s not what, generally, persons do, sit at a pump and not get gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">Once they go to investigate it, the officer does have the right to ask the passengers to get out of the car. And once they\u2019ve asked them to get out of the car, they do have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>right to search for weapons. For officer safety, the officer does have the right to detain Mr. Hicks temporarily and do a pat down search. When Mr. Hicks decides he wants to resist and starts elbowing the police officer, he is then arrested for assault. Once he\u2019s placed under arrest for unlawful assault, they certainly have the right to do the search. When doing the search, they find out that he has a revolver on him. Motion to suppress is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">Additional facts will be provided as needed for a discussion of the issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\n<em>The Motion to Suppress the Handgun</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress the handgun. Specifically, appellant claims that, even if Officer Waters observed what he thought was a hand-to-hand transaction outside the vehicle between Jennings and a third person, that \u201ccould not provide the required individualized suspicion to stop and frisk appellant.\u201d Moreover, he asserts that, \u201cby the time of appellant\u2019s frisk, [Jennings] had already been searched and nothing had been discovered,\u201d and thus any \u201creasonable suspicion to initiate an investigatory stop ... was dispelled once the initial contact and search of [Jennings] yielded nothing.\u201d Appellant further maintains that Officer Gottlieb \u201chad no right to restrict [his] freedom to leave the scene and certainly had no right to tackle [him] when he chose to leave,\u201d and thus, he was \u201centitled to resist an unlawful arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The State counters that the trial court did not err in finding that the police had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct a stop and frisk, but, even assuming it was not reasonable, appellant\u2019s \u201cassault on the officer during his resistance to the stop and frisk was not privileged and provided probable cause for his arrest.\u201d Thus, the State asserts that the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>handgun as it was the fruit of a lawful search incident to a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">When determining whether a detention or search of an individual\u2019s person or property violates the Fourth Amendment, we \u201c \u2018make our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crosby v. State, </em>408 Md. 490, 505, 970 A.2d 894 (2009) (quoting <em>State v. Williams, </em>401 Md. 676, 678, 934 A.2d 38 (2007)). However, our assessment is performed within certain limitations. First, we look only to the record of the suppression hearing. <em>Owens v. State, </em>399 Md. 388, 403, 924 A.2d 1072 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1064, 169 L.Ed.2d 813 (2008); <em>Paulino v. State, </em>399 Md. 341, 348, 924 A.2d 308 (2007) (citing <em>Carter v. State, </em>367 Md. 447, 457, 788 A.2d 646 (2002)), c<em>ert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 1071, 128 S.Ct. 709, 169 L.Ed.2d 571 (2007). Second, we defer to \u201cthe findings of the motions court as to first-level findings of fact and as to the credibility of witnesses, unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>397 Md. 89, 98, 916 A.2d 245 (2007). Finally, \u201c \u2018we view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion____\u2019\u201d <em>Owens, </em>399 Md. at 403, 924 A.2d 1072 (quoting <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">The Fourth Amendment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the United States Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, \u201cincluding seizures that involve only a brief investigative detention.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 505, 970 A.2d 894 (citations omitted). \u201cThe default rule requires that a seizure of a person by a law-enforcement officer must be supported by probable cause, and, absent a showing of probable cause, the seizure violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There are exceptions. \u201c \u2018A police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>officer who has reasonable suspicion that a particular person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime may detain that person briefly in order to investigate the circumstances that provoked suspicion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506, 970 A.2d 894 (quoting <em>Nathan v. State, </em>370 Md. 648, 660, 805 A.2d 1086 (2002) and citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 17, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Reasonable suspicion \u201c \u2018has been defined as ... a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity----\u2019\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 507, 970 A.2d 894 (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981) and <em>Stokes v. State, </em>362 Md. 407, 415, 765 A.2d 612 (2001)). In <em>Crosby, </em>the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">First, reasonable suspicion is a \u201ccommon sense, nontechnical conception that considers factual and practical aspects of daily life and how reasonable and prudent people act.\u201d <em>Bost v. State, 406 </em>Md. 341, 356, 958 A.2d 356 (2008) (quoting <em>Stokes, </em>362 Md. at 415, 765 A.2d 612). While the level of required suspicion is less than that required by the probable cause standard, reasonable suspicion nevertheless embraces something more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">Second, a court\u2019s determination of whether a law enforcement officer acted with reasonable suspicion must be based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Bost, </em>406 Md. at 356, 958 A.2d 356. Thus, \u201cthe court must ... not parse out each individual circumstance for separate consideration.\u201d <em>Ransome v. State, </em>373 Md. 99, 104, 816 A.2d 901 (2003). As recently articulated by the Fourth Circuit, \u201ccontext matters: actions that may appear innocuous at a certain time or in a certain place may very well serve as a harbinger of criminal activity under different circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Branch, </em>537 F.3d 328, 336 (2008). . . . In making its assessment, the court should give due deference to the training and experience of the law enforcement officer who engaged the stop at issue. <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 104-05, 816 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>901. Such deference \u201callows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them.\u201d <em>[United States v.] Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). To be sure, \u201c[a] factor that, by itself, may be entirely neutral and innocent, can, when viewed in combination with other circumstances, raise a legitimate suspicion in the mind of an experienced officer.\u201d <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 105, 816 A.2d 901.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">Third, the reasonable suspicion standard carries limitations; it \u201cdoes not allow [a] law enforcement official to simply assert that innocent conduct was suspicious to him or her.\u201d <em>Bost, </em>406 Md. at 357, 958 A.2d 356. Rather, the officer must explain how the observed conduct, when viewed in the context of all of the other circumstances known to the officer, was indicative of criminal activity____As this Court observed previously, we shall not \u201c \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 conduct simply because the officer believed he had the right to engage in it.\u201d <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 111, 816 A.2d 901. In other words, there must be an \u201carticulated logic to which this Court can defer.\u201d <em>United States v. Lester, </em>148 F.Supp.2d 597, 607 (D.Md.2001).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 507-09, 970 A.2d 894 (Some internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">In the case before us, we hold that the suppression court did not err in denying the motion to suppress the handgun. We perceive no error in the suppression court\u2019s conclusion that Officers Waters and Gottlieb reasonably suspected that criminal activity may have been afoot and that this suspicion was sufficient to support the investigatory detention of Jennings and appellant. Jennings\u2019 vehicle was parked for about 15 minutes in front of fuel pumps, but with no indication that the occupants were buying gasoline. The officers knew that the area was known for \u201ca lot of drug activity.\u201d It was late at night. Officer Waters observed Jennings exit his car, engage in what he believed, based on his training and experience, to be a \u201chand to hand\u201d drug transaction. There was no conversation between Jennings and the pedestrian and Jennings immediately returned to his vehicle. The totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>these circumstances support a reasonable suspicion of drug-related activity and the officers properly detained Jennings and appellant, who had been sitting in Jennings\u2019 vehicle for at least 15 minutes, for the purpose of conducting a <em>Terry </em>investigation. <em>See, e.g. Williams v. State, </em>188 Md.App. 78, 95-96, 981 A.2d 46, 56 (2009) (police officer\u2019s observation, through video surveillance of a street corner associated with open air drug sales, of an apparent hand-to hand drug transaction involving defendant constituted sufficient probable cause to justify an arrest even though officer did not observe what changed hands).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Appellant contends that, since the pat-down of Jennings did not yield evidence of criminal wrongdoing, any \u201creasonable suspicion to initiate an investigatory stop ... was dispelled.\u201d The argument is not persuasive. The purpose of a pat-down or frisk is to determine whether an individual has a weapon on his or her person and is a \u201c \u2018carefully limited search of the outer clothing\u2019 \u201d of the individual. <em>Dashiell v. State, </em>374 Md. 85 n. 3, 821 A.2d 372 (2003) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868). A pat down is intended solely to protect the investigating officer and any other persons in the vicinity. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 23, 88 S.Ct. 1868. That Jennings did not have a weapon concealed on his person was not, in and of itself, a basis to conclude that the officers\u2019 suspicions of criminal wrongdoing were groundless and certainly did not require them to curtail their <em>Terry </em>investigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Officer Gottlieb was entitled to pat appellant down before speaking to him if he had a \u201c \u2018reasonable suspicion that [appellant] may be armed ... and dangerous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arizona v. Johnson, </em>129 S.Ct. at 784 (quoting <em>Knowles v. Iowa, </em>525 U.S. 113, 117-18, 119 S.Ct. 484, 142 L.Ed.2d 492 (1998)). For reasonable suspicion to exist \u201c[t]he officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868. We have often recognized the inherent dangers of drug enforcement, and an investigatory stop based upon a reasonable suspicion that a suspect is engaged in drug dealing, can justify a frisk for weapons. <em>Burns v. State, </em>149 Md.App. 526, 817 A.2d 885 (2003) (\u201cThe intimate connection between guns and narcotics is notorious.\u201d); <em>Whiting v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 404, 417, 725 A.2d 623 (1999) (\u201c[W]e have acknowledged a nexus between drug possession and guns, observing that a person involved in drug distribution is more prone to possess firearms than one not so involved.\u201d); <em>Banks v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 582, 591, 581 A.2d 439 (1990) (\u201cPossession and, indeed, use, of weapons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>most notably firearms, is commonly associated with the drug culture ...\u201d). We conclude that Officer Gottlieb would have been justified in patting down the appellant before he spoke to him about the apparent drug transaction that Officer Waters had just witnessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"> In fact, however, Officer Gottlieb\u2019s attempt to frisk appellant was abortive. Although appellant stepped out of the vehicle when ordered to do so, he was uncooperative and combative when directed to take a stance to allow the officer to frisk him. Officer Gottlieb testified that \u201cat one point [appellant] threw his right elbow back at me, missed, ... and ran toward the back of the car ... and he was, basically, fighting us, elbowing us, trying to get away from us.\u201d Appellant\u2019s conduct changes the focus of our analysis. There is no privilege to resist either an unlawful <em>Terry </em>stop, <em>Barnhard v. State, </em>86 Md.App. 518, 528, 587 A.2d 561 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>325 Md. 602, 602 A.2d 701 (1992), or an unlawful frisk. <em>State v. Blackman, </em>94 Md.App. 284, 306, 617 A.2d 619 (1992) (\u201cEven if the frisk would have been unlawful ..., there was no right or privilege on the part of the [defendant] to resist it by using force against the officer.\u201d) Appellant\u2019s thrust of his elbow at Officer Gottlieb was an assault and appellant continued to elbow and fight the officers. Officer Gottlieb arrested appellant for assault and, pursuant to that arrest, lawfully searched him and recovered the handgun from his right front pocket. The arrest and the resulting search were justified. <em>Blackman, </em>94 Md.App. at 305, 617 A.2d 619 (\u201c[T]he [defendant] was not privileged to resist [the frisk] by shoving the officer. That shove, albeit arguably minimal, was a battery. That was all that was required to justify the arrest of the [defendant] and the search incident thereto.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\n<em>The \u201cInconsistent\u201d Verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction, in violation of Md.Code Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Crim.

State, </em>405 Md. 10, 949 A.2d 619 (2008), Maryland appellate courts generally tolerated inconsistent verdicts in criminal jury trials. <em>Id </em>at 18, 949 A.2d 619. <em>See, e.g., State v. Williams, </em>397 Md. 172, 189, 916 A.2d 294 (2007) (\u201cIt has been the position of this Court that inconsistent verdicts in jury trials are permissible in criminal cases.\u201d) In Price, the Court of Appeals held that inconsistent jury verdicts in criminal trials are no longer permissible. <em>Id. </em>at 18-29, 949 A.2d 619. As we noted in <em>Brown v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 138, 155 n. 10, 957 A.2d 654 (2008), the \u201cPrice Court limited the effect of its holding, however, to \u2018similarly situated cases on direct appeal <em>where the issue was preserved, </em>and verdicts in criminal jury trials rendered after the date of our opinion____\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Price, </em>405 Md. at 29, 949 A.2d 619; emphasis added in <em>Brown). </em>The <em>Price </em>opinion was filed on June 9, 2008. The verdict in the case before us was rendered on October 30, 2007. Therefore, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the verdicts were inconsistent, <em>Price </em>is controlling here only if the issue was preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The concurring opinion in <em>Price, </em>authored by Judge Harrell (joined by Judge Battaglia and in part by Judge Wilner), elaborated on the need to preserve the issue for appeal noting that, \u201c[bjecause of the \u2018sea change\u2019 announced by the Majority\u2019s opinion, some prospective direction is necessary and desirable to highlight the procedure required in order for a defendant to preserve for appellate review a challenge to a legally inconsistent verdict.\u201d <em>Price, </em>405 Md. at 40, 949 A.2d 619. Judge Harrell explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">The jury may render a legally inconsistent verdict to show lenity to the defendant. The defendant should not be foreclosed from accepting the jury\u2019s lenity as a result of the holding of the Majority\u2019s opinion. Nevertheless, we should not permit the defendant to accept the jury\u2019s lenity in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>trial court, only to seek a windfall reversal on appeal by arguing that the jury\u2019s verdicts are inconsistent. Accordingly, a defendant must note his or her objection to allegedly inconsistent verdicts prior to the verdicts becoming final and the discharge of the jury. Otherwise, the claim is waived.[ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">$ $ $ K: $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">Upon timely objection by the defendant0 to legally inconsistent verdicts, the trial court should instruct or re-instruct the jury on the need for consistency and the range of permissible verdicts. The jurors then should be permitted to resume deliberation. The jury is free to resolve the inconsistency either by returning verdict in the defendant\u2019s favor, convicting on the implicated counts, or deadlocking on a charge so that no inconsistent findings result----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">In sum, a defendant must note his objection to the inconsistent verdict while the trial court has an opportunity to remedy the error, i.e., before the verdict is final and the jury is discharged. Failure to do so constitutes waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOS\"><em>Id. </em>at 40-42, 949 A.2d 619 (footnotes, citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">We heeded Judge Harrell\u2019s admonition in <em>Tate v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 114, 136-37, 957 A.2d 640 (2008), although our holding rested on other grounds. In <em>Tate, </em>before us on remand from the Court of Appeals for reconsideration of our opinion in light of <em>Price, </em>we noted that \u201cthe appellant clearly did nothing by way of objecting to the reception of the verdicts or by way of asking that the jury be sent back to resolve any alleged inconsistency in its verdicts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136-37, 957 A.2d 640. The same is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">We hold that the issue of possible inconsistencies among the verdicts was not preserved for appeal as the defense did not object to the allegedly inconsistent verdicts at trial. Moreover, we decline appellant\u2019s invitation to exercise our discretion to review the issue under the plain error doctrine. We undertake \u201cplain error\u201d review only when the error is \u201c \u2018compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the defendant a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conyers v.

He further testified that there \u201cwas a round in the chamber and two in the magazine. The gun was ready to be fired.\u201d Officer Gottlieb took the handgun to the Firearms Examination Unit, \u201cat which point one of the examiners, they did work on it a little bit and then they did a test fire and it fired.\u201d When asked specifically what he observed the examiner do, Officer Gottlieb replied: \u201cHe used some tools. He\u2014I\u2019m not an expert like that, but he adjusted something in there and then we went down to test fire it and it fired.\u201d He further testified that the gun was certified as operable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">There were no witnesses from the Firearms Examination Unit. Only Officer Gottlieb testified as to the examination and testing of the gun. His testimony included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">[STATE]: [Defense counsel] asked you on cross about the tools that the firearms examiner used. Can you describe any of those tools?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>GOTTLIEB: There [sic] are just some small hand tools, precision tools to use on the gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">[STATE]: What exactly was done that you saw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">GOTTLIEB: He tightened up a bolt and he adjusted a mechanism from the interior working of the firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">* # * He sk :!\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">[STATE]: Showing you [the handgun] ...

The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">Post trial, appellant filed a \u201cMotion to Reconsider the Court\u2019s Denial of Defendant\u2019s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal on [the possession of regulated firearm counts] of the Indictment, or, In the Alternative For a New Trial.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The issue, briefed and argued before the trial court, was whether proof of operability of a regulated firearm was required to sustain the convictions under Public Safety \u00a7 5-133 for pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>session of a regulated firearm, and if so, whether the evidence at trial established operability.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">At the hearing on the issue, the defense argued in favor of the operability requirement, maintaining that possession of a firearm under the Public Safety Article should be construed like similar provisions under the Criminal Law Article, which the defense claimed, by either legislative action or judicial interpretation, require operability. The defense also argued that, because the firearms technician did something beyond mere maintenance to the handgun, which required special knowledge and tools, and there being no evidence that appellant possessed such special knowledge or tools, the gun must be deemed inoperable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The State argued below that operability is not a requirement as the definition of a \u201cfirearm\u201d in Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-101(h) includes \u201cthe frame or receiver\u201d of a weapon, which by design is incapable of expelling a projectile by the action of an explosive. The State also asserted that, because the definition of a \u201cregulated firearm\u201d in the Public Safety Article was modeled after that found in federal law, and because federal courts have held that operability is not a required element to sustain a conviction for possession of a firearm under the federal statute, operability is not a required element under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">After determining that the definition of a \u201cfirearm\u201d in the Public Safety Article was \u201cspecifically and identically taken by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the Legislature from the federal definition of firearm found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3)\u201d;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133 regulate and proscribe the same conduct; and that federal courts have \u201cconsistently and uniformly held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) does not require proof of operability,\u201d the trial court concluded that operability is not a requirement under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133 to sustain a conviction for possession of a regulated firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">As an alternate basis for its decision, the trial court concluded that, even if operability is a requirement under the Maryland statute, \u201csufficient circumstantial evidence did exist for the jury to find that the gun was indeed operable, and that [appellant] was guilty.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">Specifically, there was evidence that the weapon contained one round of ammunition in the chamber and two more rounds of ammunition in the weapon\u2019s clip. The jury could find that the defendant would not load an inoperable weapon or carry a loaded \u201cinoperable\u201d weapon especially with two rounds in the clip. If the weapon were inoperable, why would there be two rounds in the clip which only can be used if the round in the chamber is fired or otherwise removed. The jury was not required to \u201cpark [its] common sense at the door,\u201d and heard sufficient circumstantial evidence that the weapon was operable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration of the denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal or for a new trial. On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion. Both the appellant and the State advance essentially the same arguments raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We perceive no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling and hold that proof of the operability of the firearm is not required to sustain a conviction for possession of a firearm under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133 makes it illegal for persons convicted of certain crimes to possess a firearm. Pub. Safety \u00a7 5\u2014133(b)(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">A person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person [among other things]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">(1) has been convicted of a disqualifying crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">(2) has been convicted of a violation classified as a common law crime and received a term of imprisonment of more than 2 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133(c)(l) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">A person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person was previously convicted of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">(1) a crime of violence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-13\">(2) a violation of [various crimes under the Criminal Law Article].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">Section 5-133 itself is silent as to whether the firearm must be operable to sustain a conviction. Therefore, we turn to the defined terms in the statute to determine if the answer we are seeking lies therein. The terms relevant to our discussion are defined in Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-101. We will set them out in reverse order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-15\">(p) Regulated firearm.\u2014\u201cRegulated firearm\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-16\">(1) a handgun; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-17\">(2) a firearm that is any of the following specific assault weapons or their copies, regardless of which company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>produced and manufactured that assault weapon: [list of assault weapons omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">(n) Handgun.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">(1) \u201cHandgun\u201d means a firearm with a barrel less than 16 inches in length.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">(2) \u201cHandgun\u201d includes a signal, starter, and blank pistols.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">(h) Firearm.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">(1) \u201cFirearm\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">(i) a weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">(ii) the frame or receiver of such a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-12\">(2) \u201cFirearm\u201d includes a starter gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">The issue we are asked to resolve in this case turns on the construction of the definition of \u201cregulated firearm.\u201d Our goal in statutory construction is to \u201cascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\u201d <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995) (citing <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 260, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994) and <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 73, 591 A.2d 481 (1991)). In doing so, we must first look to the plain, normal meaning of the language of the statute. <em>Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corp. v. Yanni, </em>397 Md. 474, 481, 919 A.2d 1 (2007). Moreover, we \u201cconstrue the statute as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland v. Mayor &amp; Town Council of Mountain Lake Park, </em>392 Md. 301, 316, 896 A.2d 1036 (2006). When considering the ordinary meaning of the language of a statute, we consider how the language relates to the purpose and meaning of the act itself. <em>Id </em>But courts may \u201c \u2018not invade the function of the legislature\u2019 by reading missing language into a statute, \u2018even to correct an omission [that is the result of] obvious ... inadvertence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 351, 772 A.2d 1225 (2001) (citation omitted). Nor may we read a meaning into the statute that is not expressly stated or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>clearly implied, so as to expand its meaning. <em>See Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>387 Md. 1, 14, 874 A.2d 439 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We have found no Maryland cases that directly speak to the precise issue before us. We are persuaded, however, that a firearm need not be operable to sustain a conviction under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133(b). As noted, \u201cfirearm,\u201d the operative term here, is defined as \u201ca weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; or the frame or receiver of such a weapon.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">There is no definition of the term \u201cframe or receiver\u201d in the Public Safety Article; however, the term \u201cfirearm frame or receiver\u201d is defined by the Code of Federal Regulations as \u201c[t]hat part of a firearm which provides housing for the hammer, bolt or breechblock and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to receive the barrel.\u201d 27 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 478.11, 479.11. The definition was adopted in 1978. Commerce in Firearms and Ammunition, 43 Fed.Reg. 13536, 13537 (March 31, 1978) (to be codified at 27 C.F.R. pt.178) and Machine Guns, Destructive Devices, and Certain Other Firearms, 43 Fed.Reg. 13538, 13539 (March 31, 1978) (to be codified at 27 C.F.R. pt.179). Thus, when the General Assembly enacted the Maryland Gun Violence Act of 1996, the term \u201cframe or receiver\u201d had a long-established definition in the context of the federal regulation of firearms. When interpreting a statute, courts presume that the enacting legislative body uses \u201c \u2018familiar legal expressions in their familiar legal sense,\u2019 unless the legislature indicates a contrary intent.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>410 Md. 426, 448, 979 A.2d 98, 111 (2009) (quoting <em>Trinity Assembly of God v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>407 Md. 53, 92, 962 A.2d 404 (2008)). The \u201cframe or receiver\u201d of a firearm is not, in and of itself, an operable firearm as it is not capable of expelling a projectile by the action of an explosive. This leads to the inference that, when the General Assembly enacted the statutory predecessor to Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133, it did not intend to restrict the definition of the term \u201cfirearm\u201d to operable weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The legislative history of \u00a7 5-133 supports our conclusion. Chapter 561 of the Laws of 1996, titled the \u201cMaryland Gun Violence Act of 1996,\u201d repealed and reenacted, with amendments, <em>inter alia, </em>former Article 27, \u00a7 445, the predecessor to Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133. The Act was enacted for the stated purpose of, among other things, \u201cproviding that certain ... possessions of firearms prohibited under federal law are prohibited under State law;\u201d and \u201caltering certain definitions.\u201d 1996 Md. Laws 3139-40. Prior to the Act, Article 27 \u00a7 445 prohibited certain persons (including those previously convicted of committing a crime of violence and certain other crimes), from possessing \u201ca pistol or revolver.\u201d The pertinent provisions of the Act deleted the phrase \u201ca pistol or revolver\u201d and substituted instead the term \u201ca regulated firearm.\u201d The Act also introduced the definitions of \u201cregulated firearm,\u201d \u201chandgun,\u201d and \u201cfirearm\u201d in substantially the same form as that currently codified at Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-101(p), (n) and (h) as set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Since at least 1968, when Congress enacted the Gun Control Act, federal law has proscribed the same conduct as that of Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133. Specifically, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) of the United States Code provides: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any [restricted] person [including persons convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year] to ... possess ... any firearm or ammunition.... \u201d \u201cFirearm\u201d is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">(A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">(B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">(C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">(D) any destructive device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">Such term does not include an antique firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-101(h) virtually mirrors that in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3)(A) &amp; (B). By including \u00a7\u00a7 (C) &amp; (D), the federal definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d is somewhat broader than Maryland\u2019s definition. Nonetheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>for our purposes, the two definitions are sufficiently comparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Federal cases interpreting a federal statute substantially similar to a subsequently enacted Maryland statute are always useful, and often persuasive, in our interpretation of the latter. <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County, </em>299 Md. 493, 506, 474 A.2d 880 (1984) (\u201cWhere the purpose and language of a federal statute are substantially the same as that of a later state statute, interpretations of the federal statute are ordinarily persuasive.\u201d) <em>See also Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 496 n. 18, 842 A.2d 743 (2004) (\u201cWhile [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is] different from Maryland\u2019s statutes, its content is similar, and thus instructive [in an analysis related to penalty provisions], in that the federal statute also makes it illegal for certain classes of individuals to possess certain firearms.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The United States Courts of Appeal have consistently held that an inoperable weapon falls within the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3). <em>See United States v.

We hold that, in order to obtain a conviction under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133, the State need not prove that the firearm in question was operable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-12\">.

In <em>Dennis I, </em>the defendant, a passenger in a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation, attempted to walk away from the vehicle even though the police ordered him to remain. In ruling that his subsequent detention was illegal, the Court of Appeals noted \"there ordinarily is no reason to believe that a passenger in a vehicle is guilty, as an accessory or aider and abettor, of the traffic offense with which the driver may be charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 674 A.2d 928.

As we explain in Part III, while the State is required to prove that a handgun is operable in order to support a conviction under Crim.

There was no legal inconsistency in the verdicts rendered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The verdicts were, arguably, factually inconsistent. The appellant was in possession of a handgun when he was arrested and Officer Gottlieb testified that the firearms examiner was able to fire the handgun after the examiner \u201cworkfed] on it a little bit.\u201d However, the firearms examiner did not testify and Officer Gottlieb conceded that he was not a firearms expert. In addition, he admitted that he was unable to describe the specific actions the firearms examiner took before the weapon was fired. While the jury was not specifically instructed that, in order to convict appellant of violating either Crim. Law \u00a7 4-203(a)(l)(i) or (ii), the State had to prove that the handgun was operable, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney explicitly conceded the point in his closing argument.
