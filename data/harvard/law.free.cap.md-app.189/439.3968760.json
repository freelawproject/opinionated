On March 15, 2005, CMMA entered into a Billing Services Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) with \u201cCapitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology\u201d (\u201cLaurel Radiology\u201d). Dr. Dorianne Thomas, the principal for Capitol Radiology, LLC, signed the Agreement on the signature line for Laurel Radiology. On May 19, 2006, CMMA discontinued providing billing services, alleging breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">On July 25, 2006, CMMA filed a one-count complaint for breach of contract, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, against \u201cDorianne Thomas, MD d/b/a Capitol Radiolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>gy and/or Laurel Radiology, and Capitol Radiology, LLC\u201d (collectively, \u201cappellants\u201d). On November 1, 2006, appellants filed an answer and counterclaim, alleging breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and constructive fraud. A three-day bench trial was held on March 10-12, 2008. On March 19, 2008, CMMA filed a petition for attorney\u2019s fees, citing an indemnification provision in the Agreement. On April 14, 2008, the trial court issued an oral opinion, ruling in favor of CMMA and awarding contract damages in the amount of $55,396.83, attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $119,909.80, and costs in the amount of $4,442.53. Appellants timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Appellants present four questions, which we have reordered and revised for clarity:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">1) Did the trial court err in finding that appellants were parties to the Agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">2) Did the trial court err in finding that, under the Agreement, appellants had a duty to provide demographics and to perform credentialing?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">3) Did the trial court err in awarding appellee contract damages for work that CMMA had not yet performed?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">4) Did the trial court err in awarding appellee attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Agreement\u2019s indemnification clause?</p>\n<p id=\"AgSi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>We answer the first three questions in the negative, and the last question in the affirmative. As such, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In January 2005, Dr. Dorianne Thomas started her own radiology practice and formed Capitol Radiology, LLC, a limited liability company organized under Maryland law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The practice consists of two components: 1) providing radiology services at Laurel Regional Hospital, beginning in February 2005; and 2) providing radiology services at a private office in Laurel, Maryland, beginning <em>in </em>March 2005. Needing assistance in the \u201cstart-up process\u201d for her practice, Dr. Thomas hired Snyder, Cohn, Collyer, Hamilton &amp; Associates, P.C. (\u201cSnyder Cohn\u201d), a full-service firm providing management advisory services to businesses. Snyder Cohn directed Dr. Thomas \u201cto look at [CMMAJ as a billing company,\u201d and therefore, Dr. Thomas scheduled an initial meeting with CMMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">On March 15, 2005, CMMA entered into the Agreement with \u201cCapitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology.\u201d Dr. Thomas signed the Agreement on the line below the name Laurel Radiology, while Jeanne Kohn, the General Manager of CMMA, signed on the line above the name CMMA. Nowhere in the Agreement did it indicate the letters \u201cLLC\u201d after the words \u201cCapitol Radiology\u201d or that Capitol Radiology was a limited liability company.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The Agreement stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">2. <em>Duties and Responsibilities of CMMA,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">(a) Based upon the demographic and charge [injformation provided by Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology, CMMA shall be responsible for the timely preparation of billing statements and insurance forms---- CMMA will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>review and post charges within 72 hours of receipt from the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">(b) CMMA shall in a timely manner forward or distribute all billing statements and insurance forms to the appropriate agency, carrier or patient within 72 hours of receipt of charge information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">(c) CMMA shall bill on behalf of and under the name of Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology, and will assume responsibility for the collection of all accounts receivable----CMMA will post all payments within 48 hours of receipt.... CMMA shall not commingle Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology\u2019s funds with its own funds____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">(d) CMMA shall post all payments and adjustments to the patient account records and shall provide monthly reports \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">(e) CMMA shall provide training and support services to the office personnel of Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology to assist them in the proper assembly of information for CMMA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">(f) If this billing Agreement is terminated, CMMA will at Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology\u2019s option, complete all billing activities for services rendered up to and including the termination date. This will include the resolution of Accounts Receivable balances and collections as needed to complete outstanding work up to 90 days past termination date provided that CMMA is paid for its services in a timely manner and at the prevailing rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">(g) If the relationship between CMMA and Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology is terminated, CMMA agrees to cooperate in transferring billing records to the new billing entity, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">3. <em>Duties and Responsibilities of Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology shall provide to CMMA on a daily or other mutually agreeable basis all of the demographic and charge information necessary to prepare the billing statements and insurance forms that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>CMMA is required to prepare under this Agreement and shall permit employees of CMMA to interface with the office personnel of Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology to enable the CMMA employees to obtain this information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">7. <em>Compensation</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology shall pay to CMMA as compensation for the billing services rendered under this Agreement an amount equal to 8.5% of net collections of hospital charges and 7.5% of office charges. CMMA shall bill Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology by written invoice on a monthly basis, which invoice shall be payable upon presentation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">9. <em>Termination and Breach</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">(a) <em>General Breach </em>In the event that either party should be in default in the performance of any material provision of this Agreement, (non-payment of CMMA\u2019s invoice shall be considered a material provision), and such default is not cured within twenty (20) days after receipt of written notice of such default from the other party, the non-defaulting party, at its option, may terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to such defaulting party within five (5) days after the expiration of said twenty (20) day period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGt\">(b) In the event of termination or in the event of discontinuance of CMMA\u2019s business, all records in CMMA\u2019s possession which are the property of Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology shall be returned to Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology within 30 days of said termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">10. <em>Indemnification</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">(a) Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology shall indemnify and hold CMMA harmless from and against all claims, demands, costs, expenses, liabilities and losses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) which may result against CMMA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>as a consequence of: (i) Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology, performance of this Agreement, except to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of CMMA; or (ii) which arise out of any alleged medical malpractice, malfeasance or neglect caused by Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology, its employees, agents or independent contractors, in connection with the rendering of, or failure to render, any medical or other service to any person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">(b) <em>CMMA </em>CMMA shall indemnify and hold Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology harmless....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">* * sj*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">14. <em>Miscellaneous</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">(e) <em>Entire Agreement </em>This Agreement contains the entire understanding among the parties hereto and with respect to the subject matter hereof, supercedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understanding, inducements or conditions, express or implied, oral or written, except as herein contained. This Agreement may not be modified or amended other than by an agreement in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">CMMA immediately began providing medical billing services for appellants, the business entity created by Dr. Thomas, following the provisions in the Agreement. In May 2006, CMMA terminated the Agreement, alleging that appellants \u201cfail[ed] to provide CMMA with timely information, fail[ed] to compensate CMMA and fail[ed] to take such necessary steps to ensure that the bills processed by CMMA would be paid by the respective insurance company and/or governmental agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">On July 25, 2006, CMMA filed a one-count complaint for breach of contract against appellants, \u201cDorianne Thomas, MD d/b/a Capitol Radiology and/or Laurel Radiology, and Capitol Radiology, LLC.\u201d On November 1, 2006, appellants filed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>answer as well as a counterclaim, alleging breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and constructive fraud. On December 7, 2006, CMMA filed a motion to dismiss Count II (negligent misrepresentation) of appellants\u2019 counterclaim. The court denied that motion on September 25, 2007. Thereafter, on December 5, 2007, CMMA filed an amended answer to the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">On January 25, 2008, CMMA filed a motion for summary judgment on all counts. On February 14, 2008, appellants filed a motion for preliminary determination of question of law regarding interpretation of contract, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-502. Specifically, appellants asked the court to \u201cdeclare that the Agreement did not require Dr. Thomas to input and format the demographic information,\u201d that \u201cthe Agreement is ambiguous as written on this point,\u201d and that \u201can award of attorney\u2019s fees is not available on a claim of breach of the Agreement.\u201d The court denied appellants\u2019 motion as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">On March 10, 2008, the court heard arguments on CMMA\u2019s motion for summary judgment, while appellants orally moved for summary judgment. The court denied both parties\u2019 motions and proceeded with a three-day bench trial. At the end of trial, CMMA made an oral motion, pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-341, for award of its attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against appellants\u2019 counterclaim. The court denied that motion and took the case under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">On March 19, 2008, CMMA filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, per the Agreement, which appellants opposed. On April 14, 2008, the court issued an oral opinion, ruling in favor of CMMA. Specifically, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">1) appellants \u201cwaived their ability to challenge being sued by filing an answer, filing a counterclaim, and failing to timely raise the issue;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">2) appellants breached the contract by failing \u201cto pay CMMA for April, May, and June of 2006,\u201d failing \u201cto provide the demographics to CMMA,\u201d and failing \u201cto fulfill the credentialing requirement;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>3) appellants did not \u201cprove[] a breach of contract by a preponderance of the evidence in the counterclaim,\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t prove its count of negligent misrepresentation by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d and \u201cfailed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the plaintiff ... defrauded them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Subsequently, the court awarded CMMA contract damages in the amount of $55,396.83, broken down as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">$45,234.17: monies past due for the months of April, May, and June 2006</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">$5,690.33: amount that CMMA was unable to bill because of appellants\u2019 \u201cfailure to obtain all of the credentialing they needed,\u201d calculated by taking 8% of the value of appellants\u2019 28.5% collection rate over the previous four months (i.e. appellants retain 28.5% of bills collected from services and, under the Agreement, CMMA was to take \u201c8.5% of net collections of hospital charges and 7.5% of office charges\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">$1,369.02: medicare claims that CMMA was unable to collect</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">$2,903.31: claims that CMMA could not process because one physician was not credentialed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">$200.00: software to access hospital information</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXk\">In addition, the court awarded CMMA attorney\u2019s fees, under Section 10 of the Agreement, in the amount of $119,909.80, and costs in the amount of $4,442.53. On May 13, 2008, appellants filed this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">When an action has been tried without a jury, we \u201creview the trial court\u2019s decision on both the law and the evidence, upholding factual findings unless clearly erroneous, but subjecting its legal conclusions to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Regency Furniture, Inc., </em>183 Md. App. 710, 722, 963 A.2d 253 (2009) (citing <em>Jackson v. 2109 Brandywine, LLC, </em>180 Md.App. 535, 567, 952 A.2d 304 (2008)); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 8-131(c). \u201c \u2018[U]nder the clearly erroneous standard, this Court does not sit as a second trial court, reviewing all the facts to determine whether an appellant has proven his case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goss v.

Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609 (2002)). \u201cThe interpretation of a contract is a legal question subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Regency Furniture, supra, </em>183 Md.App. at 722, 963 A.2d 253 (citations omitted). \u201cMaryland follows the objective theory of contract interpretation,\u201d which \u201cfocuses on the written text: the construing court\u2019s task is to determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">I. Appellants were parties to the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Appellants contend that \u201cDr. Thomas signed the [Agreement] only as a representative of Laurel Radiology\u201d and that \u201c[t]he LLC did not sign the [Agreement] at all.\u201d Therefore, appellants assert that CMMA \u201chad no cause of action for breach of contract ... because no contract was formed\u201d between CMMA and appellants. As such, appellants argue that the trial court erred when it precluded them from moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, based on the fact that they did not raise the privity issue until trial. As we will explain, appellants\u2019 argument is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\n<em>A. Appellants failed to specifically plead a negative defense pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-323(f).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">When CMMA filed its complaint in circuit court, it averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">7. On or about March 13, 2005, CMMA entered into a Billing Services Agreement (the \u201cContract\u201d) with Dr. Thomas and/or Capitol Radiology [the LLC], pursuant to which CMMA agreed to provide billing services, ... in connection with medical services provided by Dr. Thomas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>8. Pursuant to the Contract, Dr. Thomas and/or Capitol Radiology agreed to, among other things, compensate CMMA for billing services....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">In their answer to the complaint, appellants stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">7. Defendants admit that on or about March 13, 2005 a contract was entered into, the terms of which speak for themselves. All other allegations contained in this Paragraph of the Complaint are hereby denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">8. Defendants aver that the terms of the contract speak for themselves, and deny any allegations in this Paragraph which seek to vary or mischaracterize the terms of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Appellants argue that \u201cthe trial court abused its discretion by failing to require further proof of the actual contracting parties,\u201d as CMMA had the burden of proving the allegations made in its complaint. But, with regard to the issue of whether a written contract was executed between CMMA and appellants, appellants failed to specifically raise a \u201cnegative averment\u201d pursuant to Maryland Rule 2\u2014323(f). Instead, appellants admitted that an Agreement was entered into on March 13, 2005, and proceeded to answer by saying that \u201cthe terms of the contract speak for themselves\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll other allegations contained in this Paragraph of the Complaint are hereby denied.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">According to Rule 2-323(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>when a party desires to raise an issue as to (1) the legal existence of a party, including a partnership or a corporation, (2) the capacity of a party to sue or be sued, (3) the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity, (4) the averment of the execution of a written instrument, or (5) the averment of the ownership of a motor vehicle, the party shall do so by negative averment, which shall include such supporting particulars as are peculiarly within the pleader\u2019s knowledge. If not raised by negative averment, these matters are admitted for the purpose of the pending action....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Based on the arguments that appellants now raise before this Court, we believe that appellants could have raised negative averments under subsections (1), (3), and (4) of Rule 2\u2014323(f). For example, if it was appellants\u2019 contention that the party with whom CMMA contracted\u2014Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology\u2014was not a legal entity capable of being sued, then it should have stated as such. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2\u2014323(f)(1). Appellants could also have raised the negative averment that Dr. Thomas did not have the authority to be sued in a representative capacity, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 2\u2014323(f)(3), or that the execution of a written instrument between CMMA and appellants never took place, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 2-323(f)(4). Because appellants did not plead any negative defenses, we hold that the circuit court properly admitted CMMA\u2019s averments, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the purpose of the pending action. Although the court did not cite Rule 2-323(f) in finding that appellants \u201cwaived their ability to challenge being sued,\u201d we affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Appellants rely on <em>Fifer v. Clearfield &amp; Cambria Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>103 Md. 1, 62 A. 1122 (1906) to support their argument, but their reliance on that case is misplaced. In <em>Fifer, </em>the plaintiff buyer brought suit against the defendant company \u201cto recover damages for the alleged failure and neglect of the [company] to ship and deliver to the [buyer] certain coal, alleged to have been sold by the [company] to the [buyer]\u201d through the company\u2019s agent. <em>Id. </em>at 2, 62 A. 1122. In his pleading, the buyer alleged that he \u201centered into a written contract with the said [company], by Rogers, Holloway &amp; Co., agents of the [company] duly authorized by them to execute said contract in its behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In its answer, the company stated \u201cthat it was never indebted and never promised as alleged; and for a third plea, that the alleged contract was procured by the fraud of the [buyer].\u201d <em>Id. </em>At trial, the buyer \u201ccontended that the contract having been set forth <em>verbatim </em>in the declaration, and not having been denied by the [company] in its next succeeding pleading, it must be taken as admitted for the purposes of this action as well as the agency of Rogers, Holloway &amp; Co.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Disagreeing with the buyer\u2019s argument, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit court, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">The failure of the [company] to make denial of the execution of the contract as set out in the declaration, had the effect only of relieving the [buyer] of proving it, but it did not admit that Rogers, Holloway &amp; Co. were the agents of the [company] with authority to bind them as charged in the <em>narr. </em>That was put in issue by the pleas, and was open for proof as any other fact that had been alleged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 3, 62 A. 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The present case differs from <em>Fifer, </em>however, because CMMA\u2019s pleading did not allege that Laurel Radiology was an agent of Dr. Thomas and/or the LLC. Rather, CMMA averred that it entered into the Agreement with Dr. Thomas and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>LLC, directly, as separate entities. The pleading in this case did not place agency at issue and, therefore, the issue of agency was not part of this case and, therefore, not open for proof at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\n<em>B. Any error in the court\u2019s reasoning, in f\u00ednding that appellants failed to timely raise the issue, was harmless.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Appellants also argue that the circuit court erred when it reasoned that appellants\u2019 failure \u201cto timely raise the issue\u201d barred them from moving to dismiss the case, at trial. Although we agree that this was error on the court\u2019s part, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 2-324(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we hold that such error was harmless because appellants were, indeed, parties to the Agreement. <em>Flores v. Bell, </em>398 Md. 27, 33, 919 A.2d 716 (2007) (\u201cIt has long been the policy in this State that this Court will not reverse a lower court judgment if the error is harmless.\u201d) (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In this case, Dr. Thomas signed the Agreement on behalf of \u201cCapitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology.\u201d Thus, it can be argued that there was no \u201cexpress contract\u201d between CMMA and appellants, as neither Dr. Thomas nor the LLC were named in the Agreement. <em>See County Comm\u2019rs of Caroline County v. J. Roland Dashiell &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>358 Md. 83, 94, 747 A.2d 600 (2000) (\u201cAn express contract has been defined as \u2018an actual agreement of the parties\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 323 (6th ed.1990)). For a year after the Agreement was signed, however, appellants performed Laurel Radiology\u2019s duties under the Agreement, while CMMA performed those attributed to it. Appellants, therefore, accepted CMMA\u2019s contract through their actions. <em>See Porter v. Gen. Boiler Casing Co., </em>284 Md. 402, 409-10, 396 A.2d 1090 (1979) (\u201cAcceptance can be accomplished by acts as well as words\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Here, an implied in fact contract existed between the parties, although CMMA was not given the chance to prove that it expressly contracted with appellants. <em>See Burt v. Myer, </em>71 Md. 467, 504, 18 A. 796 (1889) (\u201cIt is true that where there is a failure to prove a special contract, the law will imply a contract by the parties to do what <em>ex [ajequo et bono </em>[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] they ought to do\u201d). Such a contract \u201c \u2018is proved by circumstantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mass Transit Admin. v. Granite Constr. Co., </em>57 Md.App. 766, 774, 471 A.2d 1121 (1984) (quoting Dobbs, <em>Handbook on the Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 4.2 (1973)). Hence, an implied contract existed between CMMA and appellants, as CMMA performed billing services on behalf of appellants and posted all payments on appellants\u2019 account. <em>See Downs v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>111 Md. 674, 694, 76 A. 861 (1910) (\u201c\u2018There is an implied contract to make compensation for money which it has no right to retain.\u2019 \u201d) (Quoting <em>Centr.

Under the terms of the Agreement, appellants had a duty to provide demographics and to perform credentialing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Having determined that appellants were parties to the Agreement, we proceed to discuss the remaining issues with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the understanding that \u201cCapitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology\u201d and appellants are one and the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\n<em>A. Demographics</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">It is undisputed that, in order to prepare bills and collect payment for services rendered, certain patient identification and insurance information, called \u201cdemographics,\u201d had to be gathered from patients and manually entered into CMMA\u2019s computerized billing system. Appellants collected the demographics from patients, then sent CMMA the information on paper. Following trial, the court found, among other things, that there were \u201cdeficiencies in the [appellants\u2019] transmittal of demographics\u201d and, therefore, CMMA proved its claim for breach of contract. On appeal, appellants argue that \u201cthe trial court \u2018misconstrued\u2019 the Agreement\u201d in ruling that appellants \u201chad the responsibility ... [of] physically inputting the data into [CMMA]\u2019s computer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">According to the Agreement, appellants were to \u201cprovide\u201d CMMA with \u201call of the demographic and charge information necessary to prepare the billing statements and insurance forms,\u201d while CMMA was \u201cresponsible for the timely preparation of billing statements and insurance forms.\u201d Appellants argue that, because neither the term \u201cprovide\u201d nor the word \u201cprepare\u201d was defined in the Agreement, then the ordinary meanings of the words control. Citing Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the American Language, Unabridged 1450 (2d ed.1983), appellants contend that to \u201cprovide\u201d means \u201cto furnish; to make available; to supply; to afford.\u201d Moreover, appellants assert that the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cprepare\u201d is \u201cto make ready, usually for a specific purpose; to make suitable; to fit; to adapt....\u201d Thus, appellants reason that CMMA\u2019s responsibility \u201cwas to take the information supplied ... and do whatever was necessary ... in order to put together bills,\u201d including \u201ckeying the information from the paper into [CMMA]\u2019s computer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Again, appellants\u2019 argument is flawed. By relying on <em>Stratakos v. Parcells, </em>172 Md.App. 464, 471, 915 A.2d 1022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>(2007), appellants assume that the terms at issue in this case are \u201cplain and unambiguous.\u201d To the contrary, because the word \u201cprovide\u201d could mean \u201cto supply\u201d by giving the demographic information on a piece of paper or \u201cto supply\u201d by entering the information into CMMA\u2019s computer, then the terms of the contract are ambiguous. <em>See United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Riley, </em>393 Md. 55, 80 (2006) (\u201cA contract is ambiguous if, when read by a reasonably prudent person, it is susceptible of more than one meaning.\u201d) (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTf a trial court finds that a contract is ambiguous, it may receive parol evidence to clarify the meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson Adventures, LLC v. Sam &amp; Murphy, Inc., </em>176 Md.App. 164, 179, 932 A.2d 1186 (2007) (quoting <em>Maslow v. Vanguri, </em>168 Md.App. 298, 319, 896 A.2d 408 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">At trial, the court admitted into evidence an e-mail dated February 4, 2005, from Maureen McCarthy of Snyder Cohn, notifying Jeanne Kohn, the General Manager of CMMA, that Dr. Thomas thought \u201cit would be best if [Dr. Thomas] had a full time billing person in the office to gather data from the office [patients] and the hospital and then she could certainly <em>enter that into the system </em>\u201d (Emphasis added). On February 28, 2005, Ms. McCarthy sent another email to Ms. Kohn, notifying her that Dr. Thomas \u201chired a biller who ... is terrific.\u201d Then, on March 11, 2005, Ms. McCarthy negotiated the terms of the Agreement as to CMMA\u2019s fees, stating that \u201cthe rates are too high considering that we will have a full time biller to coordinate the function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Further, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">Cynthia Atkins was hired by Capitol Radiology as a billing coordinator. She had 16 years of billing experience, and more important, four years of radiology billing experience. This would tend to deflate any argument or any insinuation that Dr. Thomas and her staff had no idea what the amount of work would be involved in the billing services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">Her testimony revealed some very incriminating information. One, Capitol Radiology did not have the computer system necessary to enter demographic information that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>they had indicated they would be getting, and consequently, was not keying in the demographics; and two, although she was hired as a billing coordinator, she was quickly moved to office manager, and no one took over as a billing coordinator at Capitol Radiology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">In August of 2005, Capitol Radiology hired additional workers, surge workers, on a part-time basis to help with their backlog of demographic information....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">... This action demonstrated that Capitol Radiology was not fulfilling the terms of the contract, and affirmed their understanding of their obligation to supply CMMA with the demographic information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Based on this evidence, we hold that the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in its findings that there were \u201cdeficiencies in the [appellants\u2019] transmittal of demographics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\n<em>B. Credentialing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Appellants also argue that the trial court erred in finding that \u201cboth parties expected and understood that [appellants] would perform the credentialing.\u201d Appellants assert that, because the Agreement \u201cmade no mention of \u2018credentialing\u2019, and so did not address who was responsible for performing the task,\u201d the court erred in finding that it was their obligation to fulfill. Further, appellants contend that \u201cthe proper ruling would have been that no contract was formed because the parties did not agree on an essential term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Appellants do not dispute that, in order for insurance claims to be accepted and paid by a health insurer, the facility or doctor providing the medical services has to be credentialed with the private or government insurance carrier. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that one of the parties to the Agreement was made responsible for performing the task. Because the Agreement did not specify which party would perform the credentialing, the terms are, again, ambiguous. <em>See Anderson Adventures, supra, </em>176 Md.App. at 178, 932 A.2d 1186 (To determine whether a contract is ambiguous, \u201cthe court considers the character of the contract, its purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of the execution.\u201d) (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we look to parol evidence once more to clarify the parties\u2019 intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">While announcing its ruling following the trial, the court discussed several pieces of evidence upon which it based its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">And in that, I highlight Ms. [Kohn]\u2019s e-mail to Maureen McCarthy. \u201cAlso, I was hoping that you could give me any credentialing information that you have. We have ordered this division and can probably begin to set it up tomorrow or Monday. Do you have the following info?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Maureen McCarthy testified that Snyder Cohn started the credentialing process on behalf of Capitol Radiology. Her e-mail to Dr. Thomas on January 10, 2005, confirms this. Not just one e-mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The court then proceeded to read from nine documents, all of which were admitted into evidence, discussing appellants\u2019 need to perform credentialing. One e-mail reflected that Ms. McCarthy reminded Dr. Thomas of the \u201cneed to ... get credentialing started;\u201d another asked one of Dr. Thomas\u2019s staff members \u201chow ... the credentialing process [was] going.\u201d The court also noted that several of Snyder Cohn\u2019s bills invoicing the work done on behalf of appellants dealt with the issue of credentialing. In addition, Larry McKenney, the Chief of Operations for Capitol Radiology, confirmed that appellants hired a woman named Sharifah Riley-Mack to do the credentialing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Based on this evidence, we hold that the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in finding that, under the Agreement, appellants were expected to perform the credentialing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">III. The trial court did not err in awarding damages totaling $55,396.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Appellants next contest the amount of damages awarded to CMMA. Appellants do not challenge the court\u2019s award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>$45,234.17\u2014monies past due for the months of April, May, and June 2006. Rather, they assert that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s award of damages for the alleged demographics/credentialing breach were completely speculative and erroneous.\u201d As we explained in the preceding section, however, appellants were responsible for providing demographics and performing credentialing. Therefore, they were obligated to compensate CMMA for its losses, suffered as a result of appellants\u2019 breach. <em>See Milske v. Steiner Mantel Co., </em>103 Md. 235, 249, 63 A. 471 (1906) (\u201cThus, if the act to be done by the party binding himself can only be done upon a corresponding act being done or allowed by the other party, an obligation by the latter to do or allow to be done the act or things necessary for the completion of the contract will be necessarily implied.\u201d) (Citing <em>Churchward v. The Queen, </em>6 B. &amp; S. 807); <em>accord Funger v. Somerset, </em>249 Md. 311, 331, 239 A.2d 748 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u201cIn a breach of contract action, upon proof of liability, the non-breaching party may recover damages for 1) the losses proximately caused by the breach, 2) that were reasonably foreseeable, and 3) that have been proven with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Hoang v. Hewitt Ave. Assocs., LLC, </em>177 Md.App. 562, 594, 936 A.2d 915 (2007) (citations omitted). At issue here is the third factor. In order to recover damages for lost profits, the plaintiff must be able to prove lost profits with \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Della Ratta, Inc. v. Am. Better Cmty. Developers, Inc., </em>38 Md.App. 119, 138-39, 380 A.2d 627 (1977). \u201c \u2018[Reasonable certainty\u2019 of contract damages means the likelihood of the damages being incurred as a consequence of the breach, and their probable amount.\u201d <em>Hoang, supra, </em>177 Md.App. at 595, 936 A.2d 915. In this case, the damages at issue fall into the category of \u201cdirect profits.\u201d Those are profits \u201c \u2018that would have resulted immediately from the performance of the contract broken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>M &amp; R Contractors &amp; Builders v. Michael, </em>215 Md. 340, 347, 138 A.2d 350 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In their brief, appellants rely on two out-of-state cases and argue that CMMA \u201cfailed to show that its methodol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ogy for calculating its damages\u2014using four months\u2019 history of collections or applying a blended rate\u2014was based on generally accepted accounting principles.\u201d In Maryland, however, \u201cif the fact of damage is proven with certainty, the extent or the amount thereof may be left to reasonable inference.\u201d <em>David Sloane, Inc. v. Stanley G. House &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>311 Md. 36, 41, 532 A.2d 694 (1987) (quoting <em>Michael, supra, </em>215 Md. at 349, 138 A.2d 350). \u201c[M]ere difficulty in ascertaining the amount of damage is not fatal,\u201d and \u201cmathematical precision in fixing the exact amount is not required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, \u201c[t]he evidence must ... lay some foundation enabling the fact finder to make a fair and reasonable estimate of the amount of the damage.\u201d <em>Della Ratta, supra, </em>38 Md.App. at 143, 380 A.2d 627. In this regard, damages can be ascertained \u201cby reference to some fairly definite standard, such as market value, established experience, or direct inference from known circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 22 Am.Jur.2d <em>Damages </em>\u00a7 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">At trial, CMMA presented evidence of damages based on the amount that appellants actually collected or would have been able to collect, and for which CMMA was not compensated. Ms. Kohn, who testified that she has been a manager at medical billing companies since 1990, explained that she calculated CMMA\u2019s damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">I would think the fair way to do it would be take an average, a gross collection rate and then once that number was arrived at to then do a percentage. Since I wouldn\u2019t know whether they were hospital or office, I would do it at a blended percentage of 8 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">I [calculated an average collection rate] by using some of the more stable looking months that we did billing.... So I took a few of the more normal looking months and average[d] them and came up [with] I believe the number was 28.5 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Hence, the way in which she calculated the damages in this case satisfied the factors that we set forth in <em>Medi-Cen Corp. v. Birschbach, </em>123 Md.App. 765, 785, 720 A.2d 966 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>... [CJourts should consider the collectibility of accounts receivable, and from that, determine the value of the accounts receivable. Ultimately, the value of accounts receivable are based on the collectibility of the particular accounts at issue----Inquiry into the obligor\u2019s resources may also be useful, as well as testimony from witnesses experienced in similar businesses or acquainted with the debtor\u2019s transactions. Experts may be useful in considering the collectibility of the holder\u2019s past accounts receivable and, based on those values and records, calculating the value of the holder\u2019s uncollected accounts receivable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">In mentioning these factors, we are not providing an exhaustive list. Any competent and admissible evidence tending to shed light on the collectibility of accounts receivable might be relevant and material. We hasten to add that we should not be understood to say or imply that accounts receivable are never capable of being found to be 100% collectible, provided the evidence supports such a conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Although Ms. Kohn was not presented as an expert, she had ample experience in medical billing and was well-acquainted with appellants\u2019 transactions. After considering the values and records of appellants\u2019 prior collections, she was able to calculate a fair and reasonable estimate of CMMA\u2019s damages. Therefore, we hold that the circuit court did not err in awarding damages totaling $55,396.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">IV. The trial court erred in awarding appellee attorney\u2019s fees because the Agreement provided for payment of attorney\u2019s fees only as part of indemnification against a third-party suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Lastly, appellants argue that the circuit court erred in awarding CMMA attorney\u2019s fees \u201cfor prosecuting a first-party breach of contract claim and for defending against a counterclaim where the contract provided for payment of attorney\u2019s fees only as part of indemnification against a third-party suit.\u201d We agree. CMMA\u2019s argument\u2014that \u201cthe Agreement expressly provides for attorney\u2019s fees\u201d because \u201cthe broad lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>guage of the indemnification provision clearly indicates that it applies to <em>all </em>claims, demands, costs, expenses, liabilities and losses ... suffered ... by CMMA due to [appellants\u2019] performance\u201d\u2014is not supported by the law and the evidence and, therefore, fails. (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">With regard to the grant of attorney\u2019s fees, \u201cMaryland follows the common law \u2018American Rule,\u2019 which states that, generally, a prevailing party is not awarded attorney\u2019s fees \u2018unless (1) the parties to a contract have an agreement to that effect, (2) there is a statute that allows the imposition of such fees, (3) the wrongful conduct of a defendant forces a plaintiff into litigation with a third party, or (4) a plaintiff is forced to defend against a malicious prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nova Research, Inc. v. Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P., </em>405 Md. 435, 446, 952 A.2d 275 (2008) (quoting <em>Thomas v. Gladstone, </em>386 Md. 693, 699, 874 A.2d 434 (2005)). In this case, the second, third, and fourth exceptions are not at issue: there is no relevant statute authorizing the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in breach of contract actions; there is no third party involved; and CMMA did not incur counsel fees in defense of the criminal or civil charge in a malicious prosecution action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Bahena v. Foster, </em>164 Md.App. 275, 289-90, 883 A.2d 218 (2005). Therefore, we will address only the first exception to the American Rule, before proceeding to discuss the trial court\u2019s denial of CMMA\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\n<em>A. The court erred in granting attorney\u2019s fees per the Agreement.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">When the circuit court announced its ruling at the conclusion of trial, it opined:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Attorney\u2019s fees. Section 10 entitled \u201cIndemnification of the Billing Services Agreement\u201d is inartful and awkward.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>However, I find that it, as I said before in trial, I find that it does allow CMMA to obtain reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for their litigation expenses, both in pursuit of their complaint for breach of contract and a defense of Capitol Radiology\u2019s counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Section 10 was the only portion of the Agreement that mentioned recovery for attorney\u2019s fees and costs expended. Section 9 of the Agreement, entitled \u201cTermination and Breach,\u201d set forth certain responsibilities and obligations between the parties resulting from termination or breach of the Agreement, but did not discuss an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the event that one party pursues a claim for breach or termination of the contract when one party believes the other party is at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In Maryland, \u201c[a]n express indemnity agreement, being a written contract, must be construed in accordance with the traditional rules of contract interpretation.\u201d <em>Ulico Cas.

Thus, \u201ca trial court may award attorneys\u2019 fees only ... where ... a contract between the parties <em>specifically </em>authorizes attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Maxima Corp. v. 6933 Arlington Dev.

Rossi, <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees </em>\u00a7 9:18 (3d ed.2002, Cum.Supp.2007)). In <em>Nova Research, </em>the Court of Appeals addressed the issue of \u201cwhether the contract provision for indemnification includes first party attorney\u2019s fees, where the contract language does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>not provide expressly for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, 952 A.2d 275. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">The indemnification provision, which encompasses loss \u201ccaused or arising out of\u2019 the failure to comply with the agreement, is distinctly different from the loss provision in <em>Atlantic [Contracting &amp; Material Co., Inc. v. Ulico Cas. Co., </em>380 Md. 285, 844 A.2d 460 (2004)]. The agreement in <em>Atlantic </em>stated explicitly that it covered loss \u201csustained or incurred ... in connection with or as a result of ... the enforcement of this Agreement.\u201d <em>Atlantic, </em>380 Md. at 302, 844 A.2d at 469. The contract in the case <em>sub judice </em>does not so provide. Interpreting the indemnification provision in the context of the contract as a whole, we do not find support that the parties intended the indemnification to cover first party attorney\u2019s fees. In examining the scope of the indemnification provision, we find no express fee shifting provision. Under <em>Jones v. Calvin B. Taylor Banking Co., </em>253 Md. 430, 441-42, 253 A.2d 742, 748 (1969), we implied a fee-shifting provision to allow an indemnitee to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against a third party. Where the contract provides no express provision for recovering attorney\u2019s fees in a first party action establishing the right to indemnity, however, we decline to extend this exception to the American rule, which generally does not allow for prevailing parties to recover attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 451, 952 A.2d 275. The <em>Nova Research </em>Court concluded its analysis by holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">... [W]e adopt the approach followed by the majority of states, and require that the contract provide expressly for recovery in first party enforcement actions. The contract in the case before us does not explicitly cover expenses in the enforcement of the contract; therefore, we shall not imply the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees accrued in a first party action establishing the right to indemnity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 458, 952 A.2d 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">A straightforward reading of the terms of the Agreement confirms that the parties did not intend to provide for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in the event of default. Section 9 of the Agreement addressed the issues of \u201cTermination and Breach,\u201d yet it did not include a provision for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees if either termination or default occurred. Moreover, Section 10 of the Agreement addressed \u201cIndemnification,\u201d but did not provide for attorney\u2019s fees and costs for enforcement in a <em>first </em>party breach of contract action. Instead, Section 10 provided that appellants \u201cshall indemnify and hold CMMA harmless from and against all claims, demands, costs, expenses, liabilities and losses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) which may result against CMMA as a consequence of: (i) Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology, <em>performance </em>of this Agreement, except to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of CMMA.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">We agree with the circuit court that the wording of Section 10 is \u201cawkward.\u201d Because the words \u201cCapitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology, performance of this Agreement\u201d are arranged together under subsection (i), however, we understand this section to mean that appellants would be held responsible for attorney\u2019s fees if such fees result \u201cas a consequence of ... Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology[\u2019s] performance of this Agreement.\u201d Therefore, appellants would pay CMMA\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in the event that CMMA is sued as a result of appellants\u2019 <em>performance </em>of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">For example, if appellants collected demographic information and provided it to CMMA pursuant to the Agreement, and one of appellants\u2019 patients sued CMMA as a result of having such information, then CMMA could ask appellants to pay for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against such lawsuit. CMMA could also require appellants to pay attorney\u2019s fees if CMMA is sued for violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692 <em>et seq., </em>for repeatedly making annoying telephone calls or initiating similar forms of contact. But, because the Agreement did not specify that appellants would be held responsible for attorney\u2019s fees if such fees result as a consequence of Capitol Radiology, DBA Laurel Radiology\u2019s <em>default or termination </em>under the Agreement, then the indemnification provision of Section 10 cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>be interpreted to imply the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees accrued in this type of first party breach of contract action.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">CMMA argues that appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Nova Research </em>is \u201cmisplaced\u201d because, unlike here, \u201cthe indemnification provision in <em>Nova Research </em>did not expressly provide for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d As we previously stated, however, <em>Nova Research </em>\u201crequire[s] that the contract provide <em>expressly for recovery in \u00f1rst party enforcement actions.\u201d Nova Research, supra, </em>405 Md. at 458, 952 A.2d 275 (emphasis added). <em>Nova Research </em>is not limited to situations where an indemnification provision does not expressly include \u201cattorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Instead, the <em>Nova Research </em>Court found that the dispositive question was whether the action was a first party action to enforce the contract. <em>See id. </em>at 449-52, 952 A.2d 275. It would be illogical to construe the Agreement in a way that allows us to disregard Section 9 and insert additional words into Section 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">This case is similar to <em>Oscar Gruss &amp; Son, Inc. v. Hollander, </em>337 F.3d 186 (2d Cir.N.Y.2003), <em>cited with approval </em>in <em>Nova Research, supra, </em>405 Md. at 454-55, 952 A.2d 275. In <em>Oscar Grass &amp; Son, </em>\u201cthe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had to determine whether an indemnification provision applied only to claims brought by third parties or whether it applied also to claims brought between the parties to the agreement.\u201d <em>Nova Research, supra, </em>405 Md. at 454, 952 A.2d 275.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">The indemnification provision provided for reimbursement of any legal expenses incurred \u201cin connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending, or providing evidence in or preparing to serve or serving as a witness with respect to, any lawsuits, investigations, claims or other proceedings arising in any manner out of or in connection with the rendering of services by the Advisor hereunder <em>(including, without Imitation, in connection mth the enforcement of this Agreement </em>and the indemnification obligations set forth herein).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 454-55, 952 A.2d 275 (quoting <em>Oscar Gruss &amp; Son, supra, </em>337 F.3d at 199) (emphasis in original). \u201c[Construing the language in context with the surrounding contractual provisions,\u201d the Second Circuit determined that \u201cthe right to attorney\u2019s fees applied only to claims brought by third parties, and not to an action commenced by the indemnitee against the indemnitor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455 (citing <em>Oscar Gruss &amp; Son, supra, </em>337 F.3d at 200); <em>see also Phoenix Servs. L.P. v.

Therefore, we hold that, under the Agreement, the right to attorney\u2019s fees and costs applies only to claims brought by third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>B. The court did not err in denying CMMA\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Maryland Rule </em>1-341.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Maryland Rule 1-341 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">CMMA argues that \u201cMaryland Rule 1-341 also provides a basis for the award of attorney\u2019s fees\u201d because \u201c[appellants\u2019 actions in this case clearly demonstrate a lack of substantial justification and good faith.\u201d CMMA, however, does not point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>to anything in the record, nor does it provide any legal support, for this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">In <em>Garcia v. Foulger Pratt Dev., Inc., </em>155 Md.App. 634, 845 A.2d 16 (2003), we noted that \u201c \u2018[a]n award of counsel fees [pursuant] to Rule 1-341 is an \u2018extraordinary remedy,\u2019 which should be exercised only in rare and exceptional cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 845 A.2d 16 (quoting <em>Barnes v. Rosenthal Toyota, Inc., </em>126 Md.App. 97, 105, 727 A.2d 431 (1999)) (additional citation omitted). \u201cRule 1-341 represents a limited exception to the general rule that attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable by one party from an opposing party....\u201d <em>Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. v. Bishop\u2019s Garth Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>75 Md.App. 214, 223, 540 A.2d 1175 (1988) (citation omitted). \u201cBefore a court metes Rule 1-341 sanctions, it must make an evidentiary finding of \u2018bad faith\u2019 or \u2018lack of substantial justification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, 540 A.2d 1175 (citing <em>Hess v. Chalmers, </em>33 Md.App. 541, 545, 365 A.2d 294 (1976)). \u201cWhether bad faith or lack of substantial justification is found by a court to exist in any given case is a question of fact subject to a \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220-21, 540 A.2d 1175 (citing <em>Century I Condo. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Plaza Condo. Joint Venture, </em>64 Md.App. 107, 117, 494 A.2d 713 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In this ease, there is nothing in the record to support CMMA\u2019s contention that appellants\u2019 actions \u201cdemonstrate a lack of substantial justification and good faith.\u201d CMMA initially filed suit against appellants, and appellants filed an answer and counterclaim in its own defense. <em>See U.S. Health, Inc. v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 116, 128, 589 A.2d 485 (1991) (\u201c[W]e are mindful that Rule 1-341 was not intended to punish legitimate advocacy, or to force abandonment of questionable or innovative causes, or to penalize exploration beyond existing legal horizons.\u201d) (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Although the trial court found in favor of CMMA, there is no indication that appellants made frivolous claims or defenses. <em>See Blitz v. Beth Isaac Adas Isr.

And, our review of the record shows that the judgment in this case qualifies as a final, appealable judgment because: 1) it was docketed on April 14, 2008 as a \"final disposition;\u201d 2) in its oral ruling, the court addressed CMMA\u2019s breach of contract claim as well as all three counts listed in appellants' counterclaim; and 3) a \"notice of judgment\u201d bearing the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>case number for both the complaint and counterclaim was recorded by the clerk of the circuit court on April 18, 2008. <em>See Addison v.
