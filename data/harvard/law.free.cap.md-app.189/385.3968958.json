Appellant presents three questions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to this Court, which we have consolidated and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">I. Was the MSBE\u2019s review of the Local Board\u2019s decision arbitrary and capricious because it failed to reverse the Local Board\u2019s decision for its failure to provide appellee with the numerical rating tool used to evaluate appellee\u2019s charter school application?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">II. Did the MSBE abuse its discretion in failing to reverse the Local Board based upon appellee\u2019s allegations of bias?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we answer both questions in the negative. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Appellee, SAFE, a corporation established for the purpose of creating and operating a charter school in Somerset County, Maryland, submitted an application to create a charter school to the Local Board on December 12, 2006, during a regular session public meeting of the Local Board. Appellee completed the application pursuant to the Public Charter School Guidance Materials published by Somerset County Public Schools (SCPS). The Charter School Review Committee (the Committee) initially reviewed appellee\u2019s application and determined that the application was \u201ctechnically incomplete.\u201d The Committee created a ten-page document detailing the deficiencies in the application and requesting clarification in fifty areas, and provided it to appellee on January 12, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">On March 12, 2007, appellee resubmitted its application. The amended application, according to the Committee, provided an \u201cadequate response\u201d to eight items, an \u201cinadequate response\u201d for twenty-nine items and thirteen items were deemed to require \u201cgroup discussion.\u201d Between March 22, 2007 and April 3, 2007, the Committee met with appellee\u2019s representatives on four occasions to discuss the areas of concern, including the Instructional Program, Administrative Structure, Special Education, Personnel, Finances, Business Management, Transportation, Technology and Facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The Committee, including the Superintendent, after reviewing the amended application and meeting with appellee\u2019s representatives, scored the amended application based upon an \u201canalytical scoring rubric\u201d that was developed by the Anne Arundel County Public Schools. The Local Board did not provide the numerical scoring tool to appellee until after the conclusion of the scoring process. Out of a maximum possible score of 530, appellee\u2019s application received a score of 189. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>score of 318 would have been sufficient to grant appellee\u2019s application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">After holding the four meetings, the Committee prepared a detailed document, listing the strengths and weaknesses of the various aspects of the application. The Local Board held a special meeting on April 12, 2007 to review the Committee\u2019s findings after scoring. None of appellee\u2019s representatives attended the April 12, 2007 meeting, despite the fact that the April 12, 2007 Local Board meeting was announced during January and March of the regular session meetings of the Local Board and appellee\u2019s representatives were again reminded of the meeting during the April 3, 2007 meeting with the Committee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the meeting on April 12, 2007, the Local Board voted 4-0 to deny the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">That same day, the Local Board sent a letter to appellee and enclosed the Public Agenda for the meeting, the Informational Handout from the meeting and the \u201cBoard and SAFE Packet,\u201d which contained the results of the review of the application. The packet included a breakdown of the criteria used to evaluate the application, along with a copy of the numerical scoring rubric and appellee\u2019s score. Although the document went into great detail about the various categories and sub-categories that were considered, we will provide an overview of the topics considered by the Local Board and the strengths and weaknesses that were identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Section One of the evaluation rubric considered the Executive Summary, Profile of the Founding Group, Background Information, Governance Structure, School Management and Administrative Structure, Student Populations, School Calendar and the Recruiting and Marketing Plan. The Local Board identified as strengths in this area appellee\u2019s enthusiasm, good will, commitment, ability to raise funds through grants, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>appellee had made many vendor contacts and had devoted significant funds for marketing and recruitment. The Local Board, however, also found the following to be weaknesses in this section: the summary, mission and goals failed to describe a school that is unique from Somerset County Public Schools, the individual for whom a resume was furnished to the Board had withdrawn his name from consideration from the daily operations of the Board of the proposed charter school, the governing board lacked experience in school leadership and operation, the organizational chart, which was changed throughout the interview process, did not align with the narrative, the budget or the discussion and that the identified goals were not stated in measurable terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Section Two of the evaluation rubric considered the Education Plan, the Academic Program, Standards and Curriculum, Student Assessment, Student Support Services, Code of Student Conduct and Parental Involvement and Community Participation. The Local Board again identified a number of strengths in the application, such as: the fact that the application established a 1:20 classroom ratio with a commitment not to go above 1:22, the proposed use of the \u201cCalvert Curriculum\u201d because it was a known and respected tool, the aspiration to provide foreign language and piano lessons to all students, the plan to use project-based learning to engage reluctant learners, the use of the \u201csophisticated technology,\u201d Curriculum Mapper, to track each teacher\u2019s instruction, the proposed use of Individual Learning Plans for each student with annual review and the expectation that parents be active participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The Local Board, however, pointed to a number of concerns in this area, including \u201cnotable calendar problems,\u201d a weak Special Education section, a lack of intervention plans to bring students up to grade level, insufficient coordination of implementation of the multiple proposed education plans, a lack of focus on the Maryland State Assessment and the attainment of adequate yearly progress, the inability of the administrative structure to comply with policies and procedures associated with federal and state records management and reporting requirements and a lack of clear procedure detailed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>application to support the stated goal of maintaining a racial and ethnic balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Section Three of the evaluation rubric exposed the greatest number of concerns that the Local Board had with appellee\u2019s application. Section Three considered Personnel, Human Resources, Payroll and Benefits, School Facilities, Finances, School Safety and Security, Transportation, Food and Nutrition and Accountability Plan. The Local Board noted several strengths, such as the fact that a budget item for charter school promotion and advertising was included in the application, appellee sought multiple partnerships to provide a facility, appellee had been aggressive in identifying land to use and appellee\u2019s plan to maintain employees through the thirteen years that students will spend in the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Unfortunately for appellee, the Local Board also noted numerous areas of deficiency in Section Three. Specifically, the Local Board pointed to a lack of a plan to attract and retain effective staff, a lack of clear and complete job descriptions, the failure to realize that the Chief Executive Officer of the school must also have the status of a Somerset County Public School (SCPS) employee, that the design that was submitted for the building was not the design that appellee intended to use, insufficient technology infrastructure in the plans and budgets, a lack of alternative transportation, a lack of food and nutrition services other than relying on SCPS, concerns about a conflict of interest regarding the lease arrangement, a lack of provision for compensation and management of personnel responsible for extra-curricular activities and an excessive amount of funds budgeted for student and staff promotion that may risk limiting other necessary expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In addition to the list of strengths and weaknesses, the Local Board attached to the packet ten pages detailing the precise categorical breakdown of the possible points and the mean rating of the eleven responses from the committee members.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>After the Local Board denied appellee\u2019s application, appellee timely noted an appeal to the MSBE. Before the MSBE, appellee challenged the Local Board\u2019s decision on three grounds: (1) that the denial of the charter was based on vague evaluation criteria, which lacked an \u201canalytical key,\u201d and that appellee did not receive the specific evaluation rubric during the evaluation process, (2) the denial based on budgetary concerns was arbitrary because SCPS did not provide appellee with the necessary funding information and (3) the Local Board abused its discretion based on the local school system\u2019s alleged resistance to charter schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The MSBE, employing the standard of review set forth in COMAR 13 A. 01.05.05(A),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> affirmed the decision of the Local Board in <em>Somerset Advocates for Educ. v. Somerset County Bd. of Educ., </em>MSBE Op. No. 07-39 (Oct. 30, 2007). First, the MSBE reviewed the evaluation process employed by the Local Board. Appellee argued in its Memorandum to the MSBE that the MSBE had previously ruled in an earlier case, <em>Potomac Charter School v. Prince George\u2019s County Bd. of Educ., </em>MSBE Op. No. 05-08 (Mar. 11, 2005), that technical review of a charter school application must \u201cinclude an explanation of the applicant\u2019s scores or the required analytical key.\u201d The MSBE distinguished <em>Potomac, </em>however, expositing that \u201cthe Board did not conclude that such failure required a finding that the evaluation process was per se arbitrary and capricious but rather, the Board evaluated the process as a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Relying on other prior agency decisions, the MSBE ruled: \u201cWhat is clear from those cases is that this Board looks at the evaluation process as a whole to determine if the process itself was so unfair that it resulted in an arbitrary decision.\u201d The MSBE ruled that the evaluation process was fair based upon the fact that the Local Board provided to appellee a ten-page technical review with requests for clarification in fifty areas, and met with appellee four times to \u201cdiscuss the application at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>length\u201d during meetings lasting sixty to ninety minutes each. The MSBE noted: \u201cGiven all those opportunities, it is difficult to conclude that the applicant did not understand how its application was being evaluated.\u201d With regard to appellee\u2019s claim that the evaluation tool was not congruent with SCPS Charter School Guidance Materials, the MSBE ruled: \u201cAgain we explain that the evaluation process is, by necessity, a fluid one. We would not expect absolute congruence between every piece of information the school sends out about charter schools and the evaluation tool. Here, we have reviewed the evaluation tool and find it to be an appropriate tool congruent with the Technical Review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Finally, with regard to appellee\u2019s claim that the Local Board denied the charter due to bias against charter schools, the MSBE reviewed the alleged incidents<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and concluded that the Local Board\u2019s decision did not appear to be influenced by bias against charter schools. \u201cWe return to the fact that SCPS spent 450 hours in reviewing the application, meeting with SAFE, and evaluating the amended application. We believe that type of commitment shows good faith on the part of the local school system, not resistence to the charter school effort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">. Appellee sought judicial review in the circuit court pursuant to COMAR 13A.01.05.il<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the circuit court reversed the decision of the MSBE, ruling that it was arbitrary and capri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>cious. Appellant noted a timely appeal to this Court. Additional facts will be supplied <em>infra </em>as warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS IN MARYLAND</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Before reaching the merits of this case, we shall provide a brief overview of the charter school movement and application process in Maryland. In <em>Baltimore City Bd. of School Comm\u2019rs v. City Neighbors Charter School, </em>400 Md. 324, 929 A.2d 113 (2007), Judge Wilner, writing for the Court of Appeals, summarized the concept and philosophy behind charter schools:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">Charter schools are in the nature of semi-autonomous public schools that operate under a contract with a State or local school board. The contract, or charter, defines how the school will be structured, staffed, managed, and funded, what programs will be offered, and how the school will operate and account for its activities. The movement to create charter schools, either by converting existing schools or by starting new ones, began in the 1990s from a growing concern that the public schools, at least in some areas, were not living up to legitimate public expectations, and the movement took root and spread quickly</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">The principal objective of those who desired to create such schools\u2014parents, educators, community groups, private entities\u2014was to develop and implement innovative and more effective educational programs, and, to do that, they needed and demanded freedom from some of the structural, operational, fiscal, and pedagogical controls that governed the traditional public school system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 328-29, 929 A.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">In 2003, the Maryland General Assembly enacted the Maryland Public Charter School Program currently embodied in Md.Code (2008 RepLVol., 2009 Supp.), Education Article (Ed.), \u00a7 9-101 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Section 9-103(a) vests in the local county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>boards of education primary chartering authority and the MSBE is granted secondary chartering authority pursuant to \u00a7 9-103(b) when it is \u201cacting in its appeal review capacity or as the public chartering authority for a restructured school in accordance with \u00a7 9-104(a) of this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00a7 9-104 sets forth the application and review procedure, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">(a) In general.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">(1) An application to establish a public charter school shall be submitted to the county board of the county in which the charter school will be located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">(2) An application to establish a public charter school may be submitted to a county board by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">(i) The staff of a public school;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">(ii) A parent or guardian of a student who attends a public school in the county;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">(iii) A nonsectarian nonprofit entity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">(iv) A nonsectarian institution of higher education in the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">(v) Any combination of persons specified in items (i) through (iv) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-13\">(3) A public chartering authority may not grant a charter under this title to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-14\">(i) A private school;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-15\">(ii) A parochial school; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-16\">(iii) A home school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-17\">(4) (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the county board shall review the application and render a decision within 120 days of receipt of the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-18\">(ii) For a restructured school:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-19\">1. The county board shall review the application and render a decision within 30 days of receipt of the application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>2. The county board may apply to the State Board for an extension of up to 15 days from the time limit imposed under item 1 of this subparagraph;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">3. If an extension is not granted, and 30 days have elapsed, the State Board may become a chartering authority; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">4. If an extension has been granted, and 45 days have elapsed, the State Board may become a chartering authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">(b) Denial and appeal.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">(1) If the county board denies an application to establish a public charter school, the applicant may appeal the decision to the State Board, in accordance with \u00a7 4-205(c) of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">(2) The State Board shall render a decision within 120 days of the filing of an appeal under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">(3) If the county board denies an application to establish a public charter school and the State Board reverses the decision, the State Board may direct the county board to grant a charter and shall mediate with the county board and the applicant to implement the charter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The foregoing statute constitutes the entire statutory framework governing the charter school application process. The specific requirements imposed by local boards to satisfy their own charter school application requirements are not fixed by statute and, therefore, may vary from county to county. Once the Local Board has denied a charter school application, the MSBE may only review that denial on the limited grounds embodied in COMAR 13A.01.05.05(A).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee submitted its application to the Local Board and, after being denied, appealed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>MSBE. The MSBE reviewed the Local Board\u2019s decision and affirmed the decision of the Local Board. Appellee filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the circuit court and the circuit court thereafter reversed the decision of the MSBE.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AeP\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">First, we must determine the precise issues that are before this Court and the appropriate standard of review that we must apply to our analysis of those issues. The parties confuse the issues before this Court and the applicable standard of review by, in part, challenging the ruling of the circuit court and in discussing the arbitrary and capricious standard of review and the substantial evidence test interchangeably in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Although the circuit court reversed the decision of MSBE on the basis that the decision was arbitrary and capricious \u201cfor failing to follow the precedent it set in Opinion No. 05-08 regarding disclosure of the analytical key,\u201d the Court of Appeals has made clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">As a court sitting in judicial review of an administrative decision, [Maryland appellate courts] review[ ] the decision in the same posture as that of the courts below. That is to say, we reevaluate the decision of the agency under the same statutory standards as would the circuit court, and we do not employ those standards to reevaluate the decision of the circuit court or intermediate appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\"><em>Charles Co.

School Comm\u2019rs, </em>51 Md. 401 (1879), we observed in <em>Board of Educ. of P.G. Co. v. Waeldner, </em>298 Md. 354, 359-62, 470 A.2d 332 (1984) that [the MSBE] \u201chas very broad statutory authority over the administration of the public school system in this State,\u201d that the totality of its statutory authority constitutes \u201ca visitatorial power of such comprehensive character as to invest the State Board \u201cwith the last word on any matter concerning educational policy or the administration of the system of public education____\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">400 Md. at 342-43, 929 A.2d 113 (quoting <em>Resetar v. State Board of Education, </em>284 Md. 537, 556, 399 A.2d 225 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The Court further noted that two standards of review can be applicable to a decision of the MSBE:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">In actions for judicial review of [MSBE] rulings and decisions, there may be two aspects to the issue of standard of review, although, because they are governed by the same principles, they often coalesce. There is ultimately the question of what standard the court is to apply in reviewing the [MSBE] decision, but subsumed in that may be the question of what standard should be applied by [the MSBE] when, in an appellate capacity, it reviews the decision of a county board of education.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 343, 929 A.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Accordingly, the Court has explained that, when the MSBE interprets a statute that it administers and applies, \u201c \u2018the paramount role of the State Board of Education in interpreting the public education law sets it apart from most administrative agencies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bd. Of Ed. For Dorchester Co. v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 790-91, 506 A.2d 625 (1986)). \u201cWhat that statement means is that [MSBE] rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>must be given heightened, not less, deference.\u201d <em>City Neighbors, </em>400 Md. at 343, 929 A.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The Court of Appeals has pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">This unbroken and consistent line of cases supports the precepts embodied in COMAR 13A.01.05.05.\u2014that (1) decisions of a local board involving a local policy or a dispute regarding rules or regulations of the local board shall be considered by [MSBE] as <em>prima facie </em>correct, and [MSBE] will not substitute its judgment for that of the local board in such cases unless the local decision is arbitrary, unreasonable, or illegal, but (2) [MSBE] shall exercise its independent judgment on the record before it in the explanation and interpretation of the State public school laws and State Board regulations. A local board decision will be regarded as arbitrary or unreasonable if \u201c[i]t is contrary to sound educational policy\u201d and it will be regarded as illegal if it \u201c[misconstrues the law\u201d or is \u201can abuse of discretionary powers.\u201d COMAR 13A.01.05.05.B.(1) and C.(3) and (5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUc\"><em>Id. </em>at 343-44, 929 A.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>unlike in <em>City Neighbors Charter School, supra, </em>the MSBE\u2019s decision did not construe- a State statute, but instead exercised appellate review of a local board\u2019s decision and was required to presume it correct absent a showing that the Local Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary, unreasonable or illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Before the MSBE, appellee argued that the Local Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because the criteria were vague, appellee was not provided with an \u201canalytical key\u201d as required by prior MSBE rulings and the evaluation rubric did not reflect the published requirements of the Local Board. The MSBE reviewed the Local Board\u2019s denial of appellee\u2019s charter application and ruled that it was not arbitrary, unreasonable or illegal because it determined that its prior rulings permit local boards to withhold a scoring rubric in the evaluation of a charter school application as long as the process as a whole is otherwise well-explained and fair to the applicant. Accordingly, we shall now review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>MSBE\u2019s decision in the case <em>sub judice </em>and determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious. <em>Md. State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 557-58, 625 A.2d 914 (1993); <em>Bond v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr.

Prince George\u2019s County Board of Education, </em>MSBE Op. No. 05-08 (Mar. 11, 2005) ] and failed to provide a legitimate basis for doing so.\u201d Appellee contends that the MSBE\u2019s alleged departure from this \u201ccommon sense rule\u201d rendered the application process \u201cpatently unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Appellant concedes that the MSBE previously noted in <em>Potomac Charter School v. Prince George\u2019s County Bd. of Educ., </em>MSBE Op. No. 05-08 at p. 7 that, \u201cif a numerical rating scale is used to evaluate an application, the local board must provide an analytical key that describes with specificity what is necessary or adequate to achieve each point on the scale.\u201d Nevertheless, appellant contends: \u201cThe State Board has had several opportunities since its opinion in <em>Potomac Charter Schools </em>to examine the fairness of evaluating a charter school application without providing a scoring tool to an applicant.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>A review of these rulings, appellant posits, \u201cclearly shows that the State Board views the scoring tool as an important, but not mandatory, part of the evaluation process.\u201d Therefore, appellant asserts, the MSBE did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to reverse the Local Board\u2019s decision based upon its failure to provide appellee with the evaluation rubric. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In discussing <em>Potomac Charter School, </em>MSBE Op. No. 05-08 in its decision in this case, the MSBE noted that \u201c... the failure to provide an analytical key to the applicant raised a concern on the part of the Board, but the Board did not conclude that such failure required a finding that the evaluation process was per se arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Somerset Advocates for Educ. v. Somerset County Bd. of Educ., </em>MSBE Op. No. 07-39 at 7 (Oct. 30, 2007). In <em>Potomac, </em>the MSBE actually dismissed the appeal as untimely, but had occasion to \u201cdescribe concerns [the MSBE had] with the evaluation tool used by the local board,\u201d one of those concerns being that the Prince George\u2019s County Board of Education had failed to provide the applicant with an analytical key until the case was appealed to the MSBE. MSBE Op. No. 05-08 at 6. As appellant correctly contends, the Local Board\u2019s actions were not reversed in <em>Potomac </em>as a result of the failure to furnish the evaluation rubric.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The MSBE further explained in its opinion in the case <em>sub judice </em>that its subsequent decisions in <em>Imagine Belair Edison Charter School v. Baltimore City Bd. of School Comm\u2019rs., </em>MSBE Op. No. 06-16 (May 24, 2006), and <em>Piscataway Creek </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>Montessori Communities, Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s County Bd. Of Educ., </em>MSBE Op. No. 07-21 (Apr. 24, 2007), highlight that the MSBE \u201clooks at the evaluation process as a whole to determine if the process itself was so unfair that it resulted in an arbitrary decision.\u201d In <em>Imagine Belair Edison Charter School, </em>the MSBE remanded the case to the Local Board because, since the time that the appeal was noted, facts had changed and the Local Board was willing to reconsider additional evidence from the applicants. MSBE Op. No. 06-16 at 11. In response to the applicant\u2019s claim that it did not know what to expect from the charter school application process, the MSBE stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">We encourage BCPSS, as we have other school systems, <em>see Potomac Charter School v. Prince George\u2019s County Board of Education, </em>Op. No. 05-08 (3/11/05), to develop clear guidelines for the evaluation process, to explain the process to all applicants, and to make the process as consistent and transparent as possible. If a numerical scoring system is being used, the point system should be clearly explained to the applicant. Moreover, we reiterate the importance of consistency and fairness in the total evaluation process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYs\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Later, in <em>Piscataway Creek Montessori Communities, Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s County Bd. of Educ., </em>MSBE Op. No. 07-21 (Apr. 24, 2007), the MSBE again addressed the use of a numerical scoring system in the charter school application process. As the MSBE explained in its opinion in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP-\">In <em>[Piscataway </em>], it was not clear from the record that the local school system had shared the Evaluation Rubric with the applicants. Despite that flaw, this Board concluded that the evaluation process was a fair one because applicants had ample opportunity to discuss the evaluation criteria in interviews with the Review Committee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In fact, the MSBE, in <em>Piscataway, </em>specifically looked to the information provided to the applicant during its meeting with the Local Board and found it \u201cto be sufficient for an applicant to determine what the application needed to contain, at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>minimum.\u201d MSBE Op. No. 07-21 at 7. The MSBE also again encouraged local boards to \u201cdevelop a transparent charter school application evaluation process, particularly defining with as much specificity as possible what an application must contain and how it will be evaluated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. The MSBE affirmed the decision of the local board. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Appellee contends: \u201cAt best, these decisions involved the upholding of Local Board opinions under distinguishable circumstances. At worst, the decisions simply show that the State Board\u2019s pattern and practice with respect to reviewing charter school applications is inconsistent and unjust.\u201d We disagree. In its decision in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the MSBE discerned that its prior decisions looked to \u201cthe evaluation process as a whole____\u201d Guided by its previous decisions, the MSBE concluded that \u201cit is abundantly clear from the facts that the applicant had an extraordinary number of opportunities to discuss with the Review Team their concerns about flaws in the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In this case, as the MSBE had done in earlier cases, it looked to whether the applicant had other means of ascertaining what information was required to be in the charter school application aside from the evaluation rubric. In light of the discussion of the MSBE opinions above, we fail to see how the MSBE acted inconsistently and departed from agency precedent in determining that, because appellee received a ten-page Technical Review from the Local Board, met with the Review Team four times to discuss the application and had sufficient guidance from the Somerset County School System\u2019s own Public Charter School Guidance Materials, the evaluation process was fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Appellee alternatively contends that the charter school application review process was a \u201csham\u201d and that the evaluation rubric employed by the Local Board was arbitrary. The crux of appellee\u2019s contention is that the rubric developed by the Anne Arundel County Public Schools was not congruent with the criteria published by SCPS and, therefore, it was arbitrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>to apply the rubric to appellee\u2019s application. The MSBE ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">Again we explain that the evaluation process is, by necessity, a fluid one. We would not expect absolute congruence between every piece of information the school sends out about charter schools and the evaluation tool. Here, we have reviewed the evaluation tool and find it to be an appropriate tool congruent with the Technical Review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Appellant points out that the Checklist that the Local Board provided to appellee contained twenty-two of the twenty-three components used in the numerical rating tool (payroll and benefits were not included on the checklist). Additionally, appellant contends, the Technical Review provided by the Local Board to SAFE followed the subcategory headings on the Application Checklist identically and contained feedback in each area. The primary difference between the rubric and the Local Board\u2019s initial written review of appellee\u2019s application, appellant correctly notes, is the order in which the various categories were listed. Accordingly, we hold that the MSBE\u2019s review of the Local Board\u2019s decision was not arbitrary and capricious, but rather was consistent with its prior rulings in similar cases.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Appellant next contends that the MSBE\u2019s review of the Local Board\u2019s decision in this case was reasonable and fair in concluding that the Local Board\u2019s decision was not influenced by bias against charter schools and we should therefore reverse the decision of the circuit court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Before the MSBE and the circuit court, appellee argued that Local Board\u2019s decision was influenced by its resistance to or bias against charter schools, as allegedly demonstrated by the following incidents:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">1. SAFE was required to respond to questions that could only be answered effectively after negotiations with SCPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">2. SCPS failed to document requests for assistance with food services and denied assistance with food services.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">3. SCPS failed to provide job descriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">4. SCPS retracted an offer of assistance with special education in violation of its written Public Charter School Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">5. SCPS denied SAFE the use of a vacant school building in contradiction of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">6. SCPS failed to make staff available to assist in developing a charter school application in contradiction to its Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">7. SCPS failed to invite SAFE to the public Board meeting concerning their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">8. SCPS misrepresented SAFE\u2019S attitude and intentions in the Minutes of the four meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">9. SCPS made false statements to the media and community.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>10. SPCS did not work with SAFE in a way that would enhance chartering effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The MSBE ruled that each of the foregoing instances could be categorized as the Local Board\u2019s \u201cfailure to provide assistance.\u201d It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">We return to the fact that the SCPS spent 450 hours in reviewing the application, meeting with SAFE, and evaluating the amended application. We believe that type of commitment shows good faith on the part of the local school system, not resistance to the charter school effort. It may well be that the review and the evaluation process was rigorous, grueling, difficult or even contentious but that does not make the process illegal. When the evaluation process is viewed as a whole, it is our conclusion that it was a fair process and certainly one that was legally sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Before the circuit court, appellee argued that \u201c[i]t is simply not plausible to conclude that all of these incidents do not evidence a clear bias on the part of the Local Board.\u201d The circuit court declined to reach this issue and on appeal to this Court appellee advances no specific counter argument to appellant\u2019s claim that the MSBE\u2019s decision was unbiased, but instead generally states that the charter school movement \u201cis often met with resistance by the established education bureaucracy.\u201d Appellee asserts, relying on <em>City Neighbors Charter School, </em>400 Md. at 329, 929 A.2d 113, that the Court of Appeals has noted that \u201cbias toward charter school applicants is not at all uncommon.\u201d Appellee states that the Court of Appeals has explained that charter schools, in general have \u201c... created obvious areas of conflict with various components of the existing public school system\u2014school boards, administrators, teachers unions, and local fiscal authorities\u2014which mostly and often vehemently oppose[ ] the effort____\u201d 400 Md. at 329, 929 A.2d 113. Appellee takes this quote completely out of context. In the quoted portion of <em>City Neighbors Charter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>School, </em>the Court of Appeals was not discussing the issue of bias against charter school applicants, but instead was providing the history of the charter school movement in Maryland and across the United States to set the stage for the controversial public policy decisions that the movement produced for the Maryland General Assembly prior to the enactment of \u00a7 9-101 <em>et seq. </em>400 Md. at 329-30, 929 A.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">As appellant properly points out and as we explained, <em>supra, </em>on appeal, we review the decision of the MSBE. Implicit in the MSBE\u2019s ruling is that none of the alleged incidents demonstrated that bias or impartiality on the part of the Local Board. \u201cIn determining whether there is either actual bias or an appearance of impropriety on the part of a decision maker in a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, we begin with the presumption of impartiality.\u201d <em>Regan v. State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam\u2019rs, </em>355 Md. 397, 411, 735 A.2d 991 (1999). The Court of Appeals has held that the test to be applied when there is an allegation of bias or impartiality is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac3\">\u201c... an objective one which assumes that a reasonable person knows and understands all the relevant facts---Like all legal issues, judges determine appearance of impropriety\u2014not by what a straw poll of the only partly informed man-in-the-street would show\u2014but by examining the record facts and the law, and deciding whether a reasonable person knowing and understanding all the relevant facts would recuse the judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Boyd v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 86, 581 A.2d 1 (1990)). <em>See also Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 107, 622 A.2d 737 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">First, we note that appellee never requested that any member of the Local Board or the MSBE recuse himself or herself. Professor Rochvarg has explained that in the context of administrative decision-making, \u201c[i]n general, there are three types of disqualifying bias: financial bias, personal bias and prejudgment bias.\u201d Arnold Rochvarg, Maryland Administrative Law, 91 (2d ed.2007). Appellee did not allege matters which involved financial, personal or prejudgment bias in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>its list of ten alleged incidents, but rather generally alleged that the Local Board was opposed to the establishment of charter schools. That, in itself, would not constitute a basis for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Local Board was generally opposed to granting a charter, such opposition would not have automatically rendered the Local Board unable to make a fair and impartial decision. Moreover, assuming the Local Board was so biased, there is no evidence in the record that was before the MSBE that demonstrates that such \u201cbias\u201d influenced the Local Board\u2019s decision to deny appellee\u2019s application. Professor Rochvarg has explained that merely possessing a \u201cpredilection toward a certain policy\u201d does not render an administrative decision-maker unfit to render an impartial decision. <em>Id. </em>at 94.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">For example, an administrative official who has expressed concern over the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay would not necessarily be disqualified in a proceeding involving an application for construction of a medical waste incinerator near the bay unless the official had stated his/her position on the particular facts of that application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">We hold that there was nothing illegal, arbitrary or capricious about the MSBE\u2019s determination that the allegations raised by appellee constituted complaints about the Local Board\u2019s failure to provide a certain level of assistance during the review process and did not constitute evidence of partiality, bias or a predisposition against charter schools that influenced the Local Board\u2019s review of appellee\u2019s charter school application. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR SOMERSET COUNTY REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-11\">.

Appellant first argues that the <em>circuit court </em>erred in finding that the language set forth in <em>Potomac Charter School v. Prince George\u2019s County Bd. of Educ., </em>MSBE Op. No. 05-08 (Mar. 11, 2005) constituted binding precedent and a clear directive to all local boards of education when evaluating charter school applications. We decline to address this argument because, as explained, <em>supra, </em>we are not reviewing the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b425-6\">. Appellee incorrectly states in its brief that \"... the State Board in <em>Potomac Charter affirmed </em>the Local Board\u2019s decision only after taking into consideration the Petitioner\u2019s charter application.\u201d The MSBE neither affirmed nor reversed the local board in <em>Potomac Charter School, </em>but instead dismissed the appeal as untimely and merely commented on its concerns with the local board\u2019s review process \"for the guidance of the parties.\u201d MSBE Op. No. 05-08 at 6. In fact, the MSBE concluded its opinion in <em>Potomac Charter School </em>as follows: \u201cTherefore, if we were to rule on the merits of the application, we would conclude that the local board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously.\" <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\">. It should be noted that, at oral argument before the panel of this Court, appellee\u2019s counsel was asked, would not the result be the same irrespective of whether the trial court\u2019s decision was affirmed or reversed, <em>i.e., </em>the appellee, in either case, will be required to submit a new application to the Review Committee.

Although the MSBE did not specifically evaluate this allegation about media commentary in its opinion, because it is the only allegation that comes close to the issue of partiality or bias, we will briefly comment on it. In appellee\u2019s appeal to the MSBE, it alleged that the Superintendent and other members of the Local Board engaged in \"fear mongering\u201d by commenting to the media on the tax impact of a charter school and other comments about the decision to deny the charter. Appellee attached to its Memorandum three newspaper articles (one a duplicate version in electronic format, leaving only two substantive articles). None of the statements indicated any negative comment about this particular charter application or charter schools in general, but rather expressed the same concerns voiced in the denial of the charter, <em>i.e., </em>the technical deficiencies in the application. Moreover, the tax comment made by the Superintendent was actually that the voting members were directed <em>not </em>to consider the tax impact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>proposed charter school in deciding whether to grant the charter. Finally, all of these comments were made and published <em>after </em>the Local Board denied appellee\u2019s application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
