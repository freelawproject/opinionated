A Claims Specialist from the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (\u201cDLLR\u201d) granted Parham benefits on July 19, 2007. Mid Atlantic appealed, and a hearing was held on August 21, 2007. On August 30, 2007, the DLLR hearing examiner found that Parham had left Mid Atlantic\u2019s employment voluntarily and, therefore, was not entitled to unemployment benefits. She appealed to the DLLR Board of Appeals (\u201cthe Board\u201d), which adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings of fact and affirmed his decision to deny her benefits. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the decision of the Board on July 1, 2008. Parham appeals that decision, raising one question, which we have reworded as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayt\">Was the hearing examiner\u2019s finding and conclusion that Parham voluntarily quit her job, which was adopted by the Board, supported by competent, material, and substantial record evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">For the following reasons, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Parham was employed at Mid Atlantic from January 31, 2007, through April 14, 2007. During this period she missed three days of work: March 5, April 11 and April 12. On April 14, 2007, she returned to work for her next scheduled shift following the April 11 and 12 absences. After Parham \u201cclocked in,\u201d Barbara Wolferman, the \u201cmanager\u201d on duty, asked to talk with her. The substance of this conversation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>which is the heart of this matter, is disputed. What is not in dispute is that, when the conversation ended, Parham left the premises without \u201cclocking out\u201d and did not contact Mid Atlantic again.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">On June 19, 2007, a Claims Specialist from DLLR determined that \u201cinsufficient information [had] been presented to show that the claimant\u2019s actions constituted misconduct in connection with the work\u201d and that \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the separation [did] not warrant a disqualification under section 8-1002<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> or 8-1003<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> of the Maryland Unemployment Insurance Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Mid Atlantic appealed the Claim Specialist\u2019s determination on August 3, 2007. The notice of a hearing on the appeal, sent to Parham on August 7, 2007, stated that the issues on appeal were: \u201cWhether the claimant\u2019s separation from this employment was for a disqualifying reason within the meaning of the MD Code Annotated Labor and Employment Article, Title 8, Sections 8-1001 (voluntary quit for good cause),<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> 8-1002-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>1002[.]1<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> (gross/aggravated misconduct connected with the work) or 8-1003 (misconduct connected with the work).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The notice also stated that \u201c[e]ach Party should arrange for all necessary -witnesses to attend the hearing, and for all necessary documents to be presented at the hearing,\u201d and, under the heading \u201cInstructions for Telephone Hearings,\u201d that \u201c[a]ny evidence [parties] wish the hearing examiner to consider must be received by the Appeals Division at least five working days prior to the hearing. Copies must be sent to other parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">A telephone hearing was set for August 21, 2007. On August 16, 2007, a Mid Atlantic representative sent to DLLR a \u201cFax\u201d captioned \u201cExhibits Attached,\u201d stating that it \u201cwould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>like to submit the attached documents as exhibits for the hearing.\u201d The attached documents included a section of the applicable union contract dealing with the probationary status of new employees and two forms related to Parham\u2019s separation from the company, titled \u201cEmployee Disciplinary Report\u201d (\u201cEDR\u201d) and \u201cEmployee Hire and Change Report\u201d (\u201cEHCR\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The EDR, dated April 11, 2007,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> described the \u201cNature of Incident\u201d as \u201cUnexcused Absence.\u201d Under \u201cFacts of the Incident\u201d was written: \u201cSaid her legs hurt-won\u2019t be in. (April 11, 2007). Called 4-12-07 said she won\u2019t be in.\u201d Under the heading \u201cAction to be Taken,\u201d the box for \u201cTermination\u201d was marked. Next to \u201cSignature of Supervisor,\u201d it was signed \u201cBarbara Wolferman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The EHCR, dated April 24, 2007, described the \u201cChange(s)\u201d as \u201cQuit\u201d with the following under \u201cRemarks:\u201d \u201cJob Abandonment Was Ask [sic] To Call Manager Refuse For No Reason And Walk Out.\u201d It was signed by \u201cDonald A. Kauffman\u201d as \u201cDept. Head\u201d and \u201cBill Hogan\u201d as \u201cPlant Manager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">During the hearing on August 21, 2007, Mid Atlantic presented two witnesses: Erica Stokes, a human resources coordinator for Mid Atlantic, and Kauffman. Neither was present when Parham left work on April 14. Stokes testified that Parham was instructed, on April 12, to speak with Kauffman about her absenteeism when she returned to work.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She also testified that she was not present on April 14 but that her records showed that Parham was written up for quitting \u201cbecause she walked out without punching out on April 14th.\u201d In her testimony, Stokes referred only to the EHCR and Parham\u2019s timecard. She did not refer to the EDR or indicate that she had discussed the incident with Wolferman directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Kauffman testified that he learned of the incident on April 15, 2007, when he returned to work. He received the write-up for Parham\u2019s absences of April 11 and 12, 2007, and talked to Wolferman about her April 14 discussion with Parham. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">[T]hat next day when I came to work, the 15th, that\u2019s when [Wolferman] had told me that [Parham] had come into work, and that she had words with her saying that she did not, you know, like what was, you know, she had discussed the absenteeism of the 11th and 12th with her, and she wasn\u2019t happy with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">So [Wolferman] wrote her up and wanted [Parham] to sign it. She refused. There\u2019s no signature on the write-up. She refused to sign it. At that point, [Parham] had left the building. She didn\u2019t even punch out. She just left the building and she was instructed that she needed to talk to me before she came back to work.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Parham\u2019s testimony at the hearing directly contradicted Stokes and Kauffman\u2019s testimony that she was told to call Kauffman. Parham testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">Barbara told me that I had to call out and Don said I couldn\u2019t operate so she had to let me go. So I just left. What was I supposed to do-stand there and disrespect the lady or argue with her? I had to leave the building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">She also stated, \u201cNo one told me to call anyone. [Wolferman] just told me to leave the building. That was that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFp\">In deciding the matter against Parham, the hearing examiner found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">.... When [Parham] arrived for work on April 14th, she was told by her supervisor that she must report to the manager, Donald Kauffman. [Parham] never reported to Mr. Kauffman but left the premises without punching off the time clock. [Parham] was not heard from after that time, although work was available for her had she continued to report for her next scheduled workday. The manager, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Mr. Kauffman did not have a conversation with [Parham] to determine the circumstances for her absences and had not made a determination whether or not he should exercise the employer\u2019s right to terminate the claimant\u2019s employment within the probationary period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Finding that Parham had failed to present sufficient evidence that the quit was for either good cause or due to a valid circumstance, the hearing examiner concluded that Parham had voluntarily quit and reversed the determination of the Claims Specialist, thereby denying Parham unemployment benefits under Lab. &amp; Empl \u00a7 8-1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Parham appealed the hearing examiner\u2019s decision to the Board, which, upon review of the record, \u201cadopted\u201d the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the hearing examiner. The Board affirmed the decision of the hearing examiner, denying Parham unemployment benefits. Parham then sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Board opted to participate as an appellee pursuant to Lab. &amp; Emp. \u00a7 8-512(a)(3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Office of the Attorney General, representing the Board, filed a response and informed Mid Atlantic that if it wished to participate in the appeal it had thirty days to file a response. No response was filed by Mid Atlantic. The circuit court affirmed the decision of the Board. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\u201cWhen reviewing an administrative agency decision, our role \u2018is precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tabassi v. Carroll County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>182 Md.App. 80, 85, 957 A.2d 620 (2008) (quoting <em>Howard County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Linda J., </em>161 Md.App. 402, 407, 869 A.2d 404 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>(2005) (citation omitted)). We review the administrative decision itself and not the decision of the circuit court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Lab. <em>&amp; </em>Empl. \u00a7 8-512(d) establishes the scope of review of a final decision of a Board of Appeals. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">In a judicial proceeding under this section, findings of fact of the Board of Appeals are conclusive and the jurisdiction of the court is confined to questions of law if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">(1) findings of fact are supported by evidence that is competent, material, and substantial in view of the entire record; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">(2) there is no fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">In reviewing an administrative action, the Court of Appeals has said that \u201c[a] court\u2019s role is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994). In addition, the Court of Appeals, quoting its decision in <em>United Steelworkers v. Bethlehem Steel, </em>298 Md. 665, 679, 472 A.2d 62 (1984), stated that \u201cfa] reviewing \u2018Court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Parcel, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">This Court, in <em>Dept. of Economic &amp; Empl. Dev. v. Taylor, </em>108 Md.App. 250, 261-262, 671 A.2d 523 (1996), <em>aff'd, DLLR v. Taylor, </em>344 Md. 687, 690 A.2d 508 (1997), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">Our review of the Board\u2019s findings of fact is deferential. In the absence of fraud, our inquiry is whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence and are reasonable, not whether they are right. <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 515, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978). We examine the agency\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in light of the record as a whole-that is, whether a reasoning mind could have made those findings from the evidence adduced. <em>Singletary v. Maryland State Dep\u2019t of Public Safety and Corr. Services, </em>87 Md.App. 405, 416, 589 A.2d 1311 (1991).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">This case presents the narrow question of whether the hearing examiner\u2019s finding and conclusion that Parham voluntarily quit her job, which was adopted by the Board, was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence and was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Parham argues that the decision violates her right to due process of law. She states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">In the case at bar, the only factual finding bearing on [her] intent in leaving Mid Atlantic\u2019s building on April 14 is that she \u201cwas told by her supervisor that she must report to the manager, Donald Kauffman\u201d but did not do so and instead walked out of the building. [ ] The only evidentiary basis for this finding is Kauffman\u2019s testimony that [she] \u201cjust left the building [on April 14] and she was instructed to talk to me before she came back to work.\u201d This hearsay evidence was accepted for the truth of the matter asserted: that someone told Kauffman that [she] was told when she returned to work on April 14 to report to Kauffman, but she instead left the building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The Board first argues that Parham\u2019s arguments \u201cwere not preserved for appellate review,\u201d and, therefore, we should decline to consider them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">Ms. Parham argues for the first time on appeal before this Court that the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision was based upon unreliable hearsay and, therefore, the Hearing Examiner violated her due process rights. [ ] First, during the hearing, Ms. Parham did not object to the testimony she now identifies as hearsay. Second, Ms. Parham did not raise this issue in her appeal of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision to the Board, which never had the opportunity to consider it. [] Accordingly, this argument is foreclosed from appellate review. <em>See [Department of Economic &amp; Employment Development </em>v.] <em>Owens, </em>75 Md.App. [472,] 477, 541 A.2d 1324 [(1988)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Arguing that \u201c[t]he issue of whether the Board\u2019s decision was supported by sufficient evidence is preserved,\u201d Parham states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>As hearsay is generally admissible in an administrative hearing, there was little reason for [her] to have noted an objection, even if she had known as a <em>pro se </em>claimant to do so. But the question of admissibility is very different from whether the total quantity of evidence considered by the hearing examiner and Board of Appeals is sufficient to constitute substantial evidence and comport with due process</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Parham cites <em>Maryland Dept. of Human Res. v. Bo Peep Day </em>Nursery, 317 Md. 573, 565 A.2d 1015 (1989), cert. <em>denied, Cassilly v. Maryland Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>494 U.S. 1067, 110 S.Ct. 1784, 108 L.Ed.2d 786 (1990), where, she states, the Court of Appeals noted the distinction between objecting to the admissibility of hearsay evidence and arguing \u201cthat hearsay was both so unreliable and so pervasive as to undermine the substantiality of the evidence\u201d supporting the agency decision. According to Parham:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">DLLR\u2019s proposition also runs counter to the thrust of Md.Code Ann., Labor and Employment Article \u00a7 8-5A-12(d)(1) (2008), which provides that the Court shall review Board decisions for whether its \u201cfindings of fact are supported by evidence that is competent, material, and substantial in view of the entire record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">It is the challenge to the underlying basis of the Board\u2019s decision, not admissibility, that Ms. Parham has raised here, asking if the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence where the sole evidentiary basis of the decision was Kauffman\u2019s rendition of Wolferman\u2019s unreliable April 15 hearsay statements regarding the contents of the April 14 conversation</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Rule 8-131(a) provides that, \u201c[o]rdinarily,\u201d an appellate court will not decide any issue \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d This Rule applies to appellate review of administrative proceedings. <em>Owens, </em>75 Md.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>478, 541 A.2d 1324 (An argument is \u201cforeclosed from appellate review\u201d if the party fails to \u201craise the theory at some point in the administrative process.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Parham\u2019s <em>pro se </em>hand-written appeal of the hearing examiner\u2019s decision, though not written in terms of \u201cunreliable hearsay\u201d and \u201cthe denial of due process,\u201d clearly indicated that the factual dispute surrounding her conversation with Wolferman is the heart of the case. In our view, this was sufficient to raise the issue before the Board and, coupled with her testimony at the hearing and Wolferman\u2019s obvious absence from the proceeding, preserved the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The Finding That Parham Quit</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The Board contends that the hearing examiner correctly found that Parham voluntarily quit by leaving work without punching out and never contacting Kauffman, the manager who had the authority to fire her. We must view the record as a whole to determine whether the evidence supporting that finding was \u201ccompetent, material, and substantial.\u201d Lab. <em>&amp; </em>Empl. \u00a7 8-5A-12(d)(l); <em>Singletary, </em>87 Md.App. at 416, 589 A.2d 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In the context of Lab. &amp; Empl. \u00a7 8-1001, an employee\u2019s intent to quit is a necessary element of \u201cvoluntarily leaving work.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>108 Md.App. at 273, 671 A.2d 523. Intent is an issue of fact to be decided by drawing reasonable inferences from admitted conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 273, 671 A.2d 523; <em>Dep\u2019t of Economic and Employment Dev. v. Hager, </em>96 Md. App. 362, 371, 625 A.2d 342 (1993). The hearing examiner found that \u201c[w]hen [Parham] arrived for work on April 14th, she was told by her supervisor that she must report to the manager, Donald Kauffman.\u201d As this was the factual scenario alleged by Mid Atlantic, it follows that the hearing examiner accepted as credible Stokes\u2019 and Kauffman\u2019s testimony that Parham was told to report to Kauffman and rejected Parham\u2019s testimony that she was told on April 14 that she had been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Parham contends that the EDR supports her version of what happened on April 14.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In her notice of appeal to the Board, she wrote: \u201cMs. Barbara Wolferman terminated me on my first call out on April 11, 2007. Ms. Wolferman sign [sic] and dated my Disciplinary Report on April 11, 2007, and Ms. Wolferman added on my call out for April 12, 2007[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">On appeal to this Court, Parham argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">Mid Atlantic\u2019s own documentary evidence based on Wolferman\u2019s first-hand knowledge of the April 14 conversation corroborated Ms. Parham\u2019s account and contradicted Kauffman: The \u201c[EDR]\u201d presented to Ms. Parham on April 14 stated specifically that the \u201cAction to be Taken\u201d with her was \u201cTermination.\u201d The [EDR] was signed by Wolferman acting as an agent for Mid Atlantic and based on her firsthand knowledge....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The EDR, purportedly signed by Wolferman on April 11, 2007, clearly indicates that the disciplinary action to be taken against Parham is termination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It was created prior to April 14 by Wolferman, provides a line for the signature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>employee, and would appear to be the \u201cwrite-up\u201d Kauffman is referring to when he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">[T]hat next day when I came to work, the 15th, that\u2019s when [Wolferman] had told me [Parham] had come into work, and that she had words with her saying that she did not, you know, like what was, you know, she had discussed the absenteeism of the 11th and 12th with her, and she wasn\u2019t happy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">So she wrote her up and wanted her to sign it. She refused. There\u2019s no signature on the write-up. She refused to sign it.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The EDR lends support to Parham\u2019s testimony that she was told she was terminated. There are, for example, several \u201cwarning\u201d blocks on the EDR that could be checked and a block for \u201cother\u201d action to be taken, but the only block checked was the one marked \u201cTermination.\u201d Also, there is nothing written anywhere on the form to indicate that Parham was to talk to anyone prior to termination, and no \u201cEmployee Comments\u201d are noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">We recognize, of course, that hearsay is admissible in administrative proceedings. <em>Kade v. Charles H. Hickey School, </em>80 Md.App. 721, 725, 566 A.2d 148 (1989). Yet, if it is to be relied upon as the basis of an administrative decision, the hearsay \u201cmust be competent and have probative force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of the record as a whole and the obvious and singular importance of what happened in the meeting between Parham and Wolferman, Stokes\u2019 and Kauffman\u2019s hearsay testimony that Wolferman told Parham to call Kauffman on April 14, 2007, did not constitute \u201ccompetent, material, and substantial\u201d evidence that Parham voluntarily quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">As Parham points out, the courts have looked to many factors to determine the reliability of hearsay evidence. One indication of its reliability is whether it has been directly contradicted by other more reliable evidence. <em>See Rogers v. Radio Shack, </em>271 Md. 126, 128, 314 A.2d 113 (1974). Another factor is whether the appellant had a meaningful opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>to cross examine the hearsay declarant. <em>Kade, </em>80 Md.App. at 725-27, 566 A.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Stokes and Kauffman were not present when Wolferman and Parham had their April 14 discussion. Their testimony to what Wolferman said took place on that day, if not directly contradicted, certainly was not supported by the EDR that Wolferman prepared. The EHCR, while relevant, was also based on Wolferman\u2019s report to Kauffman and not on firsthand knowledge. Because Wolferman, obviously the most competent and critical Mid Atlantic witness to the April 14 exchange, did not testify, there was no opportunity for meaningful cross-examination. Moreover, Mid Atlantic provided no explanation of her unavailability. <em>See Kade, </em>80 Md.App. at 721, 566 A.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In consideration of the issue presented and the record as a whole, Stokes\u2019 and Kauffman\u2019s testimony surrounding the meeting on April 14 did not constitute competent, material, and substantial evidence that Parham voluntarily quit.
