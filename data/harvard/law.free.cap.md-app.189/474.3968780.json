Parker raises four issues, which we quote in the order in which we will address them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">1. Is [CrL] \u00a7 9-303 unconstitutionally vague?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">2. Was the evidence legally sufficient to sustain Appellant\u2019s conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">3. Did the trial court err in refusing to declare a mistrial [after the prosecutor alerted the jury to a prior conviction of the appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">4. Did the trial court err in allowing the prosecutor to ask improper \u201cwere they lying\u201d questions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">We conclude that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, and that there was sufficient evidence to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for threatening to harm another in retaliation for a witness\u2019s testimony. But we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to appellant\u2019s prior conviction was unduly prejudicial, and that appellant\u2019s request for a mistrial should have been granted. We vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings. For the guidance of the trial court, we also agree with the appellant that it was improper for the prosecutor to ask appellant whether other witnesses had been lying when they testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">Willie Lee Parker and Wendy Swan were arrested by Detective Todd Dunkle and charged separately with narcotics offenses. Swan had had a romantic relationship with Parker, and is the mother of his child. The two were prosecuted separately. Swan\u2019s case was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Washington County on January 10, 2006. Parker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>attended Swan\u2019s trial, at which Det. Dunkle was a principal witness. Throughout the day of Swan\u2019s trial, Parker appeared agitated and angry, and he glared at Det. Dunkle and other witnesses. At the end of the day, Swan was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">After the conclusion of Swan\u2019s trial, Det. Dunkle left the courthouse, accompanied by Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Brett Wilson and two or three other police officers who had been involved in the case. When they walked out the front door of the courthouse, Det. Dunkle noticed Parker standing at the top of the steps. Their eyes met, and Det. Dunkle and his group walked past.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Det. Dunkle testified that, when he reached the bottom of the courthouse steps, he heard Parker say to him: \u201cNow that you fucked with my family, I\u2019ll be fucking with yours.\u201d Det. Dunkle turned around and approached Parker. According to Det. Dunkle, he asked Parker: \u201cWhat did you just say? Did you just threaten my family?\u201d And he heard Parker respond: \u201cYes, you ruined my family, so I\u2019ll ruin yours. You made it personal first.\u201d Det. Dunkle became angry, and he acknowledged that he \u201chad some colorful words to say back\u201d to Parker \u201cbecause [Parker] made the threat against my children and my wife.\u201d The others accompanying Det. Dunkle persuaded him to calm down and walk away from the confrontation with Parker.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Later that day, Det. Dunkle initiated charges against Parker for violating CrL \u00a7 9-303(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">(a) Prohibited.\u2014A person may not intentionally harm another, threaten to harm another, or damage or destroy property with the intent of retaliating against a victim or witness for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">(1) giving testimony in an official proceeding; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">(2) reporting a crime or delinquent act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Three days later, on January 13, 2006, Parker went to the District Court of Maryland for Washington County and filed an application for statement of charges against Det. Dunkle, alleging harassment. In the application, Parker recited his version of what was said on the courthouse steps. Parker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>asserted that he was being harassed by Det. Dunkle on January 10, 2006, and that the officer had a history of harassing Parker. On January 17, 2006, Parker filed a similar application for statement of charges against Officer Robison, one of the officers who was with Det. Dunkle at the courthouse during the confrontation on January 10, 2006. No charges were issued for either police officer as a consequence of Parker\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Parker was tried on the retaliation charge initiated by Det. Dunkle. At the conclusion of a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Washington County, Parker was convicted and sentenced to seven and one-half years of imprisonment. Parker noted this appeal. Additional details about the trial proceedings will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">1. CrL \u00a7 9-303 is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Parker contends that CrL \u00a7 9-303 is unconstitutionally vague on its face. Appellant maintains that \u00a7 9-303(a) is so general in the manner it proscribes threats of harm with the intent to retaliate that it (a) is fatally vague and ambiguous, and (b) does not provide fair notice as to precisely what actions are prohibited by the law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 610-11, 781 A.2d 851 (2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 990, 122 S.Ct. 1547, 152 L.Ed.2d 472 (2002): \u201cIn determining the constitutionality of statutes, [t]he basic rule is that there is a presumption that the statute is valid____We are reluctant to find a statute unconstitutional if, by any construction, it can be sustained.\u201d When the challenge to a statute is based on vagueness, \u201c[t]he party attacking the statute has the burden of establishing its unconstitutionality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 781 A.2d 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">\u201cA penal statute is vague if it violates the cardinal requirement that it be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>liable to its penalties.\u201d <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 459, 569 A.2d 604 (1990) (citations omitted). A statute may be void for vagueness if it lacks fixed enforcement standards or guidelines. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe touchstone is whether persons of common intelligence need reasonably guess at its meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted). <em>See also Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 125, 389 A.2d 341 (1978) (a statute is not unconstitutionally vague where the words used \u201cpossess a common and generally accepted meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We summarized the principles governing review of a challenge to the vagueness of a statute as follows in <em>Jeandell v. State, </em>165 Md.App. 26, 33-34, 884 A.2d 739 (2005), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>395 Md. 556, 910 A.2d 1141 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">In <em>Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 616 A.2d 1275 (1992), the Court of Appeals discussed the void-for-vagueness doctrine, and noted that it \u201crequires that a penal statute \u2018be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 616 A.2d 1275 (quoting <em>Connally v. General Const. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926)). Quoting from <em>Williams, supra, </em>and <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 389 A.2d 341 (1978), the Court further elaborated upon the doctrine in <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 615-16, 781 A.2d 851 (2001):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">A well grounded principle in federal constitutional law is that, when considering the void-for-vagueness doctrine, courts consistently consider two criteria or rationales. <em>See, e.g., Williams, </em>329 Md. at 8, 616 A.2d at 1278; <em>Eanes [v. State], </em>318 Md. [436] at 459, 569 A.2d [604] at 615; <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 120-21, 389 A.2d at 345. The first rationale is the fair notice principle that \u201cpersons of ordinary intelligence and experience be afforded a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that they may govern their behavior accordingly.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 8, 616 A.2d at 1278 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 121, 389 A.2d 341); <em>see Ferro v. Lewis, </em>348 Md. 593, 607, 705 A.2d 311, 318 (1998). The standard for determining whether a statute provides fair notice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201cwhether persons \u2018of common intelligence must necessarily guess at [the statute\u2019s] meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 8, 616 A.2d at 1278 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 607, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2913, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973)). A statute is not vague under the fair notice principle if the meaning \u201cof the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves, <em>if </em>they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 125, 389 A.2d at 348 (emphasis added) (citations omitted); see <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 460, 569 A.2d at 615-16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">The second criterion of the vagueness doctrine regards enforcement of the statute. This rationale exists \u201cto ensure that criminal statutes provide \u2018legally fixed standards and adequate guidelines for police, judicial officers, triers of fact and others whose obligation it is to enforce, apply and administer the penal laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 8[-]9, 616 A.2d at 1278 (quoting <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 121, 389 A.2d 341). To survive analysis, a statute must \u201ceschew arbitrary enforcement in addition to being intelligible to the reasonable person.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 9, 616 A.2d at 1279. In <em>Bowers, </em>we determined that, as to this standard, a statute is not unconstitutionally vague</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">merely because it allows for the exercise of some discretion on the part of law enforcement and judicial officials. It is only where a statute is so broad as to be susceptible to irrational and selective patterns of enforcement that it will be held unconstitutional under this second arm of the vagueness principle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d at 346; <em>see Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 464, 569 A.2d at 617.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">As a general rule, the application of the void-for-vagueness doctrine is based on the application of the statute to the \u201cfacts at hand.\u201d <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d at 346 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The <em>Galloway </em>Court further observed that \u201cit will usually be immaterial that the statute is of questionable applicability in foreseeable marginal situations, if a contested provision clearly applies to the conduct of the defendant in a specific case.\u201d 365 Md. at 616, 781 A.2d 851 (quoting <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d 341 (citing <em>United States v. Petrillo, </em>332 U.S. 1, 7, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 91 L.Ed. 1877 (1947))). The Court noted, however, that a statute that potentially infringes upon the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment may be challenged as vague on its face. <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 617, 781 A.2d 851. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 122-23, 389 A.2d 341:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">A different rule governs, however, where the statute in question appears to intrude upon fundamental constitutional liberties, particularly the First Amendment guarantees of free speech and assembly. In such cases, not only may the two vices of inadequate notice and insufficient adjudicative guidelines be present, but in addition the indefiniteness of the statute itself may inhibit the exercise of protected freedoms. <em>Winters v. New York, </em>333 U.S. at 509, 68 S.Ct. 665; <em>United States v. National Dairy Corp., </em>372 U.S. at 36, 83 S.Ct. 594.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201c[T]here is [in these cases] the danger that the state will get away with more inhibitory regulation than it has a constitutional right to impose, because persons at the fringes of amenability to regulation will rather obey than run the risk of erroneous constitutional judgment.\u201d Note, 109 U. Pa. L.Rev. at 80.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">On account of this \u201cchilling effect\u201d which vagueness can exert on First Amendment liberties, the Supreme Court has stated that whenever a criminal statute may, because of imprecise draftsmanship, impact upon free speech rights, the void-for-vagueness doctrine \u201cdemands a greater degree of specificity than in other contexts.\u201d <em>Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 U.S. at 573, 94 S.Ct. 1242; <em>accord, Hynes v. Mayor of Oradell, </em>425 U.S. at 620, 96 S.Ct. 1755; <em>cf. Coates v. City of Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971) (ordinance held unconstitutionally vague because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>conditioned exercise of right of assembly upon unascertainable standard). Translated, this principle of strict specificity means that where First Amendment values are at least potentially involved, the statute is to be tested for vagueness <em>on its face. Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 U.S. at 573, 94 S.Ct. 1242; <em>Winters v. New York, </em>333 U.S. at 509, 68 S.Ct. 665. So considered, the principle is essentially a rule of standing, permitting a defendant to challenge the validity of a statute as applied to marginal cases, even though the acts for which he has been charged may be squarely within the coverage of the statute. Note, 109 U. Pa. L.Rev. at 97. Once it is determined, however, that a strict specificity standard ought to apply in any given case, the criteria for measuring the validity of a statute under the vagueness doctrine are the same as in a non-First Amendment context: fair warning and adequate guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The statute challenged in the case before us is sufficiently clear that there is no need to look beyond its language to understand its meaning. <em>Grandison v. State, </em>390 Md. 412, 445, 889 A.2d 366 (2005). The words \u201cthreaten to harm\u201d are unambiguous in the context of CrL \u00a7 9-303. The purpose of the law is plain: to enable individuals to report criminal activity or participate in official proceedings without fear that they will be retaliated against for doing so. The statute\u2019s purpose clause states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">FOR the purpose of prohibiting a person from harming another, threatening to harm another, or damaging or destroying property with the intent to induce a victim or witness not to report the existence of facts relating to a crime or delinquent act; ... prohibiting a person from threatening to harm another with the intent of retaliating against a victim or witness for giving testimony in an official proceeding or for reporting a crime or delinquent act____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">2005 Md. Laws, Chapter 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">The statute is \u201c \u2018sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>329 Md. at 8, 616 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>1275 (quoting <em>Connally v. General Const. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926)). And the operative phrase \u201cthreaten to harm another\u201d has \u201ca common and generally accepted meaning,\u201d <em>Bowers, supra, </em>283 Md. at 125, 389 A.2d 341, such that \u201c\u2018persons of ordinary intelligence and experience [are] afforded a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that they may govern their behavior accordingly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>329 Md. at 8, 616 A.2d 1275 (quoting <em>Bowers, supra, </em>283 Md. at 121, 389 A.2d 341).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The law clearly applies to the facts alleged in this case. When viewed in a light most favorable to the State, the evidence showed that a police officer who investigated a crime and testified in a trial that led to a conviction was told by an associate of the convicted person, in an angry voice, \u201cnow that you fucked with my family, I\u2019ll be fucking with yours.... Yes, you ruined my family, so I\u2019ll ruin yours.\u201d This comment was made directly outside the courthouse, within minutes after the jury\u2019s verdict had been returned. There can be no question that the words \u201cI\u2019ll be fucking with your[ family]\u201d would be perceived by a witness as a retaliatory threat of harm. Section 9-303 is intended to prevent persons from tampering with testimonial proceedings by threatening, intimidating, or retaliating against witnesses. Any person of ordinary intelligence would know that approaching a witness and expressing an intent to \u201cfuck with\u201d or \u201cruin\u201d the witness\u2019s family would be viewed as conduct threatening harm in retaliation for the witness\u2019s participation in the proceeding. The statute is adequately clear to inform members of the public that such conduct is prohibited. The circuit court was correct in ruling that this law is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">2. The evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Parker contends that the State\u2019s evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his conviction under CrL \u00a7 9-303(a) for intentionally threatening to harm Det. Dunkle\u2019s family in retaliation for Det. Dunkle\u2019s testimony in Swan\u2019s January 2006 trial. A jury\u2019s verdict will not be disturbed on appeal if, \u201cafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)(emphasis in original); <em>see Harrison v. State, </em>382 Md. 477, 487-88, 855 A.2d 1220 (2004); <em>Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 12-13, 796 A.2d 821 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Parker contends that the statute requires proof that Parker intended to cause physical or bodily harm to Det. Dunkle at the time Parker made his comments, and that there was insufficient evidence that Parker so intended. According to Parker, \u201c[t]he issue is whether there was sufficient evidence to find that Appellant intentionally threatened to physically harm Officer Dunkle with the intent to retaliate for his testimony.\u201d Parker argues that the evidence showed that Parker filed an application for statement of charges against Det. Dunkle in the District Court three days after the confrontation at the courthouse, and that the pursuit of such legal action was what he was alluding to when he exchanged words with Det. Dunkle on the day of Swan\u2019s trial. Parker asserts: \u201cThere is no evidence that Appellant ever intended to inflict bodily harm.... No rational trier of fact could have found that he intended to inflict bodily harm beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We reject Parker\u2019s interpretation of what the State must prove to support a conviction under CrL \u00a7 9-303(a). The portion of the statute that is pertinent to the communication between Parker and Det. Dunkle provides that \u201c[a] person may not intentionally ... threaten to harm another ... with the intent of retaliating against a ... witness for: (1) giving testimony in an official proceeding; or (2) reporting a crime or delinquent act.\u201d The essential elements of the statutory offense that was charged in this case are: (1) that the defendant made an intentional threat to harm another person; and (2) that the defendant made the threat with the intent of retaliating against a witness who had testified in an official proceeding. Those elements were proved by the evidence presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Contrary to Parker\u2019s argument, the statute does not require a threat of <em>physical </em>harm. Nor does the statute require that the threatened harm be directed at the witness (as opposed to the witness\u2019s family members or others). Nor does the statute require proof that the party making the threat had an actual intent to commit the harm to another. The critical element is the threat of harm, intentionally communicated to the witness for the purpose of retaliating against the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">If the jury viewed all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the jury could have found that Det. Dunkle was a witness who had testified in an official proceeding against Swan, who was the mother of Parker\u2019s child. Because the outcome of the official proceeding against Swan was not in accordance with Parker\u2019s wishes, the jury could have properly inferred from the evidence that Parker had a motive to retaliate against Det. Dunkle, and further, that Parker had the intent to retaliate against Det. Dunkle when Parker uttered the threatening words on the courthouse steps. And the jury could have reasonably found that Parker said to Det. Dunkle: \u201cNow that you fucked with my family, I\u2019ll be fucking with yours.\u201d Additionally, the jury could have found that Parker confirmed that his statement was intended to be a threat when the detective asked him directly, \u201cDid you just threaten my family?\u201d Parker responded: \u201cYes, you ruined my family, so I\u2019ll ruin yours. You made it personal first.\u201d Those statements supported a finding that Parker, acting in retaliation for a witness\u2019s testimony, had intentionally threatened to harm another.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">As noted above, the test for evidentiary sufficiency is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781; <em>see State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323 (1998). When the evidence in this case is viewed in that light, the evidence was legally sufficient to support the conviction for a violation of CrL \u00a7 9-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>3. The court erred in denying the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Prior to the start of the trial, defense counsel alerted the court to his concern that, in the retaliation case, the jury might be prejudiced by the fact that the alleged retaliation involved a witness in a drug prosecution. The court agreed that, subject to the court\u2019s further ruling, there should be no references to the underlying facts of other cases. The discussion on Parker\u2019s motion in limine was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... [I]t\u2019s kind of an odd issue in the sense that Officer Dunkle just testified at my client\u2019s ex-girlfriend\u2019s trial. It was a drug distribution trial. The charges here today have to do with her trial [that] was concluded, it\u2019s retaliatory in nature, and I believe letting this jury hear that it was a drug distribution trial or that Mr. Parker was still facing that [sic] would prejudice this jury against my client____I don\u2019t think the jury should be polluted with knowing that it was a drug distribution trial ____So I\u2019d ask the Court to instruct the witnesses not to mention his ex-girlfriend\u2019s criminal conduct or his that were past or present that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I think we\u2019re talking about two separate trials here. There was a trial that took place on January 10th, in this building, that involved Wendy Swan. That\u2019s the alleged facts that this case is involved in, the defendant\u2019s alleged girlfriend. There was then a trial approximately two months later, March the 9th, where the Defendant himself was convicted. If [Defense Counsel] is arguing that that proceeding is not relevant to this proceeding, the State\u2019s not necessarily going to disagree----What happened with Wendy Swan is very relevant and is essential for the State to prove its case because that goes to the whole nature, how did Detective Dunkle mess up the Defendant\u2019s family, in the Defendant\u2019s words. But as for the Defendant\u2019s trial itself and what happened to the Defendant, the State agrees that that may not necessarily be relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I didn\u2019t imagine the State was going to re-litigate Wendy Swan\u2019s case. I thought it was just going to mention, he was at her legal proceeding____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">THE COURT: What I\u2019m going to do is grant in part the Motion <em>in Limine. </em>And I will instruct the State that you may certainly inquire briefly into the nature of why everybody was here for a legal proceeding.... But I don\u2019t know the fact that it was a drug distribution proceeding is necessarily relevant to the jury\u2019s determination in this matter. So I think you\u2019ll have to be very careful, and we may have to address some of the issues on a question by question basis. But I want the State to limit its testimony in regard to what kind of ... case proceeding it was on January the 10th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">* Jfc ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So the fact that Mr. Parker was present at a legal proceeding wherein a woman was convicted is permissible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: And one other clarification, Your Honor, ... if the Defendant elects to testify, ... that the Defendant\u2019s prior record, if it\u2019s relevant for impeachment purposes, is still admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">THE COURT: Well we\u2019ll get there when we get there. I don\u2019t know about that. I\u2019ll reserve on that request. [PROSECUTOR]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">When Det. Dunkle testified, he was asked whether he saw Parker when leaving the courthouse on January 10. Det. Dunkle replied: \u201cI looked at him ..., gave a quick glance, because I know his personality. I\u2019ve dealt with him in the past. Other officers have dealt with him.\u201d At a later point in his testimony, Det. Dunkle added: \u201cI know Mr. Parker is a local. I didn\u2019t think he would be very difficult to find.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>When the prosecutor asked Det. Dunkle if he had previously had \u201cany type of altercation with the Defendant,\u201d the officer replied: \u201cNo. I mean other than disagreements on maybe the reasons I might have stopped him on any given night like, you know, \u2018You don\u2019t have a right to stop me.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, I do. Give me a minute.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Before Parker took the stand to testify in his own defense, the court and counsel reviewed with Parker whether his prior conviction for conspiracy to distribute CDS would come into evidence if Parker testified. The following conference took place at the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Parker, we\u2019ve reached the point in the case that we can choose to present a defense or not. You have an absolute right to testify.... If you do cho[o]se to testify, the State may seek to impeach you with crimes of moral turpitude or other issues. I\u2019d ask the State now what they intend on using against you so you can decide whether or not you want to testify. Mr. [Prosecutor], do you intend on asking him about any criminal priors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: 1997 conviction for a CDS.... Well, actually, conspiracy to distribute CDS, not marijuana. It was in the Circuit Court for Washington County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It\u2019s a conspiracy charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL4\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to deny the State\u2019s request to cross-examine on the......, to raise that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, Mr. Parker, the State\u2019s not going to be allowed to ask you about that criminal prior as long as you don\u2019t open the door, you know, in a big way. Do you want to testify at this time? You don\u2019t have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">DEFENDANT PARKER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No one is going to hold it against you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-12\">DEFENDANT PARKER: Yeah, I want to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-13\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Parker testified that he was standing outside the courthouse, smoking a cigar, when Det. Dunkle and his group came out. He gave the following account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">Q [by Defense Counsel]: Did eventually ... you and Officer Dunkle get into some sort of verbal disagreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag0\">A: He turned around after he left out the courthouse and said what did I say about his family, and I told him, \u201cI ain\u2019t said shit about your family.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">Q: Did there come a point in time that you got off the ramp area and got onto the step area in front of the courthouse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">A: I got at......, to the top of the steps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">Q: And what happened when you were on the top of the steps?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">A: Officer Dunkle had started cussing at me, and I started cussing back at him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">Q: Do you remember anything that he said to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\">A: He was like, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fing make this personal.\u201d I was like, \u201cYou already did.\u201d You know, what I mean? And I ......, we was just pretty much......, I was calling him names, he was calling me names.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\">Q: Did you ever threaten him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-15\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-16\">Q: Did you ever threaten his family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-17\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-18\">Q: Prior to his testimony today, did you even know that he was married?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-19\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-20\">Q: Did you know that he had children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-21\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-22\">Q: Do you know where he lives?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-23\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-24\">During the cross-examination of Parker, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Q [by the Prosecutor]: Now, sir, you testified that police officers harassed you, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">A: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">Q: In fact, Detective Dunkle had investigated you, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">Q: And that investigation led to you being convicted, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Move for mistrial please. [PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, the Defendant opened the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-12\">door by arg......, by saying police officers harassed him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If we could approach, Your Hon- or?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-14\">THE COURT: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">Parker contends on appeal that the circuit court should have granted his motion for a mistrial because the prosecutor\u2019s reference to his prior conviction deprived him of a fair trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">We note that the State has not raised any issue as to preservation, and we deem the issue adequately preserved by Parker\u2019s motion for mistrial. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-323(c), relative to objections other than rulings on evidence: \u201cFor purposes of review by the trial court or on appeal of any other ruling or order, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take on the objection or the action of the court.\u201d Here, Parker\u2019s request for a mistrial was plainly stated, and the court\u2019s refusal to permit counsel to approach the bench to argue the motion in greater detail effectively denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">The State argues on appeal that \u201cit seems likely that the conviction to which the State was referring [in the question asked on cross-examination of Parker] was not the 1997 conviction, which the court had excluded, but the March 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>2006, conviction which had come shortly after Parker\u2019s threats.\u201d The State suggests that the prosecutor perceived a need to ask about the conviction because Parker had testified that he had \u201cfil[ed] harassment charges against two officers that constantly just pull me over, harass me constantly.\u201d But during arguments on Parker\u2019s motions in limine, the prosecutor had conceded that the 2006 conviction was not relevant to the retaliation charge, stating: \u201cThere was then a trial [on] ... March the 9th, where the Defendant himself was convicted. If [Defense Counsel] is arguing that that proceeding [ie., the one that resulted in the conviction on March 9, 2006] is not relevant to this proceeding, the State\u2019s not necessarily going to disagree.\u201d Further, when defense counsel inquired of the State what prior convictions the prosecution \u201cintend[s] on using against you so you can decide whether or not you want to testify,\u201d the March 9, 2006, conviction was not mentioned by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The State further argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial. Generally, the decision to grant or deny a mistrial is committed to the discretion of the circuit court. Our review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Coffey v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 587, 597, 642 A.2d 276 (1994). The Court of Appeals has held that a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial will not be reversed \u201cunless the defendant was so clearly prejudiced that the denial constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 422, 583 A.2d 218 (1990), citing <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 516, 495 A.2d 1 (1985). But the Court of Appeals has found reversible error in a trial court\u2019s failure to grant a mistrial in cases in which there was a high probability that the improper reference influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>E.g., Rainville v. State, </em>328 Md. 398, 411, 614 A.2d 949 (1992) (\u201cIt is highly probable that the inadmissible evidence in this case had such a devastating and pervasive effect that no curative instruction, no matter how quickly and ably given, could salvage a fair trial for the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>In <em>Kosmas v. State, </em>316 Md. 587, 594-595, 560 A.2d 1137 (1989), the Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial after a witness for the prosecution made an improper reference to the defendant\u2019s refusal to take a lie detector test. After stating the general rule that \u201cthe decision of whether to grant a motion for a mistrial rests in the discretion of the trial judge,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 594, 560 A.2d 1137, the Court of Appeals noted that the key question for the appellate court is whether the defendant was so prejudiced by the improper reference that he was deprived of a fair trial. The Court stated, <em>id. </em>at 594-95, 560 A.2d 1137:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">In somewhat similar situations, involving mention of a lie detector test in connection with a witness other than the defendant, we have identified factors that should be considered in determining whether the evidence was so prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial. In <em>Guesfeird v. State, </em>300 Md. 653, 659, 480 A.2d 800 (1984), we said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7q\">The factors that have been considered include: whether the reference to a lie detector was repeated or whether it was a single, isolated statement; whether the reference was solicited by counsel, or was an inadvertent and unresponsive statement; whether the witness making the reference is the principal witness upon whom the entire prosecution depends; whether credibility is a crucial issue; whether a great deal of other evidence exists; and, whether an inference as to the result of the test can be drawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">As we also pointed out, these factors are not exclusive and do not themselves comprise the test. The question is whether the prejudice to the defendant was so substantial that he was deprived of a fair trial, and the enumerated factors are simply helpful in the resolution of that question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Applying the <em>Kosmas-Guesfeird </em>factors to the present case, we note that the reference was a single, isolated statement; it was an intentional statement made by the prosecuting attorney despite the trial judge\u2019s instructions and rulings on Parker\u2019s motions in limine; the party making the reference was a person of significant influence in the case and the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>principal representative for the prosecution; although the court sustained Parker\u2019s objection, no curative instruction was requested; and no curative instruction was given. Most important, credibility was the critical issue: if the jury believed Parker\u2019s version of the incident, there was no threat to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In <em>Kosmas, </em>the Court of Appeals found that the potential impairment of the defendant\u2019s credibility was the deciding factor that compelled reversal of the denial of the motion for mistrial. The Court stated, <em>id. </em>at 598, 560 A.2d 1137:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">If the defendant is believed in those areas in which his testimony conflicts with that of [the two witnesses for the prosecution], the State\u2019s case is very weak. Again, then, it is apparent that the issue of the defendant\u2019s credibility is a central and crucial factor in this case, and the State\u2019s evidence that does not hinge at least in part upon the determination of that credibility is hardly of sufficient strength to permit us to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the inadmissible evidence did not in any way influence the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Similarly, in Parker\u2019s case, because the jury\u2019s finding on the critical issue\u2014what Parker said to Det. Dunkle on the courthouse steps\u2014depended on the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to a prior conviction did not in any way unfairly influence the verdict. The prosecutor\u2019s act of informing the jury that Parker was a convicted criminal \u201calmost certainly had a substantial and irreversible impact upon the jurors, and may well have meant the difference between acquittal and conviction.\u201d <em>Rainville, supra, </em>328 Md. at 410, 614 A.2d 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Although Parker requested no curative instruction, this was a case in which any curative instruction was likely to exacerbate the harm by re-emphasizing the information the jury was not supposed to have heard in the first instance. Because this case turned upon whether the jury believed the testimony of Det. Dunkle or the contrary testimony of the defendant, \u201c[i]t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>is highly probable that the [prosecutor\u2019s reference to Parker\u2019s prior conviction] had such a devastating and pervasive effect that no curative instruction, no matter how quickly and ably given, could [have] salvage[d] a fair trial for the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 614 A.2d 949. <em>See </em>5 Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 103:10 (2d ed. 2001) 55-57 (\u201cThe efficacy of an instruction to disregard is questionable. Not only may jurors not be able to erase from their minds the inadmissible information they have heard, but an instruction to disregard may emphasize it____ And, where the error complained of is particularly egregious, the courts will find the instruction to disregard insufficient to cure the resulting prejudice.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)). <em>See also Medical Mut. Liab. Ins. Soc. v. Evans, </em>330 Md. 1, 24, 622 A.2d 103 (1993) (\u201cthe prejudice resulting from the improper cross-examination of [defendant\u2019s claims manager] transcended the curative instruction, and ... the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial\u201d). Although we are generally reluctant to overrule a trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial, we conclude that the case before us presents one of those rare instances in which the denial of the motion for mistrial constituted an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we must vacate the judgment and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">4. \u201cWere they lying?\u201d questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">During cross-examination of Parker by the prosecutor, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">Q [By the prosecutor]: Well you were there when Detective Dunkle and Mr. Wilson came out, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS9\">A: I was ..., I was leaving as they were leaving, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">Q: And then you said something to Detective Dunkle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">A: No sir, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-12\">Q: In fact didn\u2019t you say, \u201cNow that you fucked with my family, I\u2019ll be fucking with yours\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">A: No sir, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-14\">Q: So Detective Dunkle is lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-15\">A: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Q: And Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, Brett Wilson, is lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atj-\">A: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\">Q: And anyone else who may have heard that comment is lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">A: Anyone that got on the stand and said they heard that comment is lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">Q: So everyone\u2019s lying here today except for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">A: I don\u2019t have a reason to lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">Q: I\u2019m not asking you if you had a reason. I\u2019m just simply asking you, you\u2019re the only one telling the truth, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">A: Yes, they are lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">Q: Well, Detective Dunkle turned and asked you if you threatened his family, didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">A: He asked me what did I say about his family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-12\">Q: And you then responded, \u201cYes, you ruined my family, so I\u2019ll ruin yours. You made it personal first.\u201d Didn\u2019t you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">A: No, I did not say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-14\">Q: So if Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, Brett Wilson, heard that he\u2019s lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, argumentative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-16\">A: He\u2019s lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-17\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-18\">Q: And, sir, Detective Dunkle again, he\u2019s not telling the truth then in regards to that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-19\">A: He\u2019s not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-20\">Q: And Detective Lehman, who testified from that witness stand that he heard you make a comment about family, he\u2019s also not telling the truth then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-21\">A: Detective Lehman, I don\u2019t believe he said anything about family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-22\">Q: Well if [sic] would have said it, that\u2019s not true then? What......, what he testified to is not true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-24\">A: If he were to say it, no, it would not be true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Parker contends that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning requires reversal on two grounds: first, asking one witness whether another witness was lying is error, and, second, the questioning was improperly argumentative. Although Parker\u2019s single belated objection was not sufficient to preserve this argument for appeal, because the issue is likely to arise again upon retrial, we comment briefly on the issue for the benefit of the trial court. We agree that the prosecutor\u2019s series of questions was improper, and that a timely objection should have been sustained. <em>See </em>Joseph F. Murphy, Jr\u201e Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 1303 (3d ed. 1999) (\u201cThe most frequent impropriety [in impeachment techniques] seems to involve arguing the credibility of other testimony____Such interrogation is totally objectionable. <em>American Stores Co. v. Herman, </em>166 Md. 312, 314-15, 171 A. 54, 55 (1934).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">A review of the transcript in this case illustrates one of the problems that arises from questions that ask one witness if another witness was lying. When the prosecutor began the series of questions, the prosecutor accurately quoted Det. Dunkle\u2019s testimony asserting that Parker had said: \u201cNow that you fucked with my family, I\u2019ll be fucking with yours.\u201d But no other witness testified to those specific words having been said.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Det. Lehman recalled hearing Det. Dunkle ask, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Det. Lehman testified that when Parker responded, Lehman heard Parker \u201cdistinctly saying, \u2018You fucked with my family.\u2019 \u201d But Det. Lehman did not corroborate the alleged threats, <em>viz., </em>\u201cI\u2019ll be fucking with yours\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll ruin yours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Brett Wilson also failed to confirm either of the specific threats that Det. Dunkle had testified to. Mr. Wilson recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">I remember the jawing escalating and specifically remember a loud......, the Defendant yelling, \u201cYou......, you fucked up my family. I\u2019m going to......\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m something......\u201d, at which point I don\u2019t recall what the ending of that sentence was because I turned immediately, Detective Dunkle turned immediately, and we began proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>back towards where the Defendant was which was still at the top of the steps. And he was leaning forward and continued......, well the first thing I remember is Detective Dunkle asking, \u201cWhat did you say about my family?\u201d And at that point, Mr. Parker continued saying, \u201cYou fucked up my family. You fucked up my family. It\u2019s personal. It\u2019s personal.\u201d I remember that being said over and over again as we walked back towards him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">Q: ... [WJhat exactly did Detective Dunkle do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">A: He turned, and 1 turned, and he proceeded walking back towards the Defendant. And as I stated, he asked, you know, \u201cWhat did you say about my family?\u201d And we were moving back towards him, that\u2019s when the Defendant continued to say, \u201cYou fed up my family. It\u2019s personal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao3\">Although both Det. Lehman and Mr. Wilson corroborated some details about the encounter, neither of them testified to the specific threats that Det. Dunkle had testified to. As a consequence, several of the prosecutor\u2019s questions about whether Lehman and Wilson were lying when they testified to the same facts as Det. Dunkle were not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In <em>Hunter v. State, </em>397 Md. 580, 919 A.2d 63 (2007), which was decided after Parker\u2019s trial, the Court of Appeals disapproved of this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Fisher v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 79, 149-53, 736 A.2d 1125 (1999), and held that the \u201cwere the other witnesses lying\u201d form of cross-examination is not permitted. The <em>Hunter </em>Court explained, 397 Md. at 595-96, 919 A.2d 63:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">[PJetitioner was asked five questions that put him in a position of characterizing the testimony of two other witnesses. He was asked five \u201cwere-they-lying\u201d questions. These questions were impermissible as a matter of law because they encroached on the province of the jury by asking petitioner to judge the credibility of the detectives and weigh their testimony, <em>ie., </em>he was asked: \u201cAnd the detective was lying?\u201d The questions also asked petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>to stand in place of the jury by resolving contested facts. Moreover, the questions were overly argumentative. They created the risk that the jury might conclude that, in order to acquit petitioner, it would have to find that the police officers lied. The questions were further unfair because it is possible that neither the petitioner nor the police officers deliberately misrepresented the truth. These questions forced petitioner to choose between answering in a way that would allow the jury to draw the inference that he was lying or taking the risk of alienating the jury by accusing the police officers of lying. Therefore, the trial court erred in allowing the State to ask petitioner \u201cwere-they-lying\u201d questions. When prosecutors ask \u201cwere-they-lying\u201d questions, especially when they ask them of a defendant, they, almost always, will risk reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In the 2008 Cumulative Supplement to Judge Murphy\u2019s treatise, Maryland Evidence Handbook, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1303, he notes that two judges dissented in the <em>Hunter </em>case \u201con the ground that \u201cwere they lying\u2019 questions \u2018serve to highlight, in oftentimes lengthy and complicated trials, the contradictions that the jury must consider in assessing credibility.\u2019 [397 Md. at 605, 919 A.2d 63.]\u201d Judge Murphy comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">The dissenting opinion fails to recognize the difference between: (1) the permissible \u201cdo you dispute ...\u201d question\u2014which does not ask the witness to read someone else\u2019s mind, and (2) the improper \u201cwas that witness lying ...\u201d question, which is both impossible to answer and unfair when employed <em>ad nauseam </em>(as it was in this case).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">As in <em>Hunter, </em>the \u201cwere-they-lying\u201d questions the prosecutor asked Parker were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY WASHINGTON COUNTY.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
