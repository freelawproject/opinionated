She admits killing the victim, but contends it was in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">According to the evidence adduced at trial, on the evening of 2 June 1977 appellant and Ray Dawson, her ex-husband with whom she had resumed living, became involved in a heated argument. When Dawson indicated he was going out appellant attempted to stop him by twisting and bending the metal license plates on his car with her bare hands. Apparently angered by this, Dawson knocked appellant to the ground and drove off. After having a couple of drinks, appellant obtained a ride with Diane Aubinoe to the Summit Apartments in Rockville to look for her husband. On arriving at this apartment complex they rode around until Dawson's car was seen. Appellant and Diane got out of the car and approached two people sitting in lawn chairs drinking beer. Upon recognizing Dawson as one of the persons, appellant inquired, \u201cwhat in the hell are you doing here?\u201d to which he answered, \u201cnone of your damn business.\u201d Appellant then smacked him across the face, whereupon he retaliated by hitting her a number of times and, according to Diane, \u201cfought her like a man.\u201d During the fight Margaret Bress, the victim, remained seated in the other lawn chair as if nothing were happening. During the melee, appellant leaped on top of Mrs. Bress and wrapped her arms around Mrs. Bress\u2019s neck. Dawson, however, pulled her off and continued striking her. Diane indicated that she did not join the fight because appellant was doing a pretty good job of defending herself, and Dawson was getting the worst of it. Eventually, Dawson walked away and Mrs. Bress went into her apartment and closed the sliding door to the patio. Appellant then banged on the door several times and yelled, \u201copen the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>door bitch.\u201d Soon thereafter, Mrs. Bress opened the patio door and apparently stood in the doorway.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">According to appellant, when Mrs. Bress opened the door she had a knife in her hand. \u201cI asked her to come out, I would like to talk to her\u201d and she said: \u201cNo, I am not coming no damn place.\u201d Mrs. Bress swung the knife in front of her and said, \u201cshe would cut my damn guts out.\u201d She became \u2022frightened and reached in her pocket book and pulled her gun out. When Mrs. Bress stepped toward her again swinging the knife, \u201cI touched the trigger just a little too hard, I guess, and it went off.\u201d After the shooting she put the.gun in her pocketbook and walked to the parking lot where she was .stopped by Mr. Papadopoulas, a tenant who lived in the apartment above the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The State\u2019s version of the incident, as testified to by the victim\u2019s husband and children who were in the apartment, was that the victim did not have a knife and that she was shot immediately after opening the door. There is nothing in the record to show that the victim left her apartment prior to the shooting, or that the appellant attempted to enter it.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">On appeal appellant contends (1) that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury on the issue of self-defense; (2) that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress the gun seized from a pocketbook during a warrantless search; (3) that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress a series of statements taken while she was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">The trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury regarding self-defense were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-11\">\u201cThe defendant has raised the. issue of self-defense, that is, legal justification. In order to justify the crime charged on the basis of self-defense, the defendant must have had reasonable grounds to believe, and must have, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>fact, believed herself to be in apparent, imminent or immediate danger of bodily harm from her assailant or potential assailant. The circumstances under which the defendant acted must have been such as to produce in the mind of a reasonably prudent person, similarly situated, the reasonable belief that the other person was about to kill her or to do her serious bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201cYou must determine whether the defendant was justified in meeting force with force. If you find such justification, the force used against another must not have been unreasonable or excessive. There must not have been used more force than the exigency reasonably demanded. One is not entitled to use any greater force that he or she has reasonable grounds to believe, and actually did believe, to be necessary under the circumstances to save her life or to avert serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">\u201cIf the defendant actually did believe that she was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm from which she could save herself only by using deadly force, and had reasonable grounds to so believe, then she had a right to employ deadly force to defend herself. Deadly force is that which is intended to or likely to cause great bodily harm or death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">\u201cDeadly force is unreasonable if non-deadly force is sufficient to avert the threatened harm. However, deadly force may be entirely reasonable under some circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">\u201cGenerally, ladies and gentlemen, the law does not require one to retreat. There used to be a concept, and still is in some jurisdictions, that you always had to retreat to the wall before you could use any self-defense or force to oppose someone else who was coming after you. That is no longer the law with respect to a person who is blameless in the first instance, who is not the aggressor or did not provoke the incident. A non-aggressor does not have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>retreat,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] CD but if you are the aggressor, even with this limited intent going in, then the law says that you must retreat if there is a reasonably available area of retreat for you and if time and circumstances permit the retreat, and if you don\u2019t retreat and you use fatal force, then you may be guilty of manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201cThe burden is upon the State to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Appellant did not take exception to the Court\u2019s charge, but requested additional instructions \u2014 which were denied. The narrow issue then is whether the Court committed reversible error in refusing to give appellant\u2019s requested instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u201cMR. AARONSON: First, Your Honor, with respect to retreat: We request that the jury be instructed that if you find the defendant was the aggressor and that there is a duty to retreat, the retreat is a subjective concept and the test is: Subjectively in the circumstances of the moment did she have an obviously safe retreat. It\u2019s not the question of whether a reasonable person looking back with hind sight would have retreated, but whether the defendant in the circumstances of the moment had an obviously safe retreat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u201cSecondly, Your Honor, we request that page ten of the defendant\u2019s instructions be given regarding if they find that the defendant is the original aggressor, and we request the jury be told the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">\u2018You are instructed that where one attacks another in a manner not contemplated to kill or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>to do serious bodily harm, and the other counter-attacks using excessive and unreasonable force in a manner reasonably contemplated to cause death or great bodily harm, then the original attacker becomes the defender. If there is no obviously safe place of safety available, the defendant may then use whatever force necessary to repeal the counter-attack of the original defender.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Appellant\u2019s right to the proposed instructions is premised on the theory that even if she were the initial aggressor using non-deadly force she became the defender when the victim counter-attacked with deadly force, <em>i.e., </em>a knife. As support for this theory she relies on <em>Tipton v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 556 (1967). In that case the father of an armless boy, who was the apparent aggressor in an affray, shot and killed the assailant who was about to strike his son on the head with a rock. In reversing the conviction this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">\u201cWe think reason and logic would support the proposition that where one attacks another in a manner not calculated to kill or to do serious bodily harm, and the defender counterattacks, using excessive and unreasonable force in a manner reasonably calculated to cause death or great bodily harm, then the original attacker becomes the defender. If the original assailant is unable to retreat to a place of safety or there is no place of safety available, then he may use whatever force necessary to repel the counterattack of the original defender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The law regarding the duty of an aggressor to retreat is explicitly set forth in R. M. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 4.1, 1005-06 (2 ed. 1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u201cOne suggestion has been that liberty itself is threatened if a law-abiding citizen can be forced from a place where he has a right to be.t[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>extreme privilege is not granted to an \u2018aggressor\u2019. One who started the encounter with an unlawful attack, or who culpably engaged in an unlawful exchange of blows, enjoys no such position. He is in no sense blameless. But if he started, or joined in, his fault in doing so is entirely overshadowed if the other wilfully changes it to a deadly encounter. Hence he has not entirely forfeited his privilege of self-defense. <em>If he kills without availing himself of an obviously safe retreat he is guilty of manslaughter. </em>If he retreats as far as he can in reasonable safety, he may use deadly force if this reasonably seems necessary to save himself from death or great bodily harm. And if by reason of the suddenness and fierceness of the change in the nature of the contest there is no reasonable opportunity to retreat, he may resort to deadly force where he is. Where both parties are in the wrong, neither is privileged to use deadly force without retreating.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Although the undisputed evidence shows that appellant was the initial aggressor, there is nothing in the record to indicate that she attempted or even contemplated retreating before firing the fatal shot, even though there was obviously a plain avenue of escape. Accordingly, in the absence of some evidence showing an inability to retreat, or that there was no safe place to retreat, the requested instructions were more than appellant was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\"><em>Cf. Street v. State, </em>26 Md. App. 336, 339 (1975) where in a felony murder case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">\u201cThe only evidence of self-defense in the instant case is the appellant\u2019s self-serving declaration to Roberts, that he shot the man \u2018because the man had pulled out some scissors on him.\u2019 Surely, this meager shred of evidence was too slight and doubtful in this factual situation to raise the issue of self-defense for jury consideration. * * * If the appellant had requested an instruction on self-defense, which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>did not, it would have been properly refused because it was not \u2018supported by the evidence.\u2019 If the instruction were granted, it would have been more than the appellant was entitled to.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In summary, we conclude that the instructions, as given, more than fairly and adequately covered the essential points of law supported by the evidence in the case, and that the trial judge did not err in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s proposed instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">THE SEARCH</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">In the present case Officer Graham received a call over his police radio that there was a shooting in an apartment complex known as Summit Hills. The testimony of the officer on direct examination regarding his encounter with appellant and the search of her pocketbook is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">\u201cQ. After your initial observation then what did you do next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">\u201cA. I observed that they were in a struggle; it appeared that the white male was trying to get the pocketbook away from the white female.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-12\">\u201cI didn\u2019t know if this was related to the shooting or not, but I figured it might be, and since the first call for the shooting was a family fight, secondly it came up as a shooting, so I stopped the two individuals as they crossed the parking lot, and had them sort of backed up against a car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-13\">\u201cAt that time I said: \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 The white female indicated to me that she was the one that did it, she is the one that did it, it\u2019s in the purse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-14\">\u201cQ. Did you have any further inquiries at that point, or what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-15\">\u201cA. I said: \u2018What happened?\u2019 and he said: \u2018She shot a girl.\u2019 At that time, the white female said: T didn\u2019t hurt anybody.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>\u201cQ. The defendant you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">\u201cAt that time the white male again: \u2018It\u2019s in the purse.\u2019 I said to the white female: \u2018Give me your purse,\u2019 and at the same time I took the purse from her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">\u201cAt that time she said to me: \u2018Yes, I shot her and the gun is in the purse.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">\u201cQ. After you took the purse, what did you do with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">\u201cA. I opened it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-10\">\u201cQ. And what did you observe within that purse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-11\">\u201cA. I observed laying in the middle of the purse a handgun, a small caliber handgun.\u201d (T. 254-255).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">In her motion to suppress, appellant relied on the case of <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U. S. 1 (1977), as the basis for excluding the gun. The State, on the other hand, relied on the theory of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d as justification for admitting the gun. In denying the motion the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, during the course of proceedings yesterday the defendant presented to the Court evidence to support a motion to suppress a confession which was allegedly given to the Montgomery County Police on the night of this homicide, and also to suppress seizure of certain evidence, to wit: a handgun which was found in the defendant\u2019s purse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-14\">\u201cThe defendant relies upon <em>Chadwick v. The United States </em>[sic] urging the privacy concept, as held there applying to a foot locker, should apply to the defendant\u2019s purse. It is a close question, and it is a novel question, and one which undoubtedly would be the subject of a very interesting appeal, but I will rely upon <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>and <em>Adams v. Williams </em>and conclude that the officer, given the totality of the circumstances, acted properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\u201cThis crime occurred on the second of June, and the opinion of Justice Burger was not issued until the 21st of June, so probably the officer hadn\u2019t had a chance to read Law Week and find that he was not acting properly, if, in fact, he was not acting properly.\u201d [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Under the facts of this case we think the officer\u2019s search of appellant\u2019s pocketbook was constitutionally permissible whether done pursuant to a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d as urged by the State, or as an incident to a lawful arrest as urged by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In <em>Chadwick </em>federal narcotics agents received reliable information that the defendants were transporting marihuana by train in a footlocker from San Diego to Boston. When the train arrived in Boston, Federal agents were on hand, accompanied by a police dog trained to detect marihuana. As the defendants claimed their luggage, including a 200 pound footlocker, the dog signaled the presence of a controlled dangerous substance inside the footlocker. After the defendants placed the footlocker in the trunk of their car, they were arrested and taken, to the Federal Building. One and a half hours after the arrests the agents, without a warrant or consent of the defendants, opened the footlocker and found a large quantity of marihuana. The Court held that the search was illegal and excluded the admissibility of the marihuana into evidence. In reaching its decision the Court, in clarifying when a warrant is required to search property seized at the time of an arrest, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">\u201cWhen a custodial arrest is made, there is always some danger that the person arrested may seek to use a weapon, or that evidence may be concealed or destroyed. To safeguard himself and others, and to prevent the loss of evidence, it has been held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>reasonable for the arresting officer to conduct a prompt, warrantless \u2018search of the arrestee\u2019s person and the area \u201cwithin his immediate control\u201d \u2014 construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u2019 <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U. S., at 763. <em>See also Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1 (1968).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">\u201cHowever, warrantless searches of luggage or other property seized at the time of an arrest cannot be justified as incident to that arrest either if the \u2018search is remote in time or place from the arrest,\u2019 <em>Preston v. United States, </em>376 U. S. at 367, or no exigency exists. Once law enforcement officers have reduced luggage or other personal property not immediately associated with the person of the arrestee to their exclusive control, and there is no longer any danger that the arrestee might gain access to the property to seize a weapon or destroy evidence, a search of that property is no longer an incident of the arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U. S. at 14-15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Appellant argues, in essence, that the search of her pocketbook, after it was seized and in control of Officer Graham, went beyond the limits now permissible under <em>Chadwick </em>as a search incident to a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Prior to <em>Chadwick </em>we would have had no difficulty in holding that the police could conduct a warrantless search of an arrestee\u2019s pocketbook as an incident to a lawful arrest under the principle enunciated in <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U. S. 752 (1969). In that case the Court held that as an incident to a lawful arrest officers may search both the arrestee and the area within the arrestee\u2019s control for weapons or destructible evidence. Numerous <em>pre-Chadwick </em>cases in federal and state jurisdictions have upheld searches of pocketbooks taken from arrestees or areas within their immediate control.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The following cases have upheld searches of pocketbooks: <em>United States v. Jeffers, </em>520 F. 2d 1256 (7th Cir., 1975); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>495 F. 2d 378 (4th Cir., 1974); <em>United States v. Berryhill, </em>445 F. 2d 1189 (9th Cir., 1971); <em>Godwin v. State, </em>133 Ga. App. 397, 211 S.E.2d 7 (1974); <em>State v. Williams, 522 </em>P. 2d 1213 (Or. Ct. App. 1974); <em>State v. Perry, </em>499 S.W.2d 473 (Mo. Sup. Ct. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The continued precedential value of these cases, however, must be re-examined in light of <em>Chadwick. </em>In <em>Shingleton v. State, </em>39 Md. App. 527 (1978) the state police stopped a van in which they had probable cause to believe the occupants were in possession of narcotics. After the occupants were removed from the van and arrested, the police conducted a warrantless search of a briefcase found in the van. This court in holding that the search was illegal under <em>Chadwick </em>said: \u201cThe law is now clear that the police, having gained 'exclusive control\u2019 of the briefcase and eliminated by space and time any possibility of the arrestee\u2019s \u2018gaining] access to the property to seize a weapon or destroy evidence,\u2019 may not then conduct a warrantless search of that property under a guise of a search incident to the arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543. In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>560 F. 2d 861 (7th Cir., 1977) federal agents took an attache case from a suspected bank robber at the time of his arrest. Approximately 8 minutes after the suspect was arrested, searched and handcuffed, the agent in charge searched the attache case. The Court, in an instructive and persuasive analysis of <em>Chadwick </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">\u201cThe Court appears to be distinguishing \u2014 for purposes of whether a warrant is required to search property in police custody that was seized from a suspect at the time of the arrest \u2014 between searches of an arrestee\u2019s clothing, as in <em>Edwards, </em>or items that were in his pockets, as in <em>Robinson, </em>from searches of other possessions, such as luggage, that were within his immediate control. Warrantless searches of the former items after they come in police custody can be characterized as searches of the arrestee\u2019s person because they do not involve any greater reduction in the arrestee\u2019s expectations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>of privacy than that caused by the arrest itself. Warrantless searches of the latter items, however, affect privacy interests other than those reduced by the arrest itself and thus can be conducted only so long as the danger exists that the arrestee might gain access to the property to seize a weapon or destroy evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">\u201c[W]e believe that the search of the attache case is better characterized as a search of possessions within the arrestee\u2019s immediate control than as a search of his person. First, as a matter of common usage, a briefcase is not an item carried on an individual\u2019s person in the sense that his clothing or items found in his pocket are. Second, as was true of the footlocker in <em>Chadwick, </em>the privacy interest in the attache case here centered on its contents rather than on the container itself. A search of the interior constituted \u2018a far greater intrusion into Fourth Amendment values\u2019 than either Wilson\u2019s arrest or the impoundment of the case. Finally, <em>unlike a purse that might be characterized as immediately associated with the person of the arrestee </em>because it is carried with the person at all times, the attache case here was more like luggage in that Wilson was not carrying it when he left the building, but rather removed it from an auto trunk immediately before his arrest. The warrantless search of the attache case in police custody thus cannot be justified as a search of Wilson\u2019s person.\u201d (emphasis supplied). 560 F. 2d at 864.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Of like import <em>see United States v. Ester, </em>442 F. Supp. 736 (S.D. N.Y. 1977); and <em>State v. Dudley, </em>561 S.W.2d 403 (1978), where searches of suitcases were held invalid. <em>See also State v. Dean, </em>574 P. 2d 572 (1978) where a search of an overnight case was held invalid. <em>Cf. United States v. Moreno, </em>569 F. 2d 1044, (9th Cir., 1978) where the Court, without mentioning <em>Chadwick, </em>but in reliance on Chimelheld: \u201cThe search of Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Moreno\u2019s purse was a valid search incident to her arrest, and a warrant was, therefore, unnecessary.\u201d 569 F. 2d at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Returning to the instant case, we think appellant\u2019s pocketbook, unlike the footlocker in Chadwick, the suitcases in <em>Ester </em>and <em>Dudley, </em>the overnight case in <em>Dean </em>and the briefcase in <em>Shingleton, </em>was \u201cimmediately associated with the person of the arrestee.\u201d Therefore, under the rationale of <em>Berry </em>which we adopt, the search was permissible under <em>Chadwick </em>as a search of appellant\u2019s person. Such a search, we believe, is analytically akin to a search of items found in an arrestee\u2019s clothing or pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Even if we were to construe appellant\u2019s purse as property not \u201cimmediately associated with the person,\u201d but property \u201cwithin appellant\u2019s immediate control,\u201d the search of the purse would still be permissible under <em>Chadwick </em>because of exigent circumstances. Here, the officer, in responding to a report of a shooting, observed a man and a woman apparently struggling over a pocketbook. Upon being informed that appellant had done the shooting and had a gun in her purse, the officer grabbed the purse from under appellant\u2019s arm. Although at this point the officer may have had custody of the purse, he was only one or two feet from appellant and still involved in an uncontrolled and potentially life endangering situation. Appellant was neither handcuffed nor under any physical restraints. She was within the <em>Chimel </em>perimeter of reachability, lungeability or graspability, <em>i.e., </em>the area from within which she could gain access to the pocketbook and the gun; thus, the search was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The appellant further argues that the search of her pocketbook was not, as held by the trial court and urged by the State, a justifiable \u201cstop and frisk\u201d within the ambit of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1 (1968). In <em>Terry </em>the Supreme Court recognized the concept of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d and squarely held that a police officer could, under appropriate circumstances, \u201cstop and frisk\u201d persons thought to be carrying concealed weapons even though there is less than probable cause for an arrest. Assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that Officer Graham lacked probable cause to arrest the appellant at the time he seized and searched her pocketbook for a weapon, the record clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>shows that he had specific and articulable facts upon which to reasonably believe appellant was armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Appellant next contends that the search exceeded the scope of a justifiable frisk. She argues, \u201cthat at no time did Officer Graham perform a pat down or frisk of defendant\u2019s person or attempt to squeeze the outside of the pocketbook to see if it contained a hard object such as a gun____\u201d We do not think <em>Terry </em>is so restrictive in its application that it would preclude the officer in this case from searching appellant\u2019s pocketbook for a gun. In <em>Terry, </em>the Supreme Court did not attempt to place such a limit on the scope of this type of protective search for weapons. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\u201cWe need not develop at length in this case, however, the limitations which the Fourth Amendment places upon a protective seizure and search for weapons. These limitations will have to be developed in the concrete factual circumstances of individual cases. * * * The sole justification of the search in the present situation is the protection of the police officer and others nearby, and it must therefore be confined in. scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.\u201d 392 U. S. at 29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">In <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U. S. 143 (1972) an informant told a police officer that an individual seated in a nearby vehicle was carrying a gun in his waistband. Acting on this information, the officer approached the car and asked the occupant to open the door. When the occupant rolled down the window instead, the officer reached into the car and removed a fully loaded revolver from the individual\u2019s waistband. The gun there, as in this case, was not visible to the officer, but it was in precisely the place indicated by the informant. A divided Court upheld this search on the basis of <em>Terry. </em>See <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>567 F. 2d 314 (7th Cir. 1977) where the Court, in reliance on <em>Terry, </em>upheld the search of a purse for a gun that was within the immediate control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of the arrestee\u2019s female companion, who was not placed under arrest. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201cWhere, however, an arresting officer by his own calculation which must survive objective review, determines that a dangerous situation may exist under the circumstances due to the presence of a third party, we do not propose, out of regard for the safety of the officers, to limit the search to a \u2018pat down\u2019 when the actual danger is seen reasonably to exist in easy access to items within the companion\u2019s immediate control.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 319.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>See also United States v. Poms, </em>484 F. 2d 919 (4th Cir. 1973) where the Court upheld the search of a shoulder bag under the guidelines established by <em>Terry </em>for protective searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">For the reasons herein stated, we conclude that the search of appellant\u2019s pocketbook by Officer Graham was permissible under <em>Chadwick </em>as a search incident to a lawful arrest or, as a valid \u201cstop and frisk\u201d under <em>Terry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Finally, appellant argues that a series of statements she made to the police before being advised of her rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966), were improperly admitted into evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">As previously indicated, when Officer Graham initially encountered appellant and Mr. Papadopoulas, he inquired, \u201cwhat happened? and Mr. Papadopoulas replied, \u201cshe shot a girl,\u201d ... \u201cit\u2019s in the purse.\u201d After this remark appellant said, \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt anybody.\u201d But upon the seizure of her purse by Officer Graham she remarked, \u201cyes, I shot her and the gun is in the purse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">The record further indicates that while being transported to the police station appellant admitted shooting the victim, although repeatedly told by Officer Graham not to say anything about the crime. Upon arrival at the police station, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>appellant was informed that a nitric acid test was going to be administered to her hands to determine if she had recently fired a gun. Appellant told the officer he \u201cdidn\u2019t need to do the test because she did shoot a gun and she was an honest person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Appellant contends these statements were inadmissible because they were the product of custodial interrogations before she had been advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Even if we assume appellant was in police custody when she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt anybody\u201d and, \u201cyes, I shot her and the gun is in my purse,\u201d these statements were not made in response to police interrogation. They were volunteered statements or blurts which are outside the protective orbit of <em>Miranda. </em>See <em>Cummings v. State, </em>27 Md. App. 361, 381-385 (1975) and the cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In <em>Tisdale v. State, </em>30 Md. App. 334 (1976), a police officer observed a taxidriver holding the defendant at bay. The officer inquired, \u201cwhat was going on\u201d to which the taxidriver replied, \u201cthis guy just robbed me.\u201d The defendant then said, \u201cYes, I robbed him, but you all don\u2019t understand.\u201d This Court held: \u201c... there was no custodial interrogation here, and appellant\u2019s statement, if made and however made, was clearly a spontaneous utterance, admissible as such. <em>Miranda </em>would not have been applicable even if appellant had been in custody.\u201d Regarding the inculpatory statements made by appellant enroute to the police station and prior to the administration of the nitric acid test, we think they were also volunteered statements or blurts, and not, as urged by appellant, statements extracted by subtle questioning intended to elicit incriminating responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">After the nitric acid test had been completed, appellant was advised for the first time of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. She then gave an inculpatory statement which was reduced to writing and signed. The detective who gave appellant her <em>Miranda </em>rights read them from a standard form used by the Montgomery County Police Department. He described the procedure in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">Q. Starting at the top and working your way to the bottom, would you indicate what the written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>notations are and what they signify and why you placed them on there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">A. Yes, sir. The first four are check marks indicating that I read a statement to Mrs. Dawson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">Q. For the record, what were the statements that you read that you have checked off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">A. 1. You have a right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">2. Any statement you make may be used as evidence agains you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">3. You have a right to the presence of a lawyer prior to and during any questioning and if you cannot afford a lawyer one will be appointed for you if you desire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-11\">4. Anytime during any questioning you may remain silent or ask for a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-12\">A. At Number 5 is where she started responses to my questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-13\">Q. What are the questions and what are the answers that come after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-14\">5. Do you understand what I have said? and she answered, \u201cI sure do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-15\">6. Do you have any questions about what I have said?\u201d and she responded, \u201cNo, sir. I don\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-16\">7. Do you want to answer my questions? and she responded \u201cI will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-17\">8. Do you want a lawyer here and now? and she responded \u201cI\u2019ll take one later\u201d ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">Appellant contends that her answer \u201cI\u2019ll take one later\u201d to Question 8 <em>supra </em>was not a full waiver of her right to counsel. As we view it, appellant\u2019s response, in the context of her answers to the other <em>Miranda </em>questions, was a knowing and intelligent waiver of her right to counsel. Her answer clearly demonstrated a willingness to talk to the police at that particular time. There was no equivocation on her part.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-19\">Based upon our independent, reflective, constitutional judgment, we conclude that all of appellant\u2019s statements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>voluntarily given and properly admitted into evidence against her. See <em>Walker v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 684 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-10\">. Because we are not concerned here with the duty of a non-aggressor to retreat, we need not determine whether the court\u2019s instructions on this issue were a correct statement of the Maryland law. See the following cases which discuss the retreat rule: <em>Bruce v. State, </em>218 Md. 87 (1958); <em>Bennett v. State, </em>230 Md. 562 (1962); <em>Crawford v.
