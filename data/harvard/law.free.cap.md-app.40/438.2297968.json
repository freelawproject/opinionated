Appellants used $53,000 of their own money, and desired to borrow $14,000 from appellee, Key Federal. Pursuant to a previous commitment letter, Key Federal agreed to make the loan, settlement of which occurred on January 29, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">At that time, and in accordance with the terms of the commitment letter, Key Federal delivered to the Hoffmans its check for $14,000, the full proceeds of the loan. The Hoffmans immediately endorsed that check (and delivered as well one of their own for $53,000) to Robert L. Kolscher and George G. Wachter, trustees. The delivery of these funds was accompanied by the execution of a trust agreement governing, among other things, the future disbursement of the funds. The $14,000 loan was evidenced by a promissory note, secured by a deed of trust upon the Hoffmans\u2019 lot and improvements. The note required repayment in equal monthly installments of $105.75, principal and interest, commencing May 1,1976, and continuing for the ensuing 25 years. Interest commenced running on the $14,000 from the date of closing, and, apparently, was separately billed for. the period from January 29, 1976, through April 30, 1976 \u2014 -the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>period. An annual interest rate \u201con the unpaid balance\u201d was stated in the note to be 7%%.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The critical agreement, in terms of the legal issue presented, is the trust agreement between the Hoffmans and the two trustees, both of whom are alleged to be \u201cofficers, agents and employees of Key Federal and were acting on behalf and under the control and direction of Key Federal.\u201d The agreement recited the loan from Key Federal, and stated that a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to the loan was that the Hoffmans erect and complete certain improvements within nine months from that date. It stated further that \u201cfor the purpose of guaranteeing the completion of said improvements\u201d, the Hoffmans had turned over to the trustees the proceeds of the mortgage loan, and that such proceeds were \u201cto be deposited by said Co-Trustees, in their own names, with Key Federal Savings and Loan Association as a pending fund to secure the erection of the aforesaid improvements\u201d. These funds were to be advanced to the Hoffmans in six installments as certain specified levels of completion were achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The agreement prohibited the commencement of any work until written authorization was received from Key Federal. However, once such authorization was received, work must commence within 30 days; otherwise, the agreement \u201cmay be . voided by the Co-Trustees and all monies paid to Key Federal ,.. on account of their mortgage loan____\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that event the Hoffmans released the trustees from \u201cany suits, legal actions, etc.\u201d, and \u201cby the signing of this agreement ... hereby expressly give their permission to the said Co-Trustees to follow the above stated course of action.\u201d In similar vein, the agreement provided that, if work on the improvements stopped for a period of 20 consecutive days, or was not completed within nine months, the trustees, \u201cin their discretion, have the authority to use the balance of the aforesaid loan then in their hands towards the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>completing said improvements or to pay [Key Federal] on account of its aforesaid mortgage loan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">Finally, the agreement provided that \u201cby the acceptance of this trust by the [trustees] and the agreement by them to perform the duties imposed upon them... they do not assume any personal responsibility, and [the Hoffmans] do ... not hold them responsible and do... expressly release them from such responsibility and no claim shall be made upon them for or on account of any matter or thing in excess of the sum of money paid into their hands or such balance thereof as may be remaining and undisposed of in accordance with the terms and agreements as hereinbefore set forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Pursuant to this agreement, the trustees deposited the entire sum (presumably the $67,000) in a noninterest bearing account at Key Federal, withdrawing and disbursing the same as construction proceeded. Although the Amended Declaration did not specifically allege this, the court, in lieu of granting leave to amend, considered the pleading as implicitly alleging that, whil\u00e9 on deposit with Key Federal, these funds were not segregated in any way, but were instead intermingled with Key Federal\u2019s general funds, and were thus usable and used for the general purposes of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The basis of the Hoffmans\u2019 complaint is that, between January 29, 1976 (the date of closing) and the time the last advancement was made pursuant to the trust agreement, the Hoffmans paid $800 in interest to Key Federal, this being interest on the <em>full amount </em>of the $14,000 loan for that period, notwithstanding that the loan proceeds were advanced in installments. Their claim is that they were required to pay interest on amounts that had not been advanced to them, and that did not, therefore, constitute an \u201cunpaid balance\u201d upon which interest could properly be charged. This $800, they assert, amounted to usury in that it constituted interest on amounts not actually lent to and within the exclusive control of the Hoffmans; and they sought, as damages $2,400.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>addition, as representatives of a class, on behalf of each other person in the class who obtained a residential construction loan from Key Federal under similar arrangements, they claimed the greater of $500 or treble the amount of \u201cusurious\u201d interest charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Appellants\u2019 theory of recovery emanates primarily from the principles announced by the Court of Appeals in <em>Tri-County Fed. S. &amp; L. v. Lyle, </em>280 Md. 69 (1977); and, in large part, the initial question is whether the transaction alleged here is but a variation upon a theme or something substantially different from that considered by the Court in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><em>Lyle </em>also involved a residential construction loan, obtained in order to finance both the purchase of a lot and construction of a house on it. At closing, a check for $60,000 was issued to the Lyles, which they immediately endorsed back to the savings and loan association. The association then paid out $15,000 to the seller of the lot, that being the purchase price of the property, but retained the balance of $45,000, which became part of its general funds. No separate escrow account was maintained. The $45,000 was to be paid out by the association in nine installments as work progressed. Evidencing the transaction was a note for $60,000, bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, secured by a deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Five months later, before any part of the $45,000 had been disbursed, the Lyles abandoned their plans and repaid the association $15,000 plus $573.29 accrued interest on the $60,000. During the interim, an additional $1,600 in interest had been paid. Thereafter, Mr. and Mrs. Lyle sued to recover three times the amount of interest paid on the $45,000. With respect to this undisbursed sum, the Court stated, at page 73:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cAt no time was this under the Lyles\u2019 control, or under their partial control, as it might have been had it been held in escrow by others for their account, even though subject to restrictions. It was deposited in Tri-County\u2019s general account, and remained there from the day the Lyles signed the note until repayment was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>For that reason, said the Court, that sum was not part of any \u201cunpaid balance\u201d owed by the Lyles, and any interest charged on it was usurious. At page 76:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">\u201cHere the \u2018unpaid balance\u2019 referred to by Art. 49, \u00a7 3 [the predecessor statute to Commercial Law article, \u00a7 12-103] was the $15,000.00 owed by the Lyles to Tri-County; the $45,000.00 was a balance beyond their control, to which they had no access until they commenced the construction of their house. So long as it remained in the sole control of Tri-County, and was not utilized by the Lyles, the imposition of the interest charged was usurious, because the $45,000.00 was not and could not be a part of the unpaid balance of the loan to the Lyles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Seizing upon the Court\u2019s comment about the absence of an escrow account in <em>Lyle, </em>Key Federal attempts to distinguish that case, and thereby escape from the meaning the Hoffmans ascribe to it, by pointing to the trust agreement existing here. It relies on <em>Toney Schloss v. Union Federal, </em>233 Md. 224 (1964), and the cases cited in it for the proposition that the full $14,000 became \u201cpresently loaned\u201d to the Hoffmans, and therefore constituted the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d, at time of settlement, when the proceeds of the loan were actually, though only momentarily, disbursed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\"><em>Toney Schloss </em>involved a construction loan arrangement very similar to that used here. The mortgage loan proceeds were disbursed to the borrower at settlement, and, as part of the overall agreement with the lender, these proceeds were immediately deposited with trustees selected by the lender, to be further disbursed in stages as construction progressed. The ease did not involve the question of usury, or whether interest could properly be charged prior to disbursement by the trustees. Bather, the sole question was whether such an arrangement constituted a mortgage to secure \u201cfuture advances\u201d, and, as to any disbursement made by the trustees that they were not required to make under the loan agreement, whether the construction mortgage became subordinate to another mortgage given to a third party of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>which the construction lender had actual notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was in this context that the Court concluded (233 Md. at 233) that \u201cthe money loaned by the [construction mortgagee] to the mortgagor was money presently loaned and it did not constitute future advances\u201d. Consequently, said the Court, the construction mortgage \u201cwas a lien for the full amount of the consideration named therein from the time of its recordation____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The argument of Key Federal has a certain facial appeal: if, under <em>Toney Schloss </em>(and a number of cases that preceded it), the full amount of the loan proceeds are considered to be \u201cpresently loaned\u201d when disbursed at time , of settlement, notwithstanding their immediate deposit under a trust agreement, surely they must also constitute the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d owed as of then. This argument overlooks, however, the very different considerations involved in the two types of situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The device of disbursing the entire loan proceeds at tim\u00e9-' of settlement, and then requiring the borrower to deposit them in trust pending further disbursement based upon the progress of construction, was developed and used primarily to avoid the effect of an 1872 statute making the priority of future advances date from the time of the advancement, rather than from the date of the mortgage, as against the rights of intervening creditors. <em>See </em>Comment to Former Article 21 (noted in footnote 4). The obvious policy embodied, in that statute was to protect subsequent creditors by assuring that thos\u00e9 claiming prior liens had, in fact, given value for those liens. Thus, a lien could not be claimed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>respect to money that had not been advanced. As against this policy, however, a construction lender had to be assured that the funds lent, or obligated to be lent, would, in fact, be used for the intended purpose, and that the security of his lien would not be jeopardized by collateral transactions occurring after he committed himself and during the progress of construction. To conclude, in that context, that the entire sum was \u201cpresently loaned\u201d at time of settlement, when the lender actually committed the funds, to the borrower under an arrangement that assured their ultimate actual disbursement to the project, was a reasonable and pragmatic resolution to what otherwise would have been a serious statutory impediment to efficient construction financing. As between the construction mortgagee, the mortgagor, and intervening creditors, no one was injured by such a result, and the statutory goals could be achieved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Constructive notice of the full amount of the lien was given to the world when the mortgage was recorded; thus, prospective intervening creditors would know what lien was ahead of them, and the construction lender was assured of his first lien on the entire amount of his construction loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The considerations at issue with respect to the usury laws are quite different. These laws deal not with the co-relative rights of creditors, but with the relationship between lender and borrower. They deal with <em>interest, </em>which the law defines as compensation imposed by a lender \u201cfor the extension of credit for the <em>use or forbearance </em>of money____\u201d (emphasis supplied), Commercial Law article, \u00a7 12-101 (e); and their purpose is to limit the amount of such compensation that may lawfully be exacted by lenders. The point addressed by <em>Lyle </em>is that, in order to charge interest in the first place, there must exist the \u201cuse or forbearance\u201d of money. Thus, interest may not be charged for the \u201cuse\u201d of money of which the borrower has had no use, or for the \u201cforbearance\u201d of money which the lender has not forbore. Because, in this context, we are dealing with a charge imposed by a lender solely by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>reason of his ceding control over money to the borrower, the question of whether such a cession has in fact occurred becomes paramount. It is not, therefore, the obligation or agreement to relinquish the funds that is relevant, but the actual relinquishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">This does not, of course, require an unconditional relinquishment; <em>Lyle </em>makes clear that some restrictions as to use or possession may be imposed. But when the totality of the restrictions, or the totality of the circumstances under which they are imposed, is so pervasive as to negate the reality of an actual relinquishment of use and control, so long as that condition pertains, there has not been the forbearance or transferrence of use required in order to assess interest. Thus, whereas for purposes of determining the priority of \u201cfuture advances\u201d the commitment of funds may have sufficed to make the amount committed \u201cpresently loaned\u201d, in dealing with the usury laws, it is the relinquishment, not the commitment, that governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">It is in this light that we must test the circumstances of this case against the principles stated in <em>Lyle. </em>Given the overall nature of the transaction at issue here, and, in particular, the character of the trust agreement itself, we believe that the principles announced in <em>Lyle </em>are equally applicable to the situation here. Quoting from earlier cases, the Court made clear in <em>Lyle </em>that \u201cthe laws against usury ought to be strictly enforced\u201d, that \u201ccourts have not hesitated, in every case, to tear off, with unsparing hands, the mask under which it has been attempted to conceal the usury, and to declare the true nature of the transaction\u201d, that \u201cno device or subterfuge of the lender will be permitted to shield him in taking more than the legal interest on a loan\u201d, and finally that \u201c[i]n whatever part of the transaction usury may lurk, or in whatever form it may take, or under whatever guise the lender may attempt to evade the law, the court will seek to ascertain what the contract actually was between the parties and give the debtor relief.\u201d <em>See </em>280 Md. at 74, 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Based upon the allegations in the Amended Declaration, the Hoffmans had no more control over or use of the $14,000 here, <em>prior to disbursement </em>by the trustees, than the Lyles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>had over the $45,000 while it remained in the hands of Tri-County. Conversely, Key Federal gave up no significantly greater measure of control over or forbearance of the $14,000 prior to such disbursement, than did Tri-County. The Court's mention of an escrow account in <em>Lyle </em>was in the context of whether the funds were \"under the Lyles\u2019 control, or under their partial control.\u201d That was the critical element. The use of a trust arrangement that contains the form but not the substance of the requisite control will not suffice; and here there was only the appearance \u2014 the form \u2014 of control in the Hoffmans. Coupling the facts (alleged in the Amended Declaration) that (1) the trustees were officers of Key Federal, not selected by the Hoffmans, (2) they had no discretion in terms of investing the corpus of the trust, but were required to maintain it in a noninterest bearing account at Key Federal, (8) once so deposited, the funds were not segregated, but were intermingled with the other general funds of the association, and remained available for general use by the Association, including re-lending or re-investing, and (4) the immunity of the trustees from any liability to the Hoffmans except to the extent of any balance remaining in their hands, it is clear that, prior to disbursement by the trustees, the Hoffmans had no real control whatever over the $14,000. That fact is not erased by using a document entitled a trust agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">This does not mean, however, that all or perhaps any of the interest charged on the $14,000 for the \u201cpre-disbursement\u201d construction period is usurious. <em>Lyle </em>does not require, or authorize, that conclusion. In <em>Lyle, </em>the amount retained by the association, and thus excluded by the Court from consideration as part of the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d, was 75% of the total principal amount upon which interest was paid. This had the effect of making the interest paid on the whole amount far in excess of that lawfully allowed to be collected on the true \"unpaid balance\u201d of $15,000. This is evident from footnotes 2 and 3, appearing on pages 71 and 72 of the Opinion. At the time, the maximum interest rate allowed was 8%. The court computed the allowable interest, at that rate, on $45,000 as $1,637, thus making the allowable interest on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the actual unpaid balance of $15,000 one-third of that amount or $545. Yet, the Lyles had paid a total of $2,173 \u2014 far more than that permitted by law on the $15,000 unpaid balance. That was the extent of the usury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">It is apparent here (unlike the situation in <em>Lyle) </em>that the entire $14,000 was actually disbursed by Key Federal and the trustees at various times during the construction period. Although Key Federal is not entitled to collect interest on the $14,000 by virtue of its \u201cdisbursement\u201d on January 29,1976, it <em>is </em>entitled to begin collecting interest from the time the proceeds of the loan were disbursed by the trustees, and thus truly relinquished by the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Where the full proceeds of the loan have, in fact, been disbursed to the borrower, and have thus become the unpaid balance of the loan (even though they become such in stages), we have a somewhat different situation than pertained in <em>Lyle, </em>and we must look more specifically to the various statutes comprising the State usury law to determine whether the loan is usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Commercial Law article, \u00a7 12-103 (b), as it was in effect at the time this mortgage was made, provided, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cA lender may charge interest at <em>an effective rate of simple interest </em>not in excess of 10 percent per annum on the unpaid principal balance of the loan if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">(i) There is a written agreement signed by the borrower which sets forth the stated rate of interest charged by the lender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">(ii) The loan is secured by a first mortgage or first deed of trust on any interest in residential real property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">(iii) There is no prepayment penalty in connection with the loan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>(iv) The loan is made and the mortgage or deed of trust is executed after May 31,1974, and before June 2, 1976;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">(v) The loan is not a renewal of a loan which was made by the lender to the borrower before June 1, 1974 and which was secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the same property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">(vi) The lender did not issue before June 1, 1974, a written commitment agreeing to make the loan at a rate of interest of 8 percent or less.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">From the Amended Declaration and the exhibits to it, it would appear that the six conditions enumerated in \u00a7 12-103 (b) were satisfied; and thus, Key Federal was entitled under that section to charge interest <em>at an effective rate of simple interest </em>not in excess of 10% per annum. The term \u201ceffective rate of simple interest\u201d is defined in \u00a7 12-101 (d) as \u201cthe yield to maturity rate of interest received or to be received by a lender on the face amount of a loan, computed in accordance with \u00a7 12-107 of this subtitle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Section 12-107 addresses the situation in which a \u201ccharge or fee considered inter\u00e9st under this subtitle is charged at or before the inception of a loan contract.\u201d Derived from former art. 49, \u00a7 2 (b), which itself was basically a codification of a procedure set forth by the Court of Appeals in <em>B. F. Saul Co. v. West End Park, </em>250 Md. 707 (1968), this section provides that, where such advance fees are involved, the effective rate of interest is to be determined by deducting the amount of those fees from the principal balance of the loan and applying the interest, excluding such fees, to the net balance of the loan. Section 12-107 does not, however, apply to the situation here, for the interest improperly charged during the time the funds remained in the trustees\u2019 account was not a charge or fee imposed \u201cat or before the inception of [the] loan contract.\u201d It was not in the nature of \u201cpoints\u201d, or loan origination fees, or similar one-time charges with which both <em>B. F. Saul Co. </em>and \u00a7 12-107 were directly concerned. What was collected here was not a \u201ccharge or fee considered interest\u201d but interest itself, imposed <em>after </em>the inception of the loan contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>In light of this difference, it would seem that the appropriate way of determining whether this loan is usurious is to consider the combined effect of \u00a7\u00a7 12-103 (b) and 12-101 (d), and to determine whether the total amount of interest charged during the true life of the loan, including the interest charged for the period prior to disbursement by the trustees, produces a yield to maturity in excess of 10% per annum. The note in question, attached as Exhibit 2 to the Declaration, calls for monthly payments to commence on May 1, 1976, which is the beginning of the 25-year repayment period. Reference to the published principal and interest repayment tables reveals that, even if no part of the construction period prior to May 1, 1976, were considered as part of the life of the loan <em>(i.e., </em>it is assumed that none of the $14,000 was disbursed until May 1,1976), the addition of the $800 paid for the money during the construction period to the total interest payable over the 25-year remaining life of the loan would not produce an effective rate of interest in excess of 10% per annum,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Bettum v. Mont. Fed. S &amp; L Ass\u2019n, </em>262 Md. 360 (1971); <em>Montgomery Federal Savings and Loan Association v. Baer, </em>308 A. 2d 768 (D.C. C.A., 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Accordingly, the pleading, when coupled with the exhibits to it, shows on its face that the loan was not, and could not have been, usurious. For that reason, the court was correct in sustaining Key Federal\u2019s demurrer, to Count I of the Amended Declaration without leave to amend.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Given this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider the question of whether the action should proceed as a class action under Maryland Rule 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellants to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\">.

At the time <em>Toney Schloss </em>was decided, by virtue of then art. 66, \u00a7 3, in Baltimore County, \u201cif the future advance under a mortgage were voluntary, it would not have priority over an intervening purchaser, mortgage or lien creditor if the mortgagee received actual notice of the rights of such third party prior to such advance; but if the advance were obligatory under the mortgage, the advance would have priority over the rights of such intervening third parties notwithstanding such actual notice.\u201d <em>See </em>\u201cComment to Former Article 21, \u00a7 7-102\u201d appearing in Real Property article, following \u00a7 7-102. This distinction has now been repealed by Real Property article, \u00a7 7-102 (b); but, at the time, it was important to determine (1) whether the payments in question were \u201cfuture advances\u201d, and (2) if so, wheth\u00e9r they were voluntary or obligatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">. It is also to be noted that the 1872 statute did not apply to deeds of trust \u2014 only to mortgages. The device in question therefore did little more than to apply, in a practical way, the benefits available to a deed of trust to a mortgage as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b470-11\">. Of additional significance is the fact that the rate charged on the loan was the maximum then allowed by law \u2014 8%. This meant that <em>any </em>interest charged in excess of that properly applicable to the $15,000 was necessarily in excess of the maximum permitted by law for the loan, and therefore usurious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b472-5\">. Repayment of the loan over a 25-year period in equal monthly installments of $105.75 would result in a total interest payment of $17,725 ($105.75 x 300 less $14,000 principal repayment). If the $800 were added to that, the total interest payment would be $18,525, which, based on the amortization schedule published in Monthly Mortgage Payments Handbook (2nd Ed.), p. 150, would produce an effective annual interest rate of less than 8.1% \u2014 well below the maximum permitted 10%&gt;. Moreover, if the calculation is made strictly in accordance with \u00a7 12-107, based upon the appropriate schedule published in Prepayment Mortgage Yield Table for Monthly Payment Mortgages (5th Ed!), p. 375, the effective annual interest rate would be only 8.48%&gt;.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\">. We express no opinion as to whether the increase in the effective rate of simple interest occasioned by the collection of interest prior to disbursement by the trustees would result in any violation of the truth-in-lending requirements of State or Federal law as that issue was not raised by the Hoffmans in this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
