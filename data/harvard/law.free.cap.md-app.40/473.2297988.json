J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACA\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We herein hold that the State of Maryland Commission on Human Relations (Commission) does not possess the authority to subpoena certain records pertaining to arrests made by the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department (Department). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County,</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Before we explain why we have concluded that the Commission lacks the power to subpoena records of the Department relative to charges of \u201cpolice brutality,\u201d we shall briefly recount the factual situation from which this matter arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Following receipt of citizens\u2019 complaints of acts of brutality supposedly committed by personnel of the Department, the Commission undertook to survey the situation. In order to ascertain the facts surrounding the incidents that led to complaints having been filed with the Commission against the Department, an Intergroup Relations Representative ,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> visited the Department on July 8,1976. A verbal request was made by the Commission\u2019s investigator for data pertinent to the survey. The Department offered to supply only the names of the officers allegedly involved and to afford the Commission investigator an opportunity to interview those officers. The Department declined to furnish any information over and above the names and opportunity for an interview. Subsequent written requests made by the Commission to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Department were rejected. The Commission refused to be blocked by what it apparently believed to be the Department\u2019s wall of non cooperation, and it served upon the Chief of the Police Department a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>signed by the Commission\u2019s then Chairman.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The subpoena \u201cdirected\u201d the Chief to deliver to the Commission thirteen (13) specifically enumerated items.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Delivery was to be made at the Commission\u2019s Mondawmin Mall office in Baltimore City before noon, September 3,1976. That deadline passed without the Department\u2019s having complied. For almost a year the matter seemingly lay dormant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, on August 26, 1977, the Commission filed a petition in the circuit court for an order directing the Department and the Chief to provide the \u201cdocuments referred to in the <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>issued August 25, 1976----\u201d The Department and the Chief demurred to the petition, and before the demurrer was heard, the Commission moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The demurrer and motion were heard before the circuit court which, in a written \u201cOpinion and Order of Court,\u201d overruled the demurrer of the Department and the Chief. Thirteen (13) days later, the court granted the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment, entered judgment against the Department and the Chief, and ordered the Chief to deliver the subpoenaed material to the Commission. The Department and the Chief appealed. Because the case would have been mooted by compliance with the circuit court\u2019s order, we granted a stay of that order pending disposition on the merits by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">By Laws 1951, ch. 548, codified as Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>titled \u201cInterracial Commission\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was amended. Section 3 of ch. 548 provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">\u201cThe ... Commission shall have authority and power to make such surveys and studies concerning interracial relations, conditions and problems as it may determine [<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] to promote in every way possible the welfare of the colored race and [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] the betterment of interracial relations____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cIt shall be the duty of said Commission to submit an anhual report to the Governor and General Assembly bn or before January 1st each year, setting forth the results of its studies and recommendations, if any, for any additional legislation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In 1968, Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 and 12 were repealed and reenacted with amendments. The Commission name was changed to \u201cHuman Relations Commission.\u201d Section 3 wsis changed by striking wherever it appeared the word \u201cinterracial\u201d and substituting in lieu thereof the word \u201chuman.\u201d Laws 1968, ch. 83. Notwithstanding chapter 83, the same session of the Legislature enacted chapter 464, approved by the then Governor, a month after chapter 83 had been signed into law. Chapter 464 amended section 3, The amendment made no reference to \u201cHuman\u201d but referred to the \u201cInterracial Commission\u201d and \u201cinterracial relations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAx\">The 1969 General Assembly attempted to clear up the legislative haze. The \u201cHuman Relations Commission\u201d was established, and its powers and duties were enumerated. Oddly, however, Laws 1969, ch. 153, \u00a7 3 (A) continued to refer to \u201cinterracial relations,\u201d while Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(a) used the terminology \u201chuman relations.\u201d Since it is the Session Laws that govern, the discrepancy continued until the 1977 revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The 1977 legislative session amended section 3 of Md. Ann. Code art. 49B. That section, at the time the matter was heard in the circuit court, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201c(a) The Commission may make such surveys and studies concerning human relations, conditions and problems as it may determine, <em>and to promote in every way possible the betterment of human relations. </em>In making studies and surveys, it may expend any funds provided for in the budget or otherwise made available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">On the basis of studies or surveys, the Commission may recommend to the Governor [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] additional legislation or changes in existing legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">(c) Whenever any problem of racial discrimination arises, the Commission immediately may hold an investigatory hearing. The place of any hearing shall be in the area where the problem exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">The purpose of the hearing shall be to resolve the problem promptly by the gathering of all the facts from all the interested parties and making such recommendations as may be necessary.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">That statute goes on to prohibit discrimination in public accommodations, section 11; declaring it to be unlawful to receive renumeration for participating in racial demonstrations, section 11A; mandating that agencies, offices, and employees of the State may not engage in discriminatory practices, section 11B; proscribing discrimination by any person, firm, or corporation licensed or regulated by the Department of Licensing and Regulation, section 11C; specifying the enforcement powers of the Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>including investigations, hearings, and enforcement, sections 12-15; establishing the confidential nature of the investigation, section 16; prohibiting discrimination in employment, section 17; defining the terms as used in the subtitle, section 18; enumerating unlawful employment practices, section 19; mandating that pregnancies or child birth are to be treated as temporary disabilities, section 19A; exempting from the employment provisions certain religious corporations and associations, educational institutions, and others, section 20; banning discrimination in housing, section 21; setting out those practices it deems unlawfully discriminatory in housing, section 22; prohibiting \u201cblock busting,\u201d section 22A; precluding discrimination on the basis of race, creed, marital status, sex, national origin, incapacity, or the like by banks, savings and lo\u00e1n institutions, credit unions, insurance companies, and others engaging in making mortgages or loans for the purchase or improvement of dwellings, section 23.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The authority conferred on the Commission by the phrase \u201cand to promote in every way possible the betterment of human relations,\u201d as italicized in the quotation, from section 3 above, appears to be all encompassing so long as the Commission determines that its study or survey concerns human relations. Nevertheless, the phrase may not be lifted out of the statute so as to confer upon the Commission powers never granted to it by the Legislature. The statute must be read as a whole. <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A. 2d 275, 278 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U. S. 942 (1976); <em>accord, Comptroller of Treasury v. Mandel, Lee, Goldstein, Burch Re-election Comm., </em>280 Md. 575, 578-80, 374 A. 2d 1130, 1132 (1977). When so read, we think it apparent that the Commission\u2019s authority is not boundless, and that its thrust is directed toward three principal areas: public accommodations, housing, and employment. If the quoted phrase means what it facially seems to say, then Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a711 through 23, are surplusage. Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>more, if the phrase is taken literally, the Commission would be empowered to investigate just about every aspect of human behavior, official, non-official, public, or private. It would be, in essence, a \u201csuper agency\u201d with awesome powers. We think it clear that the Legislature never intended to confer such limitless authority upon any agency of the State. Indeed, we believe the Legislature, in delegating to the Commission the task of \u201cpromoting in every possible way the betterment of human relations,\u201d meant that the Commission was to study ways and means of promoting goodwill and harmonious relations between persons of different races, creeds, colors, religions, sexes, ages, and national origins, and to recommend to the Governor proposed legislation designed to further that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Notwithstanding the limitations on the Commission\u2019s power, it has been held that the Commission may issue subpoenas when it is investigating complaints of discrimination. <em>Soley v. State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 356 A. 2d 254 (1976); <em>Banach v. State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 502, 356 A. 2d 242 (1976); <em>Augusta Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>39 Md. App. 466, 387 A. 2d 618 (1978); <em>Vermont Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">A question immediately surfaces, <em>i.e., </em>does \u201cstudy and survey\u201d mean to investigate? If so, then the Commission, pursuant to sections 3 and 14 (d), would be authorized to issue the subpoena and in the event of non-compliance by the recipient thereof, to seek the aid of the courts in compelling production of the subpoenaed material. Md. Ann. Code art. 49B. \u00a7 14 (d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The word \u201cstudy\u201d has among its myriad of meanings, \u201cto inquire into; investigate: <em>study the mood of the country. \u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>(1970 ed.). <em>See also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged </em>(1976 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u201cSurvey\u201d is defined <em>inter alia </em>as \u201c[a] detailed inspection or investigation.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1970 ed.). <em>See also generally Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged </em>(1976 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u201cWords express whatever meaning convention has attached to them,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and convention has attached to \u201cstudy and survey\u201d the plain meaning of \u201cto investigate.\u201d As Mr. Justice Holmes said in <em>United States v. Brown, </em>206 U. S. 240, 244, 27 S. Ct. 620, 51 L. Ed. 1046 (1907), \u201c[Whatever the consequences, we must accept the plain meaning of plain words.\u201d The consequences of the meaning of \u201cstudy and survey\u201d are that, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 14 (d), the Commission may issue a subpoena for relevant documents, papers, records, and witnesses whenever the Commission determines it necessary to so do in order to carry out the responsibilities placed upon it by the Legislature. Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Contrary to the view of the Department-appellant, the Commission is empowered to issue a subpoena whenever that course of action is dictated in furtherance of a study or survey that has been undertaken by the Commission in pursuit of its assigned task to resolve racial problems promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">We are supported in our conclusion that the Commission may subpoena relevant materials to aid it in carrying out its function by <em>Banach v. State of Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, supra. </em>Judge Levine, for the majority,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> said in <em>Banach:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201c[I]t is argued that the only \u2018proceedings\u2019 for which subsection (d) authorizes subpoenas are the investigation prescribed by \u00a7 13 and the \u00a7 14 hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ing. This contention that the subpoena power is limited to the post-complaint investigation and hearing stages finds no support in the language of \u00a7 14 (d) itself. First, the opening sentence, \u2018In the administration and enforcement of the provisions of these several subtitles,\u2019 suggests a distinction between the \u2018administrative\u2019 and \u2018enforcement\u2019 functions of the commission. Siftce only \u00a7\u00a7 12-16 of Art. 49B are grouped under the \u2018enforcement\u2019 subtitle, the General Assembly apparently intended to extend the use of subpoenas even to areas beyond enforcement investigations and hearings. One such area is suggested by \u00a7 3 which empowers the commission, \u2018[w]henever any problem of racial discrimination arises, [to] hold an investigatory hearing\u2019 for the purpose of promptly resolving the problem \u2018by the gathering of all the facts from all the interested parties and making such recommendations as may be necessary.\u2019 The \u2018enforcement\u2019 subtitle, in any event, is merely one of five subtitles contained in Art. 49B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">Even more significant, in terms of the statutory language, is the use of the word \u2018proceedings\u2019 in \u00a7 14(d) rather than \u2018hearings.\u2019 In our view, this further reflects an intent on the part of the Legislature to authorize subpoenas beyond the narrow limits urged by appellants. Administrative investigations, a vital part of the administrative function, are commonly referred to as \u2018proceedings.\u2019 <em>See </em>1 K. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 3.01 (1958). The word \u2018proceedings\u2019 is a term of broad scope, encompassing both the investigative and adjudicative. functions of an administrative agency. <em>United States v. Fruchtman, </em>421 F. 2d 1019, 1021 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U. S. 849 (1970); <em>Rice v. United States, </em>356 F. 2d 709, 715 (8th Cir. 1966). Our conclusion that the word \u2018proceedings\u2019 was used in its broad sense here is reinforced by the provision in the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>(1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7 244 (c), which, in defining the term \u2018contested case,\u2019 clearly ascribes a somewhat broader meaning to the term \u2018proceedings\u2019 than to \u2018an agency hearing,\u2019 \u201d 277 Md. 509-10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">This case does not end, however, with a determination that the Commission may issue subpoenas in order to conduct studies and surveys. The next question is obvious, may it subpoena police records in furtherance of its \u201cstudy and survey\u201d function?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Equating, as we must, \u201cstudy and survey\u201d with \u201cinvestigate\u201d we now turn our attention to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727-734D, known as the \u201cLaw-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The Law-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights, enacted as Laws 1974, ch. 722, was codified, as we have observed, in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727-734. Section 728 (b) (4) provides that \u201c[a] complaint against a law-enforcement officer, alleging brutality in the execution of his duties, may not be investigated unless the complaint be duly sworn to ... before an official authorized to administer oaths.\u201d We note that the \u201cPetition for Order Directing Production of Documents,\u201d as filed by the Commission in the circuit court, averred that it had made \u201c[o]n or about July 8,1976, a <em>verbal, </em>on-site request for documents considered relevant and necessary. ... The questions [sic] related to numerous complaints received by the Commission alleging police brutality and harassment against Blacks in Prince George\u2019s County.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) While the petition, as filed by the Commission, asseverates \u201cnumerous complaints,\u201d it does not contain a statement that the complaints have been \u201cduly sworn to before an official authorized to administer oaths.\u201d Hence, it is defective in that degree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Furthermore, section 728 (b) mandates that \u201c[w]henever a law-enforcement officer is under investigation or subject to interrogation by a law-enforcement agency, for any reason which could lead to disciplinary action, demotion or dismissal, the investigation or interrogation shall be conducted\u201d in accordance with the Law-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Even though the Commission performs functions which enforce the laws against discrimination, it is not a \u201claw-enforcement agency\u201d as that term is generally defined,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> nor is it such an agency with respect to the \u201cLaw-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights.\u201d As used in section 728 (b) of Article 27, \u201claw-enforcement agency\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201c(1) The Maryland State Police; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">(2) The Baltimore City police department; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">(3) The police department, bureau or force of any county; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">(4) The police department, bureau or force of any incorporated city or town; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">(5) The office of the sheriff of any county; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">(6) The police department, bureau or force of any bicounty agency or the University of Maryland; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">(7) The State Aviation Administration police force of the Department of Transportation, the Mass Transit Administration police force of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Department of Transportation, the Maryland toll facilities police force of the Maryland Transportation Authority, and the Maryland Port Administration police force of the Department of Transportation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">(8) The police officers of the Department of Natural Resources; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">(9) The Maryland Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Enforcement Unit.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 727 (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">We do not believe that the legislature ever intended to erect a protective shield around a police officer when the officer is confronted by an investigation conducted by a law-enforcement agency and at the same time deny that protection to the officer if the investigation is made by another type of Commission or agency. Such a result would cause the \u201cLaw-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights\u201d to be little more than a verbalizing of \u201crights\u201d which are devoid of substance. While it may be argued that the \u201cstudy and survey\u201d was directed at the Department rather than a particular police officer or officers, it seems to us that of necessity inquiry into the conduct of the officers involved in the April 1976 incident would have to be made.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The provisions of the Law-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights may not be avoided by addressing a Department instead of the individual police officer. If, as here, an end run around the Law-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights may be made by directing inquiry to the Department from which font floweth the information necessary to complete an investigation of alleged brutality against individual officers, \u201crights\u201d conferred by Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727-734D are relegated to myth.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Moreover, the information sought by the Commission is further barred under Md. Ann. Code art. 76A (Public Information) in that section 3 (a) (i) thereof excludes inspection if the same \u201cwould be contrary to any State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>statute.\u201d In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the inspection is contrary to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 734B. Section 3 (b) (i) of Article 76A exempts from public inspection \u201c[rjecords of investigations conducted by, or of intelligence information or security procedures of, any sheriff, county attorney, city attorney, the Attorney General, police department or any investigatory files compiled for any other law-enforcement or prosecution purposes----\u201d The Court of Appeals, in <em>Superintendent, Maryland State Police v. Henschen, </em>279 Md, 468, 475, 369 A. 2d 558, 562 (1977), said that \u201cwhen the documents in question constitute records of an investigation by a police department (or sheriff\u2019s office or any of the other law enforcement agencies specifically listed in \u00a7 3 (b) (i)), there need not be an actual showing that the records were compiled for law enforcement or prosecution purposes for the exception to be applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The release of the information to the Commission for \u201cstudy and survey\u201d would create an additional problem. Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 16 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\u201c(a) During the investigation of any complaint alleging a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 11, 11B, 17, 18, 19, or 23 of this article, and until said matters reach the stage of public hearings, the activities of all members of the Commission and employees thereof in connection with said investigation shall be conducted in confidence and without publicity, and the Commission shall hold confidential any information in relation thereto, including the identity of the complainant and the respondent, except that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">(i) Any information may be released at any time if the release has been agreed to in writing by both complainant and respondent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">(ii) The identity of the complainant may be disclosed to the respondent at any time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">(b) Any member of the Commission or employee thereof, who violates the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>$1,000.00 or imprisoned not more than one year or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">It is to be noted that section 3 (a) of Article 49B is conspicuously absent from those enumerated sections of the statute shielded by a cloak of confidentiality during the investigatory stages of the Commission\u2019s inquiry. Hence, if the Commission were successful in obtaining the sought documents in the instant case, the strictures of section 16 would not apply, and in theory, at least, the content thereof could be disclosed publicly without fear of the sanctions prescribed by section 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The Legislature, however, was not unaware of its own acts, and to be certain that all conflicts among prior statutes and the Law-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights could be readily resolved, the Legislature established the superiority of the Law-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights by providing in section 734B thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201cThe provisions of this subtitle [Law-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights] shall supercede any State, county or municipal law, ordinance, or regulation that conflicts with the provisions of this subtitle, and any local legislation shall be preempted by the subject and material of this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">While the Commission was given authority, by the General Assembly, in the spheres of public accommodations,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> housing, and employment, nothing in Md. Ann. Code art. 49B confers upon the Commission the right or duty to investigate police matters unrelated to those specified areas. If the Legislature intended the Commission to exercise authority over allegations of police brutality, it could have enacted such a provision. In the absence of such express legislative intent, it is not the role of the judiciary to extend by fiat the powers of any administrative body. <em>Scoville Serv., Inc. v.

In <em>Demory </em>we observed that \u201c[i]t has been held that a legislative body\u2019s rejection of a statutory amendment is significant because it throws light upon the legislative intent. <em>See Madden v.

Although the Court of Appeals has \u201cnever held that the amendment-rejection theory is a completely determinative method of ascertaining legislative intent, [they] have indicated that such action strengthens the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to achieve the results the amendment would have achieved, if adopted.\u201d <em>Demory Brothers v.

That the 1978 session of the Legislature refused to enlarge its grant of power to the Commission at the expense of law-enforcement officers is a conclusion that may be drawn from rejection of the proposed amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>We think the circuit court should have refused to issue the order compelling compliance with the subpoena, and, accordingly, we reverse that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\n<em>Order reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\">.
