Langston, her son, Lawrence Langston, the appellants, and their insurer, Allstate Insurance Company, the appellee, is being fought on two fronts, <em>i.e., </em>Maryland and Florida. At this point in time, the Langstons have seen their victory, gained in an arbitration proceeding and confirmed in the Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial Circuit in and for Dade County, Florida, in the form of a summary judgment \u201cagainst Allstate Insurance Company in the amount of $40,000.00,\u201d qualified but not totally nullified by the District Court of Appeal of Florida, Third District, in <em>Allstate v. Langston, </em>Fla. App., 358 So. 2d 1387 (1978). In the meantime, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, patently declining to follow the Florida arbitration proceeding or the Dade County circuit court, entered a judgment in favor of the Langstons against Allstate for $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">The battle between the litigants is being waged over whether claimants, under a motor vehicle policy insuring two vehicles on separate premiums, may \u201cstack\u201d or pyramid coverage so as to obtain the maximum amount payable on each vehicle. Phrased in more explicit terms, the issue is, when two premiums are paid in one policy for two vehicles, may the claimant add or \u201cstack\u201d the maximum amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>payable to any one person under the policies so that the $20,000 maximum amounts on each policy become a total of $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The arbitrators expressed no opinion on the question, nor should they have done so under Florida law, because that State has held in <em>Government Employees Insurance Co. v. Mirth, </em>333 So. 2d 545, 547 (Fla. 3d. DCA 1976) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201cUnder a liability indemnity insurance policy providing uninsured motorist coverage, issues relating to the merits of the claim against the tort-feasor are triable on the arbitration, <em>but an issue bearing on coverage is not to be so tried, and is triable </em>by the court. <em>Cruger v. Allstate Insurance Company, </em>Fla. App. 1962, 162 So. 2d 690; <em>Zeagler v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>Fla. App. 1964, 166 So. 2d 616.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\n<em>See also Allstate v. Langston, supra.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">The Circuit Court for Montgomery County implicitly held that the \u201cstacking or pyramiding\u201d of benefits was not allowed in Maryland. Moreover, the court sanctioned a credit to Allstate in the amount that the Langstons recovered from the insurance carrier on the vehicle in which Lawrence Langston was riding when he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">Our task then is to rise above the debate between the parties and to endeavor to secure for each its respective rights, thereby securing those rights for the people of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">\n<em>THE FACTS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">Lawrence S. Langston, a Maryland resident, but a student at the University of Miami, was severely injured on September 23, 1975, as the result of a collision between an uninsured vehicle and a motorcycle on which Langston was a passenger. Langston was paid $15,000, the full amount of the uninsured motorist coverage of the motorcycle owner\u2019s motor vehicle liability. At the time of the accident, Langston was an insured under a motor vehicle liability policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>containing uninsured motorist coverage. That policy had been issued in Maryland by Allstate to Mrs. Jean D. Langston. It insured her against liability and loss occasioned by an uninsured motorist. The policy covered two vehicles, a 1972 Ford and a 1966 Chevrolet. Lawrence Langston was included within the ambit of the policy by his status as son of the insured and resident of the same household as the insured. The policy limit as to an uninsured motorist for each vehicle was $20,000 each person, $40,000 each accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The damages to Lawrence \u201cfar exceeded\u201d the $15,000 that was paid to him by Universal Underwriters Insurance Co., the motorcycle operator\u2019s insurance carrier. Lawrence, therefore, made demand upon Allstate in the amount of $40,000, a figure he arrived at by \u201cstacking\u201d the $20,000 coverage afforded for damages caused by an uninsured motorist<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on each of his mother\u2019s two vehicles. Allstate rejected the \u201cstacking\u201d concept. Instead, it deducted the $15,000 paid to Lawrence by Universal Underwriters from the $20,000 figure to which it contended it had obligated itself through the issuance of the policy to Mrs. Langston and offered the sum of $5,000 to Lawrence in settlement of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The Langstons, in accordance with the terms of their policy,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> demanded that the dispute \u201cbe settled by arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d Seemingly racing to circumvent the arbitration proceeding, Allstate, on March 2, 1977, filed, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, a \u201cBill for Declaratory Relief.\u201d That bill was followed two days later in Florida, by Allstate\u2019s instituting a \u201cComplaint for Injunction\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and then on March 9, 1977, a \u201cMotion for Temporary Stay\u201d of the arbitration pending the determination of the Maryland suit brought in Montgomery County. The motion to stay was denied so that the arbitration hearing was held in Dade County on March 14,1977. The arbitrators made the following award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201cTHE UNDERSIGNED ARBITRATOR(S), designated under the arbitration provision of Policy No. 0-18-550435, having been duly sworn and having heard the proofs and allegations of the parties, AWARDS as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">The Arbitrators [s/e] AWARD to the claimant is FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($40,000.00).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">This AWARD is subject to a judicial determination of the applicable policy limits. Claimant contends stacking applies. Respondent denies this. Respondent contends it is entitled to a $15,000.00 set-off. Claimant denies this. Claimant contends there is $40,000.00 in coverage. Respondent contends the coverage is $5,000.00. The Arbitrators make no decision in this regard. If the coverage is $5,000.00 the AWARD is $5,000.00. If the coverage is $40,000.00 the AWARD is $40,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">This Award is in full settlement of all claims submitted to this arbitration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>On the basis of the arbitration award, the Langstons moved for summary judgment. The Dade County court granted the motion and entered judgment for Lawrence by confirming and adopting \u201cas the judgment of... [the] court\u201d the \u201cAward of Arbitration.\u201d On July 28, 1977, the Dade court \u201centered two additional orders. One was entitled \u2018Order Granting ... [Lawrence\u2019s] Amended Motion for Summary Judgment.\u2019 That order did not contain confirmation of the arbitration award, but recited that the motion for summary judgment was granted, and ordered \u2018that accordingly summary judgment shall be entered against Allstate ... in the amount of $40,000.00.\u2019 The other, entitled \u2018Final Judgment,\u2019 ordered that Lawrence recover from Allstate ... the said amount of $40,000.00, with provision therein for execution to issue.\u201d <em>Allstate v. Langston, supra. </em>Allstate moved for a rehearing which was denied and then, as we have seen, appealed to the District Court of Appeal of Florida, Third District.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">While the matter was pending in the Florida trial court, Allstate moved that summary judgment be granted to it by the Montgomery County trial court on the ground that there was \u201cno genuine dispute between the parties as to any material fact, and that... [it] was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 610. The circuit court denied the Langston motion to stay the Maryland case until after disposition by Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On December 12, 1977, the court heard argument on Allstate\u2019s motion for summary judgment, opposition thereto, the Langstons\u2019 \u201cCounter-Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d and the opposition to that motion. The court denied the counter-motion but granted Allstate\u2019s motion and entered judgment in favor of the Langstons for $5,000, the amount Allstate maintained that it owed under Mrs. Langston\u2019s motor vehicle liability policy after allowing a deduction of a sum equal to the amount recovered from Universal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">This appeal followed, but before the matter was argued in this Court, the Florida intermediate Court of Appeals, as we have previously said, reversed the Dade, County circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The Florida appellate court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201c[t]he action initially filed in Maryland for coverage determination conferred on that court the jurisdiction to litigate and settle the question. <em>Wade v. Clower, </em>94 Fla. 817, 114 So. 548 (1927). For that reason, the question as to the coverage limit could not have been decided in the subsequently filed action in Dade County ... even if the latter action had been brought for that purpose____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">Where the policy was issued in Maryland to a resident of that State, the construction and legal effect of the terms of the policy and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are to be determined by the laws of that State. (Citations omitted).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\n<em>THE LAW.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Before we explore whether the so-called \u201cstacking or pyramiding\u201d is permitted by the Maryland statute, we think it well to discuss the question of the credit allowed Allstate as a result of the payment to the Langstons by Universal Underwriters of $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">If there were any doubt over whether a credit could be taken, it was resolved in a strikingly similar case, by the Court of Appeals in <em>McKoy v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., Inc., </em>281 Md. 26, 374 A. 2d 1170 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">McKoy was struck by a negligent driver while she was operating her vehicle in Washington, D.C. The negligent driver was insured by Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO), but the liability of GEICO, under the policy was limited to $10,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> McKoy alleged her damages to be substantially in excess of $20,000. Inasmuch as the GEICO policy limit was less than $20,000, the tort-feasor was, for Maryland purposes, deemed to be an uninsured driver, as that term was used in the Aetna policy insuring McKoy against injury by uninsured motorists.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>GEICO paid McKoy $10,000 in satisfaction of its obligation under its policy. McKoy then claimed indemnification from Aetna, under the uninsured motorist coverage, in the amount of $20,000. Aetna asserted that it was entitled to a set off of the amount paid by GEICO so that it was liable only to the extent of $10,000. The circuit court agreed with Aetna, but the Court of Appeals did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The Aetna policy provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">\u201c T. UNINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE (Damages for Bodily Injury and Property Damage Caused by Uninsured Highway Vehicles)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u2018The Company will pay all sums which the insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured highway vehicle because of bodily injury or property damage, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such uninsured highway vehicle; provided, for the purposes of this coverage, determination as to whether the insured or such representative is legally entitled to recover such damages, and if so the amount thereof, shall be made by agreement between the insured or such representative and the company or, if they fail to agree, by arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">\u2018HI. LIMITS OF LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">\u2018Regardless of the number of insureds under this insurance, the company\u2019s liability is limited as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">(a) The limit of bodily injury liability stated in the schedule as applicable to \u201ceach person\u201d is the limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages because of bodily injury sustained by one person as the result of any one accident and, subject to the above provision respecting \u201ceach person,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the limit of liability stated in the schedule as applicable to \u201ceach accident\u201d is the total limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages because of bodily injury sustained by two or more persons as the result of any one accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">(d) Any amount payable to an insured under the terms of this <em>insurance </em>shall be reduced by (1) all sums paid to such insured for bodily injury or property damage by or on behalf of the person or organization legally liable therefor and (2) the amount paid and the present value of all amounts payable to such an insured under any workmen\u2019s compensation law, exclusive of non-occupational disability benefits.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The Court held that the words \u201cany amount payable\u201d as employed in Clause III (d) \u201cshould be construed as providing for a setoff against the total damages suffered and not against the face value of the endorsement.\u201d 281 Md. at 30. The Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">\u201cSection I, \u2018Uninsured Motorist Coverage,\u2019 sets out the basic liability of Aetna, to pay all damages which the insured is legally entitled to recover resulting from an accident with an uninsured motorist. Section III, entitled \u2018Limits on Liability,\u2019 begins \u2018the company\u2019s liability is limited as follows.\u2019 This strongly suggests that the limitations which follow are to be understood as limits on the primary liability articulated in Section I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">Section 111(a) then limits liability to $20,000 per person. Sections 111(b) and (c) concern limits on property damage and claims made under other insurance. Finally, Section 111(d) contains the setoff clause. There is no indication that 111(d) is in any way subordinated to 111(a). Both clauses stand on equal footing, and both must therefore be understood as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>independently modifying the primary liability of Section I. That is, amounts paid to an insured on behalf of the tortfeasor shall be deducted from \u2018all sums which the insured ... [is] legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured highway vehicle.\u2019 Under the terms of this contract the setoff clause, 111(d), applies to the total damages incurred and is not a further limitation upon the $20,000 limit set forth in clause 111(a).\u201d 281 Md. at 30-31.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">The Allstate policy which we are called upon to construe provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">\u201cSECTION II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">\u201cPROTECTION AGAINST BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE BY UNINSURED AUTOMOBILES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">COVERAGE SS \u2014 Uninsured Motorists Insurance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\"><em>Allstate will pay all sums which the insured </em>or his legal representative <em>shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner </em>or operator of an uninsured automobile because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom, hereinafter called \u2018bodily injury\u2019, sustained by the insured or property damage, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such uninsured automobile;

It is the <em>coverage </em>that is reduced, not all sums.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">A recent Court of Appeals case, <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Md. Auto. Ins. Fund, </em>277 Md. 602, 856 A. 2d 560 (1976), construed the meaning of \u201ccoverage\u201d as it is used in Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 541 (c). As Chief Judge Murphy noted therein: \u201c \u2018[c]overage\u2019 is a common insurance term; it has been defined as the \u2018aggregate of risks covered by the terms of a contract of insurance.\u2019 Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 525 (1961).\u201d The present edition, <em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged </em>(1976 ed.), carries that same definition of \u201ccoverage.\u201d Among its meanings, \u201ccoverage\u201d is listed as \u201c1. the act or fact of including or treating: a thing that covers: COYER: as a: INSURANCE: protection by insurance policy: inclusion within the scope of a protective or beneficial plan ... c: the aggregate of risks covered by the terms of a contract of insurance.\u201d <em>See also The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1970 ed.) which defines \u201ccoverage\u201d to mean \u201c2. The extent of protection afforded by an insurance policy.\u201d In other words, \u201ccoverage\u201d is insurance. When so read, we fail to see the distinction between <em>McKoy </em>and the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u201cCoverage SS\u201d of the Allstate policy provides that \u201cAllstate will pay all sums which the insured ... shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile....\u201d That language does not limit the payment by Allstate to the difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>between the amount actually obtained from the uninsured driver and the Allstate policy limits. If Allstate had desired to so delimit its liability it should have so provided. As w\u00e9 read \u201cCoverage SS\u201d Allstate is liable, to the extent, of course, of its policy limits, to the insured for all damages <em>he is entitled to recover </em>from the uninsured 'motorist, less the amount actually recovered. Thus, if, in the instant case, the insured were entitled to recover damages of $100,000,? the insured may recover from Allstate that sum reduced by the $15,000 paid by Universal and further reduced to the limit of Allstate\u2019s liability under the Uninsured Motorist Endorsement. <em>Aetna v. McKoy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Even as Judge Eldridge said in <em>McKoy, </em>if \u201cthe interpretation of the policy urged upon us by ... [Allstate] is ... [a] reasonable one, this would, at best, create an ambiguity. In such\" situations, ambiguities are resolved against the author of the Instrument.\u201d 281 Md. at 31. <em>See also Penn., Etc., Ins. Co. v. Shirer, </em>224 Md. 530, 537, 168 A. 2d 525 (1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201cHowever, if the insurance company, in attempting to. limit coverage ..., failed to make its intended meaning clear and drew an ambiguous clause, that ambiguity would be resolved against it as the one who drafted the instrument, as is true in the construction of contracts generally, <em>Ebert v.

Reed\u2019s Refrigeration Service, Inc., </em>222 Md. 49, 54.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">We now turn our attention to the principal question put to us by the parties. Does the Maryland Statute, Article 48A, proscribe \u201cstacking or pyramiding\u201d? We shall not answer that question because as we see it neither \u201cstacking nor pyramiding\u201d is involved.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>In order to avoid confusion in the minds of the reader, we shall define what we mean by \u201cstacking or pyramiding.\u201d Both of those terms, as used in insurance litigation, may be defined to mean the recovering by a claimant \u201cseveral times over for his injuries.\u201d A.J. Widiss, <em>A Guide to Uninsured Motorists Coverage </em>(1969). So that if a person is insured by carrier A, carrier B, carrier C, and carrier D, and he recovers the <em>full amount of his claim </em>from carrier A, subsequent recovery from B, C, and D for the same loss is \u201cstacking\u201d or \u201cpyramiding.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He has, in short, turned his loss into a three hundred percent profit. That type of activity is barred by Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 543 (a), insofar as coverage under an uninsured motorist endorsement is concerned. Section 543 (a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, no person shall recover benefits under the coverages required in \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541 of this article from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u201d [<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Allstate contends that section 543 (a) prohibits Langston\u2019s recovery from Allstate because that section forbids \u201cduplication of benefits\u201d or recovery on \u201ca supplemental basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Allstate fails to note that this section only applies when there is <em>\u201cmore than one </em>motor vehicle liability policy or insurer____\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Since there is only one motor vehicle liability policy covering the Langston vehicles and since Allstate is the only insurer from whom recovery is sought under section 541 of Article 48A, section 543 (a) of that article is not apposite to the present case. An additional flaw in Allstate\u2019s argument is that the Langstons seek to do neither of the two proscribed acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Duplication of benefits is \u201cstacking.\u201d It is payment in full twice or more for the same claim. For example, if, as we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>previously said, claimant <em>recovers the full amount o\u00ed </em>the sum he is \u201clegally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile,\u201d he may not successfully assert a claim against his own insurance carrier inasmuch as that claim would be duplicitous. There is nothing in the case at Bar that suggests an effort to duplicate benefits. The injury and damages to Lawrence Langston far exceed the $15,000 he obtained from Universal, <em>and </em>the $40,000 he maintains Allstate owes him under its policy, even when the two sums are added together. The truth of that statement is not controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The other activity barred by section 543 (a) is that of supplementing benefits recovered under the Uninsured Motorist Endorsement. We interpret \u201csupplemental\u201d to mean securing remuneration over and above the recovery from an uninsured motorist of all that the claimant is legally entitled to recover. The bar on supplemental payment prevents recovery of more than all one is legally entitled to recover. By way of illustration, we point out that if the claimant is legally entitled to recover the sum of $100,000 <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> from the uninsured motorist, and claimant so recovers, he may not successfully prosecute a claim against his own insurance carrier for an additional sum or \u201csupplement.\u201d Such a recovery would amount to \u201cstacking or pyramiding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Section 543 (a) does not, however, proscribe the claim the Langstons are asserting against Allstate. We think it significant to note that the Allstate premium on the Langston vehicles was billed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">\u201cCOVERAGE DESCRIPTION 72-Ford 66-Chev. * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azu\">SS Uninsured Motorists $4.00 $4.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Patently, a separate premium of $4.00 on each of the two vehicles was charged and collected by Allstate. Notwithstanding that it has collected two premiums it seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>to make but one remittance. From the record, we are unable to determine to which of the two vehicles Allstate assigned its loss, or if it differentiated between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The question of whether an insured may recover on an uninsured motorist claim for each of the vehicles on which he has paid a premium may be new in this State, but it most certainly is not a new concept. Similar claims have been made in other jurisdictions with differing results.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The basic premise upon which the purpose of legislation requiring insurers to provide protection to its insured in the form of uninsured motorist coverage is the idea of placing the insured motorist in the same position that he would have been if the operator or owner of the uninsured vehicle had been properly insured.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Some courts have held that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause of motor vehicle liability policies was generally valid and not repugnant to the statute requiring uninsured motorist coverage. They have taken the view that \u201cthe statute was not designed to provide the insured with greater insurance protection than would have been available had the insured been injured by a person having a policy containing the minimum required statutory limits.\u201d 28 A.L.R.3d 558; <em>M.F.A. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wallace </em>(1968 Ark.), 431 S.W.2d 742; <em>Tindall v. Farmers Auto. Management Corp., </em>83 Ill. App. 2d 165, 226 N.E.2d 397 (1967), 28 A.L.R.3d 546. The decisions adopting the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause reasoning are in conflict with <em>McKoy </em>wherein the Court of Appeals implicitly rejected that approach and refused to follow the view that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause limited the insured\u2019s right of recovery to the amount he could obtain from the uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">We think there is much to be said for the point of view expressed in <em>Sturdy v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., </em>203 Kan. 783, 457 P. 2d 34 (1969), a case bearing similarity to that now before us. Sturdy had two automobiles insured on the same policy. He paid a separate premium on each car. While riding on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>motorcycle, he sustained bodily injury as the result of a collision with an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Sturdy and the insurer submitted the issue of damages to arbitration.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The parties agreed that if the arbitrator found in favor of the insured, the insurer would pay any sum up to the minimum coverage of $10,000. If the award exceeded $10,000, it was agreed that the court should determine whether the insurer was liable for that sum. The policy, as does that in the case <em>sub judice, </em>provided that \u201c[w]hen two or more automobiles are insured hereunder, the terms of this policy shall apply separately to each____\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Kansas court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\u201cDefendant here chose to issue coverage on two separate automobiles and to accept a premium for each. Under these facts clauses designed to prevent the payment of a disproportionate amount of a loss which is properly shared with another insurance company should not be distorted to reduce whatever amount is otherwise due the insured under his policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">... [T]he policy provides the named insured with two kinds of coverage: While he is in his insured automobile, and wherever else he may happen to be when he suffers bodily injury due to an uninsured motorist. This latter constitutes [s/c] a broad reservoir of coverage. The only exception in it arises from the specific exclusionary clause which provides the policy does not apply to bodily injury to an insured while occupying an automobile (other than an insured automobile) owned by the named insured (or a relative) or through being struck by such an automobile. Obviously this exclusion is designed to prevent two or more automobiles being covered for the price of one, inasmuch as ownership of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>automobile is the foundation of the entire policy, and to induce persons owning more than one automobile to secure coverage for all. In effect, then, as to the named insured, upon his payment of a single premium for one automobile, the policy provides vast coverage \u2014 with the single important exception. If, in paying one premium for a single automobile, coverage is purchased while occupying the insured automobile along with the coverage not tied to that automobile, the question might well be asked, What coverage is intended by payment of an equal premium for a second automobile? Does it also include the broad reservoir of coverage secured under the first premium for the first automobile, and if not, why?\u201d 203 Kan. at 789-92, 457 P. 2d at 39-41.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The court then answered its own rhetorical question, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">\u201c[7] It must be borne in mind the purpose of uninsured motorist insurance is tQ provide compensation for personal injury to the innocent victim of the uninsured motorist. As to the named insured the coverage is a contract benefit for which he has paid. Here the damage to the insured has been determined and he now seeks indemnity for it. <em>He is not seeking any windfall as a result of his injury but he is seeking full indemnity based on payment of two separate premiums. </em>Applying traditional rules of construction we think he is entitled to that coverage. Of the two constructions which could be placed on the limitation of coverage in this particular policy under these facts, this conclusion effectuates insurance as to each automobile mentioned in the policy and permits recovery rather than forfeiture of a benefit for which the insured has paid. Defendant seeks to avoid fully indemnifying its insured on what we believe to be an overly strict construction of its policy in its favor. If it were intended to restrict the limit of liability to $10,000 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>one policy where more than one automobile is covered, this could have been very easily accomplished in plain, unmistakable language____ We are accustomed to purchasing insurance which follows the person in units or multiples, with the premium fixed by the insurer accordingly (the premium, of course, is subject to state regulation). <em>When we pay a double premium we expect double coverage. This is certainly not unreasonable but, to the contrary, is in accord with general principles of indemnity that amounts of premiums are based on amounts of liability. </em>Defendant argues that what plaintiff is seeking amounts to pyramiding coverage but nothing is said about pyramiding the premiums which effectuate the coverages. We would not be understood as implying that an injured insured can pyramid separate coverages in the same policy so as to recover more than his actual loss (see Rosson v. Allied Mutual Ins. Co., Kan., 457 P.2d 42).\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 203 Kan. at 792-93, 457 P. 2d at 41-42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The Supreme Court of Florida reached the same result in <em>Mullis v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>252 So. 2d 229 (Fla. 1971), holding that \u201cinsurance policies covering two or more automobiles owned by the insured with uninsured motorist coverage included and containing a limitation of liability ... provided coverage to the extent of the bodily injury inflicted upon an insured in the total amount of the per person coverage for each vehicle.\u201d Cited with approval in <em>Tucker v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>288 So. 2d 238, 241 (Fla. 1973). <em>See also Sellers v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>214 So. 2d 879 (1968), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>229 So. 2d 873 (Fla. 1969).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201cIt is an anomaly to contend that if two automobiles are combined in the coverage of one auto liability insurance policy with uninsured motorist protection added that an exclusion of the kind here involved may be validly inserted, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>if a separate policy covered each automobile such exclusion is invalid. The mere form of a policy \u2014 a combination coverage \u2014 should not be the predicate for an exclusion of additional coverage.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Government Employees Ins. Co., supra </em>at 242.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Under the rationale of <em>McKoy, </em>an insured is not restricted to the amount of the uninsured motorist insurance of the vehicle in which he was riding at the time of the accident giving rise to his loss, <em>see also Sellers v. Government Employees Ins. Co., supra, </em>nor may his own company setoff the amount recovered from the insurance carrier of the vehicle in which he was riding. Of course, the insured may only recover for his full loss. He is not entitled to make a profit by collecting more than the total loss. Such being the law, we can perceive of no reason why a different rule should be applied when the insurance coverage afforded on different vehicles is combined into one policy instead of two or more, particularly where, as here, a separate premium is charged for each vehicle covered by the policy. <em>Sellers v. Government Employees Ins. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In <em>Lipscombe v. Security Ins. Co. of Hartford, </em>213 Va. 81, 83, 189 S.E.2d 320, 322 (1972), the court repeated what it had held in <em>Cunningham v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>213 Va. 72, 189 S.E.2d 832 (1972), wherein it has adopted the reasoning of the Kansas court in <em>Sturdy </em>that an \u201cinsured is entitled to double coverage for the double premium paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The Court of Appeals of Louisiana, Third Circuit, in <em>Roberie v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>La. App., 291 So. 2d 923 (1974), considered a case wherein Roberie was insured by State Farm on both of his motor vehicles. A separate policy had been issued on each. Roberie, while driving one of his vehicles, was struck and seriously injured by a \u201chit and run\u201d driver who has never been apprehended. As a result of the impact, Roberie\u2019s damages were \u201cequal to or in excess of $10,000.\u201d Each of the two policies issued to Roberie by State Farm provided \u201cuninsured motorist coverage of $5,000.00 for each person and $10,000.00 for each accident.\u201d Roberie claimed $5,000 under each policy. State Farm offered to pay only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>$5,000. The Court, noting that a premium had been charged and paid for uninsured motorist insurance in each policy, allowed recovery on both policies. Moreover, the Court disallowed a deduction made under the medical payment coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">There are, to be sure, a number of jurisdictions which have taken a contrary view,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are of the belief, however, that the rationale of <em>McKoy, </em>together with what the Florida Supreme Court, in <em>Tucker, </em>termed the \u201cweight of authority\u201d leads to the conclusion that in Maryland the payment of a premium for uninsured motorist insurance on each of two or more separate motor vehicles permits recovery on each, but only to the extent of one full recovery for any loss sustained by the insured. If the Legislature wants to limit recovery to a specified sum or to not more than the amount payable under a policy insuring one motor vehicle, it has but to so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">As we see it, the uninsured motorist insurance mandated by the General Assembly to be included in each automobile insurance policy issued in this State is remedial legislation designed for the protection of the motoring public. Being remedial in nature, the statute must be construed liberally so as to effectuate its benevolent purpose in affording insurance coverage to the injured party.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">We hold that when an insurance carrier issues an automobile liability insurance policy containing, as it must, uninsured motorist coverage on two or more motor vehicles, and it charges and collects a separate premium on each vehicle of that coverage, it is liable to its insured for the total coverage for which he has paid, or the full amount of his damages, whichever is less.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Other issues raised by the Langstons involve <em>res judicata </em>and the refusal of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to stay this proceeding pending disposition by the Florida appellate court. That decision having been handed down before oral argument and holding that Maryland is the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>forum for the interpretation of the policy, the issues are now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\n<em>Case remanded to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with instruction to enter judgment in favor of the appellants against the appellee in such amount as the Circuit Court may determine, consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\">.
