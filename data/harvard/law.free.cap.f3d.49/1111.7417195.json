As we conclude that the bankruptcy court erred in determining that Grosz was - not compensated with funds from Southmark\u2019s estate, we reverse the summary dismissal of Southmark\u2019s preference claim and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-18\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-19\">Southmark, debtor in possession of a real estate and financial services company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has literally hundreds of affiliated .businesses and subsidiaries, one of which is a wholly owned subsidiary named American Realty Advisors (\u201cARA\u201d). In 1984, Grosz entered in an employment agreement with Southmark and Southmark Funding (later renamed ARA), to serve as the president and a director of ARA, and American Realty Trust, another of Southmark\u2019s wholly owned subsidiaries. In consideration of that service, Grosz was entitled to compensation in the form of, inter aha, loan procurement fees, bonuses, and profit sharing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-20\">Sometime during the late 1980s, the relationship between Southmark and Grosz soured, and Southmark refused to pay Grosz portions of the accrued fees and bonuses to which he believed he was entitled. South-mark and Grosz decided to resolve the dispute out of court and entered in a settlement agreement. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-21\">Pursuant to that agreement, Southmark delivered Grosz a check totaling $289,258.96, $214,228 of which was for commissions and other compensation that he had previously earned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Although the check named ARA as the remitter and the W-2 Form reporting Grosz\u2019 income to the IRS identified ARA as the payor, the check was actually drawn or\u00ed .an account owned by Southmark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-22\">The somewhat confused circumstances surrounding the identity of the entity that paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>Grosz were caused by the fact that South-mark uses a cash management system (the \u201cCMS\u201d) to administer more efficiently and effectively its financial operations and assets. The CMS employs several different bank accounts to process all deposits, transfers, and payments of Southmark and of those affiliates and subsidiaries \u2014 such as ARA\u2014 that also use the CMS. Although each company\u2019s receipts and disbursements are commingled in the CMS for cash management purposes, they are segregated for record keeping purposes and can be readily identified. At the time Grosz was paid, ARA had a positive balance in the CMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">Grosz\u2019 check was drawn on a general miscellaneous bank account, referred to as the \u201cPayroll Account.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Like other accounts in the CMS, the Payroll Account is maintained in Southmark\u2019s name and is owned, operated, and controlled by Southmark. Southmark used funds from the account to pay for its own obligations in addition to those incurred by affiliates and subsidiaries participating in the CMS. There is no evidence of any agreement between ARA and Southmark restricting Southmark\u2019s access to or use of the funds in the Payroll Account. In fact, had Southmark desired, it could have totally depleted that account to pay its own creditors \u2014 or those of any affiliate or subsidiary\u2014 without regard to any other subsidiary\u2019s contribution to or balance remaining in the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">In 1989, Southmark filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Almost two years later, Southmark, as a debtor in possession, filed an adversary action in Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of Texas in which it sought to recover, inter alia, the payment to Grosz, arguing that the transfer was a preferential payment and thus avoidable under \u00a7 547(b). Grosz filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing, among other things, that the funds with which he had been paid were not the property of Southmark\u2019s estate, so that the payment was not an avoidable preference. The bankruptcy court agreed and dismissed Southmark\u2019s preference claim (the \u201cFebruary Order\u201d), then tried the remaining issues in the ease, ultimately ruling in favor of Grosz on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-10\">Southmark appealed the February Order to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s summary judgment. In the instant appeal, Southmark urges only that the court erred in dismissing its claim that the $214,228 portion of the disbursement to Grosz was a preferential payment, and is thus avoidable under \u00a7 547(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-13\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-14\">Both the bankruptcy court and the district court granted summary judgment for Grosz. \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate if the moving party establishes that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe courts\u2019 reasoning on issues of law must be appraised <em>de novo.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-15\">B. PROPERTY OF THE DEBTOR\u2019S ESTATE</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-16\">Section 547(b) permits a debtor in possession to avoid transfers of its property if the transfer meets certain conditions estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>lished by statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A preliminary requisite, however, is that the transfer involve property of the debtor\u2019s estate. Even though Grosz was paid by check drawn on a bank account that is owned by Southmark, the bankruptcy court concluded that Grosz was entitled to summary judgment as there were no genuine issues of material fact presented, and that, as a matter of law, the payment was from ARA\u2019s estate, not the estate of Southmark. The district court agreed and affirmed the bankruptcy court, but for a different reason. The district court held that the funds in Southmark\u2019s Payroll Account in the CMS that were used to pay Grosz were held in a \u201cquasi trust\u201d for the benefit of ARA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even, though we agree with both the bankruptcy and the district courts that the record presents no genuine issue of material fact regarding which estate, for the purposes of preference law, owned the funds that were paid to Grosz, we disagree with both courts\u2019 legal conclusions \u2014 drawn .from the undisputed facts \u2014 that the funds were .not part of South-mark\u2019s bankruptcy estate. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-4\">1. <em>ABA as the Remitter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">The bankruptcy court dismissed South-mark\u2019s preference claim against Grosz based primarily on the court\u2019s reasoning in a prior ruling, <em>Southmark Corporation v. Kranz,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which involved Southmark and another of its subsidiaries, Southmark/Envicon. In <em>Kranz, </em>the bankruptcy court held that a payment to Kranz, a former officer of Southmark/Envi-con, was not an avoidable transfer under \u00a7 547(b), even though that payment, like .the one to Grosz here, was made from South-mark\u2019s Payroll Account.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court took judicial notice of- the fact that, in numerous other cases in which claims had been filed against Southmark\u2019s affiliates or subsidiaries, \u201cSouthmark had encouraged this court in thousands of objections to be very' mindful of the separate legal entity [with which] people were dealing.\u201d .The court then concluded that Southmark could not avoid the transfer, because South-mark/Envicon \u2014 not Southmark \u2014 was the corporate entity that actually paid Kranz, therefore the transfer was made with property belonging to Southmark/Envicon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">In -the instant case, the court invoked <em>Kranz </em>and again held that the transfer did not involve property from Southmark\u2019s estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-8\">The court has consistently in the South-mark ease attempted to recognize appropriate boundaries of legal entities not imposing liability on a-parent company if it\u2019s not there, but by the same token not permitting the parent company when it\u2019s appropriate to step.into the shoes of the subsidiary and so forth. The result is there have been lots of claims against Southmark disallowed, but it also cuts in this case in favor of the defendant [Grosz].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">The court continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-10\">The fact that funds are transferred through a cash management system to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>into a Southmark payroll account in San Jacinto does not create a genuine issue of material fact, [that] in this case this is an ARA, Inc. payment. It\u2019s an ARA check. W-2 Reports to the IRS it\u2019s an ARA payment. The ARA accounts are charged and credited. Southmark\u2019s providing a servicing function here only. The property interests are those of ARA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling dismissing Southmark\u2019s preference claim makes .clear that the court was attempting; in an equitable fashion, to disentangle the various assets and liabilities of the Southmark family of companies.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although \u00a7 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (\u201cCode\u201d) authorizes bankruptcy courts to fashion such orders as are necessary to further the substantive provisions of the Code, that provision does not, as we recently observed, empower bankruptcy courts to act as \u201c \u2018roving commission^] to do equity.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cEven the broad powers of the bankruptcy courts to fashion equitable remedies ... must be exercised only within the confines of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cThe \u2018statute does not authorize the bankruptcy courts to create substantive rights that are otherwise unavailable under applicable law....\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">In attempting to do equity here, the bankruptcy court exceeded the limits of its equitable powers under \u00a7' 105(a) by creating substantive rights that otherwise would not have existed. The court ruled that ARA possessed a property interest in funds that, under the law governing avoidable preferences, indisputably belonged to Southmark\u2019s estate: The check paid to Grosz was drawn on Southmark\u2019s Payroll Account, a general bank account containing commingled funds,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to which Southmark held complete legal title, all indicia of ownership, and unfettered discretion to pay creditors of its own choosing,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> including its <em>own </em>creditors.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The last point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>is particularly important, as the primary consideration in determining if funds are property of the debtor\u2019s estate is whether the payment of those funds diminished the resources from which the debtor\u2019s creditors could have sought payment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">Conversely, if funds cannot be used to pay the debtor\u2019s creditors, then they generally are not deemed an asset of the debtor\u2019s estate for preference purposes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A common example is when a debtor holds funds in trust for another<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Here, the district court invoked a trust theory \u2014 albeit constructive, not express \u2014 in affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment. But, as explained immedir ately below, the summary judgment record cannot support that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">2. <em>Constructive Trust</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">The district court found that South-mark could not avoid the payment to Grosz because the funds that were used to pay him were not Southmark\u2019s. Rather, said the court, the funds in question were held.in \u201cquasi\u201d (or constructive) trust by Southmark for ARA. Section \u201c541(d) excludes property subject to a constructive trust from the bankruptcy estate.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aj6O\">The district court relied on <em>Begier v. </em>IRS<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> in concluding that the payment to Grosz was not from Southmark\u2019s estate, because South-mark held only legal title to the money that was paid to Grosz, but not an equitable interest as well. Although the district court properly invoked that aspect of <em>Begier (i. e., </em>that for property to be part of the debtor\u2019s estate the debtor must possess both legal title and equitable interest), the court 'did not first analyze whether ARA possessed an equitable property interest in the funds from South-mark\u2019s account that were used to pay Grosz. And, it is that issue that proves problematic in. this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-14\">At the outset, it is important to distinguish generally between two types of \u201cequitable interests.\u201d In a contractual (or debtor-creditor) relationship, the creditor may possess an \u201cequitable claim\u201d to property actually owned by the debtor, but there is no .division of ownership or title in the property at issue; the debtor is entirely free to dispose of the property as he sees fit. In a trust relationship, by contrast, the law actually divides the bundle of rights in the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>erty; the trustee holds legal title while the beneficiary possesses an equitable title or property interest.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Only in the latter instance \u2014 when legal title to the property is held by the bankrupt in trust for the benefit of another \u2014 is the property properly excluded from the bankrupt\u2019s estate under preference law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">But when property that otherwise would be considered part of a debtor\u2019s estate is alleged to be held in trust for another, \u201c[t]he burden of establishing the existence of the constructive trust rests on the claimant.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cThis burden is based in part upon the statutory intent reflected by the sweeping marshalling and avoidance powers accorded a trustee in order to secure all the debtor\u2019s property for an equal distribution according to the terms of the Code.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We are mindful, therefore, that the imposition of. a constructive trust is a potent remedy, as it gives the successful claimant priority over the debtor\u2019s unsecured creditors; thus such a trust should not be imposed \u201ccavalierly\u201d in a bankruptcy proceeding.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-11\">We look to state law to determine whether a party has adequately demonstrated that property is held in constructive trust for another.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As neither the bankruptcy nor the district court conducted the requisite analysis, neither court decided which state\u2019s laws should be applied in determining ARA\u2019s rights to funds deposited in Southmark\u2019s bank account. Based on the summary judgment record, however, Texas appears to have the \u201cdominant contact\u201d with the funds,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> so we shall apply its laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">\u201cUnder Texas law, a constructive trust is not actually a trust, but rather an equitable remedy imposed by law to prevent unjust enrichment resulting from an unconscionable act.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We have explained that, \u201cto justify imposing a constructive trust on property, fruad \u2014 either actual or constructive \u2014 must be present.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The record before us, however, is devoid of evidence of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-13\">This is no evidence of actual fraud in the record. Moreover, even assuming arguendo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>that Southmark, as ARA\u2019s parent company and the administrator of the CMS, owed a fidueiary-like duty to ARA, the record does not support a finding that Southmark breached that duty. As a parent company, South-mark was responsible for producing the maximum results from its investments in its subsidiaries, including ARA. To help accomplish that goal, Southmark created the CMS, which consisted of, inter alia, the Payroll Account from which Grosz\u2019 cheek was drawn. But there is no evidence \u2014 and Grosz does not claim \u2014 that Southmark violated any duty by establishing the CMS. Neither is there evidence that Southmark misappropriated any of ARA\u2019s deposits, used ARA\u2019s deposits in an unreasonable manner, or abused its position with ARA by filing for bankruptcy. In short, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Southmark violated any duty that it may have owed to ARA.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> And, absent some proof of that type, there is no justification for imposing a constructive trust in this bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\">As we have recently-written,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-5\">[t]he remedy of a constructive trust is ... a potent one in bankruptcy because it gives the successful claimant \u201cpriority over the defendant\u2019s unsecured creditors\u201d to the extent of the property subject to the trust. As a result, creditors of the bankrupt debt- or have every incentive to argue that their unsecured claims are eligible under state law for the remedy of a constructive trust. Because the constructive trust doctrine can wreak such havoc with the priority system ordained by the Bankruptcy Code, bankruptcy courts are generally reluctant to impose constructive trusts without a substantial reason to do so.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">Although the district court likely believed that substantial justification for imposing a constructive trust existed here, the court was still required to apply state law to ascertain whether (1) ARA was entitled to the benefit of that equitable remedy, arid (2) the remedy could be properly fashioned from the facts and within the confines of the Bankruptcy Code. The court failed to. do either. Furthermore, as Grosz has not demonstrated that the money that he received from South-mark\u2019s Payroll Account was held \u2014 or should be deemed to have been held \u2014 in trust for-ARA by Southmark, we conclude, as a matter of law, that based on the undisputed facts, those funds are the property of South-mark\u2019s estate for the purposes of \u00a7 547(b).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\">The bankruptcy court erred in summarily dismissing Southmark\u2019s claim that Grosz received a preferential transfer based on the court\u2019s conclusion that\" funds, paid to Grosz from the Payroll Account were not part of Southmark\u2019s estate. Likewise, the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court on a constructive trust theory. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court\u2019s order dismissing Southmark\u2019s preference claim against Grosz, as affirmed by the district court, is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1157-15\">. As a debtor in possession in a Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding, Southmark has all the rights and powers of a trustee, which includes the right to avoid a payment under \u00a7 547. <em>See Georgia Pac.
