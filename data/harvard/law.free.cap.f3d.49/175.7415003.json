Jackson alleged that Scharf and Palamara violated his constitutional rights when they stopped a car in which he was riding, seized evidence and arrested him without probable cause. Jackson also alleged that his rights were impinged because Vannoy inadequately trained his officers. Jackson argued that the illegal arrest caused the State\u2019s Attorney to seek a revocation of his previous sentence of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">The magistrate judge held a Spears<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing to allow Jackson an opportunity to expound his claims. At the hearing, Jackson explained that he was serving a ten-year sentence for indecency with a child. He initially received a sentence of ten years of probation, but his probation was revoked because of the charges arising out of the arrest that gave rise to this lawsuit. Jackson\u2019s parole on other charges was also revoked as a result of this incident. Jackson complained that he lost his freedom as a result of the illegal arrest, and he noted than an appeal of the revocation of his-probation was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">Jackson filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that he was entitled to a judgment regarding the defendants\u2019 liability for false imprisonment. The magistrate judge addressed the merits of Jackson\u2019s claims, recommended that the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss be granted and recommended that Jackson\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment be denied. The district court adopted the findings of the magistrate judge, granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and denied Jackson\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">The district court dismissed Jackson\u2019s suit pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-18\">The district court erred in determining that Jackson lacked standing to challenge the stop of the vehicle by Palamara. In <em>United States v. Roberson, </em>6 F.3d 1088, 1091 n. 6 (5th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 1383, 128 L.Ed.2d 58 (1994), this Court held that a passenger has standing to challenge the constitutionality of a vehicle stop because a stop results in a seizure of the passenger. Nevertheless, we find the district court\u2019s error is harmless because Jackson\u2019s testimony at the <em>Spears </em>hearing reveals that his claim is not ripe under <em>Heck v. </em>Humphrey.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-21\">A complaint, as amended by a <em>Spears </em>hearing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> may be dismissed pursuant to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion by the defendant or by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) if it lacks an arguable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>basis in law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The dispositive issue is whether Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint is ripe. In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court directed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">[i]n order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has <em>not </em>been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 114 S.Ct. at 2372 (footnote omitted). <em>Heck </em>requires the district court to consider \u201cwhether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate, that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition to convictions and sentences, <em>Heck </em>applies to proceedings which eall into question the fact or duration of parole. <em>See Cotton v. Texas Dep\u2019t Criminal Justice, </em>No. 94-10532, 35 F.3d 560 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 1994) (parole proceeding) (unpublished). <em>Cotton </em>indicates that <em>Heck </em>should also apply to proceedings that call into question the fact or duration of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">A judgment in favor of Jackson on his illegal seizure claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of the revocation of his probation and parole.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It logically follows that <em>Heck </em>applies to Jackson\u2019s probation and parole revocation proceedings. Jackson has not demonstrated that his current sentence has already been invalidated. He does not allege that any revocation proceeding has been reversed, expunged, set aside by a state court, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>Thus, Jackson\u2019s action is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 at this time, and we need not address the arguments Jackson has raised on appeal. The appeal is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUD\u00cdCE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-11\">. <em>Spears v.
