She also appeals the sentence imposed. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">Michael Landry, a coconspirator, testified that he was a houseguest at the Port Arthur, Texas home of Brown and her husband Burton Bailey on July 14, 1993. Bailey invited Landry to join him and Brown for a ride. As the trio drove off in Brown\u2019s white Chrysler Lebaron, Bailey and Brown explained that they had been cheated in a drug deal and wanted to find the dishonest dealer to kill him and to recover their money. They drove to Houston. Unable to find the dealer they discussed alternative means of making money, including robbing a hotel or store or a carjacking. They searched for hotels to rob; at one point, Brown entered a hotel to see if it had surveillance cameras. They ruled it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">The group then drove to a park where they spotted Darrell Arcement, a man they had earlier noticed driving a green Chevrolet Camaro in a K-Mart parking lot. Bailey handed Landry a gun and persuaded him to carjack Arcement. Landry pulled the gun on Arcement and commandeered the vehicle. Brown and Bailey followed. When the Ca-maro stopped for gas the Lebaron waited. When the Camaro pulled off the road so Landry could ask for directions the Lebaron stopped. When the Lebaron passed, Landry and its occupants made hand signals back and forth. Arcement testified that the couple in the Lebaron appeared to be the same people he had earlier noticed sitting with Landry on park bleachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-17\">Upon arrival near Port Arthur, Landry put Arcement out of the auto and then drove to join Brown and Bailey. Bailey got into the Camaro with Landry and told him they should return and kill Arcement. Brown drove off and Landry and Bailey returned and forced Arcement into the back seat. In a skirmish, Arcement seized Bailey\u2019s gun and fired several rounds as the two miscreants raced off in the Camaro. Returning to Brown\u2019s and Bailey\u2019s home they discussed selling the Camaro and Brown made known her expectation of a portion of the proceeds. All three were indicted for conspiracy to take a motor vehicle by force and of the substantive charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Convicted by the jury, Brown was sentenced to concurrent 78-month and 60-month imprisonments on the two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-18\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-19\">Brown first alleges that the district court erred in overruling her <em>Batson v. Kentucky</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>challenge to the government\u2019s peremptory strike of an African-American member of the venire. When a defendant raises this challenge the state must provide a neutral reason for the release related to the particular case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecutor explained that the particular woman was released because she indicated on voir dire her belief that her ex-husband had not received an adequate sentence for an assault charge. The prosecutor anticipated that a conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>between Brown and her husband might become a part of Brown\u2019s defense and he did not want a distracted juror. Reviewing the district court\u2019s determination with the requisite deference, we find no error in the court\u2019s ruling that the state provided non-pretextual, race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strike. Brown\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge fails. We also reject Brown\u2019s contention that the court erred in forcing her to proceed to trial without the remaining African-American juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Brown next alleges several errors in the court\u2019s jury instructions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The standard of review we apply to jury instructions is whether \u201cthe court\u2019s charge, as a whole, is a correct statement of the law and whether it clearly instructs jurors as to the principles of law applicable to the factual issues confronting them.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Brown first asserts that the trial court erred in giving the Pinkerton<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> charge twice, over her objection, while instructing the jury only once that each count should be considered separately. The <em>Pinkerton </em>charge is permitted in this circuit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Concluding that the overall effect of the jury charge did not mislead the jury as to the elements of either offense, or to the fact that each offense was to be considered separately, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">Brown next alleges that the district court omitted a portion of the pattern jury instruction from its charge. Our precedents do not require trial judges to use any particular language in a jury charge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We reject this claim. Nor do we find error in the court\u2019s instructions regarding Brown\u2019s alibi defense<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or her decision not to testify,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as neither charge was misleading nor an inaccurate statement of the law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-20\">Brown challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we hold that a rational jury could have found that Brown voluntarily agreed to pursue the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>lawful objective of carjacking and that Landry and Bailey committed acts in furtherance of that objective.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The verdict reflects that the jury accepted Landry\u2019s version of the events; we will not disturb the jury\u2019s credibility assessments. Moreover, the uncorroborated testimony of an, accomplice is sufficient to support a verdict, as long as the testimony is not incredible or insubstantial on its face.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such was not the case here; Arcement corroborated much of Landry\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Finally, Brown alleges error in the application of the Sentencing Guidelines. We review a district court\u2019s Guideline application <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Brown contends that the court erred by failing to consider her post-offense rehabilitative efforts for a two-level acceptance of responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because Brown denied her guilt and forced the government to go to trial, she was not eligible for a section 3E1.1 reduction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Brown also contends that the court improperly added one criminal history point under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e) for a prior offense of evading detention, because evading detention is similar to resisting arrest. However, the PSI states that Brown\u2019s probation for evading detention was revoked and she was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment, thus vitiating this claim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">The convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-15\">.Bailey and Landry were also indicted for carrying a firearm during a crime of carjacking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) and one count each for carrying a firearm after conviction of a crime punishable by excess of one year imprisonment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-20\">. 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-22\">. <em>Batson; United States v.
