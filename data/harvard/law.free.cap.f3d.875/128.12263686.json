As explained below, we VACATE the judgment of the District Court and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b173-13\" pgmap=\"173\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b173-14\" pgmap=\"173\">As this case involves the alleged garnishment of Social Security retirement income (\u201cSSRI\u201d) in a New York-based bank account, and the interplay between the FDCPA and New York law relating to freezing and garnishing consumer bank ac- . counts, we first provide an overview of the relevant State legal framework.</p> <p id=\"b173-15\" pgmap=\"173\">1. New York Exempt Income Protection Act</p> <p id=\"b173-17\" pgmap=\"173\">Under federal law, SSRI is exempt from garnishment, with certain exceptions not relevant to this appeal. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a). In 2008 New York enacted the Exempt Income Protection Act (\u201cEIPA\u201d) to better protect \u201cexempt funds from forcible . collection\u2014a \u25a0 problem that had reached epidemic proportions in New York State.\u201d Cruz v. TD Bank, N.A., 711 F.3d 261, 270 (2d Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted). The EIPA \u201cremedied an imbalance in the prior law which unfairly placed the burden on debtors to show that their funds were exempt, at a time when they were being deprived access to those funds.\u201d Distressed Holdings, LLC v. Ehrler, 113 A.D.3d 111, 976 N.Y.S.2d 517, 521 (2d Dep\u2019t 2013).</p> <p id=\"b173-18\" pgmap=\"173(13) 174(133)\">To begin the garnishment process, a creditor can serve a restraining notice on the debtor\u2019s bank, along with a copy of the notice to be sent to the debtor, an exemption notice, and two exemption claim forms. N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7\u00a7 5222(a), 5222-a(b)(l). \u201c[T]he restraining notice serves as an injunction prohibiting the transfer of the judgment debtor\u2019s property.\u201d Ehrler, 976 N.Y.S.2d at 521; see also N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5222(b). But the debtor\u2019s bank is required to leave certain funds unrestrained. The bank must leave unrestrained a minimum amount for the debt- or\u2019s basic needs, calculated based on the federal and New York minimum wage laws. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5222\u00ae. And if within the 45 days preceding the restraining notice an account received a direct deposit of funds \u201creasonably identifiable as statutorily exempt,\u201d the bank must leave $2,500 unrestrained. Id. \u00a7 5222(h).</p> <p id=\"b174-4\" pgmap=\"174\">Within two business days of receiving a restraining notice, the bank must serve the debtor with the restraint documents, including the exemption notice. Id. \u00a7 5222-a(b)(3). \u201cThe exemption notice advises the judgment debtor that his or her bank account is being restrained or frozen\u201d and that \u201ccertain funds, which may be on deposit in the restrained bank account, are exempt from restraint and cannot be taken by the judgment creditor to satisfy the judgment.\u201d Ehrler, 976 N.Y.S.2d at 522.</p> <p id=\"b174-5\" pgmap=\"174\">If the debtor believes that any of the restrained funds are exempt from garnishment, he may complete an exemption claim form\u2014signed under penalty of perjury\u2014 and send it to the bank and the creditor\u2019s attorney. N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5222-a(c)(l). The debtor may also send information establishing that the restrained funds are exempt, including, inter alia, \u201coriginals or copies of benefit award letters, checks, check stubs or any other document that discloses the source of the judgment debt- or\u2019s income, and bank records showing the last two months of account activity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 5222-a(c)(4). Upon receiving an exemption claim form, the creditor generally must instruct the bank to release the restrained funds if the exemption claim form \u201cis accompanied by information demonstrating that all funds in the account are exempt.\u201d Id. If the supporting documentation shows that \u201cthe account contains some funds from exempt sources, and other funds from unknown sources, the judgment creditor shall apply the lowest intermediate balance principle of accounting\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and instruct the bank to release the exempt portion of the account. Id.</p> <p id=\"b174-8\" pgmap=\"174(159) 175(32)\">Regardless of the documents accompanying the debtor\u2019s exemption claim form, the bank must release the restrained funds eight days after receiving an exemption claim form, unless the creditor files an objection in court within that time. I\u00ae \u00a7 5222-a(c)(3). The creditor may do so by making a motion under section 5240 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules and serving copies of its moving papers on the bank and the debtor. Id. \u00a7 5222-a(d). The creditor\u2019s motion must be accompanied by an affirmation demonstrating \u201ca reasonable belief that [the] judgment debt- or\u2019s account contains funds that are not exempt from execution.\u201d Id. \u201cThe affirmation ... shall not be conclusory, but is required to show the factual basis upon which the reasonable belief is based.\u201d Id. If the creditor objects to an exemption claim in bad faith, it will be liable for the debtor\u2019s costs, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, actual damages, and an amount not to exceed $1,000. Id. \u00a7 5222-a(g). The court will hold a hearing to determine whether the funds are exempt, and shall issue its decision within five days of the hearing. Id \u00a7 5222-a(d).</p> <p id=\"b175-5\" pgmap=\"175\">2. Factual Background<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b175-6\" pgmap=\"175\">In 2006 Arias rented an apartment in the Bronx owned by 1700 Inc. At some point that year,\u2019 Arias moved out of the apartment and allowed his daughter to move in, expecting that she would pay the rent to 1700 Inc. After his daughter missed two months of rent payments, 1700 Inc. retained GMBS and sued Arias for breach of the lease in Bronx County Civil Court (the \u201cState court\u201d). When Arias failed to file an answer, 1700 Inc. obtained a default judgment.</p> <p id=\"b175-7\" pgmap=\"175\">Around December 2014, 1700 Inc., through GMBS, tried to collect on its default judgment by issuing a restraining notice on Bank of America, where Arias had a checking account. In response to the restraining notice, Bank of America notified Arias that upon \u201creceiv[ing] an order to remove funds\u201d from his account, it had \u201cresearched [his] account[ ]\u201d and identified $2,625 that constituted protected Social Security \u201cbenefits payments,\u201d leaving $1,294.62 subject to restraint and removal from his account under the order.</p> <p id=\"b175-8\" pgmap=\"175\">That same month, Arias tried to persuade GMBS that \u201c[a]ll of the money\u201d in his account was SSRI, which is exempt from restraint and garnishment under federal law, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a). At Arias\u2019s request, Bank of America sent GMBS Arias\u2019s bank statements for the period February through December 2014, showing only deposits of SSRI. Arias also personally informed GMBS that all of the funds in his account were exempt from restraint or garnishment. GMBS replied that it would release Arias\u2019s funds only if he made a payment. When Arias said he could not afford to do so, GMBS answered that his only recourse would be to go to court to have the restraint removed.</p> <p id=\"b175-12\" pgmap=\"175\">Arias persisted. He mailed GMBS a completed exemption claim form indicating that all of the funds in his checking account were SSRI, and he re-sent the bank statements from February through December 2014 that Bank of America had previously sent. GMBS nevertheless filed an objection to Arias\u2019s claim of exemption, asking the State court to find that the funds in Arias\u2019s account were not exempt from garnishment and, in the alternative, for a hearing and a protective order to prevent the release of the funds. In support of the motion, a GMBS attorney filed an affirmation representing that \u201c[t]he commingling of personal funds with exempt funds transforms the opening balance into personal and non-exempt monies,\u201d and that Arias had \u201cnot provide[d] the proper, documentation in support of his Exemption Claim Form\u201d because he \u201cfailed to provide any bank records starting from a zero balance.\u201d App\u2019x 43-44. In his complaint, Arias alleges that these representations were false and misleading and that GMBS had no good faith basis to object to his exemption claim because it knew, based on the bank statements he provided, that all of the funds in his account were exempt from garnishment.</p> <p id=\"AKn\" pgmap=\"175(42) 176(30)\">In January 2015 the State court held a hearing on GMBS\u2019s objection. Arias, appearing pro se, claimed that all of the funds in his account were SSRI. During the hearing a GMBS attorney reviewed the bank statements that Arias had with him\u2014the same documents Arias had twice transmitted to GMBS. After reviewing the statements, the GMBS attorney promptly withdrew the objection and agreed to release the funds in Arias\u2019s account.</p> <p id=\"b176-4\" pgmap=\"176\">3. Procedural Background</p> <p id=\"b176-5\" pgmap=\"176\">In this action, Arias, now counseled, claims that GMBS violated the FDCPA as well as New York\u2019s General Business Law and Judiciary Law, and also brings a common law claim for conversion. The District Court considered and granted GMBS\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c)/holding that '(1) GMBS had \" not misrepresented Arias\u2019s burden of proof because a debtor must \u201cprovide documentary proof to sufficiently demonstrate the exempt status of restrained funds,\u201d Arias v. Gutman, Mintz, Baker &amp; Sonnenfeldt, P.C., No. 15-CV-09388 (GBD), 2016 WL 3443600, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 8, 2016); (2) GMBS\u2019s alleged misrepresentation about Arias\u2019s failure to produce documents showing a zero balance was not material because it was unrelated to the nature of his underlying debt and because Arias maintained that he-never commingled funds in his account; (3) even if the misrepresentation were material, it would not impede the least sophisticated consumer\u2019s ability to respond to the dispute because GMBS\u2019s objection encouraged Arias to participate in the hearing before the State court; and (4) GMBS did' not employ unfair or unconscionable means to collect the debt because, ampng other things, GMBS complied with applicable New York procedural law. Having dismissed Arias\u2019s FDCPA claim, the District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Arias\u2019s State law claims.</p> <p id=\"b176-6\" pgmap=\"176\">This appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b176-7\" pgmap=\"176\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b176-8\" pgmap=\"176\"> We review the grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of -Arias. See Mantena v. Johnson, 809 F.3d 721, 727-28 (2d Cir. 2015).</p> <p id=\"b176-10\" pgmap=\"176\">1. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act -</p> <p id=\"b176-12\" pgmap=\"176\"> The FDCPA is a strict liability statute: The plaintiff \u201cdoes not need to show intentional conduct on the part of the debt collector.\u201d Ellis v. Solomon &amp; Solomon, P.C., 591 F.3d 130, 135 (2d Cir. 2010). Congress enacted the FDCPA to \u201celiminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e). The Senate report accompanying the legislation noted that debt collection abuse, including the \u201cmisrepresentation of a consumer\u2019s legal rights,\u201d by third-party debt collectors, \u201cis- a widespread and serious national problem.\u201d S. Rep. ,No, 95-382, at 2 (197.7), reprinted in 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1695, 1696 [hereinafter Senate Report]. \u201cBecause the FDCPA is remedial in nature, its terms must be construed in liberal fashion if the underlying Congressional purpose is to be effectuated.\u201d Vincent v. Money Store, 736 F.3d 88, 98 (2d Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b176-13\" pgmap=\"176(52) 177(41)\"> This appeal concerns two overlapping sections of the FDCPA: section 1692e, which prohibits false, deceptive, or misleading representations, and section 1692f, which prohibits collecting or attempting to collect a debt through unfair or unconscionable means. Both sections expressly prohibit specific conduct relating to debt collection; but the FDCPA \u201cenable[s] the courts, where appropriate, to proscribe other improper conduct which is not specifically addressed.\u201d Senate Report at 4; see also Avila v. Riexinger &amp; Assocs., LLC, 817 F.3d 72, 75 (2d Cir. 2016) (describing the FDCPA\u2019s prohibitions as \u201cnon-exhaustive\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b177-5\" pgmap=\"177\"> Section 1692e prohibits debt collectors from using \u201cany false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt,\u201d including, as relevant here, misrepresenting the \u201ccharacter, amount, or legal status\u201d of a debt; threatening .to \u201ctake any action that cannot legally be taken\u201d; or threatening a debtor with arrest, imprisonment, or seizure of property if the debtor fails to make a payment. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e. A representation is \u201cdeceptive\u201d under section 1692e if it is \u201copen to more than one reasonable interpretation, at least one of which is inaccurate.\u201d Easterling v. Collecto, Inc., 692 F.3d 229, 233 (2d Cir. 2012).</p> <p id=\"b177-6\" pgmap=\"177\"> We analyze the reasonableness of an interpretation from the perspective of the \u201cleast sophisticated consumer,\u201d M. at 234, who, we have explained, lacks the sophistication of the average consumer and may be naive about the law, but is rational and possesses a rudimentary amount of information about the world, Ellis, 591 F.3d at 135. The standard is objective, \u201cpays no attention to the circumstances of the particular debtor in question,\u201d and asks only \u201cwhether the hypothetical least sophisticated consumer -could- reasonably interpret\u201d the representation in a way that is inaccurate. Easterling, 692 F.3d at 234 (emphasis added). Employing the least sophisticated consumer standard \u201censures the protection of all consumers, even the naive and the trusting, against deceptive debt collection, practices.\u201d Clomon v. Jackson, 988 F.2d 1314, 1320 (2d Cir. 1993).</p> <p id=\"b177-7\" pgmap=\"177\">Section 1692f prohibits debt collectors from using any \u201cunfair oh unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f. Like its counterpart, section 1692e, section 1692f contains a non-exhaustive list of unfair practices, including the collection of an invalid debt and taking or threatening to take nonjudicial action to effect the dispossession of property without a legal right to do so. Id. The FDCPA may also bar an array of other unfair practices. See Currier v. First Resolution Inv. Corp., 762 F.3d 529, 534 (6th Cir. 2014) (collecting cases).</p> <p id=\"b177-8\" pgmap=\"177\"> Although the FDCPA leaves the term \u201cunfair or unconscionable means\u201d undefined, we have .held that the term refers, to practices that are \u201cshockingly unjust or unfair, or affronting the sense of justice, decency, or reasonableness.\u201d Gallego v. Northland Grp. Inc., 814 F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir. 2016) (quotation marks omitted) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. (10th ed. 2014)). The least sophisticated consumer standard is used to determine whether a practice is unfair or unconscionable. See LeBlanc v. Unifund CCR Partners, 601 F.3d 1185, 1200-01 (11th Cir. 2010); cf. Schweizer v. Trans Union Corp., 136 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir. 1998).</p> <p id=\"b177-9\" pgmap=\"177\">2... Interplay of Sections 1692e and 1692f</p> <p id=\"b177-11\" pgmap=\"177(87) 178(234)\">. [11] GMBS argues that sections 1692e and 1692f are mutually exclusive and that the same conduct by a debt collector cannot violate both sections at once. We disagree. See Sykes v. Mel S. Harris &amp; Assocs. LLC, 780 F.3d 70, 82, 87 (2d Cir. 2015) (affirming certification of a class alleging that the same scheme violated sections .1692e and 1692f). Each section primarily targets a different type of misconduct, even as both sections share the goal of protecting consumers from abuse \u2018by debt collectors. Section 1692e mainly targets practices that take advantage of a debtor\u2019s naivete or lack of legal acumen.' Section 1692f, meanwhile, is aimed at practices that give the debt collector an unfair advantage over the debtor or are inherently abusive. .\u201c[A] collection practice could be unfair without necessarily being deceptive,\u201d Currier, 762 F.3d at 534, could be deceptive without being unfair, or could be both deceptive and unfair, see id. at 536 (sections 1692e and -1692f are \u201cbroad, potentially overlapping, and are not mutually exclusive\u201d); LeBlanc, 601 F.3d at 1193, 1202 (allowing claims under sections 1692e and 1692f to proceed based on the same conduct); McMillan v. Collection Prof'ls Inc., 455 F.3d 754, 760 (7th Cir. 2006) (same); Duffy v. Landberg, 215 F.3d 871, 874-75 (8th Cir. 2000) (same). Consider, for example, section 1692f(7), which deals specifically with communicating with a consumer about a debt by postcard. A debt collector who communicates with a debtor by postcard containing a representation that is \u201cfalse, deceptive, or misleading\u201d to the least sophisticated consumer can violate both section 1692f(7) and section 1692e. In any event, here GMBS is alleged to have violated each section based on different conduct: section 1692e based on the false statements made in GMBS\u2019s affirmation, and section 1692f based on GMBS\u2019s objection to Arias\u2019s exemption claim when it allegedly knew there was no legally sufficient basis to do so.</p> <p id=\"b178-4\" pgmap=\"178\">3. Arias\u2019s Claim Under Section 1692e</p> <p id=\"b178-5\" pgmap=\"178\"> Even if the same conduct can constitute a violation of both sections, GMBS argues that Arias\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim under section 1692e. Recall that GMBS\u2019s affirmation is alleged to have contained two false representations, as follows: \u2022</p> <blockquote id=\"b178-6\" pgmap=\"178\">[Arias] does not provide the proper documentation in support of his Exemption Claim Form. [Arias] failed to provide any bank records- starting from a zero balance for [GMBS] to review to determine if [Arias\u2019s] account contains solely social security. Without any of those documents, it is not possible for [GMBS] to determine what funds, if any, contained in the Bank of America account are exempt as social security!;]</blockquote> <p id=\"b178-8\" pgmap=\"178\">and</p> <blockquote id=\"b178-9\" pgmap=\"178\">[e]ven if the restrained account contains social security, [Arias] failed to provide any documentation that he never commingled the account with non-exempt funds.</blockquote> <p id=\"b178-10\" pgmap=\"178\">App\u2019x44.</p> <p id=\"b178-11\" pgmap=\"178(184) 179(8)\">In our view, neither representation is accurate. Contrary to both representations, New York\u2019s EIPA did not require Arias to disprove commingling or to provide bank statements starting from a zero balance in order for GMBS to figure that all of Arias\u2019s funds were exempt under the lowest intermediate balance rule. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5222-a(d) (\u201cThe burden of proof shall be upon the judgment creditor to establish the amount of funds that are not exempt.\u201d); id. \u00a7 5222-a(c)(4) (\u201c[T]he judgment creditor shall apply the lowest intermediate balance principle of accounting\u201d). Here the bank statements show only deposits of SSRI and an ending balance lower than the sum of the exempt deposits. The entire balance was thus clearly exempt. For this- reason we conclude that Arias plausibly alleged that the two GMBS representations at issue had the \u201ccapacity to discourage debtors from fully availing themselves of their legal rights,\u201d Easterling, 692 F.3d at 235, by falsely suggesting that (1) the commingling of exempt and non-exempt funds renders the balance non-exempt, and (2) the consumer must disprove commingling by producing bank statements starting from a zero balance.</p> <p id=\"b179-5\" pgmap=\"179\">In urging a contrary conclusion, GMBS makes three arguments.</p> <p id=\"b179-6\" pgmap=\"179\">First, GMBS argues that its misrepresentations are not actionable because Arias was not actually misled. It points to Arias\u2019s appearance at the State court hearing and his ultimate success there. It also points out that Arias knew he had never commingled funds in his account. In Easterling, we rejected the debt collector\u2019s argument that the plaintiff was never actually misled, holding that \u201cthe operative inquiry ... is whether the hypothetical least sophisticated consumer\u201d would be misled by the debt collector\u2019s misrepresentation. Id. at 234. For the same reason, we reject GMBS\u2019s argument because it ignores the objective nature of the least sophisticated consumer standard and asks us instead to focus on Arias\u2019s particular circumstances.</p> <p id=\"b179-7\" pgmap=\"179\"> Describing its affirmation as \u201clegal advocacy made by counsel,\u201d GMBS next argues that we should \u201chesita[te] to impose FDCPA liability\u201d based on litigation conduct. Appellee Br. 22-23. It is true that in Simmons v. Roundup Funding, LLC, 622 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2010), we held that filing a false statement of claim in bankruptcy court cannot give rise to a FDCPA claim, and more recently in Midland Funding, LLC v. Johnson, \u2014 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1407, 1411, 197 L.Ed.2d 790 (2017), the Supreme Court held that \u201cfiling of a proof of claim [in bankruptcy court] that on its face indicates that the limitations period has run does not\u201d violate any provision of the FDCPA, including section 1692e. But the rationale of Midland and Simmons reflects the special protections afforded a consumer under the Bankruptcy Code\u2014protections that are unavailable where, as here, the proceedings are in State court and the consumer, often unfamiliar with the law governing garnishment of bank accounts, has the benefit of neither counsel nor a bankruptcy trustee. See Midland, 137 S.Ct. at 1413 (\u201c[I]n the context of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy[,] ... [t]he consumer initiates [the] proceeding, ... [a] knowledgeable trustee is available^] ... [and procedural bankruptcy rules more directly guide the evaluation of claims.\u201d); Simmons, 622 F.3d at 96. Under these circumstances, where court filings \u201croutinely come to the consumer\u2019s attention and may affect his or her defense of a collection claim,\u201d Hemmingsen v. Messerli &amp; Kramer, P.A., 674 F.3d 814, 818 (8th Cir. 2012), debt collectors do not have immunity from FDCPA liability for their litigation conduct, see Eades v. Kennedy, PC Law Offices, 799 F.3d 161, 172 (2d Cir. 2015); cf. Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U.S. 291, 294, 115 S.Ct. 1489,131 L.Ed.2d 395 (1995) (holding that the FDCPA \u201capplies to the litigating activities of lawyers\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b179-14\" pgmap=\"179(99) 180(8)\">Third, GMBS argues that the relevant statements are not \u201cmaterial\u201d because they are unrelated to the \u201cnature\u201d or \u201cstatus\u201d of Arias\u2019s debt. Appellee Br. 22 n.4. We are not persuaded. Even if we assume without deciding that a general \u201cmateriality\u201d requirement exists under section 1692e,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we regard GMBS\u2019s alleged misrepresentations as material because they concerned the applicable burden of proof and the substantive law regarding commingling of funds under the EIPA, issues that can reasonably be expected to affect how or even whether a consumer responds to a debt collector\u2019s objection to a claim that the restrained funds are exempt from garnishment.</p> <p id=\"b180-4\" pgmap=\"180\">4. Arias\u2019s Claim Under Section 1692f</p> <p id=\"b180-5\" pgmap=\"180\"> Finally, we consider whether the complaint states a claim under section 1692f, focusing principally on the claim that GMBS used unfair or unconscionable means to collect on the default judgment entered against Arias as well as the following allegations: (1) that GMBS had \u201cdocumentary proof-that [all of the] funds restrained [in Arias\u2019s bank account] were exempt SSRI\u201d; (2) that GMBS refused to release the restraint and filed an objection in State court despite having \u201cno, good-faith basis for objecting ... in order to abuse and intimidate [Arias] into agreeing to send [GMBS] payments from his exempt funds, or in hopes that [Arias] would-default at the hearing\u201d; (3) that \u201cit is the pattern and practice of GMBS to object to ... exemption claims whether or not [it has] a good faith basis for doing,so, in order to abuse and intimidate consumers\u201d; and (4) that GMBS agreed to release Arias\u2019s funds at the State court hearing only after one of its lawyers reviewed documents that had previously been produced and sent with Arias\u2019s exemption claim form. Together- these allegations are enough to support Arias\u2019s claim that GMBS\u2019s conduct was \u201cshockingly unjust or unfair\u201d in violation of section 1692f, insofar as it required Arias to prepare needlessly for a hearing that GMBS knew was frivolous and that was intended primarily to harass Arias, frustrate his .exemption claim, and erect procedural and substantive challenges thaf Arias, pro se, was ill-equipped to handle. Attending a hearing can be expensive, forcing consumers to take unpaid leave from work, incur additional dependent care expenses, and so on, without access to critical SSRI funds. We hold that a debt collector engages in unfair or unconscionable litigation conduct in violation of section 1692f when, as alleged here, it in bad faith unduly prolongs legal proceedings or requires a consumer to appear at an unnecessary hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cf. Eades, 799 F.3d at 172 (suggesting that the filing of a \u201cfrivolous or baseless\u201d complaint could violate section 1692f(l)).</p> <p id=\"b180-10\" pgmap=\"180(217) 181(11)\">Our holding is consistent with section 1692e, which prohibits, a debt collector from \u201cthreatening] to take any action that cannot legally be taken.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(5). It is unlikely -that Congress would prohibit threatening to take an illegal action while permitting the additional step of actually taking, the illegal action. See Currier, 762 F.3d at 535-36 (holding that under section 1692e, alleged illegal conduct \u201ccan also fairly be characterized as a threat to take [that illegal action]\u201d). Our holding also coheres with decisions of our sister circuits, which have held that unfair or unconscionable litigation conduct violates section 1692f. See, e.g., Kaymark v. Bank of Am., N.A., 783 F.3d 168, 174 (3d Cir. 2015) (filing foreclosure complaint seeking attorney\u2019s fees not yet incurred); Currier, 762 F.3d at 535 (maintaining invalid lien on debtor\u2019s property); Phillips v. Asset Acceptance, LLC, 736 F.3d 1076, 1079 (7th Cir. 2013) (filing suit to collect debt for which the statute of limitations had run); McCollough v. Johnson, Rodenburg &amp; Lauinger, LLC, 637 F.3d 939, 952 (9th Cir. 2011) (serving requests for admission .on pro se debtor without informing debtor that statements would be automatically admitted if not responded to within thirty days); Fox v. Citicorp Credit Servs., Inc., 15 F.3d 1507, 1517 (9th Cir. 1994) (filing writ of garnishment against debtors who were .current on payments).</p> <p id=\"b181-5\" pgmap=\"181\">In response, GMBS makes three principal arguments. First, it argues that it-technically complied with- the EIPA, a State statute, and exercised its \u201cexplicit statutory right\u201d to object to Arias\u2019s exemption claim and to seek a court hearing. Appellee Br. 38. We note, to the contrary, that GMBS\u2019s alleged conduct actually contravened the' EIPA, which provides that a debt- collector \u201cshall .\u25a0.. .release the [debt- or\u2019s] account\u201d when it receives documents showing that all of the funds in an account are exempt, and may file an objection only if it has a \u201cfactual basis\u201d to form a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that the account contains non-exempt funds. N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5222-a(c)(4), (d) (emphasis added). Second, GMBS claims it had a good faith basis to object to Arias\u2019s claim of exemption, pointing, for example, to Bank of America\u2019s suggestion that some of Arias\u2019s funds were not exempt from garnishment and to the fact that Arias\u2019s bank statements were not notarized.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are not persuaded. Without further investigation, there was no good faith basis for GMBS to rely on Bank of America\u2019s ambiguous statement that some of Arias\u2019s funds \u201cmay not\u201d be exempt from garnishment. App\u2019x 30. GMBS\u2019s reasbn to doubt the authenticity of Arias\u2019s bank statements was entirely conclusory and speculative. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5222-a(d). Third, citing Bentley v. Great Lakes Collection Bureau, 6 F.3d 60 (2d Cir. 1993), GMBS asserts that its motive and intent in objecting to Arias\u2019s exemption claim are \u201cirrelevant to the issue of liability\u201d because the FDCPA is a strict liability statute. In Bentley, we. held that inaccurate statements in a collection letter were actionable under the FDCPA regardless of the debt collector\u2019s culpability. Id. at 63. We did not hold that a debt collector\u2019s intent is irrelevant in determining whether its conduct is unfair or unconscionable under section 1692f. Here the restraint is adequately alleged to have been wrongfully imposed for an abusive purpose.</p> <p id=\"b181-8\" pgmap=\"181\">5. Remedies.</p> <p id=\"b181-9\" pgmap=\"181\"> Finally, turning to remedies, GMBS argues that Arias cannot recover under the FDCPA because the EIPA provides for sanctions when a judgment creditor files an objection in bad faith. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5222-a(c)(4), (g). But abusive debt collection practices may violate both the FDCPA and State law. The FDCPA\u2019s express purpose includes \u201cpromoting] consistent State action to protect consumers' against debt collection abuses.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e). \u2018 The legislative history confirms this purpose: Congress' enacted the FDCPA in part to address \u201cthe inadequacy of existing State ... laws.\u201d Senate Report at 1697; see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(b) (\u201cExisting laws and procedures for redressing [abuse by debt collectors] are inadequate to protect consumers.\u201d). We therefore reject the argument that the remedial scope of the FDCPA is limited by State law. See Romea v. Heiberger &amp; Assocs., 163 F.3d, 111, 118 (2d Cir. 1998).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b181-10\" pgmap=\"181\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b181-11\" pgmap=\"181(11) 182(24)\">We have considered GMBS\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit.
