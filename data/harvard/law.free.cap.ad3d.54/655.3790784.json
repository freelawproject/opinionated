The appellants failed to meet their initial burden of establishing their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law <em>(see Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., </em>68 NY2d 320, 324 [1986]). Specifically, the appellants failed to establish that the subject product performed as intended or that there existed a likely cause of the respondent\u2019s injuries not attributable to any defect in the design or manufacturing of the product <em>(see Speller v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>100 NY2d 38, 41 [2003]; <em>Koslow v Zenith Elecs. Corp., </em>45 AD3d 810, 810-811 [2007]; <em>Taft v Sports Page Shop, </em>226 AD2d 974 [1996]). As the appellants failed to establish their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, we need not consider the sufficiency of the opposing papers <em>(see Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr., </em>64 NY2d 851, 853 [1985]).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The appellants\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In light of the above, we decline the request of the defendant Blackman Plumbing Supply Company, Inc., a nonappealing defendant, to search the record and award summary judgment in favor of it. Mastro, J.P., Florio, Dickerson and Belen, JJ., concur. <em>[See </em>2007 NY Slip Op 31027(U).]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
