His last known address is in Tampa, Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">By decision dated July 3, 2008, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law until such time as a final disciplinary order was entered and directed him to show cause why such final order of suspension, censure or removal from office should not be made pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (g) <em>(Matter of Erikson, </em>53 AD3d 772 [2008]).

Ordered that pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (g) respondent is disbarred, and his name is stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law of the State of New York, effective immediately; and it is further ordered that respondent is commanded to desist and refrain from the practice of law in any form, either as principal or as agent, clerk or employee of another; and respondent is hereby forbidden to appear as an attorney or counselor-at-law before any court, judge, justice, board, commission or other public authority, or to give to another an opinion as to the law or its application, or any advice in relation thereto; and it is further ordered that respondent shall comply with the provisions of this Court\u2019s rules regulating the conduct of disbarred attorneys <em>(see </em>22 NYCRR 806.9).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
