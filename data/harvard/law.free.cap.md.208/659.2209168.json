The jury found petitioner guilty on all six counts of the information, .and Judge Clark sentenced him to confinement in the Maryland Penitentiary for the period of 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Petitioner challenged the legality of the sentence. He contended that Judge Clark did not impose a separate sentence on the verdict on each count; that he had no power to impose any sentence heavier than that prescribed for assault with intent to murder, the most serious of the six charges; and that the maximum penalty for that crime is imprisonment for the term of 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Petitioner admitted that he was convicted of the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon. The Code provides that every person convicted of the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than twenty years. Code (1951), Art. 27, sec. 574A.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">It is clear from petitioner\u2019s own statement that the sentence imposed upon him did not exceed the maximum penalty prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
