Appellant\u2019s first four issues deal with evidence either used at trial, not used at trial, or allegedly fraudulently used at trial. Regardless, \u201cthis is not a ground for relief by habeas corpus, as questions of evidence must be raised by appeal.\u201d <em>Saulsbury v. Green </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 433, 434, 25 O.O.2d 445, 195 N.E.2d 787, 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Appellant\u2019s next issue is ineffectiveness of counsel. Again this is an issue to be appealed. \u201c[Tjhere is nothing in the record to indicate any lack of competence of such counsel. Even if there were such lack, it is a matter which must be raised by appeal rather than habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Sacks </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 456, 457, 20 O.O.2d 78, 184 N.E.2d 93, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Appellant\u2019s next issue is judicial misconduct. This is \u201cdirected at alleged irregularities in the proceedings and not to the jurisdiction of the court and matters which would render the conviction void.\u201d <em>Cantrell v. Maxwell </em>(1962), 174 Ohio St. 51, 52, 21 O.O.2d 297, 186 N.E.2d 621, 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">The final issue raised by appellant is that all of these issues taken together and all the prosecutorial and professional misconduct amount to a lack of jurisdiction. However, this argument is without merit. It has already been demonstrated that all of the appellant\u2019s issues are issues for appeal and not habeas corpus. When the appellant does not attack the jurisdiction of the court, habeas corpus does not lie. <em>Stahl v. Shoemaker </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 351, 4 O.O.3d 485, 364 N.E.2d 286. Finally, habeas corpus is not a substitute for appeal. <em>Walker v. Maxwell </em>(1965), 1 Ohio St.2d 136, 30 O.O.2d 487, 205 N.E.2d 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-13\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
