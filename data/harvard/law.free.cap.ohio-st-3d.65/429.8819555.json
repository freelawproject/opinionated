I(11)(C)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">After thorough review of the evidence, we find that applicant has not sustained her requisite burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Applicant suggests that any unfavorable assessment of her mental fitness was not based on her current psychological state, but instead derived from events occurring over a decade ago. We, however, find it unnecessary to return to 1981 to find evidence of mental instability. We are particularly concerned by a 1991 incident involving a Cleveland attorney for whom applicant agreed to do research as part of the job application process. At some point during her endeavors, applicant became convinced that the attorney\u2019s proposed legal strategy was wrong. Applicant did not discuss the situation with the attorney, but instead wrote to the presiding trial judge and Attorney General with her suspicions. Applicant took this action despite an awareness of the possible prejudicial impact her accusations might have on the attorney or his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Equally disturbing is the follow-up letter that applicant sent to the Disciplinary Counsel of this court. There, applicant revealed her belief that the attorney for whom she did research \u201cis not alive anymore, and that someone else is using his identity.\u201d She further suggested that the individual may be trying to sabotage the client\u2019s case in order to \u201cstiff\u201d applicant, but she did not explain why she would be targeted for such action. Applicant claimed to have suffered \u201csevere emotional distress\u201d because of the situation and was \u201ctoo emotionally distraught to look for work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">When viewed together with the medical evidence, applicant\u2019s actions may be more than just atypical examples of thinking under stress that we consider normal in the practice of law. Drs. Pagano and Koricke agreed that stress could trigger confused thinking by applicant in the future. Dr. Koricke conceded that it would be a \u201ctough call\u201d as to whether applicant could mentally handle the rigors of the legal profession. We thus find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>applicant has not demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, her fitness to practice law at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Accordingly, we adopt the findings of fact and recommendation of the board. We hereby deny applicant\u2019s application to take the bar examination. Applicant may not reapply for admission sooner than for the July 1993 examination, with admission to be contingent upon further character and fitness review and a successful demonstration of her fitness to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b584-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
