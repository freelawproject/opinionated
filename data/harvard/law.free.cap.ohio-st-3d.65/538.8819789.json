For the reasons that follow, we find that the commission had such authority. We further hold that the commission\u2019s January 17, 1990 decision is in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">As a threshold matter, we note that appellant essentially concedes that the Summit County Court of Common Pleas did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to address the merits of Sylvia\u2019s R.C. 4123.519 appeal but, nevertheless, contends, citing various cases, that the filing of the notice of appeal in the common pleas court by Sylvia divested the commission of jurisdiction to reconsider its 1989 order, rendering the commission\u2019s January 17, 1990 decision null and void. The court of appeals, in addressing appellant\u2019s contention, concluded that: \u201c * * * [T]he filing of an appeal terminates the Industrial Commission\u2019s authority to reconsider its decision only when the decision is appealable to a court. In other words, the agency\u2019s authority to reconsider its decision is not terminated by an attempted appeal from a decision which as a matter of law is not appealable.\u201d We agree with the conclusion reached by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Without question, specific-safety-requirement-violation determinations by the commission are not directly appealable to the court of common pleas. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175. Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution vests exclusive and final jurisdiction in the commission, with respect to specific-safety-requirement violations, subject to correction in mandamus upon a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Drum Service, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 135, 556 N.E.2d 459. Further, this court has determined that the filing of a R.C. 4123.519 appeal from a commission order which is not appealable is a \u201cfutile act.\u201d However, such a filing does not bar a suit in mandamus. See <em>State ex rel. Dodson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 399, 401, 12 O.O.3d 345, 346, 390 N.E.2d 1189, 1190. Thus, in view of the foregoing, we believe that the notice of appeal filed by Sylvia should be treated as a nullity and, as such, the notice does not divest the commission of jurisdiction to reconsider its 1989 order. Moreover, it is clear that appellant\u2019s reliance on those cases which hold that the commission retains jurisdiction to reconsider a decision only until the time an appeal is filed, or the time for appeal has run, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Appellant also objects to the January 17, 1990 award of additional benefits to Sylvia on the basis that the commission did not have jurisdiction to award such benefits since Sylvia\u2019s 1986 request was not filed within two years of Elmer\u2019s death. However, we believe under the facts of this case the commission had the authority under R.C. 4123.52 to consider Sylvia\u2019s 1986 request and correct its clear mistake of law in originally denying the additional benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Continuing jurisdiction is vested in the commission by R.C. 4123.52, which provides, in part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\u201cThe jurisdiction of the industrial commission over each case shall be continuing, and the commission may make such modification or change with respect to former findings or orders with respect thereto, as, <em>in its opinion is justified.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">R.C. 4123.52 contains a broad grant of authority. However, we are aware that the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction is not unlimited. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Gatlin v. Yellow Freight System, Inc. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 246, 18 OBR 302, 480 N.E.2d 487 (commission has inherent power to reconsider its order for a reasonable period of time absent statutory or administrative restrictions); <em>State ex rel. Cuyahoga Hts. Bd. ofEdn. v. Johnston </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 132, 12 O.O.3d 128, 388 N.E.2d 1383 (just cause for modification of a prior order includes new and changed conditions); <em>State ex rel. Weimer v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 159, 16 O.O.3d 174, 404 N.E.2d 149 (continuing jurisdiction exists when prior order is clearly a mistake of fact); <em>State ex rel. Kilgore v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1930), 123 Ohio St. 164, 9 Ohio Law Abs. 62, 174 N.E. 345 (commission has continuing jurisdiction in cases involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ing fraud); <em>State ex rel. Manns v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 188, 529 N.E.2d 1379 (an error by an inferior tribunal is a sufficient reason to invoke continuing jurisdiction); and <em>State ex rel. Saunders v. Metal Container Corp. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 85, 86, 556 N.E.2d 168, 170 (mistake must be \u201csufficient to invoke the continuing jurisdiction provisions of R.C. 4123.52\u201d). Today, we expand the list set forth above and hold that the Industrial Commission has the authority pursuant to R.C. 4123.52 to modify a prior order that is clearly a mistake of law. In so holding, we note that the court of appeals ably recognized that: \u201c * * * [W]here it is clear that this court would issue a writ of mandamus ordering the Industrial Commission to vacate, modify or change a decision or order, the respondent Industrial Commission neither exceeds its authority or jurisdiction nor acts unlawfully nor abuses its discretion if it proceeds to make such correction that this court would clearly have ordered without awaiting either an action being filed in this court or a decision from this court if one be filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">It is clear that the commission\u2019s 1989 order, denying Sylvia additional benefits, was a mistake of law. The commission\u2019s order was premised on the fact that Sylvia did not file a claim for additional benefits within two years of Elmer\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-20 and 4123-3-20, and their predecessors, required that an application for an award for violation of a specific safety requirement be filed within two years of the injury <em>or </em>death resulting from the violation. Neither provision requires that an application be made within two years of the claimant\u2019s injury <em>and, </em>again, within two years of the claimant\u2019s death. Rather, when read in their entirety, these rules focus only on the initial specific-safety-requirement-violation determination. Here, an application for an award for violation of a specific safety requirement was filed by Elmer within two years of his injury. The commission has determined that a violation occurred, that appellant\u2019s violation caused injury, and that injury caused death. It is apparent that the. specific-safety-requirement violation caused Elmer\u2019s death. Hence, to require the widow, Sylvia, to reestablish that the specific-safety-requirement violation caused the death of her husband would serve no useful purpose. Stated otherwise, the widow had nothing more to prove. The two-year administrative filing requirement was satisfied when Elmer filed his application. Given this factor, Sylvia was not required to file for additional benefits within two years of Elmer\u2019s death. Such additional benefits should have automatically attached to the death benefits paid Sylvia.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Accordingly, we find that the commission\u2019s January 17, 1990 order was correct in all respects. The judgment of the court of appeals denying appellant\u2019s writ is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Sweeney, H.

In reaching the result that it does, the majority ignores the rule of law established as precedent in this court. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">An action in mandamus will lie when a public agency is under a clear legal duty to perform an official act and there is no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Pressley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 141, 40 O.O.2d 141, 228 N.E.2d 631, paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, mandamus is appropriate when the Industrial Commission makes a decision on a request for an award of benefits for violation of a specific safety requirement (\u201cVSSR\u201d) which the law clearly prohibits. See <em>State ex rel. Carr v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1935), 130 Ohio St. 185, 4 O.O. 122, 198 N.E. 480. Because in my view the law clearly prohibits the commission from reconsidering its initial order denying benefits under the circumstances of this case, I would grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">R.C. 4123.52 provides that the Industrial Commission has continuing jurisdiction over each case and that it may modify former orders \u201cas, in its opinion is justified.\u201d Just cause for such a modification includes new and changed conditions, <em>State ex rel. Cuyahoga Hts. Bd. of Edn. v. Johnston </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 132, 12 O.O.3d 128, 388 N.E.2d 1383; mistake of fact, <em>State ex rel. Weimer v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 159, 16 O.O.3d 174, 404 N.E.2d 149; fraud, <em>State ex rel. Kilgore v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1930), 123 Ohio St. 164, 9 Ohio Law Abs. 62, 174 N.E. 345; and mistake by an inferior tribunal, <em>State ex rel. Saunders v. Metal Container Corp. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 85, 556 N.E.2d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Today, the majority adds to the list mistake of law in a prior order. Because I would hold that the commission\u2019s lack of power to modify its prior order is jurisdictional in nature, I would not reach this substantive question.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">The dispositive principle in this case is that the power of the commission to modify a prior order is limited. The commission has jurisdiction to reconsider its decision until the expiration of time in which to initiate a court appeal, or until the actual institution of an appeal. <em>State ex rel. Prayner v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 120, 31 O.O.2d 192, 206 N.E.2d 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">This rule applies even where the court to which appeal is taken has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>State ex rel. Borsuk v. Cleveland </em>(1972), 28 Ohio St.2d 224, 57 O.O.2d 464, 277 N.E.2d 419 (civil service commission has jurisdiction to reconsider decision until expiration of time for appeal or until actual appeal taken); <em>Diltz v. Crouch </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 367, 19 O.O.2d 312, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>182 N.E.2d 315 (Board of Liquor Control has continuing jurisdiction until expiration of time for appeal, or actual appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">In <em>Diltz, </em>the plaintiffs were holders of liquor permits which the Board of Liquor Control revoked. Plaintiffs appealed the revocations to the trial court, which affirmed the board\u2019s decision. Thereafter, plaintiffs applied to the board for reconsideration, and the board modified the revocations to suspensions. This court held that even though the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the initiation of that appeal nevertheless terminated the board\u2019s jurisdiction to modify its prior order.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In <em>Borsuk, </em>relator was a police officer terminated after his one-year probationary period. Relator requested a hearing before the city civil service commission, pursuant to which the commission reinstated him. The city requested a rehearing, and afterwards appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the court of common pleas. The trial court dismissed the appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The commission then refused to rehear the matter, stating that it lacked jurisdiction in view of the prior court appeal. The officer brought a mandamus action to compel the city to reinstate him pursuant to the pre-appeal order. The city opposed the mandamus action, arguing that the commission still had jurisdiction to rehear the matter and modify its order. This court affirmed the court of appeals in granting the writ, holding that the commission lost its jurisdiction to modify its order once the city appealed. Citing <em>Diltz </em>as controlling, this court expressly rejected the argument that because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the city\u2019s appeal, the appeal never divested the commission of its power to rehear the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">It is not in dispute that YSSR determinations by the commission are not directly appealable to the court of common pleas. <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Drum Serv., Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 135, 556 N.E.2d 459. The majority states, however, that because the commission\u2019s order was not appealable but instead subject only to an action in mandamus, Sylvia Holik\u2019s appeal did not divest the commission of jurisdiction to reconsider its order. <em>Diltz </em>and <em>Borsuk, supra, </em>however, hold otherwise. The majority opinion fails to cite any authority that contradicts the clear holdings of these cases. Nor does it give any principled reason for distinguishing them, other than the bald assertion that reliance on these cases \u201cis misplaced.\u201d The majority thus exempts the Industrial Commission from law that governs other administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In fact, the reasoning in <em>Diltz </em>and <em>Borsuk </em>is equally applicable here. Once the Industrial Commission denied VSSR benefits to appellee Holik, it retained jurisdiction to modify its order, for good cause shown, until the expiration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the time for appeal or the actual institution of appeal. When Holik instituted her court appeal on July 21, 1989, however, the commission lost the power to modify its prior order. The fact that the court of common pleas lacked jurisdiction to hear Holik\u2019s appeal from an adverse decision of the commission on her entitlement to YSSR benefits does not change this result. The trial court did have jurisdiction to make the threshold determination of whether to allow the action to proceed. See <em>State ex rel. Dickison v. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 179, 57 O.O.2d 411, 277 N.E.2d 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The majority chooses to ignore this clear and well-established law, asserting instead that because the filing of an R.C. 4123.519 appeal is a \u201cfutile act,\u201d it could not divest the commission of the power to reconsider. Although such an appeal may be futile, it is not without consequences. While it is unfortunate that appellee made the decision to file a futile appeal to the court of common pleas, apparently without the awareness of these consequences, it is not the function of this court to mitigate the errors of litigants or their counsel by ignoring applicable law. The appeals taken from administrative bodies in <em>Diltz </em>and <em>Borsuk </em>were equally futile acts, yet they ended the jurisdiction of the agency to reconsider. The same result should occur here.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">I would hold that the Industrial Commission loses jurisdiction to reconsider its own order once the party requesting reconsideration of the order has appealed it to the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">To achieve the result it does, the majority overlooks the principle that true fairness in the law requires its consistent application and respect for binding precedent. Because this court\u2019s precedent contradicts the majority\u2019s decision in this case, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b697-8\">Holmes and Wright, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
