In the actual motion, he cited Civ.R. (7)(B) and 50(B), as well as Civ.R. 54(B). None of these rules have application to this case. Civ.R. 7(B)(2) provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201cTo expedite its business, the court may make provision by rule or order for the submission and determination of motions without oral hearing upon brief written statements of reasons in support and opposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Appellant provided a written statement in support of his motion, which the court heard without oral argument. Therefore, the court of appeals did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Civ.R. 50(B) governs motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; however, as the term \u201cverdict\u201d implies, it only applies in cases tried by jury. Freeman did not demand, nor was he entitled to, a jury trial to determine whether a writ should issue. Therefore, the court of appeals properly denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict under Civ.R. 50(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Civ.R. 54(B) provides for judgment upon multiple claims or involving multiple parties. The court of appeals properly ruled on all claims raised by Freeman\u2019s motion; therefore, his argument pertaining to Civ.R. 54(B) is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Appellant\u2019s second argument is that it was substantial error to deny his motion for attorney fees without scheduling a separate hearing under R.C. 2323.51. The court of appeals correctly noted that appellant is not a licensed attorney, but a <em>pro se </em>litigant. This court has previously held, in a case between the same parties, that \u201cR.C. 2323.51 provides for attorney fees, not compensation for <em>pro se </em>litigants. A separate hearing to make that determination would have been pointless.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Freeman v. Wilkinson </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 516, 517-518, 597 N.E.2d 126, 127. Therefore, the court of appeals was correct in denying appellant\u2019s motion for legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Appellant\u2019s final objection is to the adoption and approval of the referee\u2019s report. However, Civ.R. 53(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">\u201cThe court may appoint one or more referees * * * to hear an issue or issues in any case in which the parties are not entitled to a trial by jury * * *.\u201d Civ.R. 53(E)(2) provides that \u201c[a] party may, within fourteen days of the filing of the report, serve and file written objections to the referee\u2019s report.\u201d Civ.R. 53(E)(5) provides that the referee\u2019s report \u201cshall be effective and binding only when approved and entered as the matter of record by the court. The referee\u2019s findings of fact must be sufficient for the court to make an independent analysis of the issues * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Civ.R. 53(E)(7) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">\u201cThe court may enter judgment on the basis of findings of fact contained in the referee\u2019s report without waiting for timely objection by the parties * *</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The referee filed his report on November 27, 1991, and the court made its independent analysis and entered judgment on March 19, 1992. Appellant filed no objection to the referee\u2019s report during that time. Therefore, the court of appeals\u2019 adoption, approval, and judgment based on the referee\u2019s report were well within Civ.R. 53. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-6\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
