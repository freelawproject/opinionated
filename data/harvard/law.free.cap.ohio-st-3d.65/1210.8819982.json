The city desires to hire a single general contractor and therefore instructed bidders to submit \u201csingle prime contract bids\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>bids for the entire project) only.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">Relators, two mechanical trade contractors and two organizations representing such contractors, contend that R.C. 153.50 <em>et seq. </em>requires the city to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>bids for portions of the work, such as electrical work, plumbing, or heating. Each relator asked the city to modify the bid package to allow partial bids. The city declined. On June 11, 1992, the city unsealed the bids, whereupon relators filed this action. Respondents, city of Cleveland et al., filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Relators seek a writ \u201cdirecting Respondents to disregard the bids as opened, and to advertise and receive separate and distinct proposals for the furnishing of materials and doing the work on\u201d the renovations. Relators\u2019 true objects are a prohibitory injunction and declaratory judgment, neither of which the court has jurisdiction to grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Accordingly, because relators seek relief the court cannot constitutionally give,</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss be, and the same is hereby, granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the court that this cause be, and the same is hereby, dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b800-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright and H.
