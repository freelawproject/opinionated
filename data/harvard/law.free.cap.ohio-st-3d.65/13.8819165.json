She does, however, contest the appellate ruling that Leadbetter is not a \u201cworkshop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u201cWorkshop\u201d has not been defined administratively, statutorily or judicially by this court. The term, however, was interpreted by the appellate court below, citing <em>State ex rel. Koch v. Indus. Comm. </em>(Nov. 6, 1990), Franklin App. No. 89AP-867, unreported, 1990 WL 174011, as a \u201c \u2018room or place wherein power-driven machinery is employed and manual labor is exercised by way of trade for gain or otherwise.\u2019 \u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4 Ed.Rev.1968) 1781. Decrying this definition as too narrow, appellant claims that \u201cworkshop\u201d includes all places of employment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">Appellant relies heavily on R.C. 4121.13(A), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\u201cThe industrial commission shall * * * prescribe what * * * safety devices, safeguards, or other means or methods of protection are best adapted to render the <em>employees of every employment and place of employment </em>* * * safe, and to protect their welfare. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">This mandate is codified in the commission resolution preceding adoption of Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5 in 1977:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">\u201c * * * [Sjpecific requirements herein are formulated, compiled and issued in accordance with Chapters 4101, 4121, 4123 and 119 of the Revised Code of the State of Ohio, authorizing the Industrial Commission of Ohio to make, adopt and publish safety orders, rules and regulations and to prescribe what safety devices, safeguards, or other means that are best adapted for the reasonable protection <em>of employees in every place of employment </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">Appellant proposes that when the Industrial Commission safety code is viewed in its entirety, \u201cworkshop\u201d and \u201cevery place of employment\u201d are indistinguishable. Appellant points to the other eight Administrative Code chapters, which are very specific, governing, for example, steel mills (Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-9), laundering and dry cleaning (Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-11), rubber and plastic industries (Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-13), and window cleaning (Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-17). Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>cause these chapters are so narrow, appellant reasons that Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5 must encompass all employers in order to satisfy R.C. 4121.13\u2019s mandate to protect \u201cemployees of every employment and place of employment.\u201d This contention fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">First, appellant\u2019s reliance on Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:l-5\u2019s prefatory resolution is misplaced since identical language also precedes the adoption of Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-3 in 1979. Applied conversely, appellant\u2019s theory would mandate that \u201cconstruction activity\u201d also encompasses all places of employment. However, Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-3-01(A) elaborately defines those industries falling thereunder and it clearly does not include every type of employer. Thus, appellant cannot equate \u201cworkshop\u201d with \u201cevery place of employment\u201d on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Second, appellant\u2019s position implies that without specific safety requirements covering every conceivable place of employment, the commission neglects its duty to protect \u201cemployees of every place of employment.\u201d It also suggests that absent specific safety requirements, an employer has no duty to provide a safe work environment. These assertions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">R.C. 4101.11 reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u201cEvery employer shall furnish employment which is safe for the employees engaged therein, * * * shall furnish and use safety devices and safeguards, shall adopt and use methods and processes, follow and obey orders, and prescribe hours of labor reasonably adequate to render such employment and places of employment safe, and shall do every other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, safety, and welfare of such employees * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Similarly, R.C. 4101.12 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\u201cNo employer shall require, permit, or suffer any employee to go or be in any employment or place of employment which is not safe, and no such employer shall fail to furnish, provide, and use safety devices and safeguards, or fail to obey and follow orders or to adopt and use methods and processes reasonably adequate to render such employment and place of employment safe. No employer shall fail to do every other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, safety, and welfare of such employees * * *. No such employer or other person shall construct, occupy, or maintain any place of employment that is not safe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">These statutes instruct an employer to provide a safe workplace irrespective of any specific regulations promulgated by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">A VSSR is an employer penalty and must be strictly construed in the employer\u2019s favor. <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216, 1219. It must also be specific enough to \u201c \u2018plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>* * * apprise an employer of his legal obligations towards his employees.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Frank Brown &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 162, 163, 524 N.E.2d 482, 484. It thus follows that an employer should not have to speculate as to whether it falls within the class of employers to whom a specific safety requirement applies. Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1\u2014 5\u2019s reference to \u201cworkshops and factories\u201d does not make it apparent that <em>all </em>employers and places of employment fall thereunder. Had the commission intended Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5 to encompass all employers and places of employment, it would presumably have used that very language.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
