Sandusky Cement Prod. Co. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 601, 597 N.E.2d 474, we announced that \u201closs of enjoyment of life\u201d damages when considered in the form of the \u201closs of ability to perform the plaintiffs usual functions\u201d may be separately compensable under certain circumstances and limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In the present case plaintiff-appellee Rachel Leah Ramos was injured while in \u00fatero or at birth by the negligence of her physician and hospital staff. The jury awarded two separate items of damages, among other damages, which are of special concern here. Specifically, the interrogatories returned by the jury that are pertinent to appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law are:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u201c3. Verdict in favor of Rachel Ramos for past and future pain, suffering and <em>disability </em>in the amount of $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u201c4. Verdict in favor of Rachel Ramos for loss of normal enjoyment of life in the amount of $250,000.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See Interrogatory Regarding Breakdown of Verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">In reviewing the two interrogatories above, we conclude that they conflict, in part, with our recent opinion in <em>Fantozzi. </em>In <em>Fantozzi, </em>we observed that the \u201closs of ability to perform the plaintiff\u2019s usual functions\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>loss of enjoyment of life) damages can be categorized as either \u201cbasic\u201d or \u201chedonic\u201d in form. \u201cBasic losses\u201d or disability losses include the inability to perform the basic mechanical body movements of walking, climbing stairs, feeding oneself, and driving a car. 64 Ohio St.3d at 614-615, 597 N.E.2d at 484-485. \u201cHedonic losses\u201d include the inability to perform the plaintiff\u2019s usual specific activities which had given pleasure to this particular plaintiff, such as playing golf, dancing, bowling, playing musical instruments, and engaging in specific outdoor sports. <em>Id. </em>at 617, 597 N.E.2d at 486. The conflict in the jury interrogatories submitted in this case occurs because appellee Rachel Ramos is provided with <em>separate </em>recoveries for \u201cbasic losses\u201d and \u201chedonic losses.\u201d Specifically, the jury awarded separate damages for \u201cpast and future pain, suffering and disability [which are considered basic losses such as the ability to walk] * * *,\u201d along with damages for \u201closs of normal enjoyment of life [hedonic losses] * * As we stated in <em>Fantozzi:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u201cOur intent is that the trial court shall henceforth instruct the jury that if it awards damages for loss of ability to perform usual activities <em>(which will also encompass the permanency of the disability </em>suffered), the jury must not award additional damages for that same loss when considering any other element of damages, <em>such as physical and mental pain and suffering, as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>such additional award would be </em>duplicative.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 618, 597 N.E.2d at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Thus, in this case the jury improperly awarded appellee Rachel Ramos separate recoveries for \u201cbasic losses\u201d and \u201chedonic losses.\u201d Clearly, appellee is entitled to her \u201cbasic losses\u201d awarded under the jury\u2019s third interrogatory. However, appellee is not entitled to \u201chedonic losses\u201d awarded under the jury\u2019s fourth interrogatory, since she was injured either in \u00fatero or at birth. This result is premised on the fact that a newborn cannot suffer \u201chedonic\u201d damages, since he or she has not had adequate time to develop an ability to perform a pleasurable activity or hobby specifically identified to his or her lifestyle (for example, dancing).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Accordingly, in light of our analysis in <em>Fantozzi v. Sandusky Cement Prod. Co., supra, </em>we vacate the portion of the award given to appellee Rachel Ramos for loss of normal enjoyment of life, $250,000, since it duplicates, in part, damages already awarded for her disability and is improper given her age at the time of her injuries.</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b198-8\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
