The commissioner contends that the statute limits the exclusion of Subchapter S income to only that amount included in federal AGI and that double taxation does not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-17\">R.C. 5747.01(A) excludes from Ohio AGI only the amount of Subchapter S income included in federal AGI. Since the Eatons included only the net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>amount in federal AGI, netting income and losses from the two Subchapter S corporations for federal tax purposes, they may only exclude this net amount from Ohio AGI. See <em>Gibson v. Limbach </em>(Nov. 19, 1990), Trumbull App. No. 89-T-4270, unreported, 1990 WL 178944; compare <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Lindley </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 137, 140-142, 12 O.O.3d 158, 160-161, 389 N.E.2d 473, 475-476 (taxpayer may only deduct net foreign royalties from franchise tax income because only this amount was included in federal net income), and <em>Pancake House v. Lindley </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 151, 15 O.O.3d 180, 399 N.E.2d 1249 (taxpayer may only deduct net technical assistance fees from franchise tax income because only this amount was included in federal net income).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">As to the double-taxation argument, the Eatons failed to present the franchise tax returns for the two corporations to illustrate any double taxation. Thus, we have no factual basis on which to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the board because it is reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b459-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
