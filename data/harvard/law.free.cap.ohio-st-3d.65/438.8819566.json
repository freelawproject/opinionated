We agree and, for the reasons which follow, grant the commission\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">In <em>Ohio Contract Carriers Assn. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 160, 23 O.O. 369, 42 N.E.2d 758, syllabus, we held that \u201c[ajppeal lies only on behalf of a party aggrieved by the final order appealed from. Appeals are not allowed for the purpose of settling abstract questions, but only to correct errors injuriously affecting the appellant.\u201d We explained that a \u201cfinal order\u201d under former G.C. 544, now R.C. 4903.13, is one \u201caffecting a substantial right\u201d (see R.C. 2505.02; <em>Hall China Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>[1977], 50 Ohio St.2d 206, 4 O.O.3d 390, 364 N.E.2d 852), and characterized the interest necessary to create a substantial right as a \u201c \u2018present interest\u2019 \u201d and an \u201c \u2018immediate and pecuniary\u2019 \u201d interest. <em>Id., </em>140 Ohio St. at 161-162, 23 O.O. at 369-370, 42 N.E.2d at 759. Accord <em>East Ohio Gas Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 295, 530 N.E.2d 875, wherein we also recognized that an order may be final as to one party but not to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">The orders complained of in this proceeding did not authorize Ohio Bell to implement the services proposed, but made implementation contingent upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>its willingness to accept the terms and conditions imposed by the commission. This acceptance was to be manifested by the filing of revised applications. Because the revised filings have not been made or approved in this proceeding, Ohio Bell does not have the authority to provide the proposed services and ODVN\u2019s present and immediate interests have not been affected. Clearly, if we were to decide the merits of the commission\u2019s orders on the basis of the record before us, we would be rendering the type of advisory opinion which we found improper in <em>Ohio Contract Carriers Assn. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the orders complained of did not affect ODYN\u2019s substantial rights, that the order is not final and appealable as to ODVN, and that ODVN lacks standing to bring this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b592-6\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
