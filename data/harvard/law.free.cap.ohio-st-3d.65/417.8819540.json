For the reasons that follow, we find that the commission\u2019s orders are supported by some evidence and are in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The commission\u2019s orders pertaining to the allowance of benefits for impaired earning capacity referred to the medical reports of a \u201cDr. Steiman.\u201d However, no such reports are contained in the record. Rather, the only medical reports which appear in the record are those of Drs. Kackley, McCloud and Hubbell. The reports of these three doctors were referred to in the commission\u2019s earlier orders determining the percentage of permanent partial disability. Given the commission\u2019s reliance on the reports of these three doctors in its earlier determinations, and the fact that the record contains no reports of a \u201cDr. Steiman,\u201d we are convinced that the commission\u2019s references to \u201cDr. Steiman\u201d in its orders awarding compensation for impaired earning capacity were inadvertent errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">A <em>cursory </em>review of the materials <em>in the record </em>shows that there was sufficient evidence (some evidence) on which the commission could properly rely in determining that Bowman was entitled to compensation for a thirty-six percent impairment of earning capacity, to which each claim contributed. The evidence also supports the commission\u2019s determination to allocate the total impairment between the two <em>separate </em>claims, which arose from distinct physical injuries, and we find no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>In <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 483-484, 6 OBR 531, 533-534, 453 N.E.2d 721, 724, and a number of other cases, we have stressed the importance of specificity of commission orders and have required that such orders contain a citation to the evidence relied upon and a brief explanation of the decision granting or denying benefits. In <em>Mitchell, </em>we stated that \u201cthis court will no longer search the commission\u2019s file for \u2018some evidence\u2019 to support an order of the commission not otherwise specified as a basis for its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 6 OBR at 534, 453 N.E.2d at 724. Our decision today does not represent a departure from the general rule of <em>Mitchell </em>and its progeny. Rather, we emphasize that, in the case at bar, the commission\u2019s citations to the reports of Dr. Steiman were clearly mistakes (perhaps clerical errors) and that a mere <em>cursory </em>examination of the record supports the commission\u2019s orders granting Bowman benefits for impaired earning. On these facts, we uphold the commission\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the court of appeals granting a limited writ is reversed, and the orders of the Industrial Commission are reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, H.

The majority may be entirely correct that the Industrial Commission committed a \u201cclerical error\u201d in relying on a doctor\u2019s report that does not appear in the record. Nevertheless, I must agree with the court of appeals that it is the commission\u2019s responsibility, not the reviewing court\u2019s, to correct this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">The majority states that the issue is \u201cwhether there is some evidence to support the commission\u2019s orders awarding compensation.\u201d While this is the proper standard of review, I believe that there is a predicate issue which must be reached before we consider whether \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the commission\u2019s decision. That issue is whether the commission sufficiently specified the evidence upon which it relied in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">In <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721, and <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245, we held that the commission <em>must </em>\u201cspecifically state what evidence has been relied upon, and briefly explain the reasoning for its decision.\u201d <em>Noll, supra, </em>syllabus. The commission must to do this because it is emphatically not the reviewing court\u2019s responsibility to search the record for evidence. <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 484, 6 OBR at 534, 453 N.E.2d at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>In this case we have a situation in which the commission did not state with specificity the evidence of record upon which it relied. The commission affirmed orders issued by the district hearing officer which were based on medical reports filed by Dr. Steiman. The record, however, does not contain any reports by a Dr. Steiman. Therefore the commission cannot logically be said to have stated the evidentiary basis for its decision \u2014 its decision had to have been based on other, unspecified, evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">It is not the role of the courts to search the record for evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision. The reviewing court is only to examine the record to see that the evidence cited by the commission supports its decision. Sound policy limits the participation of the courts in the workers\u2019 compensation system to questions of law. Moreover, requiring the courts to examine the record in detail places too onerous a burden on the judiciary. In this instance a \u201ccursory\u201d examination of the record may well have revealed to the majority \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s decision. Future cases, however, will not be so effortless.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">I would affirm the court of appeals. In a case in which the reviewing court finds that the evidence relied upon by the commission does not exist in the record, the court should issue a writ ordering the commission to state with specificity the evidence upon which it actually relied. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b573-6\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
