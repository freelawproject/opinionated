Scherbarth </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 270, 28 OBR 346, 503 N.E.2d 717, when that statute was applied against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>minor. Relators further contend that on August 13, 1986, this court in <em>Moldovan v. Cuyahoga Cty. Welfare Dept. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 293, 25 OBR 343, 496 N.E.2d 466, held the failure to give a party reasonable notice of a judgment when the name and address of that party are known was \u201ca denial of the right to legal redress of injuries created by Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 296, 28 OBR at 345-346, 496 N.E.2d at 468, and constitutes a denial of the party\u2019s right to perfect an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Respondent\u2019s position is summarized by his statement: \u201cAppellant\u2019s plain and adequate remedy in this case was to file a Rule 60(B) motion and, if overruled, to file an appeal therefrom. No such motion was ever filed. No such appeal was filed.\u201d Respondent also points out that at the time of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion for summary judgment, July 12, 1984, the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure did not require specific notification of the filing of judgment entries to the parties, other than the notice which occurs when the entry is actually journalized and docketed with the clerk of courts. See <em>Town &amp; Country Drive-In Shopping Centers, Inc. v. Abraham </em>(1975), 46 Ohio App.2d 262, 75 O.O.2d 416, 348 N.E.2d 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We agree with respondent. Plaintiff in the underlying malpractice action did not file a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of August 17,1984, or the judgment of January 26, 1987. Nor did plaintiff ever file a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment. Instead, she followed a pattern of inappropriate, untimely responses. On July 20,1984, she received the proposed entry resulting from the July 12, 1984 trial court ruling. On August 15, 1984, defendant\u2019s attorney forwarded his signed copy of the proposed entry to the trial court, which journalized it on August 17, 1984. More than thirty days later, plaintiff\u2019s attorney learned that the entry had been journalized, but took no action until August 15, 1985. At that time, instead of filing a Civ.R. 60(B) motion, he \u201cinvented\u201d a motion to amend the judgment entry. Moreover, plaintiff waited more than three and one-half years after the trial court overruled her motion to amend to file a notice of appeal from the August 17, 1984 decision. This appeal was ultimately dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Accordingly, respondent had no duty to amend the 1984 judgment in 1990, when relators filed their mandamus action. The judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b551-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
