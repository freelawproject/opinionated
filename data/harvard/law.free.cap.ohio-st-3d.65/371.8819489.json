A \u201clien creditor\u201d is defined as \u201ca creditor who has acquired a lien on the property involved by attachment, levy or the like.\u201d R.C. 1309.20(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">If the Behms\u2019 equipment was equipment used in farming operations, Buckeye had perfected its security interest and had the first priority to the $27,947 in sale proceeds. If the Behms\u2019 turkey processing equipment was not used in farming operations, Buckeye\u2019s security interest was not perfected and Tiffin had the first priority lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The court of appeals held that there was an insufficient nexus between the turkey processing equipment and the farming operations to allow classifying the equipment as farm equipment. The court held that \u201csubjecting a live turkey to a manufacturing process causes it to lose its status as a farm product.\u201d The court noted that the machinery which made this transformation was not farm equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The Uniform Commercial Code provides no definition of \u201cfarming operations,\u201d although it does define \u201cfarm products.\u201d R.C. 1309.07(C) (UCC 9-109) states that goods are</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">\u201c \u2018farm products\u2019 if they are crops or livestock or supplies used or produced in farming operations or if they are products of crops or livestock in the <em>unmanufactured states, </em>such as ginned cotton, wool-clip, maple syrup, milk, and eggs, and if they are in the possession of a debtor engaged in raising, fattening, grazing, or other farming operations. If goods are farm products they are neither equipment nor inventory.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Official Comment 4 to UCC 9-109 (R.C. 1309.07) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">\u201cGoods are \u2018farm products\u2019 only if they are in the possession of a debtor engaged in farming operations. Animals in a herd of livestock are covered whether they are acquired by purchase or result from natural increase. <em>Products of crops or livestock remain farm products so long as they are in the possession of a debtor engaged in farming operations and have not been subjected to a manufacturing process. </em>The terms \u2018crops,\u2019 \u2018livestock\u2019 and \u2018farming operations\u2019 are not defined; however, it is obvious from the text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>that \u2018farming operations\u2019 includes raising livestock as well as crops; similarly, since eggs are products of livestock, livestock includes fowl.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201cWhen crops or livestock or their products come into the possession of a person not engaged in farming operations they cease to be \u2018farm products.\u2019 If they come into the possession of a marketing agency for sale or distribution or of a manufacturer or processor as raw materials, they become inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u201cProducts of crops or livestock, even though they remain in the possession of a person engaged in farming operations, lose their status as farm products if they are subject to a manufacturing process. What is and what is not a manufacturing operation is not determined by this Article [R.C. Chapter 1309]. At one end of the scale some processes are so closely connected with farming \u2014 such as pasteurizing milk or boiling sap to produce maple syrup or maple sugar \u2014 that they would not rank as manufacturing. On the other hand an extensive canning operation would be manufacturing. The line is one for the courts to draw. After farm products have been subjected to a manufacturing operation, they become inventory if held for sale.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In the case of <em>In re Anderson </em>(Bankr.Ct.N.D.Ohio 1969), 6 U.C.C.Rep.Serv. 1284, the court found that a credit association\u2019s security interest in poultry equipment used in the mass production of chicken eggs by a debtor who sold the eggs to a jobber and who did not consider himself engaged in farming was properly perfected by filing in the county of the debtor\u2019s residence pursuant to former R.C. 1309.38(A)(1), now (A)(2), since the collateral was \u201cequipment used in farming operations\u201d within the meaning of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The court found that the poultry equipment was equipment used in the mass production of chicken eggs and that, because of the statute\u2019s ambiguity, the courts must approach the interpretation of the facts on a functional basis. The court determined that R.C. 1309.07 and 1309.38, read <em>in pari materia, </em>\u201cwould seem to indicate that any business operation which results in the production of \u2018farm products\u2019 is \u2018farming,\u2019 even though the business operation is performed in a factory.\u201d The court found that since eggs are \u201cfarm products\u201d as defined in R.C. 1309.07, the equipment used to produce them is necessarily used in farming operations within the purview of R.C. 1309.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">In the case of <em>In re K.L. Smith Enterprises, Ltd. </em>(Bankr.Ct.D.Colo.1980), 2 B.R. 280, the debtor bankrupt owned and operated an egg laying and processing business. The debtor sold the eggs to grocery stores. After the debtor\u2019s chickens laid their eggs, the eggs were washed, candled and oiled. The eggs were then boxed in the debtor\u2019s operations. The court concluded that the eggs were farm products and not inventory. The court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">\u201cThe pasteurization of milk or the boiling of sap seem[s] to the Court to be even more significant treatment of raw product than [do] the washing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>candling, and spraying with oil of eggs. At the very least, they are in the same category, and the internal structure of the egg is not changed. The packaging of eggs in cartons does not seem to this Court to be analogous to the \u2018extensive canning operations\u2019 characterized by the Official Comment. Nearly all farm products must be packaged in some way for delivery to the farmer\u2019s customer. <em>The facts that the packaging is done in the customer\u2019s package to eliminate a step in handling or that the operation is highly mechanized do not seem to this Court to disqualify the operation from the normal farm category. </em>The language of the Code seems reasonably specific in its determination of what are farm products and does not appear to distinguish between the methods of producing the same product.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In <em>Albion Natl. Bank v. Farmers Cooperative Assn. of St. Edward </em>(1988), 228 Neb. 258, 422 N.W.2d 86, the Nebraska Supreme Court held that corn that had gone through a drying process remained a farm product and had not been subjected to a manufacturing process within the meaning of Neb.Rev.Stat. UCC \u00a7 9-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In <em>In re Blease </em>(D.C.N.J.1978), 24 U.C.C.Rep.Serv. 450, the court used the New Jersey equivalent of R.C. 1309.07(C), defining \u201cfarm products,\u201d to determine the status of a corn dryer purchased by a farmer but located away from the farm at a grain elevator site in an industrial park. The court ruled that the drying of grain is a farming operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">As a result of the ambiguity of the term \u201cequipment used in farming operations,\u201d courts have devised a number of tests to determine whether the collateral is properly classified as equipment used in farming operations. One such test is the \u201cnormal use\u201d test, which focuses on the inherent qualities of the collateral and the uses to which that type of collateral would normally be put. The leading case advocating the normal use test is <em>Sequoia Machinery, Inc. v. Jarrett </em>(C.A.9, 1969), 410 F.2d 1116. In that case, the court held that harvesting combines used by the bankrupt in custom harvesting operations, although the bankrupt was not a farmer, constituted \u201cequipment used in farming operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">In the case of <em>In re Burgess </em>(Bankr.Ct.W.D.Okla.1983), 30 B.R. 364, the court found that tractors and plows owned by the operator of a diesel repair service were \u201cequipment used in farming operations,\u201d since tractors and plows are normally used in that manner. The court noted that the rule \u201crests upon a predictable approach to filing regarding equipment and other items generally associated with farming operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366. The court noted that such a rule relieves the creditor of the burden of monitoring how the collateral is actually used.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>In contrast, in the case of <em>In re Reier </em>(Bankr.Ct.S.D.Ohio 1985), 53 B.R. 395, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio agreed with the majority of courts that it is the actual use of the equipment which is controlling and not its intrinsic or potential nature. In <em>Reier </em>the debtor\u2019s business was reselling trailers and building flatbed trailers, horse trailers, farm equipment, and other trailers for the purpose of transporting livestock. The loan was made to the debtor by the bank so that the debtor could purchase the trailers for display at a county fair. The debtor, Reier, was not a farmer. The bank did not comply with the dual filing requirements of R.C. 1309.38(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The bank urged the court to apply the \u201cnormal use\u201d test, arguing that such trailers would normally be used in farming operations, although admittedly Reier\u2019s were used for display or business purposes. The court noted the following, <em>id. </em>at 398:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u201cWithout an extensive discussion of the \u2018normal use\u2019 test, this court merely notes that the <em>Burgess </em>decision is at this time a distinctly minority opinion and this court is not prepared to state unequivocally that stock trailers are \u2018normally\u2019 used in farming operations. Such trailers are frequently used to transport animals in connection with a variety of operations not directly associated with farming. In addition, it appears sufficiently difficult for creditors to discern intended or actual uses of collateral, without imposing the necessity of divining what might be considered the \u2018normal\u2019 use of collateral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Buckeye argues that the lower courts erred in this case when they used one category of collateral under R.C. 1309.38(A)(2) to define another. In other words, Buckeye argues that it was error to define \u201cequipment used in farming operations\u201d by examining the definition of \u201cfarm products,\u201d since \u201cfarm products\u201d is itself a separate category of collateral under the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Since the legislature did not define \u201cequipment used in farming operations,\u201d it is reasonable to examine whether the debtor\u2019s equipment that is claimed to be \u201cequipment used in farming operations\u201d is used in some manner to produce a farm product. The purpose of any farming operation is to produce farm products. Whether the court uses the \u201cnormal use\u201d test or the \u201cactual use\u201d test, we agree with the court of appeals that the Behms\u2019 turkey processing equipment used to manufacture turkey wieners was not equipment used in farming operations, but equipment used in a manufacturing process, and that dual filing under R.C. 1309.38(A)(4) was necessary to perfect a valid security interest in the equipment. The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b530-4\">James A.
