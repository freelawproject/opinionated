No Ohio appellate court has ever recognized a workers\u2019 compensation claim for mental injury or mental disease caused solely by job-related stress which is unaccompanied by physical injury or occupational disease. In the absence of a clear mandate from the General Assembly that these claims are now recognized in Ohio, we decline to expand coverage of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Other state supreme courts faced with the question whether mental conditions caused solely by work-related stress are compensable under workers\u2019 compensation statutes have reached the same conclusion we do today.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notably, the Minnesota Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201cIn the absence of proof that the legislature considered the far-reaching ramifications of extending workers\u2019 compensation coverage to employees who are mentally disabled by employment-related stress, we decline to construe the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in a manner probably not intended by that body. * * * [T]he issue raised in this case involves a policy determination which we believe should be presented to the legislature as the appropriate policy-making body. If it wishes to extend workers\u2019 compensation coverage to mental disability caused by work-related mental stress without physical trauma, it is free to articulate that intent clearly. In the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent on the issue, however, we will not hold such disability to be compensable.\u201d <em>Lockwood v. Independent School Dist. No. 877 </em>(Minn.1981), 312 N.W.2d 924, 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Rambaldo\u2019s Claim Under Former R.C. 4123.68(BB)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">A workers\u2019 compensation claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits is determined by the statutes in effect at the time of the injury. <em>State ex rel. Kirk v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 360, 361, 25 OBR 411, 411-412, 496 N.E.2d 893, 895. At the time Rambaldo\u2019s disease was diagnosed and his disability began in September 1985, \u201coccupational disease\u201d was defined in R.C. 4123.68 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\u201cEvery employee who is disabled because of the contraction of an occupational disease as defined in this section * * * is entitled to * * * compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">\u201c(BB) All other occupational diseases: A disease peculiar to a particular industrial process, trade, or occupation and to which an employee is not ordinarily subjected or exposed outside of or away from his employment.\u201d Am.H.B. No. 1282, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3934, 3954, 3960, eff. January 1, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">No workers\u2019 compensation claim for a psychological condition, whether the condition was denominated as a disease or an injury, has been recognized by this court when the mental disease or injury was based solely on job-related stress. Compensation has been allowed for a worker who is disabled by a mental condition which was the result of a compensable work-related <em>physical </em>injury. <em>State ex rel. Anderson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 166, 16 O.O.3d 199, 404 N.E.2d 153. Coverage has also been extended to a worker who suffers a <em>physical </em>injury which was the consequence of work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>mental stress. <em>Ryan v. Connor </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 406, 28 OBR 462, 503 N.E.2d 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Although we have never previously addressed the question of whether a mental condition caused solely by job-related stress is compensable, as either an injury or an occupational disease, a number of courts of appeals have addressed the question of whether such a condition is compensable as an injury. Prior to 1986, \u201cinjury\u201d was defined in R.C. 4123.01(C) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AJO\">\u201c \u2018Injury\u2019 includes any injury, whether caused by external accidental means or accidental in character and result, received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d Am.Sub.H.B. No. 340, 140 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3481, 3485, eff. October 13, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Despite this broad definition of \u201cinjury,\u201d the courts of appeals unanimously concluded that such a claim was not covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The reasoning of the case authority denying coverage of mental conditions as injuries under the broad language of R.C. 4123.01(C) prior to 1986 leads to the conclusion that mental conditions also were not covered as occupational diseases. Absent clear legislative intent, there is no logical reason to include as occupational diseases mental conditions caused solely by job-related stress when such conditions are excluded from coverage as injuries. Our holding in <em>Ryan, supra, </em>did not remove the requirement that there be a physical injury in order to receive compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Therefore, Rambaldo\u2019s mental condition caused solely by job-related stress is not compensable as an occupational disease under former R.C. 4123.68(BB).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Rini\u2019s Claim Under Current R.C. 4123.68</p>\n<p id=\"AzD\">Rini\u2019s disease was diagnosed in October 1986 and he stopped work as a fire fighter in September 1987. The General Assembly last amended the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>of \u201coccupational disease\u201d effective August 22, 1986. R.C. 4123.68 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u201cAs used in this section and Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code, \u2018occupational disease\u2019 means a disease contracted in the course of employment, which by its causes and the characteristics of its manifestation or the condition of the employment results in a hazard which distinguishes the employment in character from employment generally, and the employment creates a risk of contracting the disease in greater degree and in a different manner than the public in general.\u201d Am.Sub.S.B. No. 307, 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 718, 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">At the same time, the General Assembly changed the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d in R.C. 4123.01(C) to its current version:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u201c(C) \u2018Injury\u2019 includes any injury, whether caused by external accidental means or accidental in character and result, received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment. \u2018Injury\u2019 does not include: \u201c(1) Psychiatric conditions except where the conditions have arisen from an injury or occupational disease[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Rini argues that because the definition of \u201coccupational disease\u201d in R.C. 4123.68 does not expressly limit psychiatric conditions as does the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d in R.C. 4123.01(C)(1), psychiatric conditions are compensable as occupational diseases under R.C. 4123.68. We are not persuaded that this was the intention of the General Assembly when the 1986 amendments are considered in the context of the administrative and judicial decisions at that time. The court must consider the context of the 1986 amendments because \u201ca legislative body in enacting amendments is presumed to have in mind prior judicial constructions of the section.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Huron Cty. Bd. of Edn. v. Howard </em>(1957), 167 Ohio St. 93, 96, 4 O.O.2d 83, 84, 146 N.E.2d 604, 607. We also presume that the General Assembly had in mind prior administrative constructions of the statutory sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">By the time of the 1986 amendments there had been two developments which involved constructions of R.C. 4123.68(BB)- and R.C. 4123.01(C). First, this court had defined the criteria necessary to show whether a claimant had contracted a nonscheduled occupational disease under R.C. 4123.68(BB). <em>State ex rel. Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Krise </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 247, 71 O.O.2d 226, 327 N.E.2d 756. Second, the commission had denied claims which raised the issue of whether claimants\u2019 psychological conditions caused by job-related emotional stress were compensable as injuries under R.C. 4123.01(C).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>fore, the General Assembly knew that the issue of whether this type of claim was compensable was being raised in the context of injury claims under R.C. 4123.01(C).* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In light of the larger context within which the General Assembly made the 1986 amendments to the definitions of \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201coccupational disease,\u201d it is clear that the General Assembly was codifying the developed administrative and judicial decisions. In the amendment to the definition of \u201cinjury,\u201d the General Assembly confirmed the commission\u2019s decisions disallowing mental injury claims based solely on mental job-related stress. In the amendment to the definition of \u201coccupational disease,\u201d the General Assembly incorporated this court\u2019s criteria for determining nonscheduled occupational diseases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We conclude that by specifically excluding claims for mental conditions based solely on job-related stress from the definition of \u201cinjury,\u201d the General Assembly intended that this type of claim not be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, whether it is denominated as an injury claim or an occupational disease claim. We agree with Judge Krupansky\u2019s dissenting opinion below that denominating a claim as an injury or as an occupational disease is a distinction without a difference for the purpose of discerning the General Assembly\u2019s intentions. In the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent to recognize mental conditions caused by job-related stress as occupational diseases, we hold that such conditions are not compensable as occupational diseases under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Rini\u2019s mental condition caused solely by job-related stress is not compensable as an occupational disease under R.C. 4123.68, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In reaching this conclusion we recognize that mental illness, like alcoholism, is a disease and we in no way diminish its seriousness. Nor do we imply that such diseases cannot be contracted from job-related stress. The problem is whether such mental diseases are to be compensated under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and, if so, discerning which occupations cause stress-related mental problems. This is a public-policy issue which should be addressed by the General Assembly, perhaps by granting rule-making authority to the Industrial Commission. It is not a problem which should be addressed by this court in a sweeping public-policy statement. It may well be that certain occupations pose particular mental health problems for workers; air traffic controllers and police undercover officers immediately come to mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">However, it is the General Assembly which must address this problem and we encourage it to do so. It is the General Assembly which is charged with sole authority to determine workers\u2019 compensation coverage under Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution. It is the General Assembly which has the ability to conduct hearings, elicit expert opinions and consider the effects of extending such coverage on the resources available to compensate all injured workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">For the foregoing reasons we reverse the judgments of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgments of the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b440-9\">Moyer, C.J., and H.

Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGSs\">concurring. While I agree with the majority\u2019s decision, I want, especially, to highlight the history behind the 1986 amendments to R.C. Chapter 4123. This background establishes that the legislature did not intend to include purely psychiatric conditions in the definition of \u201coccupational disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is a legislative grant. The court cannot replace the legislature\u2019s views with its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>As the majority points out, the first efforts to make a purely psychiatric claim compensable were through former R.C. 4123.01(C). In response, the legislature amended the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d to specifically exclude purely psychiatric claims. Although the definition of \u201coccupational disease\u201d was amended at the same time, there was no reason to include a specific exemption for purely psychiatric claims because, administratively and judicially, they were not being classed as occupational diseases. Given this legislative history (which is unique to Ohio), I am not much persuaded by a head count of our sister states, dividing them into those who do and those who do not compensate job-caused mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">As the majority states, prior to the 1986 amendments psychiatric claims were not filed as occupational diseases. Presumably the legislature knew this. We are not free, by a stroke of the judicial pen, to compensate that which the legislature has specifically excluded from compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">I wish the legislative history and the statutes before us did not so clearly preclude compensation for mental disability where there is no physical disability. Mental disability is real. It can be more disabling than many physical injuries and occupational diseases which are now compensated. Who, for example, believes that a carry-out clerk who suffers mental disability from being threatened, perhaps shot at and missed by a robber, should not be compensated?</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The range of mental disability is vast. That range could include the worker who suffers headaches (or stress) as a consequence of having to perform work against a deadline. Such claims, many would argue, should not be compensated. If the full range of work-related stress is to be compensated, a staggering burden could be imposed upon the State Insurance Fund and the rates which would be assessed against employers. The criteria for compensating work-related psychiatric disabilities should be established by the General Assembly. In that body, the public policy considerations which underlie this complex subject can be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">I am uncomfortable with today\u2019s decision, though I believe it the one we must make, given the statutes and the legislative history. I am uncomfortable because our decision may result in denying compensation to those who should (as a matter of public policy) be compensated. Nearly everyone, I believe, would agree that some work-related mental disabilities should be compensated, even if there is no physical injury. Though it is for the legislature to establish the criteria, my hope is that this important issue can be addressed promptly and thoughtfully.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
