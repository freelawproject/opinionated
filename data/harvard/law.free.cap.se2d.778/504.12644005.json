McCLANAHAN.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Jose Cristino Velasquez-Lopez appeals the circuit court's order dismissing his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Velasquez-Lopez contends the circuit court erred in ruling that his counsel was not deficient for failing to file a petition for appeal on his behalf. Holding there was no such error, we will affirm the decision of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Criminal Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Velasquez-Lopez was indicted on 33 counts of taking indecent liberties with a child, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. Catherine Lea was appointed to represent Velasquez-Lopez, a native of El Salvador who does not speak English. She communicated with him through the aid of a court-appointed interpreter who was fluent in the Spanish language. Due to Lea's concerns regarding Velasquez-Lopez's mental competency and difficulty with the English language, the Commonwealth and Velasquez-Lopez submitted expert opinions to the circuit court regarding his mental status. After hearing evidence, the circuit court ruled that Velasquez-Lopez \"suffers from no mental deficits\" and \"no indication of any disability in terms of his ability to process information.\" In light of Velasquez-Lopez's difficulty with the English language, however, the circuit court directed counsel and the interpreter to meet with Velasquez-Lopez for up to ten additional hours, which they did. Subsequently, Velasquez-Lopez pled guilty to all 33 counts. The circuit court sentenced him to a term of 156 years' imprisonment, with all but 18 years suspended, and entered final judgment on September 21, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the sentencing hearing, Velasquez-Lopez sent a hand-written letter to the circuit court stating he felt his \"lawyer did not do her job,\" listing various complaints regarding counsel's performance, and asking for a reduction in his sentence. The circuit court treated the correspondence as a motion to reduce the sentence\n   and denied the motion by order dated September 30. By letter to the circuit court dated October 4, Velasquez-Lopez asked that his case be \"re-opened\" stating that \"the lawyer [his] brothers got can work on the case.\" He told the circuit court that he \"was not comfortable with [his] lawyer,\" believed \"the lawyer [his] brothers got can help [him] better,\" and that \"[his]\n   brothers tell [him] that the lawyer they got can help me only if the case is re-opened.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lea filed a notice of appeal on behalf of Velasquez-Lopez on October 7, 2010. The Court of Appeals dismissed his case on January 28, 2011, for failure to file a petition for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B. Habeas Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Velasquez-Lopez filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus against Harold Clarke, the Director of the Department of Corrections. He alleged he \"was deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment\" because his counsel failed to \"prosecute\" his appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clarke filed a motion to dismiss asserting that counsel for Velasquez-Lopez was not deficient for failing to file a petition for appeal because Velasquez-Lopez informed his counsel that he had obtained new counsel who would file his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At an evidentiary hearing conducted by the circuit court on the habeas application, Velasquez-Lopez testified that after his sentencing, he spoke to Lea and asked her to \"reopen\" his case, which she agreed to do. Although Velasquez-Lopez denied telling Lea not to file an appeal, he testified that he informed Lea \"to keep [his case] open so that I can have another attorney help me.\" Velasquez-Lopez stated he wrote to Lea and asked her to make his file available to new counsel. He testified that he never gave Lea the name of new counsel and, in fact, did not have new counsel at that time or believe that his brothers had obtained new counsel for him at that time. Although Velasquez-Lopez testified he wanted a different result in his case, he stated repeatedly he did not want Lea to change the result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lea testified she received a letter from Velasquez-Lopez dated October 4, 2010, in which he informed Lea that he did \"not feel satisfied with her work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the letter, Velasquez-Lopez stated that his \"brothers want to do something better for me but I would like to ask you if you could re-open the case. They want to appeal my case but we need you to open the case so that another attorney can do something for me.\" Lea testified that upon receipt of the letter, she visited Velasquez-Lopez at the Culpeper County jail on October 6, 2010, where he informed Lea that he did not want Lea to file an appeal for him. According to Lea, Velasquez-Lopez \"clearly told me he did not want me to work anymore on his case.\" She memorialized his instructions on the letter with the following note: \"10/6/10-visited JCV-L @ Culpeper Jail informed he did\n   <em>\n    NOT\n   </em>\n   want me to file appeal for him.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lea testified that on October 7, 2010, she received a telephone call from a brother of Velasquez-Lopez. She memorialized the conversation in her file with the following note: \"10/7/10-call from Mr. Mario Lopez, brother does want me to visit again &amp; file.\" Lea also made a notation of her review of the file on October 7 with her mentor attorney. Lea explained that she filed a notice of appeal for Velasquez-Lopez on that date because she was \"informed that they needed to preserve the time.\" Subsequent to filing the notice, Lea received a letter from Velasquez-Lopez, dated October 8, 2010, in which he asked Lea \"to give my new lawyer any paper work that he request[s].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lea testified she did not file a petition for appeal because Velasquez-Lopez informed her that he did not want her to handle the appeal and because both he and his brother informed her he had new counsel. As she explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [N]ot only did I have a discussion with Mr. Velasquez-Lopez that he did not want me to do the paper-work for the appeal document but first his brother and then he, himself, in writing informed me that he had an attorney for whom I was to prepare the file and he would get in contact with me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the hearing, the circuit court issued a letter ruling stating that it had \"fully considered the testimony of the witnesses\n   and the arguments of counsel\" and had \"observed the witnesses and their demeanor and made determinations as to their credibility.\" The circuit court found that Velasquez-Lopez \"had clear[ly] conveyed his wishes that he did not want [Lea] to file an [a]ppeal for him.\" Based on that finding, the circuit court ruled that Lea \"was not deficient for failing to file a [p]etition for [a]ppeal\" and therefore dismissed the petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Velasquez-Lopez contends the habeas court's finding that he \"had clear[ly] conveyed his wishes that he did not want [Lea] to file an [a]ppeal for him\" was plainly wrong. \"The factual findings of the [circuit court] in a habeas corpus hearing are presumed to be correct and will be upheld by us unless plainly wrong or unsupported by credible evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

First, a lawyer acts in a professionally unreasonable manner when the lawyer \"disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Roe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p477\">\n    528 U.S. at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p477\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is so because \"filing a notice of appeal is a purely ministerial task, and the failure to file reflects inattention to the defendant's wishes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, a lawyer may act in a professionally unreasonable manner when the lawyer fails to consult with the defendant regarding an appeal and there is a constitutionally-imposed duty to do so. A constitutional duty to consult may arise when \"a rational defendant would want to appeal (for example, because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal)\" or when \"this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 480,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p477\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Velasquez-Lopez seeks to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel based on the first scenario-that Lea failed to follow his instructions to file an appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Roe,\n   </em>\n   \"[c]ounsel performs in a professionally unreasonable manner\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   by failing to follow the defendant's\n   <em>\n    express instructions\n   </em>\n   with respect to an appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 478,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p477\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). On the other hand, \"a defendant who explicitly tells his attorney\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to file an appeal plainly cannot later complain that, by following his instructions, his counsel performed deficiently.\"\n   <em>\n    Roe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p477\">\n    528 U.S. at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p477\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We find no merit in Velasquez-Lopez's contention that the circuit court's finding of fact was plainly wrong. Velasquez-Lopez was required to prove his claim that Lea disregarded his instructions to prosecute his appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nolan v.

The circuit court heard testimony from both Velasquez-Lopez and Lea, considered the evidence presented, and found that no such instructions were given. To the contrary, the circuit court found that Velasquez-Lopez \"clear [ly] conveyed his wishes that he did not want [Lea] to file an [a]ppeal for him.\" There was credible evidence to support this finding. Lea testified that Velasquez-Lopez told her he did not want her to file the appeal for him. Velasquez-Lopez wrote letters to the circuit court and Lea stating that he was dissatisfied with Lea's assistance and that his brothers had retained a new attorney for him. Additionally, Velasquez-Lopez testified at the hearing that he only wanted Lea to \"reopen\" the case so another attorney could help him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Velasquez-Lopez argues that his difficulty with the English language and lack of comprehension of the criminal proceedings rendered his instructions to counsel unclear and that such ambiguity should be resolved in his favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We decline Velasquez-Lopez's invitation to depart from our standard of review and examine the evidence for ambiguities or inconsistencies. Velasquez-Lopez was provided with a court-appointed interpreter to address his difficulties with the English language. Furthermore, Lea testified that despite her initial concerns with Velasquez-Lopez's mental status, his understanding of the criminal process increased to the point that she was no longer concerned by the time he pled guilty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore,\n   we cannot say that the circuit court's finding was plainly wrong or unsupported by credible evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   III.

The initial evaluation concluded that Velasquez-Lopez was not competent to stand trial because he \"does not sufficiently understand the legal system at a factual level to allow him to participate with his attorney in his own defense.\" A second evaluation concluded that Velasquez-Lopez was competent to stand trial, noting that \"[w]here gaps in his knowledge exist, he has the capacity and the motivation to be informed/educated by a reliable authority, such as his attorney.\" After a competency hearing, the circuit court found that Velasquez-Lopez was competent, but directed that trial counsel meet with her client for up to ten hours in the presence of a Spanish language interpreter to educate Velasquez-Lopez about the factual deficits noted in the initial evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On June 10, 2010, Velasquez-Lopez pled guilty to all of the charges against him. He was sentenced on September 7, 2010 to 156 years of incarceration with all but 18 years suspended, plus three years of probation and 40 years of good behavior. An order reflecting the sentence was entered on September 21, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Velasquez-Lopez wrote his trial counsel from jail on October 4, 2010. The letter was written in Spanish and translated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The reason for this letter is to tell you that I do not feel satisfied with your work. My brothers want to do something better for me but I would like to ask you if you could reopen the case. They want to appeal my case but we need you to open the case so that another attorney can do something for me. At least so I could have less time to serve because I know that I will be deported, why deny me a second opportunity. I called you on Sunday, October 3rd so that you could come see me and on October 4th but you have not come. You know I am not okay with you [sic] work. One, I expected that my wife would testify in front of the Judge and that did not happen. Well I hope that you will come see me soon and I will explain whats [sic] to follow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Trial counsel visited Velasquez-Lopez in the jail on October 6, 2010. Her notes from the visit read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   visited JCV-L @ Culpeper Jail\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   informed he did\n   <em>\n    NOT\n   </em>\n   want me to file an appeal for him\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On October 7, 2010, the day after she visited Velasquez-Lopez in jail, trial counsel received a telephone call from her client's brother. The brother told her that they had a new attorney, but they wanted her to file the appeal. Trial counsel filed the notice of appeal required by Rule 5A:6 with the circuit court later that day. On October 8, 2010, Velasquez-Lopez sent trial counsel a letter (in English) that said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   I am writing you to let you know that I am giving you authorization to give my new lawyer any paper work [sic] that he request [sic]. I thank you for your time and concern on the matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In response, trial counsel prepared her file to be sent to her client's new attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Trial counsel took no further action in the case. She did not file a petition for appeal with the Court of Appeals as required by Rule 5A:12. No other attorney filed the petition for appeal on behalf of Velasquez-Lopez. Thus, Velasquez-Lopez's appeal was not perfected and the appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The majority places much emphasis on Velasquez-Lopez's instruction to his attorney not to file an appeal. In the majority's view, that instruction places him at the \"other end of the spectrum\" described by\n   <em>\n    Roe,\n   </em>\n   where \"a defendant who explicitly tells his attorney\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to file an appeal plainly cannot later complain that, by following his instructions, his counsel performed deficiently.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p477\">\n    528 U.S. at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p477\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, the habeas court's finding that Velasquez-Lopez \"had clear[ly] conveyed his wishes that he did not want [trial counsel] to file an [a]ppeal for him\" is plainly wrong and is unsupported by the evidence. Trial counsel was very much aware of Velasquez-Lopez's desire to appeal his conviction. She was also aware that when her client asked her to \"reopen\" his case, he meant \"appeal\" his conviction. Trial counsel testified at the evidentiary hearing on the habeas petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [Respondent's Counsel:] To your recollection did the petitioner ever tell you that he wanted you to file an appeal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [Trial Counsel:] To my recollection he had asked about reopening the case and again ... based on that and the fact that he had directly prior to the conversation with me, written a letter to the [circuit c]ourt\n   which had been denied. I took that to mean that he would like that appeal filed and to preserve that I went ahead and filed the [notice of appeal].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [Respondent's Counsel:] That what had been denied?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [Trial Counsel:] That his motion to rehear, to re-evaluate the sentence had been denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [Respondent's Counsel:] The sentence in the circuit court matter[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [Trial Counsel:] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The only other communication trial counsel received from her client after filing the notice of appeal was a letter that asked her to \"give my new lawyer any paper work [sic] he request [sic].\" Trial counsel knew that no substitute counsel ever entered an appearance before the court on behalf of Velasquez-Lopez, and that she had not been granted leave to withdraw from her representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   When trial counsel was told that her client wanted to appeal, but wanted different counsel on appeal, she was not free from her responsibilities to her client. Trial counsel is counsel of record until relieved of that responsibility by a court order. Rule 1:5 provides that \"[c]ounsel of record shall not withdraw from a case except by leave of court after notice to the client of the time and place of a motion for leave to withdraw.\" Further, Code \u00a7 19.2-159(C)provides that court-appointed counsel for an indigent defendant such as Velasquez-Lopez shall \"represent the accused in the proceeding against him,\n   <em>\n    including an appeal, if any,\n   </em>\n   until relieved or replaced by other counsel\" (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In this case, there was no court order entered allowing trial counsel to withdraw. No order was entered appointing substitute\n   counsel. No proposed substitute counsel ever contacted trial counsel. Thus, trial counsel never provided her file in the case to a successor to enable him or her to perfect the appeal. Trial counsel never asked the circuit court to relieve her of her representation of Velasquez-Lopez. Trial counsel never advised the circuit court that her client wanted another attorney for his appeal. Trial counsel never verified that a petition for appeal on behalf of her client was timely filed with the Court of Appeals.\n   The situation that trial counsel found herself in after her client told her that he wanted new counsel on appeal is hardly novel. Criminal defendants frequently lose faith and confidence in their attorneys following their convictions. The Virginia Standards of Practice for Indigent Defense Counsel squarely address the situation and provide guidance to trial counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   If the client advises counsel that he or she wishes to note an appeal, counsel shall take all necessary steps to perfect such appeal in a timely fashion pursuant to the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. If trial counsel is relieved in favor of other appellate counsel, trial counsel shall cooperate in providing information to appellate counsel concerning the proceedings in the trial court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Virginia Standards of Practice for Indigent Defense Counsel, Standard 9.2 (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly the American Bar Association's Criminal Justice Standards for the Defense Function specify that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Defense counsel should take whatever steps are necessary to protect the client's rights of appeal, including filing a timely notice of appeal in the trial court, even if counsel does not expect to continue as counsel on appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Defense Function 4-9.1 (4th ed. 2015). While our analysis of the adequacy of counsel's representation under the requirements of the Sixth Amendment is not controlled by state or ABA standards, such standards are nevertheless informative, inasmuch as they assist a court in performing its constitutionally required duty of determining if counsel made objectively reasonable choices in representing his or her client. In this instance, counsel did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I agree with the holding of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, which granted habeas relief in a case factually similar to this case.

Counsel was ineffective for failing to move to withdraw from her representation or to inform the circuit court that her client wanted a new attorney for his appeal. Had she taken such actions, the circuit court would have either ordered her to continue to represent Velasquez-Lopez on appeal, or appointed substitute counsel. In either event, Velasquez-Lopez's appeal would not have been dismissed for failure to file the petition for appeal.
