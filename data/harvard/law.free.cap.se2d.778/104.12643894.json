R.App. P. 9(b)(5)(2015), which includes its ICPC request, dated 16 September 2013, seeking a home study of Ms. Bryant from the Virginia Department of Social Services (\"Virginia DSS\"). Also included is an \"Interstate Placement Transmittal\" from Virginia DSS denying the ICPC request based on Ms. Bryant's notice to Virginia DSS on 11 November 2013 that she no longer wished to be considered as a placement option. Respondent has moved to strike these documents, inasmuch as they did not exist at the time of the 23 August 2013 permanency planning hearing and were not subsequently introduced into evidence in the trial court. We grant Respondent's motion and disregard these documents for purposes of our review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </history>\n</casebody>\n"
