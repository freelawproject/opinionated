Facts and Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2008, Grafmuller was charged with (i) attempted carnal knowledge of a minor in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-63, (ii)indecent liberties with a minor in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370, (iii)using a communications system to procure or promote certain sex offenses involving a minor in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3, and (iv) solicitation to commit a felony in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-29. Grafmuller\n   entered\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   pleas of guilty and was found guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2009, the circuit court conducted a sentencing hearing and imposed sentences upon Grafmuller. On the charge of attempted carnal knowledge of a minor, Grafmuller was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment, with eight years suspended. On the charge of using a communications system to procure or promote certain sex offenses involving a minor, Grafmuller was sentenced to 10 years, with five years suspended. In addition, Grafmuller was sentenced to 10 years (with eight years suspended) on the indecent liberties with a minor charge and five years (with four years suspended) on the solicitation to commit a felony charge. In total, Grafmuller was sentenced to 35 years of incarceration, with 25 years suspended, for a total time to serve of 10 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Grafmuller's appeal of his sentence on the charge of using a communications system to procure or promote certain sex offenses involving a minor to the Court of Appeals was unsuccessful.\n   <em>\n    Grafmuller v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129499\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/57/58/#p67\">\n    57 Va.App. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129499\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/57/58/#p67\">\n    698 S.E.2d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 281 (2010). We refused Grafmuller's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, Grafmuller, relying on\n   <em>\n    Rawls v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20Va.%20213\">\n    278 Va. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20S.E.2d%20544\">\n    683 S.E.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), filed a motion in the circuit court\n   seeking a new sentencing hearing, arguing that his 10 year sentences for attempted carnal knowledge of a minor in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-63and use of a communications system to procure or promote certain sex offenses involving a minor in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3were void ab initio because they exceeded the statutory maximum of five years on each of the two charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Grafmuller argued that the attempted carnal knowledge of a minor charge was a Class 6 felony. Similarly, with regard to the charge of use of a communications system to procure or promote certain sex offenses involving a minor, Grafmuller maintained that he was indicted and convicted under 18.2-374.3(B), a Class 6 felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commonwealth conceded that Grafmuller was convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)and that Grafmuller's sentences on both charges exceeded the statutory maximum, but maintained that the circuit court could correct the errors by entering an amended sentencing order without the need for a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The circuit court denied Grafmuller's motion for a new sentencing hearing and, on July 1, 2014, entered an amended sentencing order. Pursuant to that order, Grafmuller's sentence on the charge of attempted carnal knowledge of a minor was amended to five years, with three years suspended. His sentence on the charge of using a communications system to procure or promote certain sex offenses involving a minor was amended to five years, with no time suspended. There was no change to the sentences imposed on the charges of indecent liberties with a minor or solicitation to commit a felony, as they did not exceed the statutory maximums. Thus, under the amended sentencing order, Grafmuller was sentenced to a total of 25 years of incarceration, with 15 years\n   suspended, for a total time to serve of 10 years. Grafmuller appeals the denial of his motion for a new sentencing hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The issue in this appeal is whether our holding in\n   <em>\n    Rawls\n   </em>\n   requires that a criminal defendant who pled guilty-and thus was\n   sentenced by a judge and not a jury-be granted a new sentencing hearing when his original sentence exceeded the statutory maximum. This is a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farhoumand v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Va.%20338\">\n    288 Va. 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=764%20S.E.2d%2095\">\n    764 S.E.2d 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (2014);\n   <em>\n    Shivaee v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=270%20Va.%20112\">\n    270 Va. 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633038\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/570/#p574\">\n    613 S.E.2d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. Application of\n   <em>\n    Rawls v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rawls,\n   </em>\n   we were presented with the question whether a defendant who has been sentenced in excess of the statutorily prescribed range of punishment is entitled to a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prior to\n   <em>\n    Rawls,\n   </em>\n   our jurisprudence had not been uniform in determining whether a defendant who received an improper sentence was entitled to a new sentencing hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   278 Va. at 218-21,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20S.E.2d%20544\">\n    683 S.E.2d at 547-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, \"[i]n many instances, our jurisprudence require[d] a court to speculate regarding how a jury would have fixed a defendant's punishment had the jury been properly instructed or had the jury properly applied the correct instruction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 218,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20S.E.2d%20544\">\n    683 S.E.2d at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Rawls\n   </em>\n   we adopted a bright-line rule that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   a sentence imposed in violation of a prescribed statutory range of punishment is void ab initio because the character of the judgment was not such as the Court had the power to render. Thus, a criminal defendant in that situation is entitled to a new sentencing hearing. This common law rule of jurisprudence will eliminate\n   the need for courts to resort to speculation when determining how a jury would have sentenced a criminal defendant had the jury been properly instructed or had the jury properly followed correct instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 221,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20S.E.2d%20544\">\n    683 S.E.2d at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted). The common law rule adopted in\n   <em>\n    Rawls\n   </em>\n   was \"designed to ensure that all criminal defendants whose punishments have been fixed in violation of the statutorily prescribed ranges are treated uniformly without any speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20S.E.2d%20544\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Despite the clarity of our holding in\n   <em>\n    Rawls,\n   </em>\n   we are now invited to create an exception. The Commonwealth, noting that each case discussed in\n   <em>\n    Rawls\n   </em>\n   involved a jury sentence, argues that our holding in that case should be limited to sentences exceeding the statutory maximums that were imposed by juries. The Commonwealth contends that the dispositive point made in\n   <em>\n    Rawls\n   </em>\n   is that \"in addressing an incorrect sentence, a court may not speculate about the sentence that might have been imposed.\" In this case, the Commonwealth maintains, there is no risk of speculation: the same judge who sentenced Grafmuller in 2009 corrected his sentence in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Grafmuller argues that our rule in\n   <em>\n    Rawls\n   </em>\n   applies to \"all criminal defendants whose punishments have been fixed in violation of the statutorily proscribed ranges\" and that there should be no \"exceptions for defendants improperly sentenced by judges rather than juries.\" We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our holding in\n   <em>\n    Rawls\n   </em>\n   was purposefully broad. We intended to end both the lack of uniformity in our jurisprudence and the speculation about what sentence would have been imposed had the sentencer not been mistaken about the maximum punishment provided by law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 221,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20S.E.2d%20544\">\n    683 S.E.2d at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the cases we discussed in\n   <em>\n    Rawls\n   </em>\n   each involved a jury sentence, our holding was not limited to cases in which the jury imposed a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum. The requirement was announced \"to ensure that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   criminal defendants whose punishments have been fixed in violation of the statutorily prescribed ranges are treated uniformly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). We decline the invitation presented by this case to create an exception to this doctrine for defendants who were sentenced by a judge rather than a jury. Such\n   an exception would re-introduce to this area of the law both a lack of uniformity and a need for speculation as to what the sentence would have been if the sentencer had not misapprehended the statutory maximum. For example, if the original sentencing judge is no longer available to correct the sentence, the resentencing judge would be required to speculate about what sentence the original judge would have imposed\n   had he or she been aware of the proper sentencing range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Furthermore, a defendant charged with a felony has a constitutional right and a statutory right to be personally present during the trial. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 11; Code \u00a7 19.2-259. The statutory phrase, \"during the trial,\" means \"every stage of the trial from his arraignment to his sentence, when anything is to be done which can affect his interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Remington v.

The constitutional imperative is the same: \"[A] defendant is guaranteed the right to be present at any stage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its outcome if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Kentucky v.

The presence of the defendant would contribute to the fairness of the process of correcting his sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, we hold that a defendant convicted of a felony has a right to be present personally at a new sentencing hearing at which his or her sentence is modified so as not to exceed the maximum sentence provided by law. This requirement applies equally to sentences imposed by a jury and sentences imposed by a judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court denying Grafmuller's motion for a new sentencing\n   hearing, and remand this case to the circuit court with directions to re-sentence Grafmuller consistent with the holdings in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Because an order that is void ab initio may be attacked at any time, Grafmuller's motion filed in 2014 attacking his 2009 sentences was not untimely. An order that is void ab initio is \"a complete ity and it may be impeached directly or collaterally by all persons, anywhere, at any time, or in any manner.\"\n    <em>\n     Singh v.
