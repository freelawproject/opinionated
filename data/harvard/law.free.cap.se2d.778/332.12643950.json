In each case, we consider whether the Court of Appeals erred in its findings regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to prove bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Ricks\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Talmage Donnell Ricks (\"Ricks\") was convicted by the Circuit Court of Southampton County (\"Southampton Circuit Court\") of strangulation resulting in bodily injury in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.6. At trial, the evidence showed that Ricks lived with his girlfriend, Nichole Hyman (\"Hyman\"). On May 11, 2013, Ricks returned home drunk after an altercation with a neighbor and awakened Hyman. Ricks was angry and told Hyman that he was going to shoot someone. Hyman asked him \"to leave it alone, [and] to go to sleep.\" Hyman testified that Ricks became angrier and hit her in the side with a belt while she was in bed. Hyman tried to get out of bed, but Ricks got on top of her and held her neck down with one hand. Hyman testified that she could not breathe and that Ricks held her neck for approximately four seconds. Hyman kicked Ricks, he fell off the bed on to the floor, and she ran. Ricks caught Hyman near the bathroom door and again choked her. Hyman explained that Ricks had one hand over her neck, cutting off her breathing completely. Hyman testified she was able to get to the front door where Ricks choked her for a third time and said, \" 'B, I'm'a leave you for dead tonight.' \" Hyman kicked Ricks and ran next door to call the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hyman testified she did not yell for help because she did not have a voice and she could not talk when she went next door. Hyman testified her voice returned a \"couple of days\" later. Hyman testified she had bruises on her neck from the incident, but no\n   permanent injuries and she did not seek medical attention. When Deputy Blythe arrived to investigate, he testified that he saw a faint red mark on Hyman's neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ricks testified that he never choked Hyman and did not hit her with a belt. He admitted he hit Hyman with his forearm when she tried to prevent him from leaving. He testified Hyman told him she was leaving the house to \"get some air.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the conclusion of the evidence, the Southampton Circuit Court stated that Hyman's testimony was \"very credible.\" The court found that Hyman's respiratory process was stopped by Ricks's hand and that she was unable to yell for help as a result of Ricks's actions. Finally, the court ruled that Hyman sustained a bodily injury due to the red mark on her neck and she testified that she had a bruise on her neck and was unable to speak the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ricks filed a petition for appeal with the Court of Appeals asserting the Southampton Circuit Court erred in finding him guilty of strangulation because the Commonwealth failed to prove Hyman suffered a \"bodily injury\" within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.6. On October 15, 2014, the Court of Appeals denied the petition for appeal by per curiam order.\n   <em>\n    See Ricks v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 0293-14-1 (Oct. 15, 2014) (unpublished). The Court of Appeals held,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [i]n this case, Hyman testified [Ricks] held her neck with one hand, preventing her from breathing. She kicked [Ricks] because she was unable to call for help. As Hyman left the area, [Ricks] choked her. After Hyman was able to leave her house to get help, she was unable to speak and she was unable to speak the following day. Hyman testified she had a bruise on her neck. From this evidence, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that [Ricks] applied pressure to Hyman's neck which impeded her respiration and/or blood flow and that the bruise on Hyman's neck and\n   her inability to speak constituted bodily injury that resulted from [Ricks] applying pressure to her neck.\n   <em>\n    Dawson [v.

We awarded Ricks this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. Chilton\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Edward Chilton (\"Chilton\") was convicted by the Circuit Court of the City of Lynchburg (\"Lynchburg Circuit Court\") of strangulation resulting in bodily injury in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.6. The evidence presented at trial showed that on October 23, 2012, Chilton went to the home of his ex-girlfriend, Ebony Dickerson (\"Dickerson\"). At the end of the visit, the two began to argue. Chilton and Dickerson \"pushed each other,\" then Chilton left. Dickerson sat on the sofa with her infant daughter and watched the television. Less than ten minutes later, Dickerson heard \"[a] lot of commotion,\" that is, \"screaming\" and \"hollering\" outside her front door. Dickerson got up and looked out the window of her front door to see that it was Chilton, visibly upset, kicking at her door. Dickerson then opened the door and let him in. Once inside, Chilton continued in his rant and eventually pushed and hit Dickerson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dickerson testified that Chilton pushed her onto the couch. Chilton and Dickerson proceeded to hit each other, while Dickerson was trying to get Chilton off of her. Dickerson testified that Chilton was \"holding [her] down and at one point, he may have grabbed around [her] throat briefly.\" The questioning proceeded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Prosecutor:] As he grabbed you around your throat, did you ever lose consciousness? Did you ever black out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Dickerson:] I saw black but it wasn't like I completely and totally lost conscious [sic].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Prosecutor:] Okay. So when you say you saw black, were your eyes open?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Dickerson:] I closed my eyes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Prosecutor:] Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Dickerson:] And when I opened my eyes, he was still there but he wasn't causing any harm to me then.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On cross-examination of Dickerson, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Defense Counsel:] And did his hands actually go around your throat or was he just lying on you? Is that what caused you to close your eyes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [Dickerson:] He was in that general area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Defense Counsel:] But you can't say he actually put his hands around your throat?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <p>\n    ....\n   </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [Dickerson:] It wasn't a choking motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The evidence at trial was that, after the altercation described above, Chilton then got up and left on his own accord. Dickerson said that she did not require any medical attention following the altercation and did not complain of any injury. Officer A.J. Johnson testified that he took photos of Dickerson's neck, but did not notice any bruising or other injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Lynchburg Circuit Court found the victim credible, noting, \"I observed the witnesses on the stand and I found ... Ms. Dickerson credible [and] that there was a personal injury[,] and I find the Commonwealth proved all the elements of that charge beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Defense counsel noted his objection to the ruling, and Chilton was convicted of strangulation pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-51.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Chilton filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals asserting that the Lynchburg Circuit Court erred in finding that the evidence sufficiently showed Dickerson suffered a bodily injury.

Here, Dickerson never clearly testified that Chilton actually applied pressure to her neck. In fact, she testified that, \"He was in th[e] general area [of her throat]\" but that \"[i]t wasn't a choking motion.\" She also testified that she \"saw black\" after she \"closed [her] eyes.\" Moreover, she testified that she never completely and totally lost consciousness. The Commonwealth's evidence was so minimal that it failed to establish that Dickerson suffered a bodily injury in the form of a loss of consciousness.\n   Accordingly, for the reasons stated, we hold that the Court of Appeals did not err in reversing Chilton's conviction and dismissing the indictment against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   III.
