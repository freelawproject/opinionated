Adams was sentenced to 180 months in prison, the mandatory minimum sentence required by the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), after pleading guilty to possession of a firearm as a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court sentenced Adams under the ACCA after finding that he had three pri- or convictions, two of which \u2014 third-degree fleeing or attempting to elude, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 qualified as violent felonies under the residual clause of the ACCA. Adams objected, arguing that the residual clause was unconstitutionally vague. The district court overruled that objection and sentenced him as a career criminal based on the two convictions for fleeing or attempting to elude and another uncontested prior conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">Adams appeals his sentence, raising again his argument that the residual clause of the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague and arguing that the district court erred in applying a sentencing enhancement under the ACCA. While Adams\u2019s appeal was pending, the Supreme Court invalidated the residual clause of the ACCA as unconstitutionally vague in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2557-58,192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). The government concedes that the residual clause of the ACCA is unconstitutional under <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-15\">After <em>Johnson, </em>Adams\u2019s convictions for fleeing or attempting to elude, under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935, can serve as predicate offenses only if they qualify as violent felonies under a different ACCA provision. But Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(1) and (2) do not have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d are not \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion,\u201d and do not involve the \u201cuse of explosives.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). And the government concedes that after <em>Johnson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>Adams\u2019s convictions for fleeing or attempting to elude, under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935, are no longer ACCA-qualifying offenses and cannot form the basis for a sentencing enhancement under the ACCA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">We therefore conclude that the district court erred in sentencing Adams, based on his previous convictions for fleeing or attempting to elude, under the now-unconstitutional residual clause of the ACCA. He must be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">. One conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude was under subsection (1), fleeing or attempting to elude, and the other was under subsection (2), fleeing or attempting to elude (sirens and lights activated), of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">. At the sentencing hearing, the government disavowed reliance on a fourth conviction to form the basis of the ACCA enhancement. Having expressly disavowed reliance on that offense, the government waived its opportunity to offer evidence and seek a ruling on the fourth conviction's status as an ACCA-qualify-ing offense. <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1257 (11th Cir.2009) (\"The Government is entitled to an opportunity to offer evidence and seek rulings from the sentencing court in support of an enhanced sentence. But, the Government is entitled to only one such opportunity, and it had that opportunity at the sentencing hearing.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1314-17\">.Fla.
