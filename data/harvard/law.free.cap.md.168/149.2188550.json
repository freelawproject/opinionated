The action of the trial court in sustaining the demurrer was in accord with the principle of law recently stated and applied in the case of <em>State, use of Lorenz, v. Machen, </em>164 Md. 579, 165 A. 695. In that case, as in this, the injuries sued for were received by a boy who was permissively using the property alleged to be dangerous. The opinion, by Chief Judge Bond, said (pages 582, 583 of 164 Md., 165 A. 695, 696): \u201cIn several cases this court has had to consider claims of persons on property of others by license or permission, as distinguished from invitation or inducement. <em>Maenner v. Carroll, </em>46 Md. 193; <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. Co. v. State, use of Allison, </em>62 Md. 479; <em>Benson v. Baltimore Traction Co., supra </em>[77 Md. 535, 26 A. 973] ; <em>Kann v. Meyer, </em>88 Md. 541, 41 A. 1065; <em>Baltimore v. De Palma, </em>137 Md. 179, 112 A. 277. And the decisions in those cases have declared the familiar principle that permission or license gives leave only to take the property as the visitors find it, and that the owner or occupant undertakes no duty to those visitors who come for their own pleasure or convenience, and not at his invitation or upon inducement, express or implied, from a common advantage, except that, being aware of their presence, he must not injure them Willfully or entrap them. <em>\u2018A </em>licensee must take the property as he finds it, and is entitled only not to be led into danger by \u201csomething like fraud.\u201d \u2019 <em>Pollock, Torts </em>(11th Ed.) 544. \u2018He who is receiving the gratuitous favors of another has no such relation to him, it is said, as to create a duty to make safe, or better than it happens to be, the place where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the hospitality is tendered. The licensee must take the premises as he finds them. At most, he can claim only that the licensor shall abstain from entrapping him to his harm; shall not create new and undisclosed sources of danger without warning him of the change in situation.\u2019 <em>Burdick, Law of Torts </em>(4th Ed.) 548. And whatever differences there may be between the legal positions of trespassers and persons present by permission, to this extent they are the same; the rule stated applies to both. See <em>Benson v. Traction Co., </em>77 Md. at page 542, 26 A. 973. The trap, or \u2018something like fraud,\u2019 which is men tioned as a ground of liability to licensees, is commonlj illustrated by the case of <em>Corby v. Hill, 4 </em>C. B. N. S 556, explained at length in <em>Maenner v. Carroll, supra. </em>There, a pile of slates was placed without warning in a roadway used by visitors so as to catch them by surprise; and it caused an accident. Judge Alvey distinguished the case of <em>Maenner v. Carroll </em>by the fact that the work during which the injury in the latter case was caused had been going on for six months, and therefore there had been no lack of warning. See <em>Beck v. Carter, </em>68 N. Y. <em>283; Davis v. Railway Co., </em>58 Wis. 646, 17 N. W. 406; 3 <em>Shearman &amp; Redfield, Negligence </em>(6th Ed.) sec. 705; 1 <em>Beven, Negligence, </em>563; <em>Lowery v. Walker, </em>[1911] A. C. 370.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">It has been argued that the second and third counts of the declaration state a case within the purview of a qualification recognized in the opinion in <em>State, use of Lorenz, v. Machen, </em>because those counts allege that the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s son resulted from the negligence of the defendant in creating a new and undisclosed danger on the premises to which he and others customarily and permissively resorted, and in failing to give any warning of the peril thereby occasioned. The principle discussed in that case is expressed in <em>A. L. Inst. Restatement, Torts, </em>sec. 342, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">\u201cA possessor of land is subject to liability for bodily harm caused to gratuitous licensees by a natural or artificial condition thereon if, but only if, he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201c(a) Knows of the condition and realizes that it involves an unreasonable risk to them and has reason to believe that they will not discover the condition or realize the risk, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">\u201c(b) Invites or permits them to enter or remain upon the land, without exercising reasonable care</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqtZ\">\u201c(i) To make the condition reasonably safe, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A72\">\u201c(ii) to warn them of the condition and the risk, involved therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">According to the allegations of the second and third counts, the creation of a new and undisclosed danger consisted in the insecure placing of \u201cone or more pipes, stacks, boilers or other large objects\u201d on the pile of similar iron products on which the public had been allowed to sit or stand while observing games on the adjacent baseball field. But it is not alleged that the defendant knew the condition of the pile to be such as to involve an unreasonable risk to the licensees, and had reason to believe that they would not discover its condition in that respect or realize the risk of continuing to use it for the permitted purpose. Those requisites of actionable liability on the part of the defendant to the licensees were not satisfied by the allegation that the additional objects were negligently and insecurely placed on the pre-existing pile. A charge of negligence does not necessarily impute knowledge that it actually resulted in the creation of a particular hazard. If, however, the averments of the second and third counts should be regarded as including an imputation of such knowledge, they do not allege a realization by the defendant that the insecure position of the superimposed iron objects involved an unreasonable risk which the licensees would not perceive. It was not the defendant\u2019s duty to the licensees to maintain without change the pile of iron products on which the plaintiff\u2019s son was injured. In the ordinary course of the business indicated by the defendant\u2019s corporate name, the removal and replacement of such products would have to be anticipated by those who were in the habit of utilizing the alleged license. As the units <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>composing the pile were tubular in form, the licensees could not reasonably depend upon its being always in a state of perfect stability. The increase of its height by the additions referred to would naturally tend to make it less secure as an elevation from which the baseball games could be witnessed. There was an inherent possibility of danger in climbing upon such a pile of metal forms as the declaration described. In view of that possibility, it could be reasonably supposed by the defendant that those who used the pile as a post of observation would take precautions to ascertain whether it was sufficiently stable to be safe for such use. There is no allegation that the unsafe condition which resulted in the accident could not have been discovered by a licensee exercising due care. The defendant\u2019s limited liability to those using its property by gratuitous permission did not require an assumption that they would not themselves observe a proper degree of care for their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">In our opinion, therefore, the declaration does not aver, in any of its counts, certain essential conditions for the application of the rule of qualified liability approved in <em>A. L. Inst. Restatement, Torts, </em>sec. 342, and in <em>State, use of Lorenz, v. Machen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The cases of <em>Brinilson v. Chicago &amp; N. W. R. Co., </em>144 Wis. 614, 129 N. W. 664, and <em>Snare &amp; Triest Co. v. Friedman </em>(C. C. A.) 169 Fed. 1, cited by the appellant, were materially different in their facts from the case here alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
