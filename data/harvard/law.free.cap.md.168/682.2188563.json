In a replication to the appellee\u2019s second plea the plaintiff averred that the release was invalid because of described circumstances under which it was alleged to have been procured. A demurrer to the replication was held by the trial court to have amounted to an error in the declaration consisting in its imputation to the appellee of joint responsibility for the alleged negligence. The declaration being thus adjudged demurrable as to the appellee, and the plaintiff having declined to make, any further amendment, a judgment was entered in favor of the appellee for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The act of negligence charged in the declaration was the ignition of the gasoline which had just been \u201cscat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>tered\u201d about the lawn. It is stated that the infant son of the appellee ignited the gasoline before the plaintiff could reach a place of safety. There is no allegation that the appellee, who does not appear to have been present at the time and place of the accident, or that his wife, who is said to have been acting as his agent, had intended to have the gasoline set on fire. The purpose for which it was being used is not stated in the declaration. The ignition of the gasoline may have been a wholly unanticipated act of the infant son. No averment of the declaration indicates that he thus acted with the acquiescence of either of his parents, or in the course of any employment or agency which might subject them to liability for his negligence. It is a well-recognized principle of the common law that a parent is not ordinarily responsible for the wrongful act of his minor child. To charge the parent with such responsibility it must be shown that he induced or approved of the act, or that the child\u2019s relationship to the parent at the time was also that of servant or agent. <em>Whitelock v. Dennis, </em>139 Md. 557, 560, 116 A. 68; <em>Huddy, Automobiles, </em>sec. 656, p. 849; 20 <em>R. C. L. </em>627; 46 <em>C. J. </em>1329, 1330. In our opinion the declaration in this case does not satisfy the requirements of that principle with respect to the liability charged against the appellee, and we therefore approve of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
