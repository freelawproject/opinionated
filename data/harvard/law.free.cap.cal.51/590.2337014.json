Said Juan and Jos\u00e9 Loreto, in 1852, in Avriting, declared that they held the title in trust and for the use of Jos\u00e9 Diego Sepulveda, Ygnacio Sepulveda, and Teresa Sepulveda, jointly Avith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>themselves, and that each of the five were entitled to equal shares in the rancho. The grant was confirmed on the tenth day of December-, 1866, but no patent had been issued when this suit was tried. In 1844, said Jos\u00e9 Diego Sepulveda, and one Johnson, executed a deed of exchange, wherein J os\u00e9 conveyed to J ohnson an undivided one-fifth of Los Palos Verdes, and Johnson conveyed to said Jos\u00e9 his interest in the rancho Yucaipa. Johnson took possession of the rancho Palos Verdes, and Sepulveda took possession of Yucaipa. This action was commenced in 1874, for a partition of the rancho Palos Verdes. The deed between Johnson and Sepulveda contained full covenants of warranty. Jos\u00e9 Diego Sepulveda was dead, and, on the trial, his heirs claimed that Johnson had acquired no interest in the Palos Verdes by the deed of exchange, because he did not own Yucaipa, and therefore Sepulveda got nothing by the deed. For the purpose of showing that Johnson'did not own Yucaipa, they offered in evidence the translation of the expediente of the rancho San Bernardino, another Spanish grant, with evidence that Yucaipa was within the boundaries of Ban Bernardino. The plaintiffs objected because not accompanied with the original expediente or a certified copy thereof. The original was on file in the office of the surveyor-general of the \"United States for California. The court overruled the objection. The plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-6\"><em>Brunson, Eastman &amp; Graves, and Thorn &amp; Ross, </em>for the Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-7\"><em>Hartman Haley and J.
