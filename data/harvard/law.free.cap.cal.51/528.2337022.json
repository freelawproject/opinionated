The defendant pleaded that he was sheriff, and that he took the goods by virtue of an attachment in the suit of <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>and that the goods were Packard\u2019s, and that Packard had sold them to the plaintiffs to defraud the creditors.

Therefore, to find that on a certain day respondents were the owners of the goods, and that appellant then seized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>and sold them under judicial process, running against the vendor of respondents, is not sufficient to entitle respondents to judgment, when the issue is, whether the sale to respondents was in fraud of creditors.
