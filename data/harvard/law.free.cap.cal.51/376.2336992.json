Tyree, in the county of San Joaquin, and that the said watch and chain were afterwards taken by the defendant to the county of San Francisco, and were, in said county, by said defendant, lost [or even converted to his own use], then the jury must find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-9\">The court refused that portion of the instruction inclosed in brackets, and also qualified the instruction by inserting the words \u201clost without any intention or willful fault on the part of the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-10\">The defendant excepted to the modification of the instruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-11\">The court, also, of its own motion, instructed the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-12\">\u201c There has been some question as to the jurisdiction of this case; and the court, on that point, in accordance with the statute, further instructs you as follows: When an offense has been committed in this State; when a public offense is committed in part in one county and in part in another, the acts or facts thereof constituting the requisites to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>summation of the offense occurring in two or more counties, the jurisdiction is in either county. When property taken in one county by burglary, larceny, or embezzlement, has been brought into another county, the jurisdiction is in either county. So, gentlemen, whatever there may be of criminal offense in this, the jurisdiction and right for you to consider it, without any reference to the jurisdiction, is perfect. You have a right to consider the crime without any reference to the jurisdiction; that is, if you find that any part of it was committed in this county\u2014that is, the receipt of the watch.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">The defendant excepted to this instruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\">Section five hundred and seven of the Penal Code reads as follows: <em>\u201c </em>Every person intrusted with property as bailee, tenant, or lodger, or with any power of attorney for the sale or transfer thereof, who fraudulently converts the same, or the proceeds thereof, to his own use, or secretes it or them with a fraudulent intent to convert to his own use, is guilty of embezzlement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\">Section seven hundred and eighty-one of the Penal Code reads as follows: <em>\u201c </em>When a public offense is committed in part in one county and in part in.another, or the acts or effects thereof constituting or requisite to the consummation of the offense, occur in two or more counties, the jurisdiction is in either county.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-9\">The defendant was convicted, and appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-10\"><em>S.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">\u25a0 It is not disputed that the conversion of the watch and chain, whatever the character of that conversion, occurred not in the county of San Joaquin, where the appellant was convicted, but in the city and county of San Francisco. The offense is <em>embezzlement </em>in the fraudulent conversion of the property by the prisoner to his own use, or secreting it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>with the fraudulent intent upon his part to so convert it\u2014 under section five hundred and seven of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">It is true that the property alleged to have been embezzled was received by the prisoner from its owner in the county of San Joaquin; but its <em>receipt </em>constituted no part of the offense within section seven hundred and eighty-one, Penal Code, unless accompanied with the intent at the time upon the part of the prisoner to fraudulently convert the property to his own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In view of the question raised at the trial as to the jurisdiction of the authorities in San Joaquin to try the prisoner, it became material to inquire into the intent of the prisoner in receiving the property in that county; and it should have been submitted to the jury to find that intent from the facts and circumstances appearing. Instead of this the jury were, in effect, told by the court that <em>the mere receipt of the ivatch </em>in the county of San Joaquin by the prisoner, regardless of any intent upon his part at the time, concluded him upon the question of jurisdiction made.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Judgment and order denying a new trial reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Mr. Justice Ceookeit did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
