The action of the police judge here in question did not amount to a criminal prosecution, nor to proceedings against the minor according to the course of the common law, in which the right of trial by jury is guaranteed. The purpose in view is not punishment for offenses done, but reformation and training of the child to habits of industry, with a view to his future usefulness when he shall have been reclaimed to society, or shall have attained his majority. Having been abandoned by his parents, the State, as <em>parens patrien, </em>has succeeded to his control, and stands <em>in loco parentis </em>to him. The restraint imposed upon him by public authority is in its nature and purpose the same which, under other conditions, is habitually imposed by parents, guardians of the person, and others exercising supervision and control over the conduct of those who are by reason of infancy, lunacy, or otherwise, incapable of properly controlling themselves. <em>(Ex parte Crouse, </em>4 Whart. 1; <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>The State of Ohio, </em>19 Ohio, 184.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">It is, therefore, ordered that the said Ah Peen be, and he is hereby remanded to the custody of the Superintendent of the Industrial School, to be by him detained as directed in the warrant of the police judge of the city and county of San Francisco.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
