Judgment was asked for damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-8\">In 1856, C. M. Webber owned a tract of land containing about one hundred and sixty acres, including the street and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>lots in controversy, which he laid out into lots and blocks and caused a map of the same to be made, on which he laid down streets, including Sacramento street, and dedicated the streets. Webber afterwards sold to the plaintiff and his grantors the lots in controversy, and in his deed described the boundary as stated in the opinion. On the trial the court admitted, on behalf of the plaintiff, testimony as to the market value of the plaintiff\u2019s lots and as to the effect of the building of the railroad on such market value. The plaintiff recovered judgment and the defendant appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-7\"><em>S'. W. Sanderson, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-8\">The third finding, so far .as it states that lots two and fourteen \u201care bounded on the west by Sacramento street,\u201d in the conveyance from Webber to the plaintiff, is contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-9\">Of course the only evidence of the fact is the deed itself. The language of the deed is: \u201cThence at right angles southerly- along the easterly line ,of Sacramento street one hundred and fifty feet.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-10\">This error was most damaging t.o the defendant, for if the lots were bounded as stated in the finding the plaintiff\u2019s title would extend to and include the land lying in the street between its east line and its cent.er line; whereas, according to the terms of the deed, no title to the land lying in the street passed. The language of the deed makes the east line of the street the west line of the lots, and therefore necessarily excludes the entire street from the lands conveyed, <em>(Maynard </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em>41 Vt. <em>617; Tyler </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>11 Pick. 193; <em>O\u2019Linda </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>21 Pick. 295.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-11\">\u201cThe mere consequential disadvantages of a street railroad to .a particular locality cannot be the subject of a private action. Its proximity to a particular parcel or lot of land may affect the value of such property, either to its advantage or disadvantage. But the company can claim no compensation for the enhanced valu\u00e9 consequent upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>improvement, nor can the owner claim compensation for any depreciation which may result to the property because of the construction of the road in its vicinity. For such accidental (incidental?) disadvantage the party is without remedy. The consequential detriment to the property in such case must be regarded as <em>damnum absque injuria.\u201d ('Carson </em>v. <em>Central B. B. Co., </em>35 Cal. 332.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-5\"><em>E. S. Pillsbury and J. II. Budd, </em>for the Eespondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">The plaintiff owned to the center of the street. <em>(Wager </em>v. <em>Troy Union R. R. Co., </em>25 N. Y. 526; <em>Bissell et al. </em>v. <em>New York Cent. R. R., </em>23 N. Y. 61; 1 Conn. 103.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">The plaintiff has sustained special damage. <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>R. L. and N. R. R. Co., </em>9 Barb. 553; <em>Corning </em>v. <em>Lowerre, </em>6 John. Chan. 439; <em>Bloods. Nashua and Lowell Railway, </em>2 Gray, 157.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b213-8\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The third finding of the court below, so far as it states that lots two and fourteen \u201care bounded on the west by Sacramento street,\u201d in the conveyance from Webber to plaintiff, is contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">One line of the description in the deed is: \u201cThence <em>along the easterly line </em>of Sacramento street one hundred and fifty feet;\u201d and no other language is employed which affects or modifies the natural interpretation of that above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">It is very clear, therefore, that the parties to the instrument intended that the lots should run up to the eastern line and not to the middle of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Thus construing the instrument the plaintiff alleges no cause of action in his complaint, except a claim for special damages by reason of a nuisance caused by the obstruction of a public street or highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">In this view, the court below erred in overruling defendant\u2019s objections to testimony as to the market value of plaintiff\u2019s lots and as to the effect of the building of the railroad on such market value. <em>(Hopkins </em>v. <em>W. P. R. R. Co., </em>50 Cal. 190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
