After the remittitur went down, the plaintiffs move for leave to file an amended complaint, in which Hoerl was made a joint defendant, and which stated a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>action in trover against the three defendants. The court denied the motion. The plaintiffs then moved for leave to file an amended complaint, stating a cause of action in trover against the original defendants. The court also denied this motion.
