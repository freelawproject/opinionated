An injunction restraining the collection of the judgment was asked. It was further alleged that the then judge of the Twelfth District was disqualified from trying this cause, because he ivas the counsel for Kelly in the former case. The court below sustained a demurrer to the complaint, and the plaintiff appealed from the judgment rendered against him.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-11\"><em>James C.
