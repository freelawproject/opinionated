The plaintiff occupied this building as a saloon, and had purchased Smidt\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>est. The defendant owned a lot adjoining plaintiff\u2019s lot on the east, on which was a two-story brick building, erected in 1853. In 1856 a fire destroyed the woodwork of the brick building, but, after the fire, the building was refitted and occupied. In 1861 the defendant built a new brick building on the rear part of the old one, and both were used as one building. The brick building extended back eleven feet beyond the wooden building on the plaintiff\u2019s lot. The foundation of the brick building was on the land of the defendant, and at the surface of the ground it was one inch from, the sill of the wooden building. The brick wall sloped gradually over the plaintiff\u2019s lot from the bottom to the top. The plaintiff\u2019s building was out of repair, and he notified defendant, in June, 1874, that he desired to repair and raise it, and requested him to move the brick wall. The walls of the brick building did not lean more rvhen this suit was tried than when the plaintiff constructed his building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">The court below did not find any damage, and found, as a conclusion of law, that the wall was not a nuisance, and rendered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\"><em>Geo.

R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>2 Black U. S. 495.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-11\">It is difficult to understand how the building of the defendant, which is found to have been built and in its present condition before the construction of plaintiff\u2019s building, with \u201cwalls safe and secure,\u201d and \u201cnot liable to fall or endanger plaintiff\u2019s building, or the life of any one,\u201d can be said to be an obstruction to the free use of plaintiff\u2019s property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The entire west wall of the defendant\u2019s two-story brick building, both that portion of it erected in 1856 and the northerly portion of it erected'some five years later, leans to the west of a perpendicular line, and projects over the one-story wooden building of the plaintiff, which adjoins it on the west. The greatest projection\u2014upwards of eight inches\u2014is at the southeast corner of plaintiff\u2019s building.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">At the northern termination of the west wall of the old building the projection is some five and one-half inches. It appears that the new portion of defendant\u2019s building\u2014that commencing to' the northward and rear of the old building\u2014was purposely built to lean over the building of the plaintiff, so as to make its line conform to the west wall of the old building, which had toppled to the west, in consequence of the fire of 1856, or some other cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The court below, notwithstanding this condition of the west wall of the defendant\u2019s building, was of opinion, and accordingly found the fact to be, that the west wall and the entire building of the defendant are safe and secure, and not liable to fall or endanger the plaintiff\u2019s building. But even if this conclusion be accepted, we are of opinion that the judgment is wrong upon other grounds. It is found as a fact that the projection of the defendant\u2019s west wall <em>prevents the plaintifffrom raising and repairing his oiun building, </em>which improvement it is also found that he is desirous of making. This in itself certainly amounts to an obstruction to the free use of the plaintiff\u2019s property, and one which interferes with its comfortable enjoyment by him, and is therefore a nuisance, as defined by section seven hundred and thirty-one, Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The maintenance by the defendant of the west wall of his building, in the condition in which it is, is an unwarrantable use of his property which works an injury and obstruction to the right of the plaintiff to enjoy his own property, producing thereby such material annoyance, discomfort and inconvenience as, in law, imports damage to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to render judgment upon the findings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
