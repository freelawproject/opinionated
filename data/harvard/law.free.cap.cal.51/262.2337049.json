The testimony was taken and the case was held under advisement by the court, and, after deliberation, the court directed judgment to be rendered for the defendant. No findings of fact were made. The plaintiff moved for a new trial and filed a statement in support of it, which was settled by the court. The motion for a new trial was denied. The point that no findings had been made was not raised either in the statement or in a bill of exceptions. In the statement the point was made that the decision was not sustained by the evidence; but the point could not be made that the findings were not sustained by the evidence, as there were no findings. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-8\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-9\"><em>D.
