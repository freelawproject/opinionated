The Board of Supervisors canvassed the votes, and declared that the defendant had received 1016 votes, and the plaintiff 1015 votes. The plaintiff contested the election, and averred that votes were cast at a place where there was no legal election precinct, which were counted, and that Leese received sixteen and he nine of them; and that illegal votes were cast for Leese at other precincts. The county judge found several facts, but omitted to find how many votes each of the candidates or either of them had received at the election.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-13\">Judgment was rendered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-14\">The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-15\"><em>Woodside &amp; Geil and D.

The court below wholly omitted to find upon this issue, and if the fact be that no evidence on this point was introduced, either by the plaintiff or defendant, this does not excuse the want of a finding. It is the duty of the trial court to find upon all the material issues made by the pleadings, whether evidence be introduced or not, and if there be no finding on a material issue, the judgment cannot be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-19\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-20\">Mr. Chief Justice Wallace did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
