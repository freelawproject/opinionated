F. Irwin, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-12\">The complaint does not allege that appellant had the ability to provide, but the finding is that he had the ability. This finding is, therefore, outside of the issues, and cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-13\">In <em>Morenhout </em>v. <em>Barron </em>(42 Cal. 605), this Court said: \u201cA finding is useless and idle, unless the facts found are within the issues; and a judgment based upon such facts cannot be sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-14\"><em>George G.

Adultery. 2. Extreme cruelty. 3. Willful desertion. 4. Willful neglect,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">Section 93defines \u201cadultery;\u201d and 94 \u201cextreme cruelty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-18\">Section 95 attempts to define the expression \u201cwillful desertion,\u201d and 96, 97, 98 to set forth the different classes of fact Avhich may manifest such desertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-19\">Section 105 declares Avhat circumstances shall constitute \u201cwillful neglect,\u201d dividing the neglect into two classes: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>First. A neglect on the part of the husband to provide the wife with the common necessaries of life, he having the ability to do so; and, second, his failure to do so when he is unable, provided such inability has been caused by his idleness, profligacy or dissipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">A complaint charging the defendant with \u201cwillful neglect\u201d would be subject to general demurrer, because it would not comply with section 426 of the Code of Civil Procedure; it would not contain a \u201c statement of the facts.\u201d This is not within the class of cases in which the charge is sufficient, if it follows the language of the statute, because section 105 contains a statement of the two sets of facts\u2014differing from each other\u2014which are included within the expression \u201cwillful neglect \u201d found in section 92. The use of the general expression of section 92, therefore, does not inform the defendant of the ultimate fact on which plaintiff relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The finding of the court that the defendant had willfully neglected to supply the common necessaries of life, he having the ability so to do, was, therefore, outside the issues; which was whether, by his idleness, profligacy, or dissipation, he had rendered himself unable to supply them.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with direction to the court below to enter judgment for defendant on the findings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
