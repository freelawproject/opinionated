The complaint alleged that the defendant, in the presence of third persons, called the female plaintiff a damned thief and a damned whore, and that, at the time of speaking the words, the female plaintiff \u201csustained a good name and character among her neighbors and acquaintances for moral worth, honesty, virtue, and integrity.\u201d The plaintiff ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>tained the verdict of a jury and had judgment in his favor. The defendant moved for a new trial on a bill of exceptions. The judge extended the statutory time for filing the bill of exceptions. The court denied a new trial, and the defendant appealed from the order and judgment. The clerk, in certifying to the transcript, merely stated, \u201cThe foregoing are full, true, and correct copies of originals on file and of record in my office, and that the foregoing constitutes the transcript on appeal from the judgment and from the order of the court denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-7\"><em>Z. Montgomery, and Moore, Laine, Delmas &amp; Leib, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-8\">The defendant\u2019s answer asserted nothing but his own innocence; true, he denied the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation as to her having a good name, etc., but he did not affirm that she had a bad name or a bad character; she may have had no character of any kind; may have been a recent arrival in that neighborhood and not have acquired any character or reputation (for reputation is character) to be injured. (Townshend on Slander and Libel, note 20.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-9\">The only case in Avhich the answer of a defendant in a suit of this kind can be used in aggravation of damages, is where justification is pleaded and fails upon proof, because this is a republication of the slander. (Townshend, <em>supra, </em>sec. 400.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-10\"><em>Burch &amp; Griffith, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-11\">The instruction assigned as error is correct. The Civil Code, sec. 43, declares that every one has the \u201cpersonal right of protection\u201d * * * \u201cfrom defamation,\u201d * * Avhich means that every one is presumed in law to have a character for \u2018\u201chonesty\u201d and \u201c chastity,\u201d until the contrary is proved. By section 48, slander is defined as a charge which imputes to another a crime (subd. 1), such as, \u201cYou are a thief;\u201d or, Avith a <em>\u201cwant of </em>chastity\u201d (sec. 4), such as, \u201cYou are a Avhore,\u201d and are actionable <em>per se, </em>malice being inferred from the use of such language (Id. sec. 48), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>jury may award exemplary damages. (Id. secs. 3281-3294; <em>Lick </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>47 Cal. 252.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b438-6\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The plaintiffs allege in their complaint that at the time of the speaking of the words set forth in the complaint, the plaintiff, Margaret, sustained a good name and character among her neighbors and acquaintances for moral worth, honesty, virtue and integrity. The defendant denied the allegation. The court below instructed the jury that if the defendant \u201cunnecessarily denied in his answer the character of the plaintiff for chastity, without attempting to prove the truth of such imputation, this is an aggravation of the original slander.\u201d The words set forth in the complaint are actionable <em>per se, </em>and the preliminary panegyric upon the character of the female plaintiff was entirely superfluous. It might have been properly stricken out on motion. It was, however, stated in a traversible form, and invited the denial by which it was met in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The fact that it was denied, and that so far forth an immaterial issue was joined, did not authorize the court to instruct the jury that <em>if the traverse was mvnecessary </em>they should for that reason, by their verdict, add to the amount of damages which the plaintiff would otherwise recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">To deny that the female plaintiff had acquired a good character\u2014by which we understand a good reputation\u2014 among her neighbors, is not equivalent to an allegation that her reputation was bad, in the sense of the rule which permits a jury to find 1 additional damages for a supposed wanton, malicious or reckless defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">Judgment and order denying a new trial reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">A rehearing was granted, after which the following opinion was delivered by the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">The certificate of the clerk is sufficient in point of form. The judge had authority to extend the time for filing the bill of exceptions, and the bill was filed within the time allowed. The objections taken by the respondent, are, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>therefore, overruled, and the judgment and order denying a new trial are reversed and the cause remanded for the reasons stated in the former opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00a1Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
