The plaintiff was to pay him $5200, and in consideration of the premises, the defendants, Burrows as principal, and Bauquier and Gwynn as sureties, executed, to the plaintiff, a bond in the penal sum of $4000, conditioned that Burrows should perform his contract. The house was not completed within the time, and this action was brought on the bond to recover damages. The sureties defended on the ground that the plaintiff \u25a0 had extended the time to complete the contract. They relied on the following agreement endorsed on the back of the contract:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-10\">\u201c It is hereby agreed between the parties to this written contract, that the said second party shall have until the 1st day of November, 1872, in which to complete the work in said contract described, and it is understood that this shall not in no wise interfere with or lessen the liabilities of the sureties upon the bond given by said second party.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-11\">\u201cIn witness whereof the parties hereunto set their hands and.seals this 2d day of September, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-12\">\u201cM.

It is evident upon an inspection of the writing itself, that it was intended to be signed by all the parties to the contract upon which it was endorsed. These parties were the two principals in the contract and the two sureties upon the bond attached to and forming a part of the contract. It was signed by but three of these persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">As the contract for the extension of time was not complete, it was not obligatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Judgment and order denying a new trial affirmed.
