That the tax-collector demanded the total \u2022 tax, and the plaintiff offered to pay and tendered to him the tax on the real estate, improvements, and money, but the defendant refused to receive it, on the alleged ground that he could not separate the amount alleged to be illegal from the rest of the tax. That thereupon the plaintiff, under protest, and to prevent a sale of its property, paid the whole tax and five per cent, thereon and $1.00 printer\u2019s fees. Judgment was asked for $553.

The complaint contains an extract from the assessment-roll of the county, from which it appears that there was listed to the plaintiff\u2014 among other items\u2014\u201csolvent debts, promissory notes, and mortgages. This item was stated separately from the other and undisputed items of the assessment, and its valuation was separately given. It is now beyond question that solvent debts, notes and mortgages are not the subjects of taxation, and that the assessment was <em>pro tanto </em>illegal and void. (Ante p. 243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">It is further alleged that the plaintiff tendered to the collector the amount of taxes upon the parcels of property admitted to have been legally listed, and that acceptance was refused by him upon the ground that he had no means of separating the illegal from the legal portion of the tax. But evidently this separation could have been accomplished by a very simple mathematical computation. The complaint states the case of an illegal tax, paid under protest, for the recovery of which the plaintiff undoubtedly has his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to the court below to overrule the demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Heither Mr. Chief Justice Wallace nor Mr. Justice Rhodes expressed an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
