The court should find upon the new matter.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-11\">Idem.\u2014In such case no presumption will be indulged that findings were waived if the record is silent upon the subject.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-12\">Appeal from the District Court, Nineteenth Judicial District, City and County of San Francisco.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-13\">Action to enforce a lien on a lot in San Francisco for a street assessment. The answer set up as an affirmative defense that the owners of a majority of the frontage of lots on the street improved did not sign the petition to improve the street, and that therefore the Board of Supervisors did not acquire jurisdiction. The court rendered judgment for the plaintiff and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-14\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b644-15\"><em>B.

The answer of the defendant set up certain affirmative defenses to the action, but did not purport to deny any allegation contained in the complaint. The only sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>posed finding of facts is contained in the decree, where it is said by way of mere recital as follows: \u201cAnd it further appearing that said complaint was duly verified, the court finds all the facts as stated in said complaint.\u201d -Now in view of the circumstance that the defense did not rest either in whole or in part upon a denial of the allegations of the complaint, but entirely upon the new matter set up in the answer, a finding of \u201call the facts as stated in the complaint \u201d was not a disposition of the issues of fact involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Second. We held here.(in <em>Mulcahy </em>v. <em>Glazier, ante, </em>p. 626), that if the record were entirely silent upon the question as to whether there had been a waiver of the finding of facts, we would presume in aid of the judgment below that such waiver had occurred. But it is clear that in view of the finding here made, and appearing in the record, no such presumption of a waiver of findings can be indulged.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Judgment and order denying a new trial reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial. B-emittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
