The complaint was made, and the plaintiff was arrested-on the 14th day of July, 1873, and on the next day the magistrate held the defendant to bail. The grand jury examined the charge on the 18th and 19th days of August, 1873, and dismissed it. The plaintiff commenced this action on the 30th of August, 1873. On the trial, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for three thousand dollars damages. The defendant moved for a new trial, but the court below denied the motion. The defendant appealed from the judgment and from the order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-5\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-6\"><em>Harvey S.

The subsequent ignoring of the charge by the grand jury did not have that effect. Under, the system of criminal law prevailing in this State, the deliberations of the grand jury are not, as formerly, a mere examination of the case of the prosecution. The proceeding before the grand jury is in fact a preliminary trial, and one in which the accused may appear by his witnesses and make his defense, and may himself be sworn and testify in his own behalf. The favorable result of such a trial certainly affords no evidence of want of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The prosecution in the first instance does not seem to have been hastily or inconsiderately set on foot. It was only after an anxious and careful consideration\u2014a deliberate examination of all accessible means of information as to the fact of the alleged perjury\u2014both by the local attorney and local agent of the defendant, that it was determined that legal proceedings against the plaintiff here should be initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">There are no circumstances indicating that the prosecution originated or was conducted in consequence of malice or any reprehensible motives upon the part of the defendant or its agents. The interests of public justice require that parties who, in good faith, and upon grounds believed at the time to be sufficient, attempt to bring supposed offenders to just accountability, should not be mulcted in damages merely because the accused party has ultimately succeeded in obtaining an acquital of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We think that for the reasons indicated the court below should have set aside the verdict.-</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Judgment and order denying a new trial reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
