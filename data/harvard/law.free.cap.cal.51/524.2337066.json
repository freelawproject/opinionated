Raffour was the proprietor of and owned the furniture in the Occidental Hotel, at Santa Barbara. On the first day of June, 1874, he gave the plaintiff Horn a mortgage on the property to secure a debt of $2000, and, on the twenty-ninth of June, he gave the plaintiff a bill of sale of the property. Raffour was also indebted to William Ealand, who, on the twenty-ninth of September, 1875, procured a writ of attachment to issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>out of the District Court, which he placed in the hands of the defendant, who was sheriff, and who seized the furniture. Horn commenced this action to recover damages. In his complaint, he averred that he was in the possession of the property when seized, and the answer admitted the allegation. The answer justified under the writ, alleging that the property belonging to Baffour, and that the sale to Horn was fraudulent. On the trial, the plaintiff, after introducing evidence tending to show his title, rested. The defendant offered the writ of attachment in evidence. The plaintiff objected, because no foundation had been laid for it. The court ruled that the defendant must prove the existence of a debt, but need not prove that the writ was regularly issued. The plaintiff excepted. The defendant then offered evidence tending to show fraud in the sale, and rested. The jury found a verdict for the defendant, and judgment was entered in his favor. The plaintiff moved for a new trial, and appealed from an order denying the same.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-6\"><em>W. C. Stratton, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-7\">The defendant failed to prove legal authority for the issuing of the writ of attachment, no affidavit or bond having been given in evidence. <em>(Thornburg </em>v. <em>Hand, </em>7 Cal. 554.) Nor did it appear on the face of the writ or in evidence that a summons had been issued before or was issued at the time of the issuance of the writ. An attachment may issue at the time of issuing the summons or any time afterwards. (Sec. 537, Code of Civil Procedure.) If issued before the issuance of summons it is void. <em>(Low </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>9 Cal. 538.) He who justifies under a process must show affirmatively that it was regularly issued. <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>Landecker, </em>9 Cal. 262; Bump on Fraudulent Conveyances, sec. 455.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-9\"><em>A.
