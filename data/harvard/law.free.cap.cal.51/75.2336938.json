The complaint then proceeded as follows: \u201c She (the said plaintiff meaning) did it (meaning thereby that the said Eliza J. communicated the fire to the said clothes in room Ho. 2 aforesaid); and that the defendant also said, to certain persons, Ton (the said persons to whom the said defendant was speaking at the time meaning) don\u2019t know her (the said Eliza J. meaning) as well as I (the said defendant meaning) do; she (the said Eliza J. meaning) is cunning (meaning thereby, that the said Eliza J. was a person of a moral character so depraved that she could, and would, be. guilty of communicating a fire to the clothes in said room Ho. 2, in the manner as hereinbefore set forth). I (the said defendant meaning) have been watching her (the said Eliza J. meaning) for ten days (meaning thereby, that the said defendant had been watching the said Eliza J. to detect her in the act of setting fire to some portion of said hotel).\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-8\">Substantially the same allegations were made as to the lighted match placed on the couterpane.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-9\">The defendant demurred to the complaint, but the court overruled the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>On the trial, Mrs. E. M. Abbott was called as a witness by the plaintiff for the purpose of proving what she heard the defendant say on the 10th day of January, 1873, seven days after the suit was commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">This testimony was offered by plaintiffs, not for the purpose of proving the words as charged, or any allegations in the complaint as to the publication of the same, but for the purpose of showing express malice; and upon the preliminary examination of Mrs. Abbott by defendant\u2019s counsel she testified that she might not be able to give every word the defendant uttered in the conversation, but that she would not give any that he did not utter; that she could detail the whole conversation in substance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-7\">The defendant objected to the testimony of Mrs. Abbott, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-8\">1. The conversation occurred since the commencement of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-9\"><em>2. </em>It is not a repetition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-10\">3. The words have not been proved as laid, and-untibihis is done the <em>quo animo </em>cannot be inquired into.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-11\">4. The witness does not remember the whole of \u201cthe conversation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-12\">The court overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-13\">Brett, another witness called by the plaintiff, testified as to a conversation he had with the defendant on the sixteenth of December, 1872, in relation to the fire, in which the defendant used language which implied that he thought Mrs. Chamberlin set the fire of that day. On cross-examination of this witness the following occurred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-14\">\u201cI was boarding at the Vance Hotel at the time of this conversation; I have been boarding at the hotel ever since it opened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-15\">\u201c Q. Had you any property situated near said hotel at that time ? If so, how near ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-16\">\u201cPlaintiff objects\u2014not legitimate cross-examination, and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-17\">\u2018 \u2018 Defendant\u2019s counsel proposes to prove by witness that he owned buildings located near said hotel, which would have been liable to burn if the said hotel had burned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u201c Objection sustained. Defendant excepts to the ruling of the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">The defendant did not offer to prove that he knew that the witness owned buildings near the hotel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">J. E. Wyman was called as a witness for the plaintiff, to prove malice, and testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">\u201cI am and was county judge of this county. I believe the fires were spoken of between us twice (that is, Yance and myself). All the fires had occurred when the first conversation took place; it was in Vance\u2019s mill office; he was talking to his clerk, Jackson. I don\u2019t know how the subject Avas broached. Yance said the fire had been set twice; and I asked him the question, if he had any idea by whom ? He said he did not know, but that suspicion rested on Mrs. Chamberlin, that is all. I can\u2019t tell the date of the next conversation; think it was a short time after, on the street,, near the butcher shop. Perhaps a day or more after this first conversation, Yance said he thought it Avas a matter of importance; that he thought it was the duty of the officers to take hold of it. I don\u2019t know whether he addressed me as an officer or not. He said nothing more than that his suspicions hadn\u2019t been changed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-9\">On cross-examination he said: \u201cI Avas county judge at the times mentioned; published a neAvspaper. I was also an insurance agent. Defendant, seemed to speak of it as though he had an interest in it. I didn\u2019t see anything in it but a narration of facts. Defendant and I were alone when the second conversation took place. I think I told Yance it might come before me, and that he had better consult an attorney, or district attorney.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-10\">Defendant\u2019s counsel then propounded the following question to the witness:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-11\">\u201cQ. Were you an insurance agent at this time, and had you buildings insured near the Yance Hotel?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-12\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s counsel offered to show by the witness that he was an insurance agent, and that the statements made to him by the defendant were made to him as insurance agent, for the purpose of showing the communication was privileged and to disprove malice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u201cPlaintiffs object that it is not legitimate cross-examination. Court sustains the objection. Defendant excepts.\u201d After the plaintiff rested, the defendant called Mrs. Graham, and asked her the following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">\u201cWho was suspected of having set those fires? By whom was she suspected? Did you suspect her? To whom did you communicate your suspicions ? What induced you to suspect Mrs. Chamberlin of setting the fire? Did you communicate your suspicions to Mr. Vance? Did you communicate the grounds of your suspicions to Mr. Vance?\u201d The court, on the objection of the plaintiff, ruled out the proposed testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">The second instruction given by the-court,-and referred to in the opinion, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\">\u201cTo entitle the plaintiff to recover, it must be shown\u2014 \u201c1st. That the words charged in the complaint were spoken by the defendant of plaintiffs in the presence and hearing of others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-9\">\u201c 2. That the words spoken were false.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-10\">\u201c 3. That they were spoken with the intent and meaning as alleged, to wit: to impute to the plaintiff \u2018 the crime of an attempt to commit arson,\u2019 and that they were so understood by the persons to whom spoken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-11\">\u201cIf these facts have been shown to your satisfaction, your verdict must be for plaintiffs, otherwise your verdict must be for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-12\">\u201cIn connection with the foregoing, you are instructed that words imputing crime are presumed to be false, and malice is implied from falsity, and the plaintiff is not required to prove falsehood and malice (unless the publication is privileged), but it devolves on defendant to refute the presumption.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-13\">The defendant, in his answer, for a separate defense, stated a large number of circumstances in connection with the fires, which circumstances, he alleged, induced him and others, at the time he made the publications charged in the complaint, to believe that the plaintiff, Eliza J., was guilty of setting the fires, and he also averred that he did firmly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>believe it, and that the publications were made without malice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">The seventh instruction referred to in the opinion was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-7\"><em>\u201cIf </em>you find that defendant in his answer has alleged any fact which, if true, would tend to show that the plaintiff, Mrs. Chamberlin, was guilty of setting either of the fires, and that at the time of filing his answer the defendant had no reason to believe such fact to be true, and has not attempted to sustain the same by proof, you may consider this in estimating damages, as matter in aggravation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-9\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-10\"><em>James Manna, and McElrath &amp; Osment, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-11\">In the case at bar the prefatory averment is that certain clothing had been burned, and in speaking of and concerning the burning thereof, defendant said: \u201cI have been watching her for ten days. (Innuendo.) Meaning that he had been watching her to detect her in the act of <em>setting fire to some portion of said hotel.\" </em>There is no averment that any portion of said hotel had been fired, or any attempt or threat made to fire it, and this case falls clearly within the rule laid down in <em>Burnham\u2019s Case </em>(Yelverton, 22).</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-12\">In alluding to that case, the Supreme Court of Missouri remarked: \u201c The doctrine of this decision has been followed in all the leading cases, both in England and the United States, and this Court has uniformly recognized it. <em>(Bunday </em>v. <em>Hart, 46 </em>Mo. <em>464.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-13\">An innuendo cannot supply the place of an averment; neither can it add to or extend the meaning of words. The first intimation that any attempt was made to fire the hotel, or any part of it, or that any one was suspected of anything of the kind, appears in this innuendo. All the introductory averments and the colloquium have express reference to some clothing which was burned in room 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-14\">An innuendo is not traversable. Neither can it be proved. \u201cI never knew an innuendo offered to be proved.\u201d <em>(Arguendo, Rosewell\u2019s Case, </em>3 State Trials, 1058; <em>Van Vichtin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>5 John. 226; 1 Am. L. Cases, 150, 162; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Kneeland, </em>1 Doug. 67; <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>2 Up. Can. Q. B. R. 209.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-6\">It was clearly error to admit evidence of words not laid in the complaint. If actionable, they were properly the subject of distinct actions. They were not repetitions. They operated as a surprise upon defendant. (1 Am. L. Cas. 246; <em>Philadelphia, etc. </em>v. <em>Quigley, </em>21 How. 213; <em>Hemming </em>v. <em>Garson, </em>Ellis, B1. &amp; E1. 346; <em>Beadesley </em>v. <em>Bridgman, </em>17 Iowa, 292; <em>Letton </em>v. <em>Younge, </em>2 Met. (Ky.) 563; <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>7 Jones\u2019s L. (N. C.) 36; <em>Henson </em>v. <em>Veatch, </em>1 Blackf. 370; <em>Rundell </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>7 Barb. 262.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-7\">Mrs. Abbott\u2019s testimony was clearly inadmissible, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-8\">The words testified to by her were not alleged in the complaint; they were not a repetition; they form the subject of another action, and plaintiffs could bring another action upon them (if actionable), notwithstanding they were given in evidence in this suit, and a recovery had; they were published after the commencement of this action; they operated as a surprise upon defendant; the evidence was incompetent to enhance damages, the purpose for which it was offered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-9\">Mrs. Abbott\u2019s was the most material testimony introduced, and for all the reasons above set forth should have been excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-10\">Bumors are admissible in evidence in actions of slander.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-11\">Lord Ellenborough admitted the evidence in <em>Sir John Earner </em>v. <em>Merle.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-12\">Gibbs, C. J., admitted it in <em>Wyatt </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>Holt\u2019s N. P. C. See 2 Selwyn\u2019s Nisi Prius, 1059 (note 2).</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-13\">It was admitted in the following cases: <em>Earl of Leicester </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>2 Camp. 251; <em>Leister </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Root, 24; 6 Robinson\u2019s Prac. 879.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-14\">We are aware that this Court has decided in the late case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Fitch </em>(41 Cal. 363), that rumors are not admissible either in justification or in mitigation; and no doubt this is correct when properly understood. It is commonly said that words other than those averred are not admissible in evidence to enhance damages, but are admissible to prove malice. So it may with equal propriety be said that rumors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>of plaintiff\u2019s guilt are competent to go to the jury, not upon the question of damages, but upon the question of malice; and this is the purpose for which the evidence was offered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-6\"><em>Chamberlin &amp; De Haven, </em>for the Eespondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-7\">If it were necessary to aver a felonious attempt to burn the hotel, it would be necessary to prove it on the trial; and if so it were material to allege that it was rumored that such attempt had been made, plaintiff would be compelled to prove it upon the trial. A learned judge has disposed of appellant\u2019s argument thus:</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-8\">\u201cIt was said on the argument that it should have been set forth in the declaration, as inducement to the alleged charge, that the plaintiff\u2019s barn had been insured, in order to support the innuendoes. If such averment should be held material, it must have been proved on the trial; and the consequence would be that no person charged with crime, even in the very language of the statute, could vindicate his character or obtain redress for the injury unless the building he was charged to have burned was in fact insured. The law cannot be so defective.\u201d <em>(Case </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>15 Wend. 328.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-9\">Appellant seems to entirely ignore the allegation in the complaint, that to injure the plaintiff and to cause it to be suspected and believed of her that she was guilty of the crime of an attempt to commit arson, he spoke the alleged words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-10\">\u00edo render words actionable, there need not be the same certainty in stating the crime imputed as in an indictment for the crime. \u201cThe complaint does not allege that defendant charged, or intended to charge, plaintiff with willfully, maliciously, or feloniously firing or attempting to fire the hotel.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-11\">Nor was the pleader, by any rule of law we ever heard of, required to state the crime imputed, as if, instead of a complaint, he were drawing an indictment for such a crime. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>8 Johns, 73; <em>Niven </em>v. <em>Munn, </em>13 Johns, 48.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-12\">Appellant makes the point that the testimony of Mrs. Abbott was improperly admitted; his objections can all be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>considered under this general statement. First. The words testified to by her were not alleged in the complaint, and were therefore not a repetition. Second. That they were published after the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-4\">This evidence was received only for the purpose of proving express malice, and was properly admitted. Although she testified to the speaking of more words than were chai\u2019ged in the complaint, yet the additional words did not change the alleged meaning of those laid, and all had reference to the same slander. The rule is well established that a plaintiff may prove more words than are set forth in the complaint, provided the additional words do not change the meaning of those set forth. (Townshend on Slander and Libel, Sec. 365.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-5\">These words proven by Mrs. Abbott were spoken after the commencement of the suit, and as they related to the same slander for which this action was brought, were admissible. <em>(Kennedy </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>19 Wend. 300; <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>39 Cal. 74; <em>Partner </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>33 Ala. 78; <em>Bassel </em>v. <em>Elmore, </em>48 N. Y. <em>564; Bodwell </em>v. <em>Swan; </em>3 Pick. 378; <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Young, </em>6 Blackf. 498; <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>42 N.Y. 478.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b99-6\">By the Couet:</author>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The demurrer to this complaint was properly overruled. The complaint avers: 1 \u2018 And in that behalf plaintiff further alleges as a fact, that by all the foregoing false, malicious and defamatory words, the said defendant intended to convey the further meaning, and that the said words were by the said persons in whose presence and hearing they were so uttered and published, understood and believed to convey the meaning that the said Eliza J. communicated the fire to the said clothes in the said room No. 2, at the time and place aforesaid, as hereinbefore set forth, and that she, the said Eliza J., was guilty of the heinous crime of an attempt to commit'arson.\u201d It is admissible in actions of slander and libel to aver and prove that words which have a covert meaning were intended to defame, and were under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>stood in a particular sense by those who heard or read them. <em>(Maynard </em>v. <em>F. F. Ins. Co., </em>34 Cal. 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The words testified to by the witness Abbott, do not enlarge the meaning of the words of the complaint, if construed in accordance with the averment above recited. The words testified to by the witness were spoken after the commencement of the action, but as they were substantially the same as those declared on, they were admissible to prove the <em>quo animo </em>with which the alleged slander was originally published. The words spoken after were of similar import to those spoken before this action was brought. They may be considered a repetition, and so were admissible on the question of malice. <em>(Kennedy </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>19 Wend. 300; <em>Bodwell </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>3 Pick. 378.) It would, perhaps, have been the duty of the court, had counsel requested it, to charge the jury that no additional damages could be given for the publication of the words spoken after the commencement of the action, as for a publication of a distinct slander, and that they were to be considered only with reference to the motives with which the words declared on were spoken. But the record does not show that counsel so requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The fact that the witness Brett had buildings near the hotel, although not of any consequence in itself, might have been admissible in connection with proof of other facts (as that the defendant knew of such ownership), which would show its materiality. But when counsel make an \u201c offer \u201d of evidence it must appear that the facts offered to be proven, in connection with facts as to which evidence has already been taken, are relevant; otherwise the court is justified in sustaining an objection to the offer. The offer must be complete in itself, and must not omit facts, without which the facts offered are not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The whole conversation between defendant and the witness Wyman, as well as the triplicate occupation of the latter\u2014county judge, publisher of a newspaper, and insurance agent\u2014seem to have been made known to the jury. Under the circumstances, we are not prepared to say that the witness might possibly have omitted a part of the conversation, which would have indicated more clearly that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>defendant spoke tke words to kirn in kis character as \u201c insurance agent;\u201d nor can we believe tkat defendant was injured by tke action of tke District Court in sustaining the objection to kis \u201coffer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Tke court below properly rejected evidence of rumors of plaintiff\u2019s guilt. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>41 Cal. 384.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We think tke second instruction of tke District Court is not obnoxious to the criticism to which it has been subjected by appellant, and tkat tke seventh instruction given at tke request of plaintiff, is not erroneous. Facts were alleged in tke answer which, if true, would tend to prove tke plaintiff guilty of setting tke fires. Tke court could have assumed tke existence of suck allegations, and have based its instructions on them. Tke mere circumstance tkat it put tke matter to the jury hypothetically, \u201cIf you find tkat defendant has alleged\u201d suck facts, etc., could not have misled the jurors. In principle, the charge was correct. If tke defendant willfully alleged tke existence of suck pretended facts, not believing or having no reason to believe them to be true, this might properly be considered by tke jury as showing a continuing and express <em>malice. </em>Tke defendant in an action of slander cannot abuse kis privilege of pleading any appropriate matter as a bar, or in mitigation of damages, by spreading on tke record a renewed wanton and malicious assault upon tke reputation of kis adversary.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">By the Court, on petition for rehearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">Tke action is for slander, and tke verdict was for the plaintiffs for $5000 \u201cgold coin.\u201d In entering tke judgment tke court disregarded so muck of tke verdict as calls for gold coin, and entered a judgment for tke $5000 generally, without specifying any particular kind of money in which it shall be paid. In tke petition for a rehearing, our attention is specially called to this point, and tke judgment is claimed to be erroneous as not in accordance with tke verdict.
