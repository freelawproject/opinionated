We have been referred to no provision of the statute, nor to any rule of law, which authorizes an action of this character in the name of or on behalf of a county. On the contrary, it would appear from section 2746 of the Political Code as amended in 1873-4, that the action must be in the name of the road overseer: we think the action in the name of the county cannot be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with an order to the court below to dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">Wallace, C. J., not having heard the argument, did not participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
