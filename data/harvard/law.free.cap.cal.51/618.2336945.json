This action was commenced in February, 1875, against the administratrix alone. The cause was called for trial on the twenty-sixth of October, 1875, and the plaintiff closed his testimony. The defendant then called Cobb, one of the makers of the note, as a witness; but the court, on objection of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, refused to hear his evidence until Cobb and Briggs had been made parties to the suit. The court then, at the request of defendant\u2019s counsel, .permitted Cobb and Briggs to file answers to the complaint. They filed such answers, and the trial was resiimed on the twenty-ninth of November, when the defendant called Cobb as a witness and the court, on the objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, refused to allow him to testify. The plaintiff recovered judgment against the administratrix alone, and she appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-6\"><em>Charles H.

At the trial, the administratrix offered Cobb as a witness on her behalf, and proposed to prove by him \u201cwhat, if anything, had been paid thereon, and how paid; \u201d but the court refused to permit Cobb to testify as a witness for the administratrix, on the ground, as we infer, that he was incompetent under the provision of the Code above quoted. This ruling is assigned as error. The langu\u00e1ge of the statute is very broad, and if literally construed, might exclude all parties to the action, whether called to testify for or against the estate. But to give it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>this construction would defeat the manifest purpose of the \u2022act, and we think the language is capable of a different interpretation. Parties to the action, or in whose behalf it is prosecuted, are not allowed to testify against the estate in a suit to establish a demand against it. One of the parties to the transaction out of which the demand originated being no longer <em>in esse, </em>it was deemed unwise to permit the other party to it to testify to his version of it, when called by the plaintiff in a proceeding against the esta te to establish the demand. The statute, it is true, provides in general terms that \u201c the parties to an action or proceeding \u201d against the estate shall not testify; but the obvious meaning of this provision is that a party to the action shall not testify against the executor or administrator. This was the point decided in <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Fairbanks, </em>(50 Cal. 420); and though the language of the opinion in that case is somewhat broad, it must be interpreted with reference to the facts of the case. But in view of the evil to be remedied, the legislature could hardly have intended to prohibit the executor or administrator from calling a party to the action to testify in behalf of the estate. On the opposite theory, the defendant, representing the estate, would not be permitted to call the plaintiff himself to prove that the demand was fraudulent or had been fully paid. Such a construction of the statute is wholly inadmissible, and would be at variance with its \u25a0 manifest intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Judgment and order reversed and cause remanded for a \u25a0 new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
