H. Granice from imprisonment, on a writ of habeas corpus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-9\">Granice ivas-indicted by the grand jury of Fresno County for killing one Madden. On his trial in the District Court he offered to prove that interpolations had been made in the indictment, and moved to strike out the portions interpolated. The court denied the motion, and he was convicted, and appealed. The Supreme Court granted a new trial for this error. The case is reported in 50 Cal. 447. On the second trial, the court, on motion of the prosecution, struck out the parts of the indictment which had been interpolated. After both the prosecution and defense had introduced their evidence, the district attorney moved the court that the jury be discharged from the further consideration of the case, on the ground that it appeared from the evidence that an offense of a higher nature than that charged in the indictment had been committed. The indictment, as it then stood, was for manslaughter. The court granted the motion, and made an order that the defendant be committed to answer any indictment Avhich might be found against him for murder. The defendant AA-as detained in the jail of Fresno County by the sheriff of that county.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-10\"><em>B.

Whether the order was irregularly entered, was erroneous, or what defense or advantage it may possibly afford the prisoner, should he be again put upon his trial for the killing of Madden, are questions which it is not the office of a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>to present for our consideration. \u201cThe writ of <em>habeas </em>corpus,\u201d as well observed here in <em>Ex parte McCullough, </em>\u201c has not been given for the purpose of reviewing judgments or orders made by a court or judge, or officer acting within their jurisdiction. To put it to such a use ivould be to convert it into a writ of error,\u201d etc. (35 Cal. 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">It results that the prisoner must be remanded, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Mr. Justice Cbockett did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
