The sheriff advertised them as separate tracts, but sold three of them in mass. The sale took place on the eighteenth day of March, 1875, and Lewis Pierce purchased the three tracts for money. On the thirteenth day of September, 1875, the defendant, Ferrea, filed an affidavit in which, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>things, he stated that he was an Italian and did not speak English, and had just called on his attorney to see about redeeming one of the parcels, and found for the first time that they were sold in mass. The court made an order requiring the plaintiffs to show cause why the sale should not be set aside, and qn the hearing, refused to set aside the sale. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-6\"><em>B. S. Brooks and A. D.

A sale in mass of several distinct pieces of land should be set aside. <em>(City and Co.

This was an irregularity, to correct which the defendant had his remedy by motion to set aside the sale on notice to the judgment creditor, sheriff, and purchaser at the sale. (Code Civil Procedure, 694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">To uphold the sale would' be to deprive the judgment debtor of his right to redeem any one of the separate parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">Order reversed and cause remanded, with direction to grant the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b570-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Wallace, C.
