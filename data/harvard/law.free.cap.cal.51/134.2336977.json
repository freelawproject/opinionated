Estes took possession of the property and carried on the business of manufacturing flour and lumber, and selling the same, and selling liquor, until the 26th day of November, 1872, when he surrendered the mills, saloon, and property on hand at that time, to the plaintiff, with the consent of the defendants. The plaintiff, after the last-mentioned day, by his labor and industry, paid the debts due to Lamar, Clemons, and Brown. The other creditors claimed that their debts were still due, and threatened to enforce them; and some of them brought suits and recovered judgments, and the judgments were a lien on the real estate of the plaintiff. The creditors did not receive any of the proceeds which went into the hands of Estes. This was a bill in equity against Estes, the trustee, and the creditors, to have an account taken of the money in the hands of Estes, and to compel the creditors to credit the same on their demands. The court below held that the creditors could not be compelled to allow the money in the hands of Estes on their claims, and rendered judgment in their favor, but directed an account to be taken as to Estes, and held that the plaintiff must look to him alone. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-6\"><em>B. Harrison, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-7\">We have traced the money to Estes\u2019 hands, and it devolves upon the defendants to show what became of it. We had no control over the money in Estes\u2019 hands. It belonged to the creditors. They could control it. They could require Estes to pay it to them, or allow it to remain in his hands. We had no power to compel him to pay it to the creditors, nor was it our duty to see what he did with it. Estes was the especial agent of the creditors in carrying on the business, and their trustee in holding the money for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-8\">Estes may have been a trustee for Gschwend to the extent of taking good care of the property, using it for the purposes of the trust and delivering it back to Gschwend when the debts were paid; but Estes was in no sense of the word an agent of Gschwend\u2019s in disbursing the profits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>R. McGarvey, T. L. Garothers and Lamar &amp; Lozier, </em>for the Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b153-6\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The agreement between the parties was that Estes should take the property <em>\u201cas trustee for the </em>creditors,\u201d and the court below found that the plaintiff, immediately after the signing of the .agreement, delivered the property to Estes, who \u201cproceeded to execute his trust according to the terms of the assignment, for the benefit of the plaintiff\u2019s creditors\u201d\u2014 the defendants in this action. The court further found that some of the defendants directed and controlled Estes in the management of the business, and that they \u201cheld frequent meetings * <em>* </em>* for the purpose of managing said business and advising said Estes, and appointed one of their members treasurer, whose duty it was to receive, and who did receive, part of the moneys \u201d\u2014the proceeds of the sale of a part of the property transferred to Estes. The court also found that Estes afterward returned to the plaintiff a portion of the property, pursuant to a resolution of a meeting of the creditors directing him to do so. A further finding is that the profits received by Estes from the management and sale of the property amounted to several thousand dollars, and that no part of such profits was applied by Estes to the payment of the debts due to the defendants, but the whole of such profits was retained by Estes and converted to his own use. We are of opinion that upon these facts the plaintiff is equitably entitled to have an account of the moneys received by Estes taken under the direction of the court, and to a decree applying the same as a credit upon the several debts of the defendants <em>pro rata. </em>The judgment of the court below is therefore reversed, and the conclusions of law set aside and the 'cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
