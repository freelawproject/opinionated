Licenses to take tolls on wharves within the city limits shall be issued for one year, and the owner, proprietor or manager of each wharf on which tolls are taken, or wharfage is collected, shall procure from the city collector, on or before the twentieth day of July of each year, a \u2018Wharf License,\u2019 for which he shall pay the sum of fifty dollars per annum.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-15\">The defendant was the owner of a wharf in the city, and failed to pay the license for the year commencing July 20, 1874. This action was commenced against him in the Police Court of the city to recover the license. The defendant, in his answer, denied the legality of the tax. The plaintiff had judgment, and the defendant appealed to the County Court. The plaintiff recovered judgment in the County Court, and the defendant appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>Geo.

And the case should have been transferred to the District Court. <em>(Mahlstadt </em>v. <em>Blanc, </em>34 Cal. 578.) That court, irrespective of the amount involved, alone had jurisdiction to determine the question. (Sec. 6, Art. YI, State Constitution.) The judgment of the County Court is reviewable by this court, in all cases which <em>\u201cinvolve the legality of any tax.\u201d </em>(Sec. 966, Code Civil Procedure.) And this court has appellate jurisdiction in \u201call cases at law which involve the legality of any tax.\u201d (Sec. 4, Art. VI, State Constitution.) The license was a tax. <em>(Attorney-General </em>v. <em>Squires, </em>14 Cal. 18; <em>Ex parte Hurl, </em>49 Cal. 557; Cooley on Limitations, 201; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stodder, 2 </em>Cush. 573.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-6\"><em>W.

' (Pol. Code, sec. 4427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">It is provided by section 933, Code of Civil Procedure, that \u201call proceedings in civil actions in Police Courts must, except as in this title otherwise provided, -be conducted in the same manner as civil actions in Justices\u2019 Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>It appears by the answer in this case,- verified by the oath of the defendant, that the determination of the action will necessarily involve the question of the legality of the charge for the license, if such charge is a tax within the meaning of section 838, Code of Civil Procedure, and section 6, Article 6, of the Constitution. A license charge or fee for the transaction of business, is in our opinion a tax within the meaning of the term \u201ctax,\u201d as employed in those sections. It is not a tax within the meaning of section 13 of Article 11 of the Constitution, but is a tax in a large sense, as being a charge or burden imposed upon persons, property or business, to raise money for \u25a0 public purposes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>4 Cal. 46; <em>People </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>34 Cal. 492; <em>Sacramento </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>16 Cal. 119; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>31 Cal. 240; <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Gas Co., </em>28 Cal. 345; <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>29 Cal. 75; <em>ex parte Hurl, </em>49 Cal. 557; Cooley, Const. Lim., 201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The Police Court, therefore, upon the filing of the answer, had no jurisdiction to proceed with the trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to reverse the judgment of the Police Court, and remand the cause to that court, with directions to certify the pleadings in the cause to the clerk of the District Court of that county in accordance with the provisions of section 838, Code Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">\" Mr. Chief Justice Wallace did not express an opinion in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
