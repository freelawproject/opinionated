After summons had been served, the court made an order under section 1254 of the Code of Civil Procedure, authorizing the company to take possession of and use the land sought to be condemned until the final conclusion of the proceedings, upon giving bonds to pay damages. The bonds were given and approved, and a writ of assistance issued out of the court to the sheriff, who, by virtue thereof, placed the railroad company in possession of the land. The owners of the land thereupon obtained a writ to have the proceedings certified to the Supreme Court for review.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-13\"><em>T. B.

Younger, </em>for the Railroad Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">That provision of our Constitution relative to taking private property for public use, is not to be construed as though it read that possession should not be taken until compensation shall first have been-made. To so read it would be an interpolation. This provision is the same as was that of New York; and at the time this provision was incorporated into our Constitution its settled construction by the courts of New York was that private property could be entered upon and taken possession of for public use prior to compensation being made to the owner. <em>(Bloodgood </em>v. <em>Mohawk &amp; Hudson River Railroad Co., </em>14 Wend. 52; same case in 18 Id. 9.) This provision was adopted by the framers of our Constitution with a view of this construction placed upon it by the courts of New York, and its correctness acquiesced in. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>4 Cal. 46.) The general current of authority upholds section 1251 of the Code of Civil Procedure. <em>(Cushman </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>34 Me. 247; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Western Pacific R. R. Co., </em>31 Cal. 538; <em>Wheelock </em>v. <em>Young, </em>4 Wend. 648; Pierce\u2019s American Railway Law, 161.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-9\"><em>H. H. Haight, </em>also for the Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-10\">Is the rule of precedent or concurrent payment, under our State Constitution, an inflexible rule? That it is not so, see Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, pp. 560, 562-4. On page 562 this author says that \u201cthis is <em>not </em>an inflexible rule.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Of course the rule must be inflexible, or else it rests with the Legislature to determine, within reasonable limits, how and in what way payment must be secured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">In some cases, as where there are conflicting claims of title, it seems generally conceded that the payment of the appraised amount into court satisfies the constitutional requirement\", whether the estate is a mere fee simple or a leasehold, long or short.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-7\">The difference in phraseology in other State constitutions is noticed on page 563 (note) of Judge Cooley\u2019s work.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-8\">The argument of petitioners is that the court should insert the word \u201cfirst\u201d in the clause of our State Constitution where the framers of the instrument have omitted it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-9\">It is said by the same author, that there is a difference between the case of taking by the public for the State, county, or city, and taking for a quasi-public corporation \u2019 owned by private persons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-10\">Where is the ground for this ? The property is taken for public use in both cases, and must be so regarded, or there would be no right to take at all. The Constitution lays down <em>one rule for all cases. </em>(2 Kent\u2019s Com. 340-1; Smith\u2019s Com. 474, 486; Sedgwick, 525-6; <em>Bloodgood </em>v. <em>Mohawk &amp; H. R. R. Co., </em>18 Wend. 16, 37, 76-8.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-11\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">It is not necessary, in this case, to decide whether, under the Constitution of California, it is essential to the validity of a law for the exercise of eminent domain (when the property is taken directly by the State or by a municipal corporation by State authority), that it should provide for tender of pecuniary compensation <em>before </em>actual taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">When property is taken by a private corporation, which, although for this purpose it is regarded as the agent of the State, appropriates it as well for the benefit and profit of the members of the corporation as for the public use, it is at least essential that an adequate fund (in the custody of an agent of the public other than the corporation, or its officers) be provided, from which the owner of the property can certainly obtain compensation. As remarked by Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Justice Cooley: \u201cIt is not competent to deprive him (the citizen) of his property, and turn him over to <em>an action at lato </em>against a corporation, which may or may not prove responsible, and to a judgment of uncertain efficacy.\u201d (Con. Lim. 562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We are satisfied that wise policy and sound constitutional principles require us to hold that a <em>bond, </em>executed by sureties who may be supposed to be, or who in fact may be, responsible, when the preliminary order is made, does not constitute a certain and adequate compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">If the corporation has acted on the order of the district judge, the property of the petitioners has been actually taken. <em>(San Mateo Water Co. </em>v. <em>Sharpstein, </em>50 Cal. 284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">If it be competent to the Legislature to declare that a mere bond shall constitute compensation upon a taking at the commencement of the condemnation proceedings, it might also declare that such bonds should constitute compensation upon the final taking\u2014which would operate a plain violation of the provisions of the Constitution restraining the exercise of eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Order annulled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
