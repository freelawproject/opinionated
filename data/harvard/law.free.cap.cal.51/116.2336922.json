That, on the 18th day of March, 1873, Patrick Collier, an employee, was working in the bottom of the shaft, when, owing to the negligence and want of skill of Westlake, a tub of water fell down the shaft, and Collier was killed. There was no averment that the defendants were negligent in employing Clenden. The plaintiff sued as the administratrix of his estate. The court sustained a demurrer to the complaint because it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The plaintiff declined to amend, and judgment was rendered for the defendants. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-6\"><em>Armstrong &amp; Hinkson, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-7\"><em>Farley &amp; Porter, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b133-8\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The demurrer to the complaint was properly sustained. Plaintiff, the appellant, relies on section 1970 of the Civil Code, which provides: \u201cAn employer is not bound to indemnify his employee for losses suffered by the latter in consequence of the ordinary risks of the business in which he is employed, nor in consequence of the negligence of another person employed by the same employer, in the same general business, unless he has neglected to use ordinary care in the selection of the culpable employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">The complaint alleges that the defendants had no immediate connection with the employment of Westlake, the engineer, or of any other of the laborers, servants or em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ployees, but that Clenden, the superintendent, \u201chad full power and authority to superintend, direct, manage and control the working and operating of said mines, and to employ any and all servants and laborers in and about the working and operating thereof, and to discharge them or any of them <em>at discretion, </em>in the name of, for, and on behalf of the defendants.\u201d This averment is not qualified by the subsequent allegation that all servants and laborers \u201cwere under the immediate control and direction of defendants <em>through their said agent.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The complaint counts on the negligence and want of skill of Westlake, the engineer, and that \u201cdefendants did not use ordinary skill in selecting said Westlake.\u201d But as we have seen, Westlake was employed by and was under the direction of Clenden, the superintendent, and there is no averment that the defendants were negligent in selecting and employing Clenden.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
