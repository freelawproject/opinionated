In 1868 the Legislature passed another act for the sale of the whole water front of San Francisco, under which, commissioners were appointed to make the sale. These commissioners sold and conveyed to Boche and Conroy a part of the land previously sold to the plaintiff, claiming that the commissioners of 1853 had no power to sell the same. A part of the land conveyed under the act of 1868, to Boche and Conroy, was without the red line and a part of it within the red line. The plaintiff alleged that the deed to Boche and Conroy was a cloud on his title, and brought this action to remove it. The court below found as a conclusion of law, that the commissioners, appointed by the act of 1853, had no power to sell land without the red line, and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill as to such land, but gave him judgment as to the remainder. He appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-6\"><em>B. S. Brooks, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-7\"><em>D.
