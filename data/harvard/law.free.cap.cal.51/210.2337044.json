The action was dismissed as to all the defendants except William Monahan and T. F. Reardon. Said last-named defendants were partners in buying and selling real estate, and on the 1st day of February, 1869, contracted to sell, and that the Mission Yiew Homestead Association should execute to the plaintiff a good deed of conveyance which should convey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the title to a portion of block 122, in San Francisco. The defendants knew that the Association had no title to the lot,' but represented that it owned it. The plaintiff paid four hundred and forty dollars of the purchase-price in gold coin, and placed improvements on the premises of the value of five hundred and forty dollars. The plaintiff complied with his part of the contract and tendered the balance of the purchase-price before the commencement of the suit, but the defendants failed to convey the title because it was out of their power, but they offered to give the deed of the Mission Homestead Association, which the plaintiff refused to receive because the Association had no title. The pleadings admitted that four hundred and forty dollars in gold coin was paid on the purchase-price, but the court found as a fact that four hundred and sixty dollars were paid. The court also found that the plaintiff erected improvements on the premises of the value of five hundred and forty dollars, without designating the kind of money, and rendered judgment for the four hundred and sixty dollars, and five hundred and forty dollars and interest, all in-gold coin. The plaintiff had not been ejected from the premises by the owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-4\">The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-5\"><em>Sharp &amp; Lloyd and W.

The finding in this respect is that Monahan and Beardon \u201c contracted to sell and cause to be conveyed to the plaintiff the lot of land described in the complaint,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The record does not contain any evidence given at the trial. For aught that appears, therefore, the alleged contract was in writing. It was not necessary that the complaint should contain an allegation that the contract was in writing; nor was it necessary that the findings should set forth that it was in writing. If the contract was in fact merely verbal, objections should have been taken to the character of the proof offered to establish it, and if the objections were overruled, an exception should have been properly reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">In the absence of such a record we must assume that the contract was in writing; and in this view the argument made in the petition has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Eehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
