Section 2934 of the Civil Code does not refer to a party who pays his own note, secured by mortgage, and purchases the mortgaged premises, without requiring the note to be delivered up or canceled in his presence. A party has a right to require the surrender of the note, or the indorsement thereon of payment, or a receipt exonerating the party paying written thereon, before he is obliged to pay, except in case of a lost note, when bond of indemnity is required.
