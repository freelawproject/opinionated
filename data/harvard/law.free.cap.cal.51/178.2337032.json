Pryor, deceased, at the time of his death, that lies to the north of the land now occupied by the said Paula Romero de Gaze. The demanded premises were the north half of the vineyard mentioned in the will of Nathaniel M. Pryor, the father of the plaintiff. A history of the case is found in <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>Downey </em>(50 Cal. 388). The plaintiff had judgment and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-7\"><em>A.

The judgment in that case having been affirmed, the judgment in this as to that portion of the property, will also be affirmed under the stipulation. And we think the judgment as to the remainder of the property must likewise be affirmed. The action is ejectment in the usual form, and in the complaint the plaintiff avers that at a specified time before the commencement of this action, he was the owner in fee of said premises, and whilst so the owner and in possession, was ousted by the defendants, who have ever since withheld the possession. In the answer the defendants admit the possession of a portion of the premises and disclaim title or possession as to the remainder. As to the portion of which possession is admitted, the answer avers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>that the defendants \u201chold said last-described premises and claim the fee of the same as the heirs at law of P. N. Madigan, deceased,\u201d and then proceeds to deraign the title of P. N. Madigan, under the sale made by Forster as administrator of Nathaniel M. Pryor, deceased, being the same sale which we held to be void in <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>Downey. </em>The averment that the defendants \u201cclaim the fee\u201d as the heirs at law of Madigan, whose title they proceed to deraign under the administrator\u2019s sale, is only an averment that by means of that sale Madigan acquired the title, and is in no sense a denial that the plaintiff is the owner in fee, unless the title passed to Madigan under the sale of the administrator. In other words, there is no denial that the plaintiff is the owner in fee unless Madigan acquired the title at the administrator\u2019s sale, and as we hold the sale to be void, it results that the plaintiff\u2019s title is admitted by the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
