If it was harvested before that time, the plaintiffs have no claim to that portion of it which Case had agreed to deliver to Aurrecochea. As to how the fact was in this respect, cannot be satisfactorily ascertained by construction of the exceedingly loose averments found in the complaint\u2014even when aided by resort to notice which courts will take as to the time of harvest in the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
