Bernhardt (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Howard County to hear this attorney discipline proceeding. On November 17, 18, and 19, 2014, the hearing judge conducted a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 29, 2014, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Haley had violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(a), 1.7(a), 1.15(a), 1.15(c), 1.16(d), 8.4(c), 8.4(d), 8.4(a), and BOP \u00a7 10-306.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">On June 3, 2015, we heard oral argument. On June 5, 2015, we disbarred Haley. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>Haley, </em>443 Md. 227, 115 A.3d 1260 (2015) (per curiam). We now explain the reasons for Haley\u2019s disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">On May 30, 2007, this Court admitted Haley to the Bar of Maryland. Haley worked for various federal agencies. In 2010, Haley became a solo practitioner in Columbia, Maryland. Haley\u2019s primary areas of practice included family law, criminal law, and labor law.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Before he performed any legal services, Haley received a flat fee from each of the six clients who ended up filing complaints against him with the Commission. In each case, without his client\u2019s consent, Haley deposited the unearned fee into an operating account instead of an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Haley\u2019s professional relationship with each of the six clients followed a similar pattern. At the beginning of the representation, Haley communicated appropriately with the client. As the representation progressed, Haley became less responsive to the client\u2019s inquiries. Haley\u2019s final communications with the client usually involved an argument, during which Haley would exhibit hostility and blame the client for the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">\n<em>Vemita Ali Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">In 2012, on her own behalf, Vernita Ali (\u201cAli\u201d) filed a motion to modify custody in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. A hearing on the motion to modify was scheduled for July 31, 2012. On June 7, 2012, Ali and Haley executed an attorney-client agreement, and Ali paid Haley a $2,800 flat fee. Without Ali\u2019s consent, Haley deposited the fee into an operating account instead of an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Haley and Ali agreed that Haley would enter his appearance on Ali\u2019s behalf, file a supplemental motion to modify, and represent Ali at the hearing on the motion to modify. Haley did not perform any of these tasks. In June and July 2012, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Ali attempted to contact Haley, who did not respond. At some point before July 10, 2012, Ali and Haley spoke via telephone; Ali asked about the case\u2019s status; an argument ensued; and Haley hung up on Ali. On July 10, 2012, Ali terminated the representation and requested a full refund of the fee. On July 31, 2012, Ali appeared on her own behalf at the hearing on the motion to modify, and did not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">In April 2013, Ali filed a complaint against Haley with the Commission. Afterward, Haley refunded Ali $2,307.56 of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\n<em>Keith Boyd Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">On October 10, 2011, Keith Boyd (\u201cBoyd\u201d) retained Haley to represent him in a child custody case. Boyd paid Haley a $2,800 flat fee. Without Boyd\u2019s consent, Haley deposited the fee into an operating account instead of an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">On February 23, 2012, on Boyd\u2019s behalf, Haley filed a motion to modify custody in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Haley and Boyd appeared at a hearing at which Haley repeatedly disregarded Boyd\u2019s instructions. For example, Haley disregarded Boyd\u2019s instruction to introduce Boyd\u2019s child\u2019s school attendance records; Haley relied on opposing counsel\u2019s assertion that the records were inaccurate. As another example, Haley disregarded Boyd\u2019s instruction to dispute opposing counsel\u2019s allegation that Boyd had been charged with acts of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">On or about October 1, 2012, Boyd terminated the representation. Haley failed to refund Boyd any of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">\n<em>Tina Myers Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">On May 17, 2012, Tina Myers (\u201cMyers\u201d) retained Haley to represent her in an appeal of a ruling on custody. Myers paid Haley a $3,000 flat fee. Without Myers\u2019s consent, Haley deposited the fee into an operating account instead of an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>On June 14, 2012, on Myers\u2019s behalf, Haley timely filed a \u201cLine, Notice and Leave to Appeal\u201d in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Between May 17, 2012 and July 2, 2012, Myers e-mailed Haley on several occasions to ask about the appeal\u2019s status; Haley responded to only one of Myers\u2019s emails. On July 2, 2012, Myers decided to abandon the appeal and pursue modification of custody instead. Haley failed to timely file a motion to modify custody and failed to refund Myers any of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">\n<em>Demetrius McClarty Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">On March 9, 2012, Demetrius McClarty (\u201cMcClarty\u201d) retained Haley to represent him in a matter concerning modification of joint custody and guardianship. McClarty paid Haley a $2,600 flat fee. Without McClarty\u2019s consent, Haley deposited the fee into an operating account instead of an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On March 28, 2012, Haley and McClarty met to review a motion to modify custody and guardianship that Haley had written. The motion contained several errors, including misspellings of McClarty\u2019s name and incorrect uses of pronouns. On April 13, 2012, Haley filed the motion to modify custody and guardianship in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The motion to modify custody and guardianship included a certificate of service with an incorrect address for McClarty\u2019s ex-wife. Additionally, Haley failed to include with the motion to modify custody and guardianship a domestic case information report, as required by Maryland Rule 2-111 (Process \u2014 Requirements Preliminary to Summons). On April 16, 2012, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County ordered Haley to file a domestic case information report. Haley failed to comply with the order. On May 24, 2012, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County dismissed the motion to modify custody and guardianship without prejudice. Haley failed to inform McClarty of the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On or about June 26, 2012, McClarty terminated the representation. On June 29, 2012, without McClarty\u2019s consent, and despite having reason to know that McClarty had terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the representation, Haley filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County a second motion to modify custody and guardianship and an answer to McClarty\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s motion for contempt. Haley did not provide McClarty a copy of either filing. On July 23, 2012, Haley filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County a motion to strike his appearance. Haley failed to provide McClarty with five days\u2019 written notice of his intent to withdraw, as required by Maryland Rule 2-132 (Striking of Attorney\u2019s Appearance). And, Haley failed to refund McClarty any of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">\n<em>Eric Hemphill Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In 2012, Eric Hemphill (\u201cHemphill\u201d) retained Haley to represent him in a custody case. Hemphill informed Haley that he wanted joint legal and shared physical custody of his two children. Hemphill paid Haley a $2,600 flat fee. Without Hemphill\u2019s consent, Haley deposited the fee into an operating account instead of an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">On February 28, 2012, Haley filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County a motion to modify custody. Despite Haley\u2019s knowledge that Hemphill wanted joint legal and shared physical custody, the motion to modify custody stated that Hemphill requested primary physical custody. Hemphill\u2019s children\u2019s mother filed a counter-motion to modify custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore County conducted a scheduling conference, at which Haley failed to appear. On November 13, 2012, Hemphill and his children\u2019s mother attended a mediation, at which Haley failed to appear; Haley also failed to prepare Hemphill for the mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">On April 29, 2013, Hemphill\u2019s children\u2019s mother moved for sanctions, alleging that Hemphill had made deficient discovery disclosures. Haley had failed to communicate with Hemphill about discovery. On May 6, 2013, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County conducted a hearing, at which Haley failed to appear. On June 13, 2013, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County conducted another hearing, at which Haley moved to strike his appearance; the Circuit Court for Baltimore County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>granted the motion to strike, and Hemphill proceeded self-represented. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County: dismissed the motion to modify because of the deficient discovery disclosures; granted the counter-motion to modify, thus reducing Hemphill\u2019s visitation and increasing his monthly child support payment; and ordered Hemphill to pay attorney\u2019s fees for his \u201cdisturbing ... recalcitrance in responding to discovery\u201d requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Haley did not refund Hemphill any of the fee, and failed to provide Hemphill with his file after termination of the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\n<em>Kim Glaud\u00e9 Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">In or about 2011, Haley met Kim Glaud\u00e9 (\u201cGlaud\u00e9\u201d) through a dating website. Haley and Glaud\u00e9 chatted online and met for dinner on one occasion; Haley and Glaud\u00e9 planned, but ended up cancelling, a second date.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">On February 8, 2012, Glaud\u00e9 retained Haley to represent her in a matter concerning an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) complaint against her former employer. At that point, Glaud\u00e9 and Haley had not communicated for approximately one year. Glaud\u00e9 paid Haley a $4,500 flat fee. Without Glaud\u00e9\u2019s consent, Haley deposited the fee into an operating account instead of an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">In March 2012, Haley and Glaud\u00e9 met at Haley\u2019s law office to discuss Glaud\u00e9\u2019s case. Haley took Glaud\u00e9 to a back room and kissed her. Glaud\u00e9 immediately objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">On March 28, 2012, Haley failed to appear at a conference with an EEOC investigator; Haley also failed to reschedule the conference. On August 17, 2012, Glaud\u00e9 telephoned Haley and left a voicemail to ask about her case\u2019s status. Haley texted Glaud\u00e9 to state: \u201cI am sorry, I owe you some lips for that. [Yo]u decide where.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">In a letter dated October 18, 2012, Haley terminated the representation. Haley did not refund Glaud\u00e9 any of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Neither party meaningfully excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> thus, we \u201ctreat the [hearing judge\u2019s] findings of fact as established^]\u201d Md.

Additionally, Haley failed to use the thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary to represent Ali, Hemphill, and McClarty. Haley failed to prepare and submit any pleadings or take any action in furtherance of Ali\u2019s case. Haley failed to attend, and prepare Hemphill for, a scheduling conference and a mediation, and also failed to adequately respond to discovery requests. In McClarty\u2019s ease, the motion to modify custody and guardianship included a certificate of service with an incorrect address for McClarty\u2019s ex-wife; Haley also failed to include with the motion a domestic case information report.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">MLRPC 1.2(a) (Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">\u201c[A] lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued.\u201d MLRPC 1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Haley violated MLRPC 1.2(a) in representing Ali, Boyd, Hemphill, and McClarty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Haley failed to abide by his clients\u2019 decisions concerning the representations\u2019 objectives and/or failed to consult -with his clients.

MLRPC 1.7(a) (emphasis added). Although a lawyer\u2019s personal relationship with a client may complicate an attorney-client relationship, we can identify no case in which this Court concluded that a lawyer\u2019s merely social (as opposed to sexual) relationship with a client rose to the level of creating a significant risk that the representation would be materially limited by a personal interest of the lawyer. <em>Cf.
