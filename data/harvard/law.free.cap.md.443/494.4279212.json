Shuler failed to appear before the Court of Special Appeals at the oral argument that had been scheduled in Wilson\u2019s case. On that morning, Shuler telephoned the Office of the Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals to state that she felt too ill to travel that morning and to request that oral argument be resched<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>uled. Sometime afterward, Shuler telephoned the Office of the Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals to check the status of Wilson\u2019s case. Shuler failed to take any further action in Wilson\u2019s case. For example, Shuler failed to file a written explanation for her absence or a written request that oral argument be rescheduled. After the Court of Special Appeals treated Wilson\u2019s case as \u201csubmitted on brief\u2019 and affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, Shuler failed to inform Wilson that he had not prevailed in the appeal. Wilson filed a complaint against Shuler with the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">On May 27, 2014, on the Commission\u2019s behalf, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Shuler, charging her with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4 (Communication), 8.4(d) (Conduct that is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice), and 8.4(a) (Violating the MLRPC).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">On June 12, 2014, this Court designated the Honorable Michele D. Jaklitsch (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to hear this attorney discipline proceeding. On September 11, 2014, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. On November 18, 2014, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Shuler had violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4, 8.4(d), and 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">On May 6, 2015, we heard oral argument. For the below reasons, we suspend Shuler from the practice of law in Maryland for thirty days, with a condition precedent to reinstatement that Shuler satisfactorily demonstrate, by the report of a health care professional (acceptable to the Commission and, ultimately, this Court) or other appropriate evidence, that she is mentally and physically competent to resume the practice of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On December 19, 2002, this Court admitted Shuler to the Bar of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">On July 17, 2012, Wilson retained Shuler to represent him as the appellant in an appeal in a civil case. On July 24, 2012, on Wilson\u2019s behalf, Shuler timely filed a brief in the Court of Special Appeals. On January 31, 2013, Shuler e-mailed Wilson to state that oral argument had been scheduled for February 5, 2013, and that she would \u201cbe there[.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">On February 5, 2013, Shuler failed to appear at oral argument. Shuler had intended to appear at oral argument, but felt too ill to travel that morning.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shuler testified that, on that morning, she telephoned the Office of the Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals to state that she felt too ill to travel that morning and to request that oral argument be rescheduled; according to Shuler, an employee of the Office of the Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals told her that the judges who had been assigned to Wilson\u2019s case did not think that oral argument would be necessary. Sometime afterward, Shuler telephoned the Office of the Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals to check the status of Wilson\u2019s case. Shuler failed to take any further action in Wilson\u2019s case; for example, Shuler failed to file a written explanation for her absence or a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>request that oral argument be rescheduled. Thus, Shuler failed to advance Wilson\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">On April 10, 2013, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment in Wilson\u2019s case. Shuler failed to inform Wilson that he had not prevailed in the appeal. Thus, Shuler caused Wilson to lose the opportunity to timely petition for writ of <em>certiorari </em>in this Court. Shuler\u2019s mental state was one of carelessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">On July 23, 2013, Bar Counsel of the District of Columbia informally admonished Shuler for violating, among others,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> District of Columbia Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) (\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... [ejngage in conduct that seriously interferes with the administration of justice[.]\u201d) by failing to appear at a court-ordered mediation and two hearings and by appearing late and unprepared at a third hearing, all within one case other than Wilson\u2019s, approximately between October 2012 and January 2013; at one of the hearings at which Shuler failed to appear, another lawyer appeared on Shuler\u2019s behalf and stated that Shuler was ill. Thus, Shuler has demonstrated a pattern of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">On June 19, 2014, Shuler was served with the Commission\u2019s interrogatories and requests for production of documents. On July 6, 2014, Shuler mailed to the Commission answers to the Commission\u2019s interrogatories, but failed to respond to the Commission\u2019s requests for production of documents. On both July 14, 2014 and July 21, 2014, Bar Counsel e-mailed Shuler to outline deficiencies in her answers to the Commission\u2019s interrogatories. Shuler failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s emails. On August 15, 2014, the Commission filed a motion to compel and a motion to shorten the time to respond to the motion to compel. The hearing judge granted the motion to shorten time, and ordered that Shuler respond to the motion to compel by August 22, 2014. Shuler failed to respond to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>motion to compel. On August 25, 2014, the hearing judge granted the motion to compel, and ordered that Shuler provide new answers to the Commission\u2019s interrogatories and respond to the Commission\u2019s requests for production of documents by August 30, 2014. Shuler intentionally failed to provide the discovery materials; instead, on August 27, 2014, Shuler filed a motion to dismiss in which she contended that she did not need to provide the discovery materials. Thus, Shuler engaged in bad faith obstruction of this attorney discipline proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">As to mitigating circumstances, Shuler lacked a dishonest or selfish motive with respect to the MLRPC violations that the Commission charged, and had personal problems in the form of a history of physical illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference a hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court [of Appeals] shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Marcalus, </em>442 Md. 197, 202, 112 A.3d 375, 378 (2015) (\u201c[T]his Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact[.]\u201d) (Citations omitted); Md. R. 16-759(b)(l) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the [hearing] judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d). This Court determines whether clear and convincing evidence establishes that a lawyer violated an MLRPC. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-757(b) (\u201cThe [Commission] has the burden of proving the averments of the petition [for disciplinary or remedial action] by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">(A) Contentions Other Than Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In a \u201cMotion to Dismiss or Request for New Hearing or Allowance for Presentation of Rebuttal Evidence,\u201d Shuler contends that her right to due process was violated during this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>attorney discipline proceeding. Shuler appeared at the hearing and had the opportunity to observe all of the Commission\u2019s evidence, cross-examine the Commission\u2019s witnesses, offer her own evidence, and argue before the hearing judge; thus, we deny Shuler\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">After the hearing, the Commission filed in this Court a \u201cMotion to Supplement the Record\u201d with a purportedly \u201cretaliatory\u201d e-mail from Shuler to Wilson. Shuler filed in this Court a \u201cMotion for Sanctions Against [Bar Counsel] and [Assistant Bar Counsel] and Response to the [Commission's [Motion to] Supplement\u201d in which \u201cShuler requests monetary damages for having to miss work due to having to respond to the\u201d motion to supplement. The Commission failed to attach the e-mail to the motion to supplement; thus, we deny the motion to supplement. The Commission prevails in this attorney discipline proceeding; thus, the Commission \u201cis entitled to costs\u201d under Maryland Rule 16-761(a), and we deny Shuler\u2019s motion for \u201csanctions.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">(B) Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The Commission does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact that are discussed above.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In her exceptions, in some instances, Shuler alleges facts without indicating whether the record contains evidence of those alleged facts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This Court overrules a party\u2019s exception to a hearing judge\u2019s finding of fact where the party alleges a fact without indicating whether the record contains evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>alleged fact. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Davy, </em>435 Md. 674, 693-94, 80 A.3d 322, 333 (2013) (\u201c[I]n no instance does [the respondent] demonstrate that anything in the record contradicts any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact____ [U]nable to discern any meaningful challenge to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we overrule the exceptions[.]\u201d (Footnote omitted)). In her exceptions, in other instances, Shuler alleges that her testimony contradicts the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. A contradiction between a witness\u2019s testimony and a hearing judge\u2019s finding of fact does not alone establish that the hearing judge clearly erred; the hearing judge\u2019s role is to credit or discredit the witness\u2019s testimony, <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Felder, </em>440 Md. 272, 287, 102 A.3d 321, 330 (2014) (\u201c[T]he hearing judge is permitted to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon from a conflicting array when determining findings of fact.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)), and this Court defers to the hearing judge\u2019s determination of credibility, <em>see </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court [of Appeals] shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d). Here, we decline Shuler\u2019s invitation to second-guess the hearing judge\u2019s determination of credibility, and we overrule all of Shuler\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">(C) Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The Commission does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law based on the facts that are dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>cussed below.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is unclear whether Shuler excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law; to the extent that she does, we overrule her exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u201cA lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d MLRPC 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Shuler violated MLRPC 1.3. Shuler failed to appear at oral argument in Wilson\u2019s case because she felt too ill to travel that morning. Even if we assume, without deciding, that Shuler\u2019s illness was good reason for her failure to appear at oral argument,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and even if we assume that the hearing judge credited Shuler\u2019s testimony that, on the day of oral argument, an employee of the Office of the Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals told Shuler that the judges who had been assigned to Wilson\u2019s case did not think that oral argument would be necessary, Shuler failed to act with reasonable diligence to ameliorate her failure to appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>at oral argument. Aside from telephoning the Office of the Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals on two occasions, Shuler failed to take any further action in Wilson\u2019s case; for example, Shuler failed to file a written explanation for her absence or a written request that oral argument be rescheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) (Communication)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u201cA lawyer shall ... keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter!.]\u201d MLRPC 1.4(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Shuler violated MLRPC 1.4(a)(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Shuler failed to inform Wilson that he had not prevailed in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct that is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice!.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(d). \u201cGenerally, a lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) where the lawyer\u2019s conduct ... would negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of a reasonable member of the public!.]\u201d <em>Marcalus, </em>442 Md. at 205, 112 A.3d at 379 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Shuler violated MLRPC 8.4(d). Shuler failed to appear at oral argument. Aside from telephoning the Office of the Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals on two occasions, Shuler failed to take any further action in Wilson\u2019s case. Shuler also failed to inform Wilson that he had not prevailed in the appeal and deprived him of the opportunity to timely petition for writ of <em>certiorari </em>in this Court. In short, Shuler essentially abandoned her representation of Wilson, and thus engaged in conduct that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of a reasonable member of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">MLRPC 8.4(a) (Violating the MLRPC)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to[ ] violate ... the\u201d MLRPC. MLRPC 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Shuler violated MLRPC 8.4(a). As discussed above, Shuler violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">(D) Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The Commission recommends that we suspend Shuler from the practice of law in Maryland for thirty days, with a condition precedent to reinstatement that Shuler demonstrate, by the report of a health care professional or other proper evidence, that she is mentally and physically competent to resume the practice of law. Shuler does not recommend a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">In <em>Marcalus, </em>442 Md. at 207-08, 112 A.3d at 381, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">This Court sanctions a lawyer not to punish the lawyer, but instead to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession.

Walker-Turner, </em>428 Md. 214, 235, 232, 51 A.3d 553, 565, 563-64 (2012), this Court suspended from the practice of law in Maryland for sixty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>a lawyer who violated MLRPC 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4(a)(2) and (b) (Communication), and 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice). The lawyer failed to appear at a trial, thus causing a trial court to enter judgment against his clients. <em>See id. </em>at 227, 51 A.3d at 561. The lawyer failed to timely inform his clients as much and failed to timely move for reconsideration or to vacate. <em>See id. </em>at 231, 228, 51 A.3d at 563, 561. The lawyer\u2019s mental state was one of <em>\u201cinadverten[ce]\u201d </em>\u2014 ie., negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 234, 51 A.3d at 565. The lawyer\u2019s misconduct negatively impacted the creditworthiness of one of his clients. <em>See id. </em>at 234, 51 A.3d at 565. This Court noted two aggravating factors: (1) prior attorney discipline in the form of a thirty-day suspension for violating MLRPC 5.5(a) (Unauthorized Practice of Law) and two reprimands by the Commission; and (2) a pattern of misconduct in the form of failing to appear for court dates, as, in a previous instance, the lawyer had failed to appear at a court date and failed to properly communicate with his client. <em>See id. </em>at 232-33, 234, 51 A.3d at 564, 565. This Court noted one mitigating factor: character, as the lawyer was \u201cactive in local legal and community organizations, [and] offer[ed] pro bono representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, 51 A.3d at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Here, Shuler violated MLRPC 1.3 by failing to act with reasonable diligence to ameliorate her failure to appear at oral argument; MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) by failing to inform Wilson that he had not prevailed in the appeal; and MLRPC 8.4(d) by essentially abandoning her representation of Wilson. The hearing judge found that Shuler was careless \u2014 ie., negligent \u2014 and that Shuler failed to advance Wilson\u2019s interests and caused him to lose the opportunity to timely petition for writ of <em>certiorari </em>in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The hearing judge found two mitigating factors: (1) the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive with respect to the MLRPC violations that the Commission charged; and (2) personal problems, as Shuler has a history of physical illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>We note four aggravating factors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> First, Shuler has committed multiple violations of the MLRPC. Second, the hearing judge found that Shuler engaged in bad faith obstruction of this attorney discipline proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the hearing judge\u2019s orders to respond to the motion to compel and to provide discovery materials.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Third and fourth, the hearing judge found that Shuler has received prior attorney discipline and has demonstrated a pattern of misconduct. Bar Counsel of the District of Columbia informally admonished Shuler for, among other things, failing to appear at a court-ordered mediation and two hearings and appearing late and unprepared at a third hearing, within a case other than Wilson\u2019s, approximately between October 2012 and January 2013; at one of the hearings at which Shuler failed to appear, another lawyer appeared on Shuler\u2019s behalf and stated that Shuler was ill. Similarly, here, Shuler failed to appear at oral argument due to illness in February 2013 and failed to act with reasonable diligence to ameliorate her failure to appear at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We agree with the Commission that the appropriate sanction for Shuler\u2019s misconduct is a thirty-day suspension from the practice of law in Maryland, with a condition precedent to reinstatement that Shuler satisfactorily demonstrate, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>report of a health care professional (acceptable to the Commission and, ultimately, this Court) or other appropriate evidence, that she is mentally and physically competent to resume the practice of law. As the hearing judge found, Shuler has demonstrated a pattern of misconduct; Wilson\u2019s was the second case in which Shuler both failed to appear at a court date due to illness and failed to sufficiently ameliorate her failure to appear. Although occasionally missing court dates due to illness may be excusable, doing so repeatedly within a five-month period and without sufficient amelioration is not. Despite having been informally admonished by Bar Counsel of the District of Columbia, Shuler once again missed a court date and failed to ameliorate her failure to appear; thus, we must do more than slap Shuler on the wrist to protect the public and to impress upon Shuler the importance of remedying failures to appear and managing health issues so that they do not cause violations of the MLRPC. A reprimand would be particularly insufficient in light of the circumstance that Shuler has engaged in bad faith obstruction of this attorney discipline proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">That said, we agree with the Commission that Shuler\u2019s misconduct is similar to, but not as egregious as, that of the lawyer in <em>Walker-Turner, </em>428 Md. 214, 51 A.3d 553. Like the lawyer in <em>Walker-Turner, id. </em>at 227, 234, 228, 51 A.3d at 561, 565, Shuler failed to appear for a court date and negligently failed to sufficiently ameliorate her failure to appear. Unlike the lawyer in <em>Walker-Turner, id. </em>at 227, 51 A.3d at 561, however, Shuler failed to sufficiently ameliorate her failure to appear at an oral argument, not a trial. Failing to appear at an oral argument can be detrimental to, but is not necessarily fatal to, a party\u2019s case in the Court of Special Appeals; by contrast, failing to appear at trial almost always results in an adverse judgment, and that is exactly what happened in <em>Walker-Turner, id. </em>at 228, 51 A.3d at 561. Thus, in <em>Walker-Turner, id. </em>at 234, 51 A.3d at 565, the lawyer\u2019s misconduct was not only fatal to his clients\u2019 case, but also detrimental to the creditworthiness of one of his clients. Additionally, in <em>Walker-Turner, id. </em>at 232-33, 51 A.3d at 564, this Court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>already suspended the lawyer from the practice of law in Maryland for thirty days in a previous attorney discipline proceeding. Thus, Shuler\u2019s misconduct merits a lesser sanction than the sixty-day suspension that this Court imposed in <em>Walker-Turner, id. </em>at 235, 51 A.3d at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In an \u201cOpposition to the [Commission]\u2019s Request for a Report from a Medical Doctor as a Condition of Re-Admission, Sanction and Request for Reimbursement,\u201d Shuler seemingly contends that this Court cannot condition reinstatement on evidence that Shuler is mentally and physically competent to resume the practice of law because the record does not indicate that she has been diagnosed with any mental or physical condition. To the extent that Shuler contends as much, she is mistaken. Nothing in Maryland Rule 16-760(g) (Orders for Suspension or Inactive Status), Maryland Rule 16-760(h) (Conditions),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or this Court\u2019s precedent indicates that this Court cannot condition reinstatement on evidence that a lawyer is mentally and physically competent to resume the practice of law unless the record indicates that the lawyer has been diagnosed with a mental or physical condition. Indeed, the record need not indicate as much, as, in requiring as a condition precedent to reinstatement evidence that a lawyer is mentally and physically competent to resume the practice of law, this Court is not determining that the lawyer has a mental or physical condition; to the contrary, this Court is simply seeking additional information in furtherance of this Court\u2019s goals to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Even if the record needed to provide a factual basis for this Court to condition reinstatement on evidence that a lawyer is mentally and physically competent to resume the practice of law, the instant record provides such a factual basis. Based on evidence that Shuler herself offered,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the hearing judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>found that Shuler has a history of physical illnesses. As to Shuler\u2019s mental capacity, Shuler\u2019s filings include several concerning assertions; for example, in her exceptions, Shuler contends that this attorney discipline \u201cproceeding is in violation of her first amendment right [sic] because the Commission and Court has [sic] infringed upon right [sic] to practice her religious beliefs by alleging that she have [sic] a personal or emotional problem and/or is unethical by refusing to talk by telephone in an association with a person she consider [sic] to be a disgusting human being for his disrespectful and ungrateful conduct therefore limiting her communications by email alone.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Of course, in an attorney discipline proceeding, a respondent has the right to make any argument that he or she wishes before this Court, and this Court cannot conclude within the same attorney discipline proceeding that the respondent violated an MLRPC in making an argument before this Court. <em>See Bar Ass\u2019n of Balt. City v. Cockrell, </em>274 Md. 279, 287, 334 A.2d 85, 89 (1975) (\u201c[W]e confine [the respondent\u2019s accountability for professional misconduct to the charges contained in the \u2018Petition for Discipline^]\u2019 \u201d). That said, where this Court has determined that a respondent violated an MLRPC based on facts that are mentioned in the petition for disciplinary or remedial action, this Court may, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>purposes of determining an appropriate sanction, consider the respondent\u2019s actions during the attorney discipline proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Marcalus, </em>442 Md. at 207-08, 112 A.3d at 381 (This Court listed as aggravating factors \u201cbad faith obstruction of the attorney discipline proceeding\u201d and \u201cdeceptive practices during the attorney discipline proceeding[.]\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">For the above reasons, we suspend Shuler from the practice of law in Maryland for thirty days, with a condition precedent to reinstatement that Shuler satisfactorily demonstrate, by the report of a health care professional (acceptable to the Commission and, ultimately, this Court) or other appropriate evidence, that she is mentally and physically competent to resume the practice of law.

Both before the hearing judge and in this Court, Shuler has alleged that she agreed only to file a brief, not to appear at oral argument; however, the hearing judge found that Wilson retained Shuler to represent him in an appeal, and that Shuler promised to appear at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b545-10\">.

For the same reason, we also deny Shuler\u2019s request for \"reimbursement\u201d made in an \"Opposition to the [Commission]\u2019s Request for a Report from a Medical Doctor as a Condition of Re-Admission, Sanction and Request for Reimbursement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">. The Commission excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding as to the date on which Wilson filed a complaint against Shuler with the Commission. We do not mention that date; thus, we need not rule on the Commission\u2019s exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b548-10\">. For example, without referencing the record, Shuler alleges certain facts in an attempt to challenge the validity of the informal admonition that she received from Bar Counsel of the District of Columbia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\">. To the extent that the \"Motion to Dismiss or Request for New Hearing or Allowance for Presentation of Rebuttal Evidence\u201d purportedly contains exceptions to the hearing judge's findings of fact, we decline to consider them because Shuler filed the motion before the hearing judge filed an opinion, thus making it impossible for the motion to address the hearing judge's findings of fact. <em>Cf. Davy, </em>435 Md. at 692, 80 A.3d at 332 (\"[W]e decline to consider the 'Motion to Dismiss.\u2019 Because [the respondent] filed the 'Motion to Dismiss' before the hearing judge issued her opinion, the \u2018Motion to Dismiss\u2019 does not address the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact[J\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. The Commission excepts to the hearing judge's conclusion that Shuler violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by failing to timely respond to the Commission's requests for discovery materials and by providing deficient answers to the Commission's interrogatories. We agree with the Commission that this Court cannot conclude that a respondent violated an MLRPC based on circumstances that the Commission did not allege in the petition for disciplinary or remedial action. <em>See Bar Ass\u2019n of Balt. City v. Cockrell, </em>274 Md. 279, 287, 334 A.2d 85, 89 (1975) (\"[W]e confine [the respondentj's accountability for professional misconduct to the charges contained in the 'Petition for Discipline^]' \u201d). That said, as discussed below, we agree with the hearing judge's conclusion that Shuler violated MLRPC 8.4(d) based on other facts. Additionally, in determining the appropriate sanction, we consider the hearing judge's finding that Shuler engaged in bad faith obstruction of this attorney discipline proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the hearing judge\u2019s orders to respond to the motion to compel and to provide discovery materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\">. A lawyer violates MLRPC 1.3 by \"fail[ing] to appear for [a] scheduled court date[] without good reason[.]\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The hearing judge found one additional aggravating factor: refusal to acknowledge the misconduct\u2019s wrongful nature. The hearing judge provided the following basis for this finding: \u201c[Shuler] did not apologize to [] Wilson[,] and never explained her absence to the Court of Special Appeals.\u2019\u2019 As to the former assertion, we are not convinced that the mere fact that a lawyer did not apologize for misconduct alone establishes that the lawyer refused to acknowledge the misconduct\u2019s wrongful nature. As to the latter assertion, the hearing judge found that Shuler testified that, on the morning of the date of oral argument, she telephoned the Office of the Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals to state that she felt too ill to travel that morning. Thus, we refrain from considering refusal to acknowledge the misconduct's wrongful nature as an aggravating factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">. Shuler's filing of a motion to dismiss in which she contended that she did not need to provide the discovery materials supports the hearing judge\u2019s finding that her failure to comply with the hearing judge's order to provide discovery materials was intentional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\">. Specifically, Shuler testified that she has cardiomyopathy and that, on both the day before and the day of oral argument in Wilson\u2019s case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>she was vomiting and experiencing diarrhea. Consistently, in her exceptions, Shuler asserts that, from December 2012 through February 2013, she was \"continuously ill\" and \"had the flu, sinus infections[,] and [a] stomach virus.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\">. In her exceptions, Shuler also contends that: (1) this attorney discipline proceeding \"is in violation of her first amendment right [sic] because the Commission and Court has [sic] attempted to extort an expression of a feeling of remorse for what occurred in Mr. Wilson\u2019s case when Mr. Wilson misconduct [sic] and lies resulted in his initial termination from employment\u201d; and (2) this attorney discipline \u201cproceeding is in violation of her civil rights by the continued claim that she is incompetent, in experience [sic], and could not do an appellate argument without having knowledge of her employment history, case history, appellate experience or received an evaluation of her skills and overlook the true facts of the case and use false facts to support preconceived bias of Ms. Shuler\u2019s capabilities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b559-8\">BATTAGLIA, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">I respectfully dissent from the thirty-day sanction imposed by the majority, because I believe that an indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Why I would impose a greater sanction relates to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Shuler lacked remorse or, more cogently, that Shuler did not accept responsibility for her acts. The hearing judge found that, \u201c[Shuler] did not apologize to Mr. Wilson and never explained her absence to the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d The hearing judge, additionally, exhorted that she had concerns regarding Shuler, because of \u201c[Shuler\u2019s] refusal to admit or acknowledge any wrongdoing on her part and her lack of remorse for her behavior.\u201d Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>majority overrules Shuler\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding of lack of remorse, it kicks the finding to the side, stating, \u201cwe are not convinced that the mere fact that a lawyer did not apologize for misconduct alone establishes that the lawyer refused to acknowledge the misconduct\u2019s wrongful nature.\u201d Op. at 509 n. 12, 117 A.3d at 47 n. 12. I would not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Further, \u201cfor purposes of determining an appropriate sanction,\u201d we may \u201cconsider the respondent\u2019s actions during the attorney discipline proceeding.\u201d Op. at 513, 117 A.3d at 50. In that vein, Shuler continued to fail to acknowledge any wrongdoing on her part when, before us, she urged that she \u201chas no problem of expressing remorse for something she actually had done wrong; but Mr. Wilson and the Commission presented false evidence\u201d. Shuler again failed to accept responsibility for her failure to appear in the Court of Special Appeals, not informing her client that he had been unsuccessful in his appeal and forsaking a petition for <em>certiorari </em>before us when she, during oral argument, continued to renounce the suggestion that she ought to have apologized to her client:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABD\">[SHULER]: And to say that I should apologize to someone that\u2019s being so disrespectful towards me and who has committed a crime[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] towards me is really being unreasonable and anything that said in court is being unreasonable. In rejecting the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Shuler lacked</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4A\">remorse, the majority relies on <em>Walker-Turner </em>for its conclusion that a thirty-day suspension is appropriate. The lesser sanction in <em>Walker-Turner, </em>however, was directly attributable to Walker-Turner\u2019s clear expression of remorse. We recognized, for example, \u201cthat Walker-Turner worked with [his client\u2019s judgment creditor] in an attempt to cure the consequences of the entry of the judgment\u201d, which was the heart of his transgression. <em>Id. </em>at 234, 51 A.3d at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">More appropriate to our analysis are <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kovacic, </em>389 Md. 233, 884 A.2d 673 (2005), and <em>Attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>Grievance v. Lee, </em>393 Md. 546, 903 A.2d 895 (2006), in which indefinite suspensions were ordered. In <em>Kovacic, </em>the attorney-violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4 and 8.1(b) (failure to respond to Bar Counsel), by failing to communicate with her client in a divorce proceeding and failing to respond timely to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries. We imposed an indefinite suspension, recognizing as a significant aggravating factor that there was no finding of remorse, which left nothing to allay \u201cthe likelihood of a repetition of the conduct.\u201d <em>Kovacic, </em>389 Md. at 240, 884 A.2d at 677; <em>cf. Attorney Grievance v. McClain, </em>373 Md. 196, 212, 817 A.2d 218, 228 (2003) (\u201c[A]n attorney\u2019s voluntary termination of the charged misconduct, when accompanied by an appreciation of the serious impropriety of that past conduct and remorse for it, may be evidence that the attorney will not again engage in such misconduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In <em>Lee, </em>the attorney violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4, 1.16 (Terminating Representation), 3.2 (Expediting Litigation), 8.1(b) and 8.4(d), by failing to respond to requests by the client\u2019s Bankruptcy Trustee as well as Bar Counsel. We noted that Lee had not \u201cdemonstrated remorse\u201d and that subsequent remedial acts were not \u201cmotivated by true remorse,\u201d rather they were \u201can attempt to procure a withdrawal of the complaint.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>393 Md. at 567, 903 A.2d at 908. Reflecting upon <em>Kovacic, </em>in <em>Lee, </em>we, accordingly, imposed an indefinite suspension. Similarly, Shuler\u2019s demeanor does nothing to assuage the concern that she will repeat her misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The fact also that Bar Counsel recommended a thirty-day suspension, with a condition precedent to readmission, also is of no benefit to the Respondent herein, because we may exceed Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation and \u201corder any lawful sanction [we] deem[ ] appropriate in a given case.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Duvall, </em>373 Md. 482, 493, 819 A.2d 343, 349 (2003) (\u201cRule 16-759(c)[, which provides the sanctions that we may order,] and the nature of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction in attorney discipline matters, gives the Court the authority to order any lawful sanction it deems appropriate in a given case.\u201d); <em>see also Attorney Grievance v.

It is important to note that Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation was made before Shuler again failed to acknowledge her shortcoming during oral argument before this Court. An attorney\u2019s repeated failure to acknowledge her wrongdoing should not go unnoticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Accordingly, I would order an indefinite suspension, because I am not sanguine that Shuler appreciates the seriousness of her misconduct.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">.
