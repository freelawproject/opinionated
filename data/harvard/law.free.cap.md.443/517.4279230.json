During a second trial,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the State attempted to introduce the Forensic DNA Case Report into evidence through the testimony of a Bode Technology supervisor, without calling the analyst who had authored and signed the Report. The supervisor testified, ultimately, that he had \u201creviewed all the materials, all of the notes, the lab notes, all of the data that was generated, the paperwork and the final report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Before the Report was admitted, however, Norton\u2019s counsel raised two issues, one of which related to discovery, which is not before us. The other objection forms the gravamen of the present dispute \u2014 that the Confrontation Clause would be violated were the Report to be admitted under the umbrella of the testimony of the supervisor, because the original analyst, then, could not be cross-examined. The State retorted that Norton had waived the objection, because his counsel had stipulated to the Report\u2019s admissibility during the first trial. At the second trial, the Report <em>was </em>admitted as State\u2019s Exhibit 10A.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Norton appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In an unreported opinion, our intermediate appellate court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>admission of the Report without the analyst\u2019s testimony violated Norton\u2019s ability to confront his accuser under <em>Derr v. State, </em>422 Md. 211, 29 A.3d 533 (2011) <em>(\u201cDerr I\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> Norton v. State, </em>No. 2382, slip op. at 13-15 (Md.App. Nov. 21, 2011) <em>(\u201cNorton I </em>\u201d). Subsequently, the Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Derr I </em>and ultimately vacated its mandate in light of <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012), and remanded the case to us for further proceedings. <em>Maryland v. Derr, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 63, 183 L.Ed.2d 700 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">In <em>Derr II, </em>after having heard arguments, we concluded that the three exhibits in issue that identified Derr as the source of DNA found on the victim, about which testimony had been elicited from someone other than the analyst, had not violated Derr\u2019s right of confrontation. <em>Derr v. State, </em>434 Md. 88,118-20, 73 A.3d 254, 272-73 (2013) <em>(\u201cDerr II </em>\u201d). There was no Confrontation Clause violation, we held, because the exhibits, one of which contained the analyst\u2019s bench notes while the others were DNA profiles consisting only of \u201ca series of numbers and lines\u201d, \u201c[were] neither a sworn nor a certified declaration of fact\u201d and, thus, were not \u201ctestimonial\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 73 A.3d at 272 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">In light of <em>Derr II, </em>we vacated <em>Norton 1</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and remanded it to the Court of Special Appeals for further proceedings. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>v. Norton, </em>435 Md. 322, 77 A.3d 1116 (2013) (per curiam). In a reported opinion, our intermediate appellate court once again reversed Norton\u2019s conviction, holding that Norton\u2019s right of confrontation was violated when the Circuit Court admitted the Report without the analyst\u2019s testimony. <em>Norton v. State, </em>217 Md.App. 388, 390, 94 A.3d 110, 111 (2014) <em>(\u201cNorton II </em>\u201d). We granted the State\u2019s petition for <em>certiorari </em>to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in determining that Norton\u2019s right to confrontation under the federal constitution was violated where a DNA expert testified regarding the work of another DNA analyst, and that expert was a supervisor in the same lab, reviewed the work of the other analyst, and came to his own conclusion that was consistent with the conclusion of the other analyst, but the analyst herself did not testify?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\"><em>State v. Norton, </em>440 Md. 114, 99 A.3d 778 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">We shall hold that the language \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of scientific certainty\u201d in the Forensic DNA Case Report rendered the Report testimonial within <em>Williams, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2221,183 L.Ed.2d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Our analysis regarding the admission of a forensic document absent the testimony of its author begins with <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Crawford, </em>Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the Court, explored the history of the Sixth Amendment Right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Confrontation;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he concluded that the Clause was an attempt to eviscerate the \u201cuse of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 50, 124 S.Ct. at 1863,158 L.Ed.2d at 192. As such, \u201cthe Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53-54,124 S.Ct. at 1365,158 L.Ed.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Justice Scalia\u2019s analysis in <em>Crawford </em>was steeped in the history of England, which, two centuries before the Revolution, according to Justice Scalia, began to incorporate \u201celements of the civil-law practice\u201d of continental Europe into its \u201ccommon-law tradition.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 43, 124 S.Ct. at 1359, 158 L.Ed.2d at 187-88. One such practice was to allow justices of the peace to examine suspects and witnesses before criminal trials, such that the results of the examination would, at times, be read in court, without hearing from the witness at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 43, 124 S.Ct. at 1359, 158 L.Ed.2d at 188. Justice Scalia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>observed that the practice of receiving <em>ex parte </em>statements of accusers at the trial of the accused in English courts \u201c \u2018occasioned frequent demands by the prisoner to have his \u2018accusers,\u2019 <em>i.e. </em>the witnesses against him, brought before him face to face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting 1 J. Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of England 326 (1883).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">As Justice Scalia continued to review English history with respect to the Confrontation Clause, he noted that <em>ex parte </em>pretrial examinations had become routine during the sixteenth century reign of Queen Mary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 43,124 S.Ct. at 1360,158 L.Ed.2d at 188. Justices of the peace were appointed pursuant to then-enacted bail and committal statutes to examine suspects and witnesses in felony cases and certify the results to the court; the certifications were used as evidence at trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360, 158 L.Ed.2d at 188. One of the most notorious, and reviled, instances of the use of the civil law judicial examination procedure in an English court, Justice Scalia observed, occurred during the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh for treason in 1603. <em>Id. </em>at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360, 158 L.Ed.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">According to Justice Scalia, an <em>ex parte </em>examination of Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s alleged accomplice, Lord Cobham, was read to the jury during Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s trial, at which Lord Cobham did not appear. <em>Id. </em>Sir Walter Raleigh had demanded that the judges adhere to the common law tradition of allowing the accused to examine the witnesses against him in court: \u201c \u2018[t]he Proof of the Common Law is by witness and jury: let Cobham be here, let him speak it. Call my accuser before my face....\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting 2 How. St. Tr., at 15-16. The judges refused, and Sir Walter Raleigh was convicted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>sentenced to death.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Justice Scalia described the statutory and judicial reforms that developed following Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s trial in order to limit the use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations. <em>Id. </em>Treason statutes, for example, required witnesses to confront the accused at arraignments; meanwhile, courts developed strict rules of unavailability and admitted <em>ex parte </em>examinations only if the witness was demonstrably unable to testify in person. <em>Id. </em>at 44-45,124 S.Ct. at 1360,158 L.Ed.2d at 188. Toward the end of the seventeenth century, in response to a recurring question of whether an accused should be afforded the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses against him, the Court of the King\u2019s Bench answered in the affirmative, ruling that, \u201ceven though a witness was dead, his examination was not admissible where \u2018the defendant not being present when [it was] taken before the mayor ... had lost the benefit of a cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 124 S.Ct. at 1360-61, 158 L.Ed.2d at 189, quoting <em>King v. Paine, </em>5 Mod. 163, 165, 87 Eng. Rep. 584, 585 (1696).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Justice Scalia then reviewed the practices embraced by the English in pre-revolutionary America, which continued the civil law tradition of <em>ex parte </em>examinations; the Governor of Virginia, for example, \u201c \u2018privately issued several commissions to examine witnesses against particular men <em>ex parte\u2019 \u201d, </em>which was met by protests from the Virginia Council advocating for the common law approach of permitting the accused \u201c \u2018to be confronted with, or defend himself against his defamers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 124 S.Ct. at 1362, 158 L.Ed.2d at 190, quoting A Memorial Concerning the Maladministrations of His Excellency Francis Nicholson, <em>reprinted in </em>9 English Historical Documents 253, 257 (D. Douglas ed. 1955). The purview of admiralty courts, which followed civil law, was extended to offenses arising under the Stamp Act so that testimony by private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>judicial examination from witnesses against accused colonists was admitted into evidence without cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 47-48,124 S.Ct. at 1362,158 L.Ed.2d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Justice Scalia opined that in reaction to the use of such <em>ex parte </em>examinations the declarations of rights adopted by many of the colonies around the time of the Revolution guaranteed a right of confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 124 S.Ct. at 1362, 158 L.Ed.2d at 191, citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Maryland Declaration of Rights \u00a7 XIX (1776).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The absence of a comparable right in the proposed Federal Constitution, Justice Scalia continued, garnered objections during the Massachusetts ratifying convention <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> from those who criticized the use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence during trial. <em>Id. </em>In response, the Bill of Rights included in its Sixth Clause the language, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 124 S.Ct. at 1363, 158 L.Ed.2d at 191; U.S. Const. amend. VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">From this historical perspective, Justice Scalia extrapolated that the Confrontation Clause embodied two essential premises: \u201cFirst, the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused\u201d; and, second, \u201cthat the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1363, 1365, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192, 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Deducing that the Framers intended, by the adoption of the mandate of the Confrontation Clause, to eliminate the use of civil law <em>ex parte </em>examinations at the trial of the accused, Justice Scalia concluded that the Clause adheres when \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d is being introduced at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 53, 124 S.Ct. at 1365, 158 L.Ed.2d at 194. Justice Scalia posited that the text of the Confrontation Clause reflected such a focus, because \u201cwitnesses\u201d, as used therein, served to restrict the use of statements from those who \u201cbear testimony\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 51,124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192. To \u201cbear testimony\u201d, Justice Scalia continued, involves making \u201c \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation ... for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact\u2019 \u201d, <em>(id., </em>quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)); therefore, the \u201cprimary object\u201d of the Confrontation Clause is to limit the unfettered use of a statement made for the purpose of establishing a fact against the accused at trial, which Justice Scalia termed \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 53,124 S.Ct. at 1365,158 L.Ed.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In <em>Crawford, </em>Justice Scalia\u2019s application of the testimonial tenets gleaned from the historical analysis yielded a conclusion that a wife\u2019s statements implicating her husband made during a police interrogation were testimonial and inadmissible without the wife\u2019s presence as a witness at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 65-68, 124 S.Ct. at 1372-74, 158 L.Ed.2d at 201-03. The <em>Crawford </em>case had evolved from a Washington trial court judge permitting the introduction of the wife\u2019s statements, without her presence, because the \u201cquestioner [was] neutral to her\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 66, 124 S.Ct. at 1373, 158 L.Ed.2d at 202 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Although the Washington Court of Appeals reversed the trial court, the Washington Supreme Court vacated the opinion of its intermediate appellate court and reinstated Crawford\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 41, 124 S.Ct. at 1358,158 L.Ed.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The United States Supreme Court reversed, because, as Justice Scalia recounted, \u201c[t]he Framers would be astounded to learn that <em>ex parte </em>testimony could be admitted against a criminal defendant because it was elicited by \u2018neutral\u2019 government officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 124 S.Ct. at 1373, 158 L.Ed.2d at 202. Justice Scalia opined that the situation at issue bore the \u201cclosest kinship\u201d to the admission of the results of <em>ex parte </em>examinations at trial, because the justices of the peace who conducted examinations under the bail and committal statutes enacted during the reign of Queen Mary \u201chad an essentially investigative and prosecutorial function\u201d and, therefore, bore a strong resemblance to the police officers of the present day. <em>Id. </em>at 53,124 S.Ct. at 1365,158 L.Ed.2d at 193-94. The wife\u2019s statements, in Justice Scalia\u2019s calculus, were, therefore, testimonial in any sense of the term. <em>Id. </em>at 53, 124 S.Ct. at 1365, 158 L.Ed.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The <em>Crawford </em>holding, then, that testimonial hearsay is inadmissible at trial without the accused having had the opportunity to cross-examine is foundational. Justice Scalia, however, did not define \u201ctestimonial\u201d nor identify its parameters. What we do know is \u201cthat the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1365, 158 L.Ed.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">A number of inquiries can be derived from <em>Crawford, </em>however, to determine whether hearsay would be considered \u201ctestimonial\u201d. To whom the statement is made is a key component, because the involvement of a government official, or one acting on the government\u2019s behalf, is strongly associated with what Justice Scalia emphasized as the \u201ccore concern\u201d of the Confrontation Clause, <em>(id. </em>at 53, 124 S.Ct. at 1365, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193-94); the involvement of government officers, Justice Scalia explained, \u201cpresents unique potential for prosecutorial abuse ... with which the Framers were keenly familiar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56 n. 7, 124 S.Ct. at 1367 n. 7, 158 L.Ed.2d at 196 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Another inquiry would involve whether the statement had been solicited and, if so, whether the solicitation occurred under circumstances that \u201cwould lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193 (describing various valid formulations of \u201ctestimonial\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such an inquiry is consistent with <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>focus on the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, which made clear that <em>ex parte </em>statements solicited as part of a criminal investigation or prosecution are the archetypal statements that demand confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360,158 L.Ed.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Yet another question involves whether, when viewed objectively, the challenged statement was made \u201cfor the purpose of establishing or proving some fact\u201d in a criminal prosecution or investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 188. Justice Sealia drew a sharp distinction between hearsay made as part of a routine business practice, as part of a casual conversation or to further a criminal conspiracy with hearsay made in order to establish an individual\u2019s role in the commission of a criminal act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193. When a statement, then, is made for a nonprosecutorial purpose, it is less likely to be testimonial than one created as part of an ongoing criminal investigation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Another query from <em>Crawford </em>is whether the statement under scrutiny was made in a formal context. During Justice Scalia\u2019s textual analysis of the Confrontation Clause, he noted that a testimonial statement is one that is \u201cformal\u201d, and a \u201ccore class\u201d of such declarations is one contained within an affidavit, deposition, prior testimony or confession. <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193. As such, an inquiry with respect to formality may turn on the form of the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ment as well as other circumstances involving the creation of the statement, such as if it was offered in the confines of a police interview room. <em>See id. </em>at 52-53, 124 S.Ct. at 1364-65, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">A final inquiry involves whether there is historical authority for the admission of the challenged statement, despite its testimonial nature. Justice Scalia reflected upon at least two situations in which such historical precedent exists: when the statement is a dying declaration as that term is understood by the rules of evidence pertaining to hearsay, <em>(id. </em>at 56 n. 6, 124 S.Ct. at 1367 n. 6, 158 L.Ed.2d at 195 n. 6), and when the witness is unavailable due to the wrongdoing of the defendant, <em>(id. </em>at 62,124 S.Ct. at 1370,158 L.Ed.2d at 199).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Following <em>Crawford, </em>refining what is \u201ctestimonial\u201d has been the gravamen of a number of Supreme Court cases, most notably for our analysis, <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009); <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 180 L.Ed.2d 610 (2011); and <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>567 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">In <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>Melendez-Diaz was charged with distributing cocaine. 557 U.S. at 308, 129 S.Ct. at 2530, 174 L.Ed.2d at 320. During trial, three \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d were received in evidence,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which contained the results of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>forensic testing performed by a state laboratory in response to a police request as required by Massachusetts law. <em>Id. </em>at 308, 129 S.Ct. at 2531, 174 L.Ed.2d at 320. The technicians who had performed the testing swore to the results of their testing before a notary public. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Melendez-Diaz was convicted and the Massachusetts intermediate appellate court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 309, 129 S.Ct. at 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d at 320. The State Supreme Judicial Court denied review, but the United States Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>and reversed, holding that the laboratory certificates fell \u201cwithin the \u2018core class of testimonial statements\u2019 \u201d and, therefore, were inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 310, 129 S.Ct. at 2532,174 L.Ed.2d at 321, quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193. Justice Scalia, again writing for the majority, emphasized the formality of the exhibits as indicative of their testimonial nature. <em>Id. </em>at 311, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 321. He noted that, although denominated as \u201ccertificates\u201d, the exhibits were \u201cquite plainly affidavits\u201d in that they were declarations of fact sworn to by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths and, therefore, the documents fell within the \u201ccore class\u201d of testimonial statements. <em>Id. </em>at 310, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The second point of emphasis, Justice Scalia observed, was that the reports were created specifically to resolve a fact in question, \u201cthat the substance found in the possession of Melendez-Diaz ... was, as the prosecution claimed, cocaine\u201d. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The sole purpose of the certificates, Justice Scalia opined, was to provide evidence to be used at trial against Melendez-Diaz and, therefore, it was clear that he should have been afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the analysts who created the certificates. <em>Id. </em>at 311, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 321. In essence, the certificates were functionally identical to live testimony and were created to do \u201c \u2018precisely what a witness does on direct examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d 224, 242 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Justice Scalia then rejected a number of arguments raised by the State, <em>(id. </em>at 313-28, 129 S.Ct. at 2533-42, 174 L.Ed.2d at 323-32), and, in so doing, refined \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d as it pertains to forensic documents. He opined that a voluntary statement could be testimonial, thereby rejecting the State\u2019s argument to the contrary. <em>Id. </em>at 316-17, 129 S.Ct. at 2535, 174 L.Ed.2d at 325. Justice Scalia continued that, even were an inquiry from the police to be required for a statement to be testimonial, the fact that investigators had requested the analysis of the substance found in Melendez-Diaz\u2019s possession was a sufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">As we have explained, \u201c[t]he Framers were no more willing to exempt from cross-examination volunteered testimony or answers to open-ended questions than they were to exempt answers to detailed interrogation.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 822-823, n. 1 [126 S.Ct. 2266]. Respondent and the dissent cite no authority, and we are aware of none, holding that a person who volunteers his testimony is any less a \u201c \u2018witness against\u2019 the defendant,\u201d Brief for Respondent 26, than one who is responding to interrogation. In any event, the analysts\u2019 affidavits in this case <em>were </em>presented in response to a police request. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 12-13. If an affidavit submitted in response to a police officer\u2019s request to \u201cwrite down what happened\u201d suffices to trigger the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection (as it apparently does, see <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 819-820 [126 S.Ct. 2266]; <em>id., </em>at 840, n. 5 [126 S.Ct. 2266] (THOMAS, J., concurring in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>judgment in part and dissenting in part)), then the analysts\u2019 testimony should be subject to confrontation as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 316-17,129 S.Ct. at 2535,174 L.Ed.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The later case of <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 180 L.Ed.2d 610 (2011), represents the next refinement of the word testimonial in the context of a forensic document. More specifically, the question addressed in <em>Bull-coming </em>was \u201cwhether the Confrontation Clause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification \u2014 made for the purpose of proving a particular fact \u2014 through the in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the certification or perform or observe the test reported in the certification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2710, 180 L.Ed.2d at 616. The issue had arisen during Bullcoming\u2019s trial for aggravated driving while intoxicated, when the State failed to call the analyst from the Scientific Laboratory Division of the New Mexico Department of Health who had quantified Bullcoming\u2019s blood alcohol concentration level. <em>Id. </em>The sample had been forwarded to the Laboratory along with information that Bullcoming was stopped and arrested because of an accident. <em>Id. </em>The analyst recorded the results onto \u201ca standard [Scientific Laboratory Division] form titled \u2018Report of Blood Alcohol Analysis\u2019 \u201d and certified<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that Bullcoming\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was above the threshold for supporting a charge of aggravated driving while intoxicated.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2710, 2711, 180 L.Ed.2d at 616, 617. The Report was offered as a business record at Bullcoming\u2019s trial during the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>another scientist from the Laboratory, who had neither observed nor reviewed the analyst\u2019s work. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2712, 180 L.Ed.2d at 618. The Court of Appeals of New Mexico, as well as the Supreme Court of New Mexico, affirmed Bullcoming\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2712-13,180 L.Ed.2d at 618-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The Supreme Court reversed Bullcoming\u2019s conviction and held that introduction of the Report through the testimony of a technician in the Laboratory who had neither performed nor witnessed the testing did not meet the requirements of the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id. </em>at-, -, 131 S.Ct. at 2710, 2713, 180 L.Ed.2d at 616, 619. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the Court, emphasized that the exhibit resembled those in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>because it was created to \u201cassist in police investigations\u201d and it was \u201c \u2018formalized\u2019 in a signed document ... headed a \u2018report\u2019 \u201d, which brought it within the bounds of the Confrontation Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">In all material respects, the laboratory report in this case resembles those in <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>Here, as in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>a law-enforcement officer provided seized evidence to a state laboratory required by law to assist in police investigations. Like the analysts in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>[the] analyst [in <em>Bullcoming </em>] tested the evidence and prepared a certificate concerning the result of his analysis. Like the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>certificates, [the <em>Bullcoming </em>] certificate is \u201cformalized\u201d in a signed document, <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 837, n. 2, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), headed a \u201creport[.]\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">In sum, the formalities attending the \u201creport of blood alcohol analysis\u201d are more than adequate to qualify [the analyst\u2019s] assertions as testimonial. The absence of notarization does not remove his certification from Confrontation Clause governance. The New Mexico Supreme Court, guided by <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>correctly recognized that [the analyst\u2019s] report \u201cfell within the core class of testimonial statements\u201d, described in this Court\u2019s leading Confrontation Clause decisions: <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at 330 [308-312], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>129 S.Ct. at 2531-2532; <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266; <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52,124 S.Ct. 1354.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\"><em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2717, 180 L.Ed.2d at 624 (some internal citations omitted). Justice Ginsburg emphasized that, although the Report in <em>Bullcoming </em>was unsworn, as differentiated from those in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>it would be untenable for the definition of \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d to turn on whether the individual making the statement had done so under oath. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2717,180 L.Ed.2d at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Most recently, in <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>567 U.S.-,-, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 2229,183 L.Ed.2d 89,100 (2012), the Court was faced with a DNA profile produced by a private laboratory, Cellmark, located in Germantown, Maryland. The DNA profile had been solicited by the Illinois State Police from a vaginal swab collected from a rape kit. <em>Id. </em>Analysts at Cellmark determined that the DNA profile belonged to a male;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> there was no suspect identified at the time. <em>Id. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>profile was then compared to the DNA database in Illinois by an Illinois State Police forensic specialist and Williams\u2019s DNA developed as a result of a prior, unrelated, arrest was a match. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The Cellmark DNA profile was later received in evidence during Williams\u2019s bench trial during the testimony of the police specialist and not the Cellmark analyst. <em>Id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2227, 183 L.Ed.2d at 98. The State posited that the Cellmark profile was not admitted for its truth, rather, that it only served to explain the underlying facts the specialist had relied upon in reaching her expert opinion. <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2227-28,183 L.Ed.2d at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The plurality opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> set forth two rationales for concluding that Williams\u2019s right of confrontation was not violated by admission of the Cellmark profile. Justice Alito posited that the profile was not offered for its truth and, therefore, was outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2228, 183 L.Ed.2d at 99. Alternatively, Justice Alito stated that the Cellmark profile was not testimonial, because it was not produced for \u201cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual\u201d, unlike that which had occurred in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming. Id. </em>at-, -, 132 S.Ct. at 2228, 2243, 183 L.Ed.2d at 99, 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Justice Clarence Thomas concurred only in the judgment and provided his own opinion. <em>Id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2255, 183 L.Ed.2d at 129. In his view, introducing the Cellmark profile through the testimony of the police specialist did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>encumber Williams\u2019s cross-examination rights, \u201cbecause Cell-mark\u2019s statements lacked the requisite \u2018formality and solemnity\u2019 to be considered \u2018testimonial\u2019 for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Justice Thomas opined that \u201cCellmark\u2019s report, in substance, certifies nothing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2260, 183 L.Ed.2d at 134. When considering the question of the purpose of the Cellmark profile, Justice Thomas iterated that, when a statement is created under circumstances that indicate it is to be used in a criminal prosecution or investigation, the statement may be testimonial. <em>Id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2261, 183 L.Ed.2d at 135. The purpose for creating the statement is not enough, however, under Justice Thomas\u2019s rationale, because the statement must also have the requisite \u201cformality and solemnity\u201d to be considered testimonial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">In <em>Derr II, </em>we were called upon to apply the tenets of <em>Williams </em>and did so by \u201capplying] the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 993, 51 L.Ed.2d 260, 266 (1977)\u201d, that being, \u201cWhen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the narrowest grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 73 A.3d at 269 (internal quotation marks omitted). The narrowest grounds, we opined, were provided by Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">The plurality opinion expressed that statements are testimonial when they both have \u201cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct\u201d and are \u201cformalized statements such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.\u201d 567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2242, 183 L.Ed.2d at 116 (plurality). Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence expressed that for statements to be testimonial both \u201cthe declarant must primarily intend to establish some fact with the understanding that his statement may be used in a criminal prosecution,\u201d 567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2261, 183 L.Ed.2d at 135 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (citation omitted), and the statements must \u201cbear[ ] [an] indicia of solemnity.\u201d 567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2259, 183 L.Ed.2d at 133 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (quotation omitted). Those statements, Justice Thomas explained, include \u201cformalized testimonial materials, such as depositions, affidavits, and prior testimony, or statements resulting from formalized dialogue, such as custodial interrogation.\u201d 567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2260, 183 L.Ed.2d at 133 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (citations and quotation omitted). The common point of agreement between the plurality opinion and Justice Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion is that statements must, at least, be formalized, or have \u201cindicia of solemnity\u201d to be testimonial. Therefore, using the <em>Marks </em>approach, we conclude that the narrowest holding of <em>Williams </em>is that a statement, at a minimum, must be formalized to be testimonial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 114-15, 73 A.3d at 270. By embracing Justice Thomas\u2019s opinion we emphasized the formality of a statement or its \u201cindicia of solemnity\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 73 A.3d at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">In <em>Derr II </em>we had been asked to determine whether three exhibits received in evidence were testimonial. The first exhibit \u201cappeared] to be the notes from the bench work of the serological examiner\u201d, which were compiled during the 1985 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>investigation of the underlying rape, and were the result of an examination of physical evidence collected at the scene. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 73 A.3d at 272. We opined that the notes, because they lacked any \u201csigned statements or any other indication that the results or the procedures used to reach those results were affirmed by any analyst\u201d, were not sufficiently formalized to be considered testimonial, <em>(id. </em>at 119, 73 A.3d at 272); therefore, the admission of the exhibit without the testimony of the analyst who had created it did not violate Derr\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">With respect to the second exhibit, which was a DNA profile created in 2002 from biological material obtained via a vaginal swab of the victim, we observed that it \u201cdisplay[ed] a series of numbers and lines, and on the bottom of the documents [were] the initials of two parties. No statements, however, appeared] anywhere on the results attesting to their accuracy or that the analysts who prepared them followed any prescribed procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119, 73 A.3d at 272-73. The initials, we said, certified nothing and, thus, we concluded that the second exhibit was not sufficiently formalized to meet the standard in <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The third exhibit was created when \u201ca match was discovered between Derr\u2019s existing profile in CODIS[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>] and the profile generated in 2002\u201d, which led investigators to create a reference DNA sample from Derr\u2019s buccal swab. <em>Id. </em>at 99, 73 A.3d at 260. The third exhibit was \u201calmost identical in form to the test results from the 2002 DNA test of biological material\u201d obtained from the victim, except that there were no initials on the bottom of the third exhibit. <em>Id. </em>at 120, 73 A.3d at 273. The report itself, attached hereto as Appendix B, reflected no conclusions authored by the analyst and graphically represented only the makeup of the DNA under analysis. The third set of results, we determined, was not sufficiently formalized, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the analyst who had derived the DNA test results was not required to testify. In conclusion, we rejected each of Derr\u2019s challenges based on the Confrontation Clause, having determined that the exhibits were not formalized and, thus, were not testimonial.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Since <em>Derr II </em>was decided, many other courts also have struggled to interpret <em>Williams </em>and apply its tenets. <em>E.g., State v.

The essence of the confusion, according to our sister courts, is that none of the opinions in <em>Williams </em>articulated what could be described as the \u201cnarrowest\u201d ground for the opinion, nor did the plurality and concurring opinions provide overlapping rationales. <em>See, e.g., State v. Dotson, </em>450 S.W.3d 1, 69 (Tenn. 2014), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1535, 191 L.Ed.2d 565 (2015) (\u201cThe <em>Marks </em>rule[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>] ceases to function as it was intended where <em>Williams </em>is concerned because the two opinions that resulted in the judgment share no common denominator rationale.\u201d); <em>Young v. United States, </em>63 A.3d 1033, 1043 (D.C.2013) (\u201cWe do not get very far applying <em>Marks </em>[to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>Williams </em>], for the two opinions of the Justices who concurred in the judgment in <em>Williams </em>lack the necessary common denominator.\u201d); <em>Michaels, </em>95 A.3d at 666 (\u201cIn short, each of those three opinions in <em>Williams </em>embraces a different approach to determining whether the use of forensic evidence violates the Confrontation Clause, and there is no narrow rule that would have the support of a majority of the Supreme Court that we can discern from the opinions in <em>Williams.\u201d)-, State v. Griep, </em>361 Wis.2d 657, 863 N.W.2d 567, 579 (2015) (\u201cAs no opinion overlaps with another, the <em>Marks </em>narrowest grounds rule does not apply to <em>Williams v. Illinois.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, in <em>Young v. United States, </em>opined that \u201cthe two opinions of the Justices who concurred in the judgment in <em>Williams </em>lack the necessary common denominator\u201d to allow the court to synthesize the narrowest grounds for affirming Williams\u2019s conviction. 63 A.3d at 1043. The <em>Young </em>court explained that a statement could be accusatory and, therefore, be testimonial under Justice Alito\u2019s test, but without being formal enough to satisfy Justice Thomas\u2019s test. <em>Id. </em>A statement, conversely, could be formal under Justice Thomas\u2019s test, according to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, but without accusing or targeting a particular suspect and, therefore, not be testimonial under Justice Alito\u2019s opinion. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Young </em>court distilled, nevertheless, a \u201clogically coherent\u201d position that requires, at a minimum, that the statement have an \u201cevidentiary purpose\u201d and <em>\u201ceither </em>the plurality\u2019s targeted accusation requirement <em>or </em>Justice Thomas\u2019s formality criterion\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">There is an intermediate position. By analogy to <em>Marks, </em>it can be argued that while Justice Alito\u2019s rationale and Justice Thomas\u2019s rationale may not be includible <em>within each other, </em>the different tests they utilize to determine whether a statement is testimonial are subsumed within and narrower than <em>the dissenters\u2019 </em>test. That is so because Justice Alito and Justice Thomas each added an additional requirement to the basic \u201cevidentiary purpose\u201d test espoused by Justice Kagan. If the four-Justice plurality would deem a statement testimonial under the targeted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>accusation test, the four dissenting Justices surely would deem it testimonial under the broader evidentiary purpose test. Similarly, if Justice Thomas would deem a statement testimonial employing his formality criterion along with the evidentiary purpose test, the four dissenting Justices necessarily would deem it testimonial using the evidentiary purpose test alone. It therefore is logically coherent and faithful to the Justices\u2019 expressed views to understand <em>Williams </em>as establishing \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 a sufficient, if not a necessary, criterion: a statement is testimonial at least when it passes the basic evidentiary purpose test plus <em>either </em>the plurality\u2019s targeted accusation requirement <em>or </em>Justice Thomas\u2019s formality criterion. Otherwise put, if <em>Williams </em>does have precedential value as the government contends, an out-of-court statement is testimonial under that precedent if its primary purpose is evidentiary and it is either a targeted accusation or sufficiently formal in character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">68 A.3d at 1043-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Other of our sister state supreme courts have declined to apply <em>Williams </em>and have retreated, instead, to <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming. </em>The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in <em>Commonwealth v. Yohe, </em>621 Pa. 527, 79 A.3d 520, 537 (2013), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2662, 189 L.Ed.2d 209 (2014), observed that the plurality and concurring opinions in <em>Williams </em>\u201cregarded the Cellmark report as non-testimonial, and not analogous to the reports admitted in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming.\u201d </em>The Pennsylvania court, similarly, distinguished the report at issue in <em>Yohe </em>from that in <em>Williams </em>and, therefore, determined that <em>Williams </em>was \u201cof little assistance in deciding the matter\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The Supreme Court of New Jersey, in <em>State v. Michaels, </em>95 A.3d at 666, asserted that, \u201cthere is no narrow rule that would have the support of a majority of the Supreme Court that we can discern from the opinions in <em>Williams </em>\u201d and that, <em>\u201cWilliams </em>advances a wholly new approach to when a forensic document will be deemed testimonial,\u201d which \u201cdiverges from the primary purpose test that had been applied previously.\u201d The <em>Michaels </em>court continued that, because <em>Williams </em>did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>explicate that it was abandoning the primary purpose test from <em>Crawford, </em>it, too, would not alter the approach promulgated by <em>Crawford </em>to the extent that it was refined by <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming. Id. </em>at 666-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v. Duron-Caldera, </em>737 F.3d 988, 994 (2013), refused to follow the <em>Williams\u2019s </em>plurality opinion and, similarly, criticized the case for abandoning <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny. The Fifth Circuit opined that, \u201cfive Justices expressly rejected [the plurality\u2019s] test\u201d and that, therefore, it \u201cwould not be controlling under <em>Marks \u201d. Id. </em>Continuing, the court concluded that the plurality\u2019s test, which required that a statement \u201caccuse\u201d a specific individual to be testimonial, was unsupported by Confrontation Clause precedent, because the concern of the clause is the creation of \u201cstatements one \u2018would reasonably expect to be used <em>proseculonally ... </em>[or] at <em>a </em>later trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 995, quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193 (emphasis and alterations added by <em>Duron-Caldera </em>court). The Fifth Circuit, finally, criticized the <em>Williams\u2019s </em>plurality for relying \u201con an overly-narrow view of the rationale behind confrontation\u201d, because it assumed \u201cthat the Confrontation Clause is designed to protect only against a defendant-related motive to behave dishonestly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 995-96 (internal quotation marks omitted). The <em>Duron-Caldera </em>court, instead, continued to apply Confrontation Clause jurisprudence as defined through <em>Bull-coming </em>and Melendez-Diaz,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">It is noteworthy that no other state supreme court nor federal circuit court of appeals has solely relied upon Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence. In light of what has transpired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>since <em>Williams </em>and <em>Derr II, </em>which we have fleetingly summarized, we take this opportunity to better ref\u00edne our own analysis. When this Court is addressing a federal constitutional question we recognize that we \u201care responsible for executing\u201d the \u201cpolicy directives\u201d issued by the Supreme Court. Lawrence Baum, <em>Implementation of Judicial Decisions: An Organizational Analysis, </em>4 Am. Pol. Q. 86, 89 (1976). We cannot alter the message conveyed by the Supreme Court, unlike our own common law, but we, like our sister state supreme courts, strive to \u201ccarry out\u201d Supreme Court precedent \u201caccurately and faithfully.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">By examining the way in which sister courts have applied <em>Williams </em>we have the opportunity to explore how best to accurately and faithfully implement the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement on the issue of the Confrontation Clause in the context of forensic documents, when \u201cother [courts] have persuasively argued\u201d a different application. <em>Critical Mass Energy Project v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>975 F.2d 871, 876 (D.C.Cir.1992). We, therefore, examine <em>Williams\u2019s </em>tenets, as applied by our sister courts, to ensure that <em>Derr II, </em>\u201cwhich seems superficially relevant to resolving [the] dispute, is not applied to the facts of a case that would not be well resolved under the prior decision.\u201d Robert S. Summers, <em>Precedent in the United States (New York State), in </em>Interpreting Precedents 391 (D. Neil MacCormick &amp; Robert S. Summers eds., 1997). Doing so does not overrule our decision in <em>Derr II, </em>but serves to expand our application of <em>Williams </em>in an attempt to adhere as accurately and faithfully as we can to the Supreme Court precedent. In so doing, we are respectful of the adoption of Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence in <em>Derr II, </em>but recognize that we need to refine the analysis required in the determination of what is testimonial in the forensic document framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">As the District of Columbia in <em>Young v. United States </em>recognized, an approach to <em>Williams </em>can be constructed by formulating a test that, if satisfied, would result in adherence to the opinions of a majority of the Justices. The <em>Young </em>court opined that, if a forensic document is testimonial under either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Justice Thomas\u2019s or Justice Alito\u2019s rationale, then it, necessarily, is testimonial under the rule advocated by Justice Kagan\u2019s dissent, because each of the plurality\u2019s opinions narrows the broader rule urged by the dissent. 63 A.3d at 1043-44. This is so, according to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, because Justice Thomas provides a strict rule requiring that, to be testimonial, a forensic document must have been created with the purpose of serving as evidence in a criminal trial and that it must be sufficiently \u201cformal\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1043, quoting <em>Williams, </em>567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2255, 183 L.Ed.2d at 129. Justice Alito posits a test that is, instead, more limited with respect to the document\u2019s purpose: that a forensic document is testimonial if it has \u201cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1040, quoting <em>Williams, </em>567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2243, 183 L.Ed.2d at 115. The <em>Young </em>court\u2019s test is satisfied, then, when either Justice Thomas\u2019s or Justice Alito\u2019s opinion is fulfilled. <em>Id. </em>at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">By embracing both Justice Thomas\u2019s and Alito\u2019s opinions, we guide our trial courts, when reviewing the admissibility of forensic documents under the Confrontation Clause, to consider first, whether the report in issue is formal, as analyzed by Justice Thomas, <em>(Williams, </em>567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2255, 183 L.Ed.2d at 129); or, if not, whether it is accusatory, in that it targets an individual as having engaged in criminal conduct, under Justice Alito\u2019s rationale, <em>(id </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2243, 183 L.Ed.2d at 115). This expanded approach to <em>Williams </em>requires that we, like our brethren on the trial courts, first determine if the forensic report at issue reflects the \u201c \u2018solemnity of an affidavit or deposition\u2019 \u201d, <em>(Derr II, </em>434 Md. at 113, 73 A.3d at 268, quoting <em>Williams, </em>567 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2260, 183 L.Ed.2d at 133 (Thomas, J., concurring)), which would satisfy Justice Thomas\u2019s inquiry. Such formality does not require that the document contain specific words of attestation, but that the report, in substance, functions as a certification. <em>Cf. Williams, </em>567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2260, 183 L.Ed.2d at 134 (asserting that \u201cCell-mark\u2019s report, <em>in substance, </em>certifies nothing\u201d) (Thomas, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Should there be a determination that the document in issue was not formal, the next inquest would be whether the report has \u201cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2242, 183 L.Ed.2d at 114. (Alito, J.). If the report was generated before the defendant was a named suspect in the investigation, then the report could not be accusatory. <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2228, 183 L.Ed.2d at 99. Similarly, when a report is created as a \u201creference\u201d to \u201cverify\u201d the accuracy of a previous document, <em>ie.g., Derr II, </em>434 Md. at 99, 73 A.3d at 260), it is not accusatory. The forensic document, to be testimonial pursuant to the <em>Williams </em>plurality, must contain a conclusion that connects the defendant to the underlying crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">Under the paradigm so articulated, the Forensic DNA Case Report at issue in the instant ease is testimonial. With respect to Justice Thomas\u2019s formality inquiry, the Report contains a certification in the phrase \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of scientific certainty\u201d. The inclusion of such language, \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of scientific certainty\u201d, in a DNA report identifying a match between a defendant\u2019s profile with that of a perpetrator is key to the acceptance of the expert\u2019s testimony into evidence in Maryland. <em>Young v. State, </em>388 Md. 99,120, 879 A.2d 44, 56 (2005). Without this language certifying the result, the testimony is without foundation. <em>Id. </em>The phrase, then, of \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of scientific certainty\u201d, constitutes such \u201ctalismanic words\u201d that, without them, the testimony cannot cross the threshold of acceptance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>by the judge as gatekeeper.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>See Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Theiss, </em>354 Md. 234, 261, 729 A.2d 965, 980 (1999) (Rodowsky, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The Report in issue, thus, is testimonial pursuant to Justice Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Williams, </em>because it was certified and was signed by the analyst who had performed the test, indicating that the analyst\u2019s results had been validated according to federal standards, even if unsworn.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It may not be within the \u201ccore class\u201d of sworn documents, such as affidavits, to which Justice Scalia referred in <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193, but it does come within \u201cformalized testimonial materials\u201d to which Justice Thomas made reference and gave non-exclusive examples, <em>(Williams, </em>567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2260, 183 L.Ed.2d at 133).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The Report before us is testimonial under Justice Alito\u2019s plurality opinion as well, because it was created with \u201cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct\u201d. <em>Williams, </em>567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2242, 183 L.Ed.2d at 114. The language \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, Harold Norton ... is the major source of the biological material obtained from [the] evidence\u201d clearly \u201caccus[es] a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct\u201d. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The result we reached in <em>Derr II, </em>whereby the three exhibits were not testimonial, does not change, however, under our enunciated inquiry. Although <em>Derr II </em>was decided by the application of Justice Thomas\u2019s rationale, even under Justice Alito\u2019s plurality, the three forensic reports would not have been considered testimonial, because they were not created to accuse \u201ca targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct\u201d. <em>Williams, </em>567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2242, 183 L.Ed.2d at 114. In <em>Derr II </em>we noted that the first report reflected \u201cthe notes from the bench work of the serological examiner\u201d, contained no statement regarding the accuracy of the procedures the analyst had used to reach the results and was created before a suspect had been identified in the investigation. <em>Derr II, </em>434 Md. at 118-19, 73 A.3d at 272. Nothing about the first report accused an individual of engaging in criminal conduct and, therefore, it would not have been considered testimonial by the <em>Williams </em>plurality. <em>See Williams, </em>567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2228,183 L.Ed.2d at 99 (\u201cThe report was sought not for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be used against [Williams], who was not even under suspicion at the time, but for the purpose of finding a rapist who was on the loose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The second report at issue in <em>Derr II, </em>similarly, was developed when the Charles County \u201cSheriffs Office submitted the rape kit to the FBI laboratory for additional forensic analysis.\u201d 434 Md. at 98, 73 A.3d at 260. As such, it was composed before Derr was a suspect in the investigation and it was created \u201cfor the purpose of finding a rapist who was on the loose.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2228, 183 L.Ed.2d at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">The third of the <em>Derr II </em>reports was developed after it was discovered that Derr\u2019s existing profile in CODIS matched the previous report developed during the investigation. The final document, generated in order to \u201ccreate a new \u2018reference DNA sample\u2019 and to verify that Derr\u2019s profile in CODIS was accurate\u201d, appeared only as a graphic representation of test results, which did not contain even the name of the individual from whom the DNA was sampled, much less any accusatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>statements. <em>Derr II, </em>434 Md. at 99, 73 A.3d at 260; Appendix B. The third report, which the majority in <em>Derr II </em>determined was non-testimonial, would also have been so rendered under Justice Alito\u2019s plurality opinion, because nothing in the report \u201caccus[es] a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct\u201d. <em>Williams, </em>567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2242, 183 L.Ed.2d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that we were not able to discern a viable framework from <em>Williams </em>to apply in the present case, we would note, alternatively, that the instant report is testimonial under Supreme Court precedent prior to <em>Williams </em>as akin to the report presented in <em>Bullcoming, </em>which five Justices, including Justice Thomas, determined to be testimonial.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Stanfield, </em>158 Idaho 327, 347 P.3d 175, 184 (2015) (\u201cBecause no position [in <em>Williams </em>] received support from a majority of the justices, <em>Williams </em>does not provide us a governing legal principle and this Court views the decision as limited to the unique set of facts presented in that case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In <em>Bullcoming, </em>Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample was sent to the Scientific Laboratory Division of the New Mexico State Police to be analyzed for Bullcoming\u2019s blood alcohol concentration. 564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2710, 180 L.Ed.2d at 616. The Report indicated that the sample was submitted by the arresting officer to be checked for blood alcohol concentration, implicitly for a suspected driving under the influence charge. <em>Id. </em>The Report then contained a section titled \u201cCertificate of Analyst\u201d, which embodied the result of the analyst\u2019s test \u2014 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Bullcoming\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was above the legal limit \u2014 and an assertion that the proper procedures were followed.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The present Report reflects a DNA profile, produced by an analyst at Bode Technology, from a piece of fabric taken from the mask identified as the one worn by the assailant. That Report materially is identical to the one in <em>Bullcoming. </em>The Report was made to establish \u201csome fact in a criminal proceeding\u201d \u2014 here, the identity <em>of the </em>assailant, <em>(id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2716, 180 L.Ed.2d at 623 (internal quotation marks omitted)), and details the results of forensic testing on evidence gathered by the police. Viewed side-by-side with the <em>Bullcoming </em>Report, the Bode Technology analysis also describes the relevant samples, test methodology, and results; includes the signatures of laboratory officials; and contains a certification that proper procedures were followed in reaching the ultimate conclusion identifying the suspect, named to the analyst as \u201csuspect Harold Norton\u201d, as the perpetrator of a criminal offense. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s prior analysis, therefore, the substance of the Report could come into evidence only if Norton had a chance to cross-examine the responsible analyst.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>In the event that a trial court has occasion to review a forensic document that is analogous to the report discussed in <em>Bullcoming, </em>application of <em>Bullcoming </em>is appropriate to determine the impact of the accused\u2019s right of confrontation on the item\u2019s admissibility. A report may be considered so analogous when it includes the signatures of laboratory officials, identifies the accused as the culprit in the underlying investigation, conveys eonclusory statements and certifies that proper procedures were followed in reaching the ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The reports at issue in <em>Derr II, </em>for example, were not analogous to that in <em>Bullcoming, </em>because the <em>Derr II </em>reports did not include, substantially, a certification nor did they contain any language referring to a specific individual as being connected with the underlying offense. <em>Compare </em>Appendix A (report from <em>Bullcoming), with </em>Appendix B (third report from <em>Derr II, </em>which, we said, was identical to the second report in that case).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In conclusion, the Forensic DNA Case Report in the instant case is testimonial within <em>Williams v.
