(\u201cLafarge\u201d) operated a ready-mix concrete plant in Rockville, Maryland, during the time relevant to this case. It sought a refund from the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (\u201cWSSC\u201d) for allegedly erroneously assessed and paid water and sewer service charges for the operation of the plant. Lafarge sought initially from the WSSC administrative review and action on its refund request from the WSSC. The WSSC did not hold a hearing or decide the refund request within 180 days of its filing, as it was obliged to do by Maryland Code (1998, 2010 Repl.Vol.), Public Utilities Article, \u00a7 25-106 (\u201cPUA\u201d). The same statutory scheme decreed that the refund request was deemed denied by operation of law because of the WSSC\u2019s failure to render a timely decision. PUA \u00a7 25-106(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Lafarge turned to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for judicial review, noting that its claim was deemed denied by the WSSC\u2019s inaction. The Circuit Court concluded that the deemed denial was not supported by substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>in the record and was arbitrary and capricious because the WSSC failed to act timely. As a result, that court remanded the matter to the WSSC with directions to determine and issue an appropriate refund. On direct appeal by the WSSC, a panel of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed unanimously the judgment of the Circuit Court. We granted the WSSC\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. For the reasons explained below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The WSSC operates the public water supply, sewage collection and treatment, and storm water management systems in most of Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties. This bi-county, state agency levies separate charges for water consumption and sewer services, but its sewerage charges are determined by the water consumption of a user. PUA \u00a7 25-503(a). If some of the water consumed by a commercial, industrial, or multifamily residential use is \u201cused exclusively for any purpose that results in the [consumed] water not entering the [WSSC\u2019s] sewer system[,]\u201d however, the WSSC may not impose sewer charges for that portion of the water consumption. PUA \u00a7 25-503(d) and (e). To avoid being billed for water consumption not entering into the sewer system, a property or business owner must have a submeter installed to measure the water not discharged into the sewer. <em>Id. </em>After installation of a submeter, the WSSC calculates the sewerage bill by subtracting the water passing through the submeter from the amount of water passing through a primary meter at the site. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The WSSC delivered large quantities of water to Lafarge\u2019s ready-mix concrete plant in Rockville. According to Lafarge\u2019s refund request, the production of concrete consumes the vast majority of the water delivered to the plant. This water is not discharged into the WSSC\u2019s sewer system. The only incoming water discharged into the public sewer system as \u201csewage\u201d came from an employee bathroom on the premises. Lafarge asserted further in its refund request that the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>employees and activity levels at the plant remained the same over the past decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In 2000, at Lafarge\u2019s request and expense, the WSSC installed on the property a submeter to measure the water used to make concrete.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In August 2005, the submeter was moved elsewhere on-site after the structure housing the submeter (described by Lafarge as a \u201cshed\u201d) was destroyed by fire. Lafarge maintained, in its refund request, that the submeter ceased working properly after the fire and relocation, resulting in sewer charges for substantial amounts of water that Lafarge\u2019s operations did not discharge into the sewer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">An internal investigation into sewerage charges following a submeter malfunction in February of 2012 alerted Lafarge for the first time to the charges it came to believe were in error. Before the 2005 fire, the Rockville plant was billed consistently for discharging into the sewer system approximately one-tenth of the plant\u2019s total water consumption. After the fire, Lafarge was billed for a water-to-sewage ratio of between 2-to \u2014 1 and 1 \u2014 to\u20141. Lafarge claims that such indicated sewage discharges were erroneously high. On 16 February 2012, Lafarge contacted initially the WSSC about the erroneous sewerage charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">On 6 March 2012, Lafarge, pursuant to PUA \u00a7 25-106, submitted a letter (with attachments) to the WSSC requesting a refund for the allegedly erroneous charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 9 April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>2012, Lafarge completed and submitted a refund hearing request form, as directed by the WSSC. The WSSC did not hold a hearing or issue a decision on Lafarge\u2019s claim within 180 days, as required by PUA \u00a7 25-106(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Pursuant to PUA \u00a7 25-106(d) and (e), Lafarge petitioned the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for judicial review of the \u201cdeemed final rejection\u201d of its claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The WSSC filed a motion for a stay of the proceedings until it could hold a hearing so that a fuller evidentiary record could be developed and actual final action made. The Circuit Court denied the WSSC\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The WSSC filed thereafter with the court the \u201cagency record.\u201d The \u201crecord\u201d consisted of, in its entirety, Lafarge\u2019s 6 March 2012 letter requesting a refund and the 9 April 2012 hearing request (both of which had supporting documents attached by Lafarge). Lafarge responded with a motion requesting that the court require the WSSC to supplement the \u201crecord\u201d with any documents created during the agency\u2019s investigation of the claim, if any. The WSSC opposed the motion. On 8 January 2013, the Circuit Court granted La<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>farge\u2019s motion. Thereafter, the WSSC provided to the Circuit Court additional documents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">On 17 June 2013, the Circuit Court determined that: (1) the WSSC\u2019s deemed denial of Lafarge\u2019s claim was not supported by substantial evidence; (2) the WSSC\u2019s failure to decide the claim within the 180-day window required by PUA \u00a7 25-106(d) was arbitrary and capricious; (3) it would be inappropriate to give the WSSC a second opportunity to consider whether to deny the refund request after the agency failed to make a determination within the time-period required by the statute; and, (4) therefore, Lafarge was entitled to a refund in some appropriate amount. The court remanded the matter to the WSSC with directions to issue a refund according to the agency\u2019s standard operating procedures.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On 20 September 2013, the Circuit Court granted Lafarge\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment and required additionally that the WSSC issue the refund within 30 days.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">On 3 July 2013, the WSSC appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals. The WSSC did not argue to the intermediate appellate court that Lafarge was not due a refund, but rather attempted to persuade the court that the Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>exceeded its powers in requiring the WSSC to supplement the \u201crecord,\u201d as submitted originally, with the agency\u2019s investigative file and by making factual determinations absent a proper agency record, agency findings, or agency conclusions. Lafarge retorted that the appellate court was not authorized expressly to consider appeals from the Circuit Court under PUA \u00a7 25-106(e).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">A panel of the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, examined the legislative history of PUA \u00a7 25 \u2014 106(e) and held that the Legislature intended to allow further appeals to the Court of Special Appeals from judgments by a circuit court, after judicial review of PUA \u00a7 25-106 refund claims. On the merits of the case, however, the intermediate appellate court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The WSSC petitioned us to issue a writ of certiorari. The WSSC requested further that we stay enforcement of the mandate of the Court of Special Appeals pending our consideration of the petition. On 19 September 2014, we granted the WSSC\u2019s petition and motion to stay the enforcement of the intermediate appellate court\u2019s judgment, pending our consideration and disposition of the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">1) Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that a [circuit court] may exceed the permissible scope of judicial review when considering a \u201cdeemed\u201d rejection of a refund claim under PUA \u00a7 25-106?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">2) Did the Court of Special Appeals err in upholding the [Circuit Court\u2019s] order mandating that WSSC\u2019s investigative files be produced as part of the agency record pursuant to Md. Rule 7-206?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\"><em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission v. Lafarge N. Am., Inc., </em>440 Md. 115, 99 A.3d 778 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">I. <em>Appellate Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, Lafarge sought a dismissal of the WSSC\u2019s appeal because: (1) PUA \u00a7 25-106(e) does not authorize expressly appellate review by the Court of Special Appeals of the judgment of the Circuit Court; (2) a refund request before the WSSC is not a \u201ccontested case\u201d for purposes of Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedures Act; and, (3) the review requested by Lafarge before the Circuit Court cannot be considered alternately as a common law action for mandamus. As the argument goes, if the WSSC\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals was improper, its petition to us for a writ of certiorari is untimely. Although neither party argues before us that we or the intermediate appellate court lack fundamental jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case, an appellate court may consider, on its initiative, jurisdictional questions that it notices. <em>Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v. Maryland Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>439 Md. 262, 275, 96 A.3d 105, 113 (2014); <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>423 Md. 602, 606, 32 A.3d 1072, 1074 (2011); <em>Stachowski v.

Anne Arundel Cnty. Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>400 Md. 446, 450, 929 A.2d 185, 187 (2007); <em>Pack Shack, Inc. v.

John McShain, Inc., </em>202 Md. 340, 343, 96 A.2d 617, 618 (1953). Maryland Code (1974, 2013 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-301 (\u201cCJP\u201d) provides a general right to appeal from a final judgment of a circuit court, subject to certain exceptions. One such exception is relevant to the present case: \u201c[ujnless a right to appeal is expressly granted by law, [CJP] \u00a7 12-301 ... does not permit an appeal from a final judgment of a court entered or made in the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>appellate jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of ... an administrative agency.... \u201d C JP \u00a7 12-302.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">PUA \u00a7 25-106(e) provides expressly for judicial review by a circuit court of final action on a refund claim by the WSSC, but is silent regarding appellate review of that circuit court\u2019s judgment by the Court of Special Appeals. The panel of the Court of Special Appeals in the present case, looking to the legislative history of PUA \u00a7 25-106(e), concluded that the General Assembly intended to maintain allowance for such appellate review. According to the intermediate appellate court panel, the provision for this was left out mistakenly from the prior code provision during the relevant re-codification.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The apparent purpose of PUA \u00a7 25-106, its legislative history, and the canons of construction regarding re-codification initiatives of the Maryland Code indicate that the Legislature intended to allow appeals to the intermediate appellate court in the circumstances of the present case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> CJP \u00a7 12-302 does not authorize by implication, however, appeals from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>circuit court judgments in water/sewer charge refund matters. The right to appeal must be \u201cexpressly granted by law.\u201d CJP \u00a7 12-302. Rather than inquire into the meaning of \u201cexpressly\u201d in CJP \u00a7 12-302, we find an appropriate jurisdictional basis in Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Maryland\u2019s APA was enacted initially in 1957 to increase the perceived legitimacy of administrative agencies by imposing transparency, procedural regularity, and judicial review of agency actions. Edward A. Tomlinson, <em>The Maryland Administrative Procedure Act: Forty Years Old in 1997, </em>56 Md.L.Rev. 196, 197-98 (1997). The current iteration of the APA regarding \u201ccontested cases\u201d is codified in Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article of the Maryland Code. Judicial review was (and remains) more robust regarding trial-like, quasi-adjudicatory proceedings of \u201ccontested cases\u201d than agency rulemaking. <em>Id. </em>at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Maryland Code (1984, 2014 Repl.Vol.), State Government Article, \u00a7 10-202(d) (\u201cSG\u201d) defines \u201ccontested case\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>(1) \u201cContested case\u201d means a proceeding before an agency to determine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">(i) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">(ii) the grant, denial, renewal, revocation, suspension, or amendment of a license that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">(2) \u201cContested case\u201d does not include a proceeding before an agency involving an agency hearing required only by regulation unless the regulation expressly, or by clear implication, requires the hearing to be held in accordance with this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Refund claims pursuant to PUA \u00a7 25-106, for which the claimant requests a hearing, are \u201ccontested cases.\u201d PUA \u00a7 25-106(a) grants a right to submit a claim for any fee or charge levied by the WSSC, except assessment or benefit charges authorized by Subtitle 2 of Title 25 of the Public Utilities Article.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pursuant to PUA \u00a7 25 \u2014 106(c)(2), upon the request of a claimant, the WSSC is <em>required </em>to hold a hearing. The object of a hearing generally is to determine whether the claimant is entitled to a refund under PUA \u00a7 25-106 and, if so, in what amount. Further, the WSSC is an \u201cagency\u201d for the purposes of the definition of a \u201ccontested case\u201d as it (1) derives its existence from Division II of the Public Utilities Article of the Maryland Code, PUA \u00a7 17-101; (2) operates in portions of two counties, PUA \u00a7 17-501; and, (3) is authorized to hear contested cases pursuant to PUA \u00a7 25-106. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 202(b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>We held in <em>Donocam Associates v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>302 Md. 501, 503, 489 A.2d 26, 27 (1985), that the WSSC is a state agency subject to the requirements of the APA and that a hearing regarding an assessment to fund the construction of additional sewer and water lines was a \u201ccontested case.\u201d 302 Md. at 503, 489 A.2d at 27, <em>cited with approval in Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>413 Md. 606, 631, 994 A.2d 411, 426 (2010). Although the procedures of the hearing required in <em>Donocam </em>were not elaborated in the statute, we concluded that the hearing would fall necessarily under the ambit of the requirements of the APA. <em>Donocam, </em>302 Md. at 513, 489 A.2d at 32 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Because refund claims pursuant to PUA \u00a7 25-106 in which a hearing is requested are \u201ccontested cases\u201d pursuant to Maryland\u2019s APA, an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals was authorized here. The State Government Article, \u00a7 10-223 authorizes appeals to the intermediate appellate court \u201cin the manner that law provides for appeal of civil cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Lafarge\u2019s petition for judicial review, the WSSC\u2019s appeal to the intermediate appellate court, and its petition to us for a writ of certiorari were timely. The WSSC appealed the decision of the Circuit Court within 30 days of the judgment of the Circuit Court, as required by Maryland Rule 8-202, and petitioned us for a writ of certiorari within 15 days after Court of Special Appeals issued its mandate, as required by Maryland Rule 8-302. The present case is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">II. <em>Reversal of the Deemed Denial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The WSSC argues that the Circuit Court\u2019s scope of review of the \u201cdeemed denial\u201d of Lafarge\u2019s refund claim was limited to determining whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the denial. According to the WSSC, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>upon finding a lack of substantial evidence, the Circuit Court did not have then the authority to engage in its own factual inquiry whether Lafarge was entitled to a refund. The agency argues that the Circuit Court was authorized only to remand the case to the WSSC to engage in a fact-finding hearing and issue an appropriate decision based on the evidence, i.e., the court should order a \u201cdo-over,\u201d with the potential that the WSSC could deny the claim altogether. Although the WSSC states correctly the general standard of judicial review of agency decisions, it misunderstands (conveniently) the intent of the Legislature\u2019s codification of PUA \u00a7 25-106 and how the courts may carry-out best that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The WSSC\u2019s refund process, and the Circuit Court\u2019s authority to review refund actions (or failures to act resulting in a final denial decision by operation of law) of the WSSC, derives from PUA \u00a7 25-106. Our primary goal when interpreting statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Williams v. Peninsula Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>440 Md. 573, 580, 103 A.3d 658, 663 (2014); <em>Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore City, </em>387 Md. 1, 11, 874 A.2d 439, 445 (2005); <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002). We look first to the text of the statute, and \u201c[i]f the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction.\u201d <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 275, 987 A.2d 18, 28-29 (2010); <em>accord Bost v. State, </em>406 Md. 341, 350, 958 A.2d 356, 361 (2008) (citing <em>Ishola v. State, </em>404 Md. 155, 160, 945 A.2d 1273, 1276 (2008)); <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111, 1114 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">PUA \u00a7 25-106 makes clear that the Legislature intended for refund claims to be investigated and decided within 180 days from the filing of the claim. If the WSSC falls short of this benchmark, the resultant deemed denial of the claim by operation of law is subject to judicial review. The relevant portions of PUA \u00a7 25-106 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>(b) <em>Claims. </em>\u2014 (1) A person may file a written claim with the Commission, in a form and containing the information and supporting documents required by the Commission, for a refund of the amount of a fee or charge the person paid to the Commission that exceeds the amount that is properly and legally payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">(c) <em>Investigation. </em>\u2014 (1) On the receipt of a claim for a refund under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall investigate the merits of the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">(2) On the request of the claimant, the Commission, or the Commission\u2019s designee, shall hold a hearing on the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">(4) The Commission shall pay interest on any amount refunded under this section, calculated at the rate of 6% per year, starting 180 days from the date the claim was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">(d) <em>Failure to reach a final decision. </em>\u2014 If the Commission fails to reach a final decision on a claim within 180 days after the date the claim is filed, the failure shall be deemed a final rejection of the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">(e) <em>Judicial Review. </em>\u2014 Within 30 days after the date of final action by the Commission on a claim for a refund filed under subsection (b) of this section, a petition for judicial review may be filed with the circuit court as provided in Title 7, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The legislative choice to use the mandatory word \u201cshall\u201d indicates that the General Assembly intended for the 180 day limitation not to be discretionary or without consequences.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 63, 21 A.3d 1048, 1052 (2011) (\u201cAs this Court and the intermediate appellate court have reiterated on numerous occasions, the word \u2018shall\u2019 indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>cates the intent that a provision is mandatory.\u201d) (citing <em>State v.

PUA \u00a7 25-106(d) supplies a result if the WSSC fails to meet the statutory deadline: \u201cthe failure shall be deemed a final rejection of the claim.\u201d The claimant may move-on then and seek judicial review of the deemed denial. Nee PUA \u00a7 25-106(e).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The WSSC\u2019s interpretation would render nugatory portions of PUA \u00a7 25-106. If the Circuit Court was obliged merely to remand the case to the WSSC for a complete \u201cdo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>over,\u201d without consequences, after the agency failed to develop a more complete agency record and decide the case within 180 days, the purposes underlying PUA \u00a7 25-106(d) would be meaningless indeed. Even without the deemed-denial provisions of PUA \u00a7 25-106(d), after the passage of 180 days, a common law mandamus action might lie.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We will not interpret statutes in such a way as to render them meaningless or nugatory, if reasonable alternatives are available. <em>E.g., Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 302-303, 783 A.2d 667, 672 (2001), <em>quoted with approval in Miller v. Mathias, </em>428 Md. 419, 451, 52 A.3d 53, 72 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">PUA \u00a7 25-106 is a remedial statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As such, the statute must be construed liberally to effectuate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>remedial purpose of the legislation. <em>Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys. of City of Baltimore v. Dorsey, </em>430 Md. 100, 113, 59 A.3d 990, 997 (2013) (citing <em>Marsheck v. Bd. of Trustees of Fire &amp; Police Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys. of City of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 403, 749 A.2d 774, 779 (2000)); <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>413 Md. 606, 620, 994 A.2d 411, 420 (2010); <em>Elste v. ISG Sparrows Point, LLC, </em>188 Md.App. 634, 653, 982 A.2d 938, 949 (2009). Three goals are evinced by the plain language of PUA \u00a7 25-106: (1) to refund charges assessed improperly by the WSSC<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; (2) for the WSSC to determine timely refund claims (i.e., within 180 days); and, (3) for judicial review of denied claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Adopting the WSSC\u2019s interpretation would frustrate the remedial aims of PUA \u00a7 25-106. Providing the WSSC with a second opportunity to consider outright denial of a refund would mock the requirement of timely determination of refund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>claims and render judicial review a waste of scarce judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Courts are inhibited, however, in their exercise of judgment as to how to effectuate the will of the Legislature. As the WSSC points out, Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights in the Maryland Constitution (requiring separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers) prevents the courts from making <em>de novo </em>administrative decisions in cases in which some exercise of agency expertise or discretion may yet remain to be applied. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 228, 334 A.2d 514, 525 (1975). Because agency expertise may be exercised by the WSSC in determining the appropriate amount of the charges collected in error, it would be unconstitutional for a court to consider <em>de novo </em>the amount of a refund claim where that issue has not been adjudicated administratively as yet.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The Circuit Court, while sailing its course to a proper resolution of the present case, avoided both the Scylla of running afoul of the Declaration of Rights and the Charybdis of interpreting PUA \u00a7 25-106 contrary to the intent of the Legislature. The intent of the Legislature codified in PUA \u00a7 25-106 demands that the case not be remanded to the WSSC back to \u201cSquare One.\u201d The Declaration of Rights bars the courts from considering evidence <em>de novo </em>and judicial review prevents it as well. The Circuit Court violated neither principle by reversing the deemed rejection by the WSSC and ordering remand for the agency to calculate and issue an appropriate refund according to its standard procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The Circuit Court\u2019s decision in the present case was not outside the normal scope of judicial review in the main. A court reviewing an agency decision must decide, based on whatever the record reveals, whether the agency\u2019s decision is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and whether the discretionary determinations of the agency may be maintained in the face of the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. <em>See Spencer v. Maryland State Bd. of Pharmacy, </em>380 Md. 515, 530 n. 4, 846 A.2d 341, 349 n. 4 (2004). Indeed, in most \u201cdenied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>operation of law\u201d cases (at least where the agency record contains absolutely no basis for denial or an explanation for why an actual timely hearing and decision was not made), a reviewing court would be hard-pressed, on judicial review, not to reverse the deemed denial. In the present case, the record consisted only of Lafarge\u2019s 6 March 2012 refund request and its 9 April 2012 hearing request (with supporting attachments), as the WSSC maintained.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Based on the agency \u201crecord,\u201d the deemed denial of Lafarge\u2019s claim was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial court also found that the WSSC\u2019s failure to decide affirmatively Lafarge\u2019s claim was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Although a case should be remanded ordinarily to an agency when the reviewing court determines that the agency decision was not supported by substantial evidence or was arbitrary and capricious, <em>see, e.g., Maryland Bd. of Pub. Works v. K. Hovnanian\u2019s Four Seasons at Kent Island, LLC, </em>425 Md. 482, 522, 42 A.3d 40, 63 (2012); <em>Bereano v. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>403 Md. 716, 756, 944 A.2d 538, 561 (2008), doing so for deemed denials pursuant to PUA \u00a7 25-106, without limitation, would be contrary to the purposes underlying the statute, as we have noted above.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The only path forward is to reverse a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>deemed denial by the WSSC that is unsupported by substantial evidence or arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><em>Anne Arundel County v. Halle Development, Inc., </em>408 Md. 539, 971 A.2d 214 (2009) is instructive.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In <em>Halle Development, </em>a class of property owners sought to recover development impact fees that they argued were assessed improperly by Anne Arundel County. 408 Md. at 543, 971 A.2d at 216. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County held that the property owners were entitled to refunds. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>Halle Dev., </em>408 Md. at 551, 971 A.2d at 221. We issued a writ of certiorari to consider, among other questions, whether the Circuit Court erred by declining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>to remand fully the case after reversing decisions of the County administrative officials. <em>Halle Dev., </em>408 Md. at 551-52, 971 A.2d at 221. The County contended that the Circuit Court was obligated to remand the case. We affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">We concluded in <em>Halle Development </em>that no administrative function remained to be performed after the County agency failed to perform administrative functions within the required time period. <em>Halle Dev., </em>408 Md. at 558-59, 971 A.2d at 225. We refused to allow the county \u201cto go back and make administrative decisions that it failed to effectively execute when permitted.\u201d <em>Halle Dev., </em>408 Md. at 559, 971 A.2d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In <em>Halle Development, </em>the Circuit Court remanded for the precise determination of which property owners were eligible for refunds.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> 408 Md. at 550, 971 A.2d at 220. The trial court did not attempt to determine exactly which charges were assessed properly against which property owners. Instead, the Circuit Court remanded for additional determination by the County agencies, which decision would be subject to subsequent judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The present case shares the key considerations reflected in <em>Halle Development. </em>As in <em>Halle Development, </em>the administrative agency is obliged to act within a limited time period, but failed to fulfil its obligation. In both cases, a circuit court ordered the agency to issue a refund, without giving the agency a second chance to determine whether to deny outright a refund. Finally, in both cases, additional agency consideration was ordered regarding the proper amount of the refund owed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Given the legislative intent to provide for refunds when charges are assessed improperly, it is appropriate to remand the case to the WSSC for calculation of the amount of the refund due. The legislative intent evident from the plain language of PUA \u00a7 25-106 is that refunds should be issued for improperly assessed charges.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">III. <em>Production of the Investigative File</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Our holding regarding the Circuit Court\u2019s reversal of the WSSC\u2019s deemed denial of Lafarge\u2019s claim and limited remand renders moot the WSSC\u2019s question regarding the authority of the Circuit Court to order production of the agency\u2019s investigative file, whether for consideration as part of the agency \u201crecord\u201d or otherwise. We note, however, an observation or two as to this contretemps because instances of judicial review of deemed denials by operation of law are \u201can exotic bird in these woods.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The WSSC does not claim any prejudice resulting from the production of the investigative file. Indeed, production of additional documents could help furnish the sparse administrative record with evidence sufficient to justify the deemed denial. By the same token, this sort of \u201cevidence\u201d had not been tested by the crucibles of examination/cross-examination (if a witness or witnesses were called to authenticate or identify the documents) or rebuttal evidence. None<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>theless, \u201c[i]t is the policy of this Court not to reverse for harmless error and the burden is on the appellant in all cases to show prejudice as well as error.\u201d <em>Crane v. Dunn, </em>382 Md. 83, 91, 854 A.2d 1180, 1185 (2004) (citing <em>Rippon v. Mercantile Safe Deposit Co., </em>213 Md. 215, 222, 131 A.2d 695, 698 (1957)). As such, we decline to determine whether the Circuit Court erred by ordering the WSSC to produce, in this judicial review proceeding, additional documents from the agency\u2019s preliminary investigation of the claim. Generally, supplementation of an agency record while on judicial review is not permitted, except where agency bias or improper ex parte communications are asserted. <em>See Montgomery Cnty. v.

We described briefly the history of this exception, from its origin in 1785 to relatively modern times, in <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Bd. of Sup\u2019rs of Elections, </em>345 Md. 477, 487-90, 693 A.2d 757, 762-63 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\">. The predecessor to PUA \u00a7 25-106(e) was Maryland Code (1957), Article 29, \u00a7 6-111(e), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">Within 30 days from the date of final action by the WSSC on a claim for refund filed under this section, <em>an appeal from the final action may be made to the circuit court and the appellate courts of this State </em>as provided in Title 7, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules, [emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">As part of Maryland\u2019s decades-long re-codification efforts, Art. 29, \u00a7 6-111(e) was re-codified by Senate Bill 96 of 2010 as PUA \u00a7 25-106(e), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">Within 30 days after the date of final action by the Commission on a claim for a refund filed under subsection (b) of this section, <em>a petition for judicial review may be filed with the circuit court </em>as provided in Title 7, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules, [emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">There are indications, however, that the Legislature did not intend to remove the ability to appeal (seek judicial review of) a circuit court's disposition of a refund claim to the intermediate appellate court. It is well established that, as a general rule, alterations in statutory language resulting from Maryland\u2019s code revision process are not intended to be substantive. <em>Comptroller of Treasury v.

The uncodified preamble to Senate Bill 96 and committee reports generated during the drafting process further indicate that the Legislature did not intend to change the substance of the pre-existing law with regard to access to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The Revisor's Note provides insight into the intent of the Legislature. <em>Blanton, </em>390 Md. at 538, 890 A.2d at 285 (citing <em>Dean v.

The Revisor's Note to Bill 96 (PUA \u00a7 25-106) indicates generally that the \u201csection is new language derived without substantial change....\" Regarding PUA \u00a7 25-106(e), it notes that \"the former reference to filing an appeal with 'the appellate courts of this State' [was] deleted because according to the Maryland Rules, a petition for judicial review of an administrative decision shall be filed with the circuit court.\" The deletion appears intended to clarify that judicial review replaces the former reference to \"appeals\u201d and that review would be obtained first in a circuit court, but not to foreclose subsequent appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\">. Lafarge argued before the intermediate appellate court that the appellate review provisions of Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\u201d) do not apply to refund claims because refund claims, pursuant to PUA \u00a7 25-106, are not \"contested cases\u201d as defined in Maryland Code (1984, 2014 Repl.Vol.), State Government Article, \u00a7 10-202(d).

The WSSC incants an alternative narrative based on a letter found within the bill file for House Bill 1170 of 1986, which would become codified as Art. 29, \u00a7 6-11 and re-codified later as PUA \u00a7 25-106(e). As first presented, Bill 1170 allowed for <em>de novo </em>appeals to the Tax Court of denied refund requests. Without explanation for the sake of posterity, the Bill was amended in committee to authorize judicial review by a circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The WSSC asserts that authorizing judicial review of deemed denials was a drafting mistake. According to the agency, the Legislature intended there to be additional <em>de novo </em>proceedings before another agency (the Maryland Tax Court) after a deemed denial pursuant to PUA \u00a7 25-106(d), not judicial review as a plain reading of the statute would suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The WSSC's urging does not overcome the unambiguous plain language of the resultant statute. \u201cWe cannot assume authority to read into the Act what the Legislature apparently deliberately left out. Judicial construction should only be resorted to when an ambiguity exists.\u201d <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 388, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003) (quoting <em>Howard Contr. Co. v. Yeager, </em>184 Md. 503, 511, 41 A.2d 494, 498 (1945)). PUA \u00a7 25-106(d) is clear that a refund claim is considered a final denial by operation of law if the WSSC does not issue a decision within 180 days. PUA \u00a7 25-106(e) is unambiguous that a claimant may petition the proper circuit court for judicial review of such a denial. Attempting to uncover hidden meaning in the statute from a disregarded portion of legislative history is more likely to frustrate the will of the Legislature than advance it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\">. It seems rather predictable what the outcome of judicial review will be in the probable majority of denial by operation of law refund cases where the WSSC failed to act timely. There is a high order of probability that the agency \"record\u201d in such cases will be as scanty as was the case here, leaving little or no basis for upholding the denial based on \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d analysis where the only \"evidence\u201d is the refund requestor\u2019s refund and hearing requests. The outcome is foreseeable and may be referred to popularly as a \"slam dunk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\">.

PUA \u00a7 25-106(a) provides a remedy for overcharges by the WSSC, subsection (d) requires the WSSC to determine the validity of a refund claim within 180 days, and subsection (e) provides for judicial review to ensure the agency\u2019s compliance. The orderly and timely administration by the WSSC is central to the statute, with consequences provided for failure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\">. Passage of the predecessor to PUA \u00a7 25-106 was motivated in part, it seems, by our decision in <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission v. C.I. Mitchell &amp; Best Co., </em>303 Md. 544, 495 A.2d 30 (1985). In <em>C.I. Mitchell &amp; Best Co., </em>a class of plaintiffs sought the refund of assertedly improper payments to the WSSC and a declaratory judgment that the assessment charging scheme was improper. 303 Md. 544, 553, 495 A.2d 30, 34. Ultimately, we held that the charges were illegal, but that Maryland\u2019s voluntary payment rule prevented a refund of the charges. <em>C.I. Mitchell &amp; Best Co., </em>303 Md. 544, 549, 495 A.2d 30, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Fourteen days after we filed an order of denial of a motion for reconsideration in <em>C.I. Mitchell &amp; Best Co., </em>the attorney who represented the claimants sent a letter to a member of the House of Delegates advocating the need for legislation authorizing refunds for improper WSSC charges and offering suggestions how to accomplish that goal. Letter from Charles G. Dalrymple, Esq., to Del. Jerry H. Hyatt (September 25, 1985) (in bill file of Maryland House Bill 1170 of 1986). In January of 1986, Delegate Hyatt drafted and submitted the bill to the General Assembly. The letter found eventually its place in the bill file retained by the Department of Legislative Services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\">. For the reasons discussed below in Part II, we decline to determine whether the investigative materials were properly part of the record in the posture in which the case reached the Circuit Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\">. The WSSC does not argue to us that there was substantial evidence to support the denial of Lafarge's claim. The agency admits that the record was not developed sufficiently to support denial of some refund amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\">. The court need not remand to the administrative agency if doing so would be futile. <em>O'Donnell v. Bassler, </em>289 Md. 501, 510, 425 A.2d 1003, 1008 (1981); <em>see also Green v. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, </em>430 Md. 119, 143, 59 A.3d 1001, 1015 (2013) (ordering the case remanded to the Tax Court, but directing the Tax Court\u2019s decision); <em>Anne Arundel Cnty. v.

In the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>case, although there remains the possibility for additional fact-finding as to the proper amount of the refund due Lafarge, permitting the outright denial of the claim would be contrary to the intent of the Legislature codified in PUA \u00a7 25-106, and hence contrary to law. The only decision that the WSSC may make consistent with the intent of the Legislature is to determine the proper amount of the refund due. The option to deny Lafarge's claim is foreclosed by the failure to act within the allowed 180 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\">. The property-owner plaintiffs in <em>Halle Development </em>did not petition for judicial review. Rather, they claimed that the failure to refund impact fees: \"(1) constituted an unconstitutional taking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, (2) violated the Owners rights under the Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and (3) unjustly enriched the County, creating the basis for a constructive trust.\u201d <em>Halle Dev., </em>408 Md. at 547, 971 A.2d at 219. Nevertheless, determination of the case required review of administrative decisions and actions. <em>See Halle Dev., </em>408 Md. at 552, 971 A.2d at 222. When the courts review the decisions of an administrative agency, \"the standard of review is the same,\u201d regardless of the grounds upon which the action was filed. <em>Bowen v.

On appeal, the WSSC did not take exception to the part of the Circuit Court\u2019s order requiring that the refund be calculated in accordance with Standard Procedures for Adjustment and Correction of Water/Sewer Bill, SP Number CUS 10-01. Further, if CUS 10-01 is a standard and uniform method of determining refunds, as the parties\u2019 memoranda before the Circuit Court (and the document\u2019s title and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>content) suggest, then it might be arbitrary and capricious for the WSSC to calculate Lafarge's refund using a different standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\">. In addition to the provisions cited above, PUA \u00a7 25-106(f) authorizes refunds for excess charges even if there is no pending claim for the refund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\">.
