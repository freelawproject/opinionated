In particular, we address whether the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 11.12.01.15(A),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which Petitioners have referred to as the \u201cSingle Document Rule,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prevents an automobile dealer from relying on an arbitration provision found in a Buyer\u2019s Order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but not explicitly within the four corners of the Retail Installment Sales Contract (\u201cRISC\u201d). We conclude that COMAR 11.12.01.15(A) does not, as Petitioners suggest, displace our common law contract principles permitting multiple documents from being construed together as evincing the entire agreement of the parties. <em>Rourke v. Amchem Prods., Inc., </em>384 Md. 329, 354, 863 A.2d 926, 941 (2004); <em>Rocks v. Brosius, </em>241 Md. 612, 637, 217 A.2d 531, 545 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">This case arises from Petitioners\u2019, Willie Mae Ford and Rashad Earle Beale, purchase and finance of an automobile from Respondent, Antwerpen Motorcars Ltd. (\u201cAntwerpen\u201d), on April 24, 2010. Petitioners aver that Antwerpen faded to properly disclose the vehicle\u2019s history, including its involvement in a collision and use as a short-term rental. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>gravamen of Petitioners\u2019 dispute before this Court concerns not the vehicle\u2019s history, but rather the existence, or lack thereof, of an agreement to arbitrate disputes under the terms of the vehicle sales contract. In determining whether Petitioners\u2019 claims against Antwerpen are subject to a mandatory arbitration provision, we consider two documents executed by the parties during the transaction. On the same day, Petitioners executed both a Buyer\u2019s Order \u2014 which sets forth the purchase price \u2014 and a Retail Installment Sales Contract (\u201cRISC\u201d) \u2014 which contains the financing terms of the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In relevant part, the Buyer\u2019s Order provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\n<em>AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">Buyer(s) (also referred to as \u201cYou\u201d) and Dealer agree that if any Dispute arises, the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">A Dispute is any question as to whether something must be mediated and the terms and procedures of the mediation, as well as any allegation concerning a violation of a sales state or federal statute that may be subject of mediation, any monetary claim whether contract, tort, or other, arising from the negotiation of and terms of the Buyer\u2019s Order, any service contract or insurance product, or any retail installment sale contract or lease (but this mediation agreement does not apply to and shall not be binding on any assignee thereof).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">The parties understand that they are waiving their rights to jury a trial and class consideration of all claims and disputes between them not specifically exempted from arbitration in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">The front and back of this buyer\u2019s order, along with other documents signed by You in connection with this order, comprise the entire agreement between the parties affecting this purchase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Petitioners\u2019 signatures appear directly below the language contained in the Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The RISC, which sets forth the terms of the financing agreement between Petitioners and Antwerpen, does not include an agreement to arbitrate. Specifically, the RISC provides that \u2018You, the Buyer (and Co-Buyer, if any), may buy the vehicle below for cash or on credit. By signing this contract, you choose to buy the vehicle on credit under the agreements on the front and back of this contract.\u201d Following the various financing terms contained in the agreement, the RISC provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]his contract along with all other documents signed by you in connection with the purchase of this vehicle, comprise the entire agreement between you and us affecting this purchase.\u201d (Emphasis added). Petitioners\u2019 signatures are located two sentences after this provision. The RISC further provides that it is governed by the Creditor Grantor Closed End Credit Provisions (\u201cCLEC\u201d), Md.Code (1975, 2013 Repl.Vol., 2014 Supp.), \u00a7 12-1001 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cCom. Law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Petitioners filed their Complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on April 29, 2013, after discovering the vehicle\u2019s alleged incident history. In their Complaint, Petitioners asserted the following causes of action against Antwerpen: Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Count I); violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (Count II); Deceit by Non-Disclosure or Concealment of Prior Rental and Accident (Counts III \u2014 IV); Negligent Misrepresentation (Count V); and Contract (Count VI). Antwerpen moved to compel arbitration on the basis of the Agreement to Arbitrate contained in the Buyer\u2019s Order. Petitioners opposed Antwerpen\u2019s motion on the grounds that the language of the Buyer\u2019s Order was superseded by the RISC, which contained no arbitration agreement. Following a hearing on Antwerpen\u2019s motion on October 21, 2013, the Circuit Court entered an order granting Antwerpen\u2019s Motion to Compel Arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>On November 18, 2013, Petitioners appealed to the Court of Special Appeals seeking a reversal of the judgment entered in the Circuit Court. Prior to any proceedings in the Court of</p>\n<p id=\"AxC2\">Special Appeals, we granted Petitioners\u2019 <em>certiorari </em>petition, <em>Ford v. Antwerpen Motorcars, </em>440 Md. 114, 99 A.3d 778 (2014), to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">(1) Under Maryland contract law, is an arbitration provision not contained in a vehicle sales contract, but found in a Buyer\u2019s Order executed on the same day, enforceable where the applicable Maryland regulations require vehicle sales contracts to \u201ccontain[] all agreements of the parties\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">As explained in greater detail below, we shall answer that question in the affirmative and hold that, for the purposes of the instant case, the Buyer\u2019s Order may be construed together with the RISC as evincing the entire agreement between the parties. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">An order compelling arbitration is a final and appeal-able judgment of the trial court. <em>Holloman v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>391 Md. 580, 588, 894 A.2d 547, 551 ,(2006). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s conclusion as to whether a particular dispute is subject to arbitration is a conclusion of law,\u201d which we review for legal correctness. <em>Walther v. Sovereign Bank, </em>386 Md. 412, 422, 872 A.2d 735, 741 (2005); <em>Holloman, </em>391 Md. at 588, 894 A.2d at 551. When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision compelling arbitration, our role \u201c \u2018extends only to a determination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walther, </em>386 Md. at 422, 872 A.2d at 741 (quoting <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Stinebaugh, </em>374 Md. 631, 645, 824 A.2d 87, 95 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The parties\u2019 present dispute concerns the existence of an agreement to arbitrate contained in the Buyer\u2019s Order and, in particular, whether multiple documents signed during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the purchase and finance of the vehicle may be read together as constituting the entire agreement between the parties to a vehicle sales contract. \u201cThe issue of whether an agreement to arbitrate exists is governed by contract principles.\u201d <em>Holloman, </em>391 Md. at 590, 894 A.2d at 552; <em>Walther, </em>386 Md. at 425, 872 A.2d at 743 (citation omitted) (\u201cWhether a valid arbitration agreement exists ... \u2018depends on contract principles since arbitration is a matter of contract.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Curtis G. Testerman Co. v. Buck, </em>340 Md. 569, 579, 667 A.2d 649, 654 (1995) (citation omitted) (\u201cArbitration is \u2018consensual; a creature of contract.... In the absence of an express arbitration agreement, no party may be compelled to submit to arbitration in contravention of its right to legal process.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u201cThe fundamental rule in the construction and interpretation of contracts is that the intention of the parties as expressed in the language of the contract controls the analysis.\u201d <em>Buck, </em>340 Md. at 580, 667 A.2d at 654. \u201cIn construing contracts, Maryland follows the objective interpretation principle. If the language of the contract is unambiguous, we give effect to its plain meaning and do not delve into what the parties may have subjectively intended.\u201d <em>Rourke v. Amchem Prods., Inc., </em>384 Md. 329, 354, 863 A.2d 926, 941 (2004). \u201c \u2018[A] party who signs a contract is presumed to have read and understood its terms and as such will be bound by its execution.\u2019 ... \u2018[W]e are loath to rescind a conspicuous agreement that was signed by a party whom now, for whatever reason, does not desire to fulfill that agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Koons Ford of Balt., Inc. v. Lobach, </em>398 Md. 38, 46, 919 A.2d 722, 727 (2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Petitioners contend that the Circuit Court erred in granting Antwerpen\u2019s motion by construing the arbitration provision contained in the Buyer\u2019s Order together with the RISC. In Petitioners\u2019 view, the RISC constitutes the vehicle sales contract, and it does not contain an arbitration clause. Therefore, Petitioners contend that the RISC and the Buyer\u2019s Order, as a matter of law, are separate agreements that may not be read together. In support of their position, Petitioners rely sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>stantially upon the language of COMAR 11.12.01.15(A), which Petitioners refer to as the \u201cSingle Document Rule.\u201d This regulation provides that \u201c[e]very vehicle sales contract or agreement shall be evinced by an instrument in writing containing all of the agreements of the parties.\u201d Petitioners, directing this Court to the use of the singular term \u201can instrument,\u201d aver that \u201c[t]his means that, even if a contract in other situations might be comprised of several documents, in a car sale in Maryland COMAR requires all the terms of the contract must be contained in one document, or \u2018instrument\u2019 [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Where the vehicle is financed by the dealer, Petitioners assert that the RISC alone serves as the \u201cvehicle sales contract,\u201d because the RISC contains both the principal amount and interest charged. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1977, 2012 Repl.Vol., 2014 Supp.), \u00a7 15-311 of the Transportation Article (\u201cA contract for the sale of a vehicle by a dealer shall contain ... [t]he principal amount charged for the vehicle; [and] any interest charged on the principal amount[.]\u201d). Petitioners further maintain that the RISC, itself, purports to be the entire agreement between the parties because it provides that \u201c[b]y signing this contract, you choose to buy the vehicle on credit under the agreements on the front and back of this contract.\u201d Accordingly, the RISC, in Petitioners\u2019 view, must include all of the agreements between the parties within the four-corners of that document. Hence, Petitioners conclude that the failure of Antwerpen to include the arbitration provision within the RISC means that no such agreement exists and arbitration may not be compelled. This failure, they contend, renders the RISC and the Buyer\u2019s Order inconsistent and, as a result, the documents cannot be read together as one agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Antwerpen argues that, under well-established contract law, the Buyer\u2019s Order and RISC may be construed together as evincing the entire agreement of the parties. <em>See Rocks v. Brosius, </em>241 Md. 612, 637, 217 A.2d 531, 545 (1966). Antwerpen points out that, contrary to Petitioners\u2019 contention that the RISC contains an integration provision, the RISC incorpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>rates by reference the Buyer\u2019s Order and its arbitration provision by providing that \u201c[t]his contract along with all other documents signed by you in connection with the purchase of this vehicle, comprise the entire agreement.\u201d (Emphasis added). Further, Antwerpen contends that Petitioners have mischaracterized COMAR 11.12.01.15(A) as a \u201cSingle Document Rule.\u201d Antwerpen notes that Petitioners have failed to provide any authority using or creating the label \u201cSingle Document Rule\u201d in reference to COMAR 11.12.01.15(A). This regulation, Antwerpen asserts, \u201csimply does not state that all of the agreements ... must be in \u2018a single document.\u2019 \u201d Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 interpretation, the use of the phrase \u201can instrument\u201d does not preclude incorporating other documents by reference. Accordingly, Antwerpen asks this Court to affirm the decision of the Circuit Court compelling arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">We disagree with Petitioners that COMAR 11.12.01.15(A) supplants our longstanding common law contract principles permitting the construction or reading of multiple documents together as part of a single transaction. As explained by this Court in <em>Rocks, </em>241 Md. at 637, 217 A.2d at 545:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">A contract need not be evidenced by a single instrument. Where several instruments are made a part of a single transaction they will all be read and construed together as evidencing the intention of the parties in regard to the single transaction. This is true even though the instruments were executed at different times and do not in terms refer to each other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\"><em>See also Rourke, </em>384 Md. at 354, 863 A.2d at 941 (\u201cWhere the contract comprises two or more documents, the documents are to be construed together, harmoniously, so that, to the extent possible, all of the provisions can be given effect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Since 1978, COMAR 11.12.01.15(A) has provided that \u201c[e]very vehicle sales contract or agreement shall be evinced by an instrument in writing containing all of the agreements of the parties.\u201d <em>See </em>5:12 Md. R. 981 (June 16, 1978); 5:17 Md. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>1331 (August 25, 1978). Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 labeling of this regulation as the \u201cSingle Document Rule,\u201d the term \u201csingle\u201d is absent from the language. Nor is there any indication in our jurisprudence that, as a result of the use of the singular term \u201can instrument,\u201d a vehicle sales contract may not, as a matter of law, incorporate multiple documents by reference. To the contrary, the mere use of a singular term such as \u201can instrument\u201d or \u201ca contract,\u201d does not prevent the application of the principles in <em>Rocks </em>and <em>Rourke.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Petitioners have provided this Court with several opinions, which in Petitioners\u2019 view have \u201cconsistently and repeatedly reenforced the requirement that all agreements ... must be contained in one instrument, and have recognized that only the financing agreement or RISC contains all of the agreements of the parties.\u201d Upon review, the authorities provided, none of which are binding upon this Court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> offer little more than cursory, unpersuasive assertions lacking support in our jurisprudence. Indeed, these authorities either provide no textual support or cite to one of the other unpersuasive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>opinions Petitioners rely upon to present their case to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">To the extent the opinions Petitioners have provided this Court suggest that, in the context of a vehicle sale financed by the dealer, a Buyer\u2019s Order may not be construed together with the RISC, such opinions appear already to have been called into question by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Rota-McLarty v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., </em>700 F.3d 690 (4th Cir.2012). In <em>Rota-McLarty, </em>similar to the instant case, an individual executed a Buyer\u2019s Order \u2014 which contained an agreement to arbitrate \u2014 and a RISC \u2014 which contained no arbitration agreement \u2014 with the dealership during the purchase and financing of an automobile. <em>Id. </em>at 694-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In determining whether the arbitration agreement in the Buyer\u2019s Order was enforceable, the court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3M\">Rota-McLarty does advance a novel theory in support of integration on appeal, premised on Md.Code Regs. \u00a7 11.12.01.15, which provides that \u201cevery vehicle sales contract or agreement shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing containing all of the agreements of the parties.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 19. She seems to argue that the regulation requires one document by itself to constitute the parties\u2019 agreement, and thus we must read the Buyer\u2019s Order alone. Even if this argument is not waived, RotaMcLarty fails to provide any authority for her interpretation of the cited regulation, nor for the proposition that this regulation supplants an entire established body of Maryland law governing contract interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 700 n. 8 (emphasis added). Despite the presence of an integration clause in the RISC, the court concluded that \u201cRota-McLarty has failed to establish that the RISC\u2019s integration clause prevents reading both [the Buyer\u2019s Order and the RISC] together as a single agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Petitioners aver that reliance upon the footnote in <em>Rotar-McLarty </em>is inappropriate because, in their view, the issue of the \u201cSingle Document Rule\u201d had not been properly raised before that court. We need not resolve the present dispute on the basis of <em>Rotw-McLarty, </em>however. As explained above, Petitioners have failed to provide this Court with any persuasive or binding authority to support their proposition that only a single document by itself may constitute the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Turning to the language of the documents before this Court, the Buyer\u2019s Order and the RISC, reviewed and signed by Petitioners on the same day, indicate an intention that the documents be construed together as part of the same transaction. Notably, the RISC incorporates the Buyer\u2019s Order by reference and provides that \u201c[t]his contract along with all other documents signed by you in connection with the purchase of this vehicle, comprise the entire agreement.\u201d (Emphasis added). Petitioners\u2019 signatures were required almost immediately following this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Similarly, the Buyer\u2019s Order states that \u201c[t]he front and back of this buyer\u2019s order, along with other documents signed by You in connection with this order, comprise the entire agreement between the parties!.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Once again, Petitioners\u2019 signatures follow this provision. We also note that the Agreement to Arbitrate contained in the Buyer\u2019s Order refers directly to the RISC in its definition of \u201cdisputes.\u201d Indeed, the arbitration provisions states, in part, that \u201c[a] Dispute is ... any monetary claim whether contract, tort, or other, arising from the negotiation of and terms of the Buyer\u2019s Order, any service contract or insurance product, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>any retail installment sale contract.\u201d (Emphasis added). In other words, the arbitration agreement signed and agreed to by Petitioners on the same day as the RISC explicitly states that it applies to disputes arising out of the RISC.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">We reject Petitioners\u2019 contention that the language, \u201c[b]y signing this contract, you choose to buy the vehicle on credit under the agreements on the front and back of this contract\u201d means that the RISC purported to be the sole document considered for the purposes of the agreement between the parties and necessarily superseded the Buyer\u2019s Order. Absent from this language is any indication that any prior agreements, such as the Buyer\u2019s Order executed only moments prior to the RISC, were no longer of any force or effect as Petitioners suggest. As noted above, one of the agreements contained in the RISC requiring Petitioners\u2019 signatures was that \u201c[t]his contract along with all other documents signed by you in connection with the purchase of this vehicle, comprise the entire agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Accordingly, under our long standing common law contract principles as expressed in <em>Rocks </em>and <em>Rourke, </em>multiple documents may be construed together as evincing the entire agreement of the parties to a vehicle sales contract. The RISC and the Buyer\u2019s Order in the present case indicate an intention that they are to be read together as constituting one transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

With respect to <em>Smith, </em>Petitioners rely on a single footnote which (1) addresses an inapplicable act and (2) does not consider the possibility of incorporating by reference an arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"Abu\">Lastly, Petitioners have provided this Court with a letter of advisement from an assistant attorney general provided to the Motor Vehicle Administration which unequivocally provides that it is \u201cNOT AN OPINION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\u201d (emphasis in original) and opinions from other jurisdictions that interpret their own state statutes. <em>See, e.g., Raceway Ford Cases Larkin v. New Century Auto Sales Inc., </em>No. 12-13917, 2014 WL 29119 (E.D.Mich. Jan. 3, 2014); <em>Kroupa v. Sunrise Ford, </em>77 Cal.App.4th 835, 92 Cal.Rptr.2d 42 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\">. <em>Rota-McLarty </em>is not the only opinion which casts doubt upon Petitioners\u2019 assertion that \u201cMaryland courts ... have consistently and repeatedly enforced the requirement that all agreements of the parties, including arbitration agreements, must be contained in one instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>in vehicle sales transactions, and ... only the financing agreement or RISC contains all of the agreements of the parties.\u201d For instance, following the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision, an argument nearly identical to that of Petitioners' was rejected by a Maryland state trial court. <em>See Whitehead v. Driveline Auto., LLC, </em>No. 12-36674 (Cir. Ct. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., April 18, 2013). Interestingly, this opinion was issued by the same judge that previously decided <em>Rides, </em>which Petitioners cite to support their position. <em>See supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b529-9\">McDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGp\">concurring in the judgment, which BATTAGLIA, J., joins</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">In fantasy literature devoted to the battle between good and evil, the allegiance of elves, ores, dwarfs, and goblins is readily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>apparent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the battle between clarity and obfuscation in legal instruments, it is sometimes uncertain which side attorneys will take. This case turns on the drafting and placement of an arbitration agreement in one of several legal documents concerning the sale of a used car.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">I have attached to this opinion the \u201cbuyer\u2019s order\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Retail Installment Sales Contract (\u201cRISC\u201d) as they appear, somewhat enlarged, in the materials provided to this Court. The Majority opinion \u2014 a model of clarity itself \u2014 is able to navigate these documents. But a lay person interested in buying a used car would be well advised to bring along a lawyer, a magnifying glass, and perhaps an English major, to decipher their meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">There are significant differences between these two documents. Pertinent to this case, the buyer\u2019s order contains fine print in which the purchasers essentially waive future access to the public justice system for any disputes arising out of the transaction in favor of an alternative dispute process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The RISC does not contain such a provision. At issue is whether the terms of the RISC supersede those of the buyer\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The fine print at the bottom of the buyer\u2019s order states that \u201c[t]he front and back of this buyer\u2019s order, <em>along with other documents signed by You in connection with this order, </em>comprise the entire agreement between the parties affecting this purchase ...\u201d The RISC contains a similar reference to \u201call other documents signed by you.\u201d There is no indication in either document, nor is the record clear, as to the universe of \u201cother documents\u201d signed in connection with the purchase of this vehicle that are incorporated by reference. In any event, the universe of documents that comprise the transaction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>apparently not confined to signed documents. The bottom of the rear side of the \u201cbuyer\u2019s order\u201d states that \u201cThe information that you see on the window form for this vehicle is part of this contract. The information on the window form overrides any contrary provisions in the contract of sale.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similar language appears in a paragraph 5 on the reverse side of the RISC.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In an apparent effort to improve the possibility that a consumer might be aware of all of the terms affecting a purchase of a car, the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) has adopted a regulation that indisputably applies to the transaction in this case. That regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">Every vehicle sales contract or agreement shall be evidenced by <em>an instrument in writing containing all of the agreements </em>of the parties. It shall be signed by all of the parties before the seller delivers to the buyer the vehicle covered by the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">COMAR 11.12.01.15(A) (emphasis added). The plain language of the regulation establishes what might be called a \u201csingle instrument rule\u201d for car sales. Ms. Ford and Mr. Beale base their appeal entirely on the notion that this means a <em>single document </em>and that the RISC, which does not contain an arbitration provision, is that document. Antwerpen counters that the requisite instrument may be comprised of multiple documents and here includes the buyer\u2019s order. The Majority agrees with Antwerpen and concludes that arbitration clause in the buyer\u2019s order was not superseded by the RISC.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">I agree that a single instrument may be comprised of more than one document and, on that narrow point, given the language of these documents,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>1 join in the judgment. Wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>er these documents \u2014 and whatever else was purportedly incorporated in them \u2014 actually comply with the regulation is a question for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Judge BATTAGLIA has advised that she joins this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>INTENTIONALLY LIFT BLANK</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>intentionally left blank</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\">.
