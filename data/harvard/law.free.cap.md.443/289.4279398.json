(1991, 2008 Repl. Vol.) (\u201cLE\u201d) \u00a7 9-709(b)(3), a two-year statute of limitations, where the claim is electronically submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) before expiration of the two-year period, but not filed on paper until after expiration of the two-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">We hold that an employee\u2019s claim is time-barred under LE \u00a7 9-709(b)(3) where the claim is electronically submitted to the Commission before expiration of the two-year period, but not filed on paper with the Commission until after expiration of the two-year period. Stated otherwise, we hold that, under the relevant statutes and regulations, electronic submission of a claim does not constitute \u201cfiling\u201d pursuant to Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 14.09.02.02A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Commission erred in ruling that the filing date of a claim could, for purposes of the statute of limitations, be the date of the claim\u2019s electronic submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A36z\">\n<em>First Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">This case arises out of a workers\u2019 compensation claim filed by Mark G. Hranicka (\u201cHranicka\u201d), Petitioner, as a result of an injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident on January 6, 2010. On January 14, 2010, Chesapeake Surgical, Ltd. (\u201cthe Employer\u201d), Respondent, prepared a \u201cWorkers Compensation \u2014 First Report of Injury or Illness.\u201d The Employer and NorGUARD Insurance Company (\u201cthe Insurer\u201d), Respondent, mailed to the Commission the First Report of Injury or Illness, which was received and filed by the Commission on January 21, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">On January 14, 2010, Hranicka completed and executed a C-l Claim Form, which was filed on paper with and date stamped by the Commission on January 28, 2010, and assigned claim number \u201cW016210.\u201d On February 3, 2010, the Commission issued a \u201cNotice of Employee\u2019s Claim\u201d and assigned a \u201cconsideration date\u201d of February 24, 2010, for Respondents to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>contest the claim. Respondents contested the claim before the consideration date deadline, and the case was set for a hearing before the Commission. On May 20, 2010, at the hearing, the parties appeared before the Commission, and Hranicka requested that his workers\u2019 compensation claim be withdrawn. On May 24, 2010, the Commission ordered that the workers\u2019 compensation claim be withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\n<em>Second Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Nothing further concerning Hranicka\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim occurred until 2012. On January 17, 2012, Hranicka electronically submitted to the Commission a second C-l Claim Form, identifying the date of the accident as January 6, 2010. The Commission\u2019s online program recorded the date and time of the electronic submission at the bottom of the second C-l Claim Form, underneath the signature and date lines, as \u201cReceived: 1/17/2012 11:26:13 AM.\u201d On January 20, 2012, Hranicka executed two forms: (1) the second C-l Claim Form, which he had electronically submitted on January 17, 2012; and (2) an \u201cAuthorization for Disclosure of Health Information.\u201d On January 24, 2012, the executed second C-l Claim Form was filed on paper with and date stamped by the Commission, and assigned claim number \u201cW032036.\u201d On that same day, January 24, 2012, the authorization form was filed with the Commission. On January 27, 2012, the Commission issued a new \u201cNotice of Employee\u2019s Claim\u201d and assigned a consideration date of February 17, 2012, for Respondents to contest the claim. The new \u201cNotice of Employee\u2019s Claim\u201d stated that Hranicka\u2019s C-l Claim Form was received on January 24, 2012, the date on which the paper copy was filed. On February 12, 2012, Respondents contested the claim, contending that the claim was time-barred by LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 709(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">On May 31, 2012, the Commission conducted a hearing at which Commissioner Cynthia S. Miraglia (\u201cCommissioner Miraglia\u201d) presided. During the hearing, Commissioner Miraglia stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">[HranickaJ\u2019s claim form came in on the 17th. When an electronic claim is filed, we accept the claim for statu[t]e [of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>limitations] purposes. But you cannot file an electronic signature because of the concern of privacy and security. So the claim is \u2014 for limitation^] purposes on the 17th. However, we don\u2019t have a final notice until we get in the signed claim forms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">But just for everyone\u2019s edification, when an electronic claim form comes in to the Commission, that date is the date we use for limitation[s] purposes. Now, if you never send in a signed copy, then, obviously, then we\u2019re at another issue. But in this case, they clearly did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, Commissioner Miraglia determined that the claim was not time-barred, and on June 12, 2012, issued an order stating the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On June 18, 2012, Respondents filed with the Commission a \u201cRequest for Rehearing,\u201d arguing that the Commission\u2019s June 12, 2012, decision was \u201cincorrect as a matter of law.\u201d On July 11, 2012, the Commission denied the request for rehearing. On July 18, 2012, Respondents filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d) a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s June 12, 2012, and July 11, 2012, decisions. On February 5, 2013, Respondents filed in the circuit court a motion for summary judgment, alleging that Hranicka\u2019s claim was barred by LE \u00a7 9-709(b)(3) and that, under COMAR 14.09.02.02A, electronic submission of a claim does not constitute \u201cfiling\u201d of a claim. Hranicka filed a response in opposition to the motion for summary judgment as well as a request for a hearing, and the circuit court denied the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Respondents appealed and, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed, holding that using the electronic submission date of the claim form for purposes of the statute of limitations instead of the date that the claim form is filed on paper with and date-stamped by the Commission is inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s regulations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>incorrect as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hranicka filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which this Court granted. <em>See Hranicka v. Chesapeake Surgical Ltd., </em>440 Md. 461, 103 A.3d 593 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Hranicka contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred concluding that the Commission could not generate a procedural rule to relate claims back to their electronic submission dates for purposes of the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hranicka argues that COMAR 14.09.02.02A does not prohibit the Commission from accepting the date a claim form is electronically submitted by a claimant as the filing date. Hranicka asserts that the Commission\u2019s website provides instructions indicating that a claim has been \u201cfiled\u201d once the claim has been submitted electronically. Hranicka maintains that one of the purposes of the Commission\u2019s Web-Enabled File Management System is to facilitate the electronic filing of workers\u2019 compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Hranicka contends that, given the remedial nature of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the principle that the Act should be construed liberally in favor of employees, any ambiguity concerning the filing date should be construed in his favor. Hranicka asserts that, because Respondents knew of the claim as early as January 6, 2010, when the accident occurred, and because Respondents admitted in the circuit court that they were not prejudiced between the electronic submission and the paper filing, electronic submission of the claim was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Respondents respond that the Court of Special Appeals correctly held that Hranicka\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim is time-barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Respondents contend that COMAR 14.09.02.02A makes clear that electronic submission of a claim form does not constitute \u201cfiling.\u201d Respondents argue that neither the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act nor the Commission\u2019s regulations permit, for purposes of the statute of limitations, a \u201crelation back\u201d to the date on which a claimant electronically submitted a claim form. Respondents assert that COMAR 14.09.02.02A(4) and (5) require an original signature for the filing of any document, and point out that an electronic submission does not contain an original signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Generally, in an appeal from judicial review of an agency action, we review the agency\u2019s decision directly, not the decision of the circuit court or the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Cosby v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>425 Md. 629, 637, 42 A.3d 596, 601 (2012) (citations omitted). \u201cWe must respect the expertise of the agency and accord deference to its interpretation of a statute that it administers[;] however, we may always determine whether the administrative agency made an error of law.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety and Corr. Servs., </em>377 Md. 34, 46, 831 A.2d 1079, 1086 (2003) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Commission\u2019s decision \u201cis presumed to be prima facie correct[.]\u201d LE \u00a7 9-745(b)(l). That \u201cpresumption[, however,] does not extend to questions of law, which we review independently.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Mayor and City Council of Balt., </em>430 Md. 368, 376, 61 A.3d 33, 37 (2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe do, though, afford the Commission a degree of deference, as appropriate, in its formal interpretations of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Deibler, </em>423 Md. 54, 60, 31 A.3d 191, 194 (2011) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We have explained that \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s interpretation of a regulation is a conclusion of law[,]\u201d and that \u201ca great deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>of deference is owed to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation.\u201d <em>Crofton Convalescent Ctr., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, Nursing Home Appeal Bd., </em>413 Md. 201, 215, 991 A.2d 1257, 1265 (2010) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, \u201c[d]espite the deference, it is always within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. Accordingly, we determine whether the [agencyj\u2019s conclusions are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 991 A.2d at 1265 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). When we construe an agency\u2019s rule or regulation, \u201cthe principles governing our interpretation of a statute apply[.]\u201d <em>Christopher v. Montgomery Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>381 Md. 188, 209, 849 A.2d 46, 58 (2004) (citations omitted). Thus, we look to the regulation\u2019s \u201cplain language [as] the best evidence of its own meaning[,]\u201d and \u201c[w]hen the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 849 A.2d at 58 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201cif a covered employee fails to file a claim within [two] years after the date of the accidental personal injury, the claim is completely barred.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-709(b)(3). The two-year limitations period does not begin to run, however, if the employer does not fulfill its responsibility to \u201creport [an employee\u2019s] accidental personal injury[, where the accidental injury causes the employee to suffer disability for more than three days,] to the Commission within [ten] days after receiving oral or written notice of the disability[.]\u201d LE \u00a7 9-707(a). Indeed, if the employer does not report the employee\u2019s accidental personal injury to the Commission within ten days, \u201cthe claim limitation period in [LE] \u00a7 9-709(b)(3) ... does not begin to run until the employer files a report with the Commission in accordance with [LE] \u00a7 9-707[.]\u201d LE \u00a7 9-708(b). Thus, where the employer files a report with the Commission within ten days after receiving notice of an employee\u2019s disability, the limitations period begins to run as of the date of the accidental personal injury. However, where the employer files a report with the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>sion later than ten days after receiving notice of an employee\u2019s disability, LE \u00a7 9-708(b) serves to toll the limitations period such that it does not begin to run until the date the employer\u2019s report is filed with the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Under LE \u00a7 9-309(a), the Commission has the authority to \u201cadopt regulations to carry out\u201d the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. To that end, the Commission has promulgated certain regulations in Title 14, Subtitle 9 of COMAR. COMAR 14.09.02.02, contained in a chapter entitled \u201cRequirements for Filing and Amending Claims,\u201d provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APv\">A. Claim for Benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">(1) To initiate a claim for benefits, an employee shall file a claim form with the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">(4) The employee shall sign the claim form certifying that the information submitted on the claim form is accurate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">(5) When completing the claim form, the claimant shall sign an authorization for disclosure of health information directing the claimant\u2019s health care providers to disclose ... the claimant\u2019s medical records that are relevant[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">(7) The Commission shall reject and return to the claimant a claim form that does not contain a signed authorization for disclosure of health information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">(8) Date of Filing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">(a) A claim is considered filed on the date that a completed and signed claim form, including the signed authorization for disclosure of health information, is received by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">(b) For any claim form that has not been rejected or returned as incomplete ..., the Commission\u2019s date of receipt is determined by the date stamp affixed on the claim form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">(9) Electronic Submission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">(a) A claim that is submitted electronically is not considered filed until the signed claim form, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the signed authorization for disclosure of health information, is received by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">(b) The Commission\u2019s date of receipt is determined by the date stamp affixed on the claim form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Other regulations contained in the \u201cGeneral Administrative\u201d chapter of Subtitle 9 of Title 14 of COMAR discuss the Commission\u2019s electronic system and electronic submissions. COMAR 14.09.01.01B(21) defines \u201c Web-Enabled File Management System\u2019 or \u2018WFMS\u2019 [as] the Commission\u2019s subscriber-based web-enabled electronic file management system designed to facilitate the filing and adjudication of workers\u2019 compensation claims.\u201d And COMAR 14.09.01.04A provides that \u201c[fjorms and documents may be filed with the Commission by one of the following methods: (1) Electronically through the WFMS; (2) In person; or (3) By mail addressed to the Commission\u2019s principal office in Baltimore City.\u201d (Paragraph breaks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Upon review of the applicable COMAR regulations, even after giving deference to the Commission\u2019s interpretation of them, we hold that, pursuant to COMAR 14.09.02.02A, a claim is filed with the Commission when the claim is filed on paper with and date-stamped by the Commission. In other words, pursuant to COMAR 14.09.02.02A, electronic submission of a claim does not constitute \u201cfiling\u201d of a claim. COMAR 14.09.01.04A is a general regulation that does not govern the filing of claim forms; the more specific provisions of COMAR 14.09.02.02A apply to the filing of claim forms. Hranicka\u2019s claim is time-barred under LE \u00a7 9-709(b)(3) because it was not filed on paper with and date-stamped by the Commission until after expiration of the two-year deadline. As such, the Commission erred in ruling that the date of a claim could relate back, for purposes of the statute of limitations, to the date of the claim\u2019s electronic submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">It is clear that, under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and COMAR, an employee must \u201cfile\u201d a claim, and not simply \u201csubmit\u201d a claim through the WFMS, to seek benefits for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>accidental personal injury. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-709(b)(3) (\u201c[I]f a covered employee fails to file a claim within [two] years after the date of the accidental personal injury, the claim is completely barred.\u201d (Emphasis added)); COMAR 14.09.02.02A(1) (\u201cTo initiate a claim for benefits, an employee shall file a claim form with the Commission.\u201d (Emphasis added)). CO-MAR 14.09.02.02A provides that an electronically submitted claim for benefits is not filed until the signed claim form is received and date-stamped by the Commission; <em>i.e., </em>the date of the electronic submission is not dispositive. <em>See </em>COMAR 14.09.02.02A(8)(a)-(b) (\u201cA claim is considered filed on the date that a completed and signed claim form ... is received by the Commission.... [T]he Commission\u2019s date of receipt is determined by the date stamp affixed on the claim form.\u201d); CO-MAR 14.09.02.02A(9)(a)-(b) (\u201cA claim that is submitted electronically is not considered filed until the signed claim form ... is received by the Commission. [ ] The Commission\u2019s date of receipt is determined by the date stamp affixed on the claim form.\u201d). Plainly put, COMAR 14.09.02.02A\u2019s language makes clear that a claim form must be filed on paper with and date-stamped by the Commission, and not simply electronically submitted, to constitute filing a claim for benefits. Nothing in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or COMAR permits the Commission to \u201crelate back\u201d the date of a claim to its electronic submission date. The Commission erred in utilizing the date that Hranicka electronically submitted his claim form \u201cfor limitation purposes\u201d instead of the date that the Commission date-stamped the paper claim form; the Commission\u2019s determination was plainly erroneous and inconsistent with COMAR 14.09.02.02A.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">It is inconsequential that COMAR 14.09.01.04A provides that \u201c[florins and documents may be filed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Commission by one of the following methods: (1) Electronically through the WFMS[.]\u201d That regulation concerns \u201cgeneral administrative\u201d workings of the Commission and is not specific to the filing of claim forms.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, it is clear from the structure of the regulations that the filing of claims is governed by COMAR 14.09.02.02, which expressly provides that \u201c[a] claim that is submitted electronically is not considered filed until the signed claim form, including the signed authorization for disclosure of health information, is received by the Commission.\u201d COMAR 14.09.02.02A(9)(a) (emphasis added). In any event, the canons of statutory interpretation \u2014 applicable to interpretation of regulations, <em>see Christopher, </em>381 Md. at 209, 849 A.2d at 58 (\u201c[T]he principles governing our interpretation of a statute apply when we interpret an agency rule or regulation.\u201d (Citations omitted)) \u2014 provide that where \u201ctwo statutes, one general and one specific, are found to conflict, the specific statute will be regarded as an exception to the general statute!,]\u201d and \u201c[i]n such a situation, the specific statute is controlling and the general statute is repealed to the extent of the inconsistency.\u201d <em>State v. Ghajari, </em>346 Md. 101, 116, 695 A.2d 143, 150 (1997) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, to the extent that COMAR 14.09.02.02A(9) conflicts with COMAR 14.09.01.04A(1), the more specific statute \u2014 COMAR 14.09.02.02A(9) \u2014 controls and must be given effect with respect to the filing of claim forms. Because COMAR 14.09.02.02A(9) (\u201cA claim that is submitted electronically is not considered filed until the signed claim form, including the signed authorization for disclosure of health information, is received by the Commission.\u201d (Emphasis added).) is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>regulation\u2019s meaning ends there, and we need not address the regulation\u2019s history. <em>See Christopher, </em>381 Md. at 209, 849 A.2d at 58 (We look to a regulation\u2019s \u201cplain language [as] the best evidence of its own meaning[,]\u201d and \u201c[w]hen the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">We reject Hranicka\u2019s contention that the Commission\u2019s website provided instructions from which a claimant would have believed his or her claim had been filed once the claimant electronically submitted the claim form and sent a signed claim form within ten days. In January 2012, the Commission\u2019s website made clear that, to file a claim with the Commission, the electronically submitted claim form needed to be printed, signed, and mailed to the Commission; in other words, at the time of Hranicka\u2019s electronic submission, the Commission\u2019s website unmistakably instructed employees that electronically submitting the claim form was insufficient to file the claim form with the Commission. Specifically, on the page concerning the filing of a C-l Claim Form, as of January 5, 2012, the Commission\u2019s website provided, in pertinent part, the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>[] This is the current Employee Claim Form that is required to submit your claim to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">[ ] The Online Employee Claim Form C-l MUST be completed online \u2014 on your PC \u2014 using Formatta Filler.

In our view, the instructions on the Commission\u2019s website, as they existed at the time Hranicka submitted his claim form electronically on January 17, 2012, are consistent with, and reinforce, the regulatory language that provides that electronically submitting a claim form does not constitute filing of the claim itself.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In addition to the unambiguous language of COMAR and the Commission\u2019s website\u2019s instructions indicating that a claim form must be filed and not simply electronically submitted, COMAR 14.09.02.02A(4) and (5) require that the employee both \u201csign the claim form\u201d and \u201csign an authorization for disclosure of health information!/]\u201d Indeed, under COMAR 14.09.02.02A(7), \u201c[t]he Commission shall reject and return to the claimant a claim form that does not contain a signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>authorization for disclosure of health information.\u201d The same instructions were provided on the website in January 2012. <em>See </em>\u201cEmployee Claim Form C-l Online \u2014 MD WCC WebForm Instructions,\u201d (Jan. 5, 2012), <em>available at </em>https://web.archive. org/web/20120105021510/http://www.wcc.state.md.us/WFMS/C l_WebForms.html (\u201cThe completed/submitted form must be printed ..., must be signed where indicated on page 1 and page 2 by the injured worker and must be mailed to the Commission in a timely manner (within 10 business days) to file your claim.... All claim forms submitted to the Commission MUST be signed personally by the injured worker ... [and] mailed as soon as possible.... An incomplete claim form that does not include the signed Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information ... will be rejected and returned to the claimant.\u201d). In other words, electronically submitting the claim form is not tantamount to \u201csigning\u201d the claim form or \u201csigning\u201d the authorization for disclosure of health information form \u2014 two requirements for filing a claim \u2014 and the online form does not provide for electronic signatures, but instead requires the claimant to print the completed/submitted claim form and sign; <em>i.e., </em>an original signature is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We are unpersuaded by Hranieka\u2019s reference to the existence of the Maryland Electronic Courts (\u201cMDEC\u201d) Project and similar electronic court case filing systems in other jurisdictions, for the proposition that workers\u2019 compensation claim forms may be filed electronically. MDEC was implemented after extensive study and substantial amendments to the Maryland Rules. Although this Court certainly endorses and supports the advent of electronic filing in Maryland courts, the Commission has not promulgated regulations implementing or governing a procedure for the electronic filing of workers\u2019 compensation claims. Absent such regulations, this Court is unable to determine that submission of a claim through the WFMS is the equivalent of electronic filing of a claim, and that the date of an electronic filing may be used for purposes of the statute of limitations. As a practical matter, without implementing regulations, it is unclear how the Commission would handle the required filing of authorization for disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>health information forms using an electronic filing system; as discussed above, these forms are required for filing a claim with the Commission. <em>See </em>COMAR 14.09.02.02A(5), (7). As another matter, it is unclear whether the Commission would permit scanned signatures or would create an electronic signature process for the filing of claims, which currently must be signed by the injured employee and then sent to the Commission. <em>See </em>COMAR 14.09.02.02A(4). In short, absent regulations governing the electronic filing of claims, this Court will not read into the existing regulations procedures for electronic filing of workers\u2019 compensation claims. To be clear, nothing in this opinion precludes the Commission from promulgating new regulations to permit electronic filing of claims, nor are we expressing a preference that workers\u2019 compensation claims necessarily be filed in paper form. We simply hold that, currently, under COMAR, electronic submission of claim forms does not constitute filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Here, it is undisputed that Hranicka was injured in a motor vehicle accident on January 6, 2010, that he suffered a disability lasting longer than three days, and that the Employer was made aware of the injury and subsequently submitted to the Commission a \u201cFirst Report of Injury or Illness,\u201d which the Commission received on January 21, 2010. In other words, because the Employer\u2019s report was not submitted within ten days after receiving notice of Hranicka\u2019s disability, pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-708(b), the statute of limitations on Hranicka\u2019s claim was tolled until January 21, 2010, at which point the two-year clock began to run. Thus, pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-709(b)(3), Hranicka had two years from the date on which the Commission received the Employer\u2019s \u201cFirst Report of Injury or Illness,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>until January 21, 2012, to \u201cfile a claim\u201d with the Commission. The question thus becomes whether Hranicka\u2019s second C-l Claim Form, electronically submitted on January 17, 2012, but not filed on paper with and date-stamped by the Commission until January 24, 2012, was filed for purposes of the statute of limitations on January 17, 2012, thereby making it timely filed, or was filed on January 24, 2012, thereby making it untimely filed and barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In agreement with the Court of Special Appeals, we conclude that the clear language of COMAR 14.09.02.02A and the Commission\u2019s website\u2019s instructions provided at the time of Hranicka\u2019s electronic submission of the second claim \u2014 and continue to provide \u2014 that electronic submission of a claim form does not satisfy the requirement for \u201cfiling\u201d a claim, and, therefore, the date of electronic submission is not controlling in determining whether a claim was filed within the two-year limitations period. Thus, the Commission plainly erred in ruling that the filing date of Hranicka\u2019s claim related back, for purposes of the statute of limitations, to the date of the claim\u2019s electronic submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. PETITIONER TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">BARBERA, C.J., GREENE and McDONALD, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\">. COMAR 14.09.02.02 was previously codified as COMAR 14.09.01.06 before being renumbered without substantive change. To avoid confusion, we refer to the regulation\u2019s current version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">. In a concurring opinion, although agreeing that Hranicka\u2019s claim was time-barred and that the Commission\u2019s practice of treating electronic submission as filing for purposes of the statute of limitations was contrary to law, one judge disagreed with the majority's statement that the Commission\u2019s website makes clear the distinction between electronic submission of a claim and filing a claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\">. The Maryland Association for Justice filed an <em>amicus </em>brief in support of Hranicka.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">. The Maryland Defense Counsel, Inc. filed an <em>amicus </em>brief in support of Respondents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\">. As to whether the Commission regularly relates back, for purposes of the statute of limitations, the date a claim is filed on paper and date-stamped to the date the claim is electronically submitted, we have only Commissioner Miraglia\u2019s view on this point. Nothing in the record other than Commissioner Miraglia\u2019s ruling here indicates that such a practice does, in actuality, exist; and, in any event, such a practice would be contraiy to the Commission's own regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b348-5\">. Indeed, as Respondents\u2019 counsel posited at oral argument, with the exception of claim forms and accompanying authorization for disclosure of health information forms, there are any number of other types of forms that can be electronically filed through the WFMS and thus fall within the purview of COMAR 14.09.01.04A. For example, according to Respondents\u2019 counsel, parties are permitted to electronically file, without an original signature, document corrections, issues, requests for rehearing, requests for modification, entries of appearance of counsel, and requests to strike appearance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\">. Indeed, for purposes of statutory interpretation, it is only \"[i]f, after considering the plain language in its ordinary and common sense meaning, two or more equally plausible interpretations arise, [] then the general purpose, legislative history, and language of the act as a whole is examined in an effort to clarify the ambiguity.\u201d <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Danner, </em>388 Md. 649, 659, 882 A.2d 271, 277 (2005) (citation omitted). Thus, in the absence of any ambiguity in the relevant statutes and regulations, we also need not address the remedial nature of the Workers' Compensation Act or construe the statutes and regulations liberally in Hranicka's favor. Hranicka\u2019s counsel acknowledged as much at oral argument, stating that the remedial nature of the Workers' Compensation Act is not relevant unless there is an ambiguity and, if there is no ambiguity, then the statute or regulation is strictly read and \"is what it says it is.\u201d <em>Cf. Buskirk v. C.J. Langenfelder &amp; Son, Inc., </em>136 Md.App. 261, 270, 764 A.2d 857, 862 (2001) (When discussing the limitations provision of LE \u00a7 9-736, the Court of Special Appeals stated: \"Ordinarily, remedial legislation is construed liberally in favor of injured employees in order to effectuate the legislation\u2019s remedial purpose. This general rule of construction does not apply to limitations provisions[.]\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\">.

That is easier said than done, as this case illustrates.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The Commission has adopted an electronic filing system. In regulation it portrays that system as one of three alternative ways of filing forms and documents with the Commission. COMAR 14.09.01.04.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Only a very careful reading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Commission\u2019s other regulations and website reveals that (1) a claimant in fact has no choice but <em>must </em>use the electronic filing system to submit a claim form and (2) that submission of a claim form on that system is not the <em>filing </em>of a claim. In other words, a claimant must submit the claim <em>both </em>electronically and in hard copy to \u201cfile\u201d it before the expiration of the two-year period of limitations set forth in LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 709(b)(3). In this case, Mr. Hranicka submitted the electronic copy in a timely manner, but the hard copy was received at the Commission one day late.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">It is also confusing that, while a regulation defines the date for a claim to be the \u201cdate stamp affixed on the claim form,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Commission actually \u201caffixes\u201d two different dates to the form \u2014 one placed in a special box on the bottom of the form as part of the electronic filing process, and a second date, apparently placed on the hard copy when it is physically received at the Commission. The electronically-affixed date apparently is not the \u201cfiling date,\u201d although it is the date that the Commission\u2019s website insists must appear on the filed copy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>This leads me to second the sentiment expressed by Judge Kehoe in his concurring opinion in the unreported decision of Court of Special Appeals in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">In today\u2019s world, and identifying just a few of the myriad of transactions that routinely take place over the Internet, millions of individuals purchase health and motor vehicle insurance, make banking transactions, buy goods and services, apply to colleges, and file tax returns by doing essentially what Mr. Hranicka did in this case \u2014 filling out a form on an Internet webpage and then clicking a \u201csubmit\u201d or \u201csend\u201d icon. I am not at all surprised that Mr. Hranicka failed to grasp that submitting a claim form to the Commission is not the same thing as filing a claim with the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">I understand that the Commission, for reasons of its own, prefers claim forms to be submitted both electronically and on paper. I concede that a thorough reading of the webpage will eventually lead to the realization \u2014 counterintuitive to many individuals in this era of Internet commerce \u2014 that \u201csubmitting a claim form\u201d is different from \u201cfiling a claim\u201d and that, until a signed paper copy of the claim form is received by the Commission, no claim is filed. But I am at a loss to understand why the Commission has chosen to bury this critical information in the fine print on its website.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amp\"><em>Chesapeake Surgical, Ltd,., et al. v. Hranicka, </em>No. 0327 (Sept. Term, 2013) (concurring Opinion by Kehoe, J.), at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">It appears that, subsequent to the Court of Special Appeals decision and perhaps in light of it, the Commission revised its website to make the instructions concerning the filing of a hard copy of the electronic submission more prominent.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">At the hearing before the Commission in this case, Commissioner Miraglia outlined a very sensible approach under which the date of electronic submission of a claim is considered to be the filing date unless the claimant fails to follow through with the claimant\u2019s signed form and authorization for disclosure of health information. This approach is similar to the treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>of electronic submissions under this Court\u2019s rules for electronic filing in the courts. <em>See </em>Maryland Rules 20-202, 20-406. Moreover, identifying the submission of the electronic claim form as the key date for limitations purposes would also be consistent with the longstanding statutory policy that the Workers Compensation Law is to be \u201cconstrued as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> particularly in a case such as this one where the employer concedes that Mr. Hranicka suffered a work-related injury and the insurer concedes that it was not prejudiced by the fact that the signed hard copy arrived at the Commission one day late. While the practice espoused by the Commissioner in this case is in accord with other electronic filing systems and serves the underlying policy of the Workers Compensation Act, the language of the Commission\u2019s regulation that requires a paper submission to \u201cfile\u201d a claim is an impediment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Nothing prevents the Commission from revising its regulations to adopt the approach expressed by Commissioner Miraglia. Indeed, it might well help the Commission carry out the General Assembly\u2019s direction to adopt procedures \u201cas simple and brief as reasonably possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Chief Judge BARBERA and Judge GREENE have authorized me to state they join in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-11\">.
