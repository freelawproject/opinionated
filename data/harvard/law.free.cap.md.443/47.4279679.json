Mount Vernon Realty Grp., LLC, </em>429 Md. 53, 77, 54 A.3d 742, 756 (2012) (citations omitted). In <em>Allied Inv. Corp. v. Jasen, </em>354 Md. 547, 562, 731 A.2d 957, 965 (1999), this Court unanimously held that a defendant does not convert a plaintiffs intangible property where the defendant does not convert a document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property; in other words, under <em>Jasen, id. </em>at 562, 731 A.2d at 965, one element of conversion of a plaintiffs intangible property is conversion of a document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>In this case, we decide: (I) whether to overrule <em>Jasen, id. </em>at 562, 731 A.2d at 965, and hold that a defendant can convert a plaintiffs intangible property even where the defendant does not convert a document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property; and (II) whether, here, the plaintiffs established a claim for constructive fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">(I) We reaffirm <em>Jasen, id. </em>at 562, 731 A.2d at 965, and again hold that a defendant does not convert a plaintiffs intangible property where the defendant does not convert a document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property; and (II) we hold that, here, the plaintiffs failed to establish a claim for constructive fraud, as the plaintiffs failed to establish that the parties were in a confidential relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d), Nancy Lee Kathryn Thompson (\u201cKathy\u201d), Barbara Ann Clements (together, \u201cPetitioners\u201d), and Karen Lee Kirlin (\u201cKaren\u201d), \u201cfor the benefit of\u2019 Susan Witherspoon (\u201cSusan\u201d), Carol La-reuse (\u201cCarol\u201d), and the Estate of Albert E. Thompson, III (\u201cAlbert\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sued Susan\u2019s husband, Gordon H. Witherspoon (\u201cWitherspoon\u201d), Respondent; The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company; John Hancock Life Insurance Company USA; and UBS Financial Services, Inc., UBS Financial Services Insurance Agency, Inc., and UBS Insurance Agency, Inc. (together, \u201cUBS\u201d) for multiple causes of action, including conversion and constructive fraud as to Witherspoon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Gradually, the number of parties dwindled. No lawyer entered an appearance on behalf of Albert\u2019s estate. Susan filed a motion to strike herself and Carol as parties, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>circuit court granted. Petitioners and Karen filed a stipulation of dismissal of their claims against The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and John Hancock Life Insurance Company USA. Karen filed a stipulation of dismissal of her claims against Witherspoon and UBS. Thus, by the time of trial, Petitioners, Witherspoon, and UBS were the only parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">At trial, the circuit court admitted evidence of the following facts, which we summarize. Albert E. Thompson, Jr. and Nancy Schenuit Thompson (together, \u201cthe Thompson Parents\u201d) were the parents of Petitioners, Karen, Susan, Carol, and Albert (together, \u201cthe Thompson Children\u201d). The Thompson Children purchased a life insurance policy as to which they were the owners and beneficiaries, the Thompson Parents were the insureds, and Witherspoon was the broker. The Thompson Children signed the application for the life insurance policy, which listed Witherspoon\u2019s address under \u201cSend Premium Notices To:\u201d; from 1990 through 1998, the life insurance company mailed all policy-related documents to Witherspoon\u2019s address.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Each year from 1990 through 1995, the Thompson Parents paid each of the Thompson Children the amount of his or her share ($17,500) of the annual life insurance premium ($105,-000.01). Because Kathy disliked Witherspoon, the Thompson Parents paid Kathy\u2019s share directly to her, and Kathy transferred her share directly to the life insurance company. The Thompson Parents deposited the shares of the rest of the Thompson Children into their respective accounts with UBS, where Witherspoon worked as a financial advisor from 1995 through 2005; the shares were then automatically transferred to the life insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Each year from 1996 through 2003 (except for 1997), the Thompson Parents did not pay each of the Thompson Children the amount of his or her share of the annual life insurance premium. Thus, in each of those seven years, the life insurance company automatically issued a loan to the Thompson Children from the life insurance policy\u2019s cash value to cover the amount of the unpaid annual life insurance premium. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>loans\u2019 principal totaled $735,000.07, and the interest on the loans totaled $165,457.12 as of October 2007; thus, in all, the life insurance company deducted $900,457.19 from the life insurance policy\u2019s cash value. The Thompson Children never consented to the loans, which could have been avoided by paying the annual life insurance premium, surrendering the life insurance policy for its cash value less any policy debt, or continuing the life insurance policy as \u201cpaid-up\u201d life insurance, for which the premium would have been the life insurance policy\u2019s cash value less any policy debt. The life insurance company mailed to Witherspoon policy statements and policy notices that mentioned the loans. Witherspoon knew about the loans, but never told Petitioners about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Around the years in which the Thompson Parents did not pay each of the Thompson Children the amount of his or her share of the annual life insurance premium, the Thompson Parents provided Witherspoon and Susan (together, \u201cthe Witherspoons\u201d) with various gifts and loans. In 1995, the Thompson Parents began paying approximately $18,000 each year for the school tuition of one of the Witherspoons\u2019 children. In 1995, the Thompson Parents loaned the Wither-spoons $89,000. Each year from approximately 1995 through 2003, the Thompson Parents gifted $20,000 to the Wither-spoons. Sometime after 1995, the Thompson Parents began paying approximately $18,000 each year for the school tuition of another one of the Witherspoons\u2019 children. In 2004, the Thompson parents loaned the Witherspoons $585,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">At the conclusion of the trial, a jury found Witherspoon liable for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, deceit, conversion, and constructive fraud, and found UBS liable for negligent supervision. Witherspoon and UBS separately moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; Wither-spoon contended that Petitioners failed to establish a claim for conversion or constructive fraud. The circuit court denied the motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Wither-spoon and UBS appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that Petitioners failed to establish claims for conversion and constructive fraud, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>that the trial court made other errors that necessitated a new trial as to the claims other than conversion and constructive fraud. <em>See UBS Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Thompson, </em>217 Md.App. 500, 536, 507, 94 A.3d 176, 197, 180 (2014). Petitioners filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which this Court granted only as to the issues regarding conversion and constructive fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Thompson v. UBS Fin. Servs., </em>440 Md. 225,101 A.3d 1063 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Later, Petitioners filed in this Court a notice of dismissal of their claims against UBS; thus, Witherspoon is now the only Respondent. Nonetheless, because this case was docketed in this Court under the name <em>Thompson v. UBS Fin. Servs., </em>this case will retain that name for this opinion\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Petitioners contend that the circuit court was correct in denying Witherspoon\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to conversion, as Petitioners established a claim against Witherspoon for conversion of the life insurance policy. Specifically, Petitioners argue that Witherspoon converted the life insurance policy by interfering with Petitioners\u2019 right to the life insurance policy, even if Witherspoon did not convert a document that embodied Petitioners\u2019 right to the life insurance policy. More broadly, Petitioners assert that a defendant converts a plaintiffs intangible property by interfering with the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property, even if the defendant does not convert a document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property. Accordingly, Petitioners urge us to overrule <em>Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 562, 731 A.2d at 965, in which this Court expressly declined to adopt Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242(2) (1965) (\u201cOne who effectively prevents the exercise of intangible [property] rights of the kind customarily merged in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>document is subject to a liability similar to that for conversion, even though the document is not itself converted.\u201d). Petitioners assert that <em>Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 562, 731 A.2d at 965, is archaic in light of the modern increase in digital media (as opposed to paper documents).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Witherspoon responds that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to conversion, as Petitioners failed to establish a claim against him for conversion of the life insurance policy. Specifically, Witherspoon contends that, because he did not convert a document that embodied Petitioners\u2019 right to the life insurance policy, he did not convert the life insurance policy. More broadly, Witherspoon argues that a defendant does not convert a plaintiffs intangible property where the defendant does not convert a document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property. Witherspoon asserts that <em>Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 562, 731 A.2d at 965, is not archaic because, for conversion\u2019s purposes, the document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property can be either paper or digital.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, \u201cwhile viewing the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party[.]\u201d <em>Scapa Dryer Fabrics, Inc. v. Saville, </em>418 Md. 496, 503, 16 A.3d 159, 163 (2011) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Conversion evolved from trover, which occurred where a defendant, a \u201cfinder of lost goods[,] ... refused to return them\u201d to the plaintiff, the owner of the goods. <em>Lawson v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co., </em>69 Md.App. 476, 480, 518 A.2d 174, 175-76 (1986). Originally, because a plaintiffs intangible property could not be lost or found, a defendant could convert only a plaintiffs tangible personal property, <em>see id. </em>at 480, 518 A.2d at 176; now, however, a defendant can convert a plaintiffs intangible property under certain circumstances. <em>See Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 560, 731 A.2d at 963 (\u201c[Cjertain intangible property interests may now be recovered through a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>conversion claim.\u201d). Specifically, a defendant converts a plaintiffs intangible property where the defendant converts a document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property. <em>See id. </em>at 562, 731 A.2d at 965 (\u201c[Conversion generally may extend to the type of intangible property rights that are merged or incorporated into a transferable document.\u201d). For example, such a document could be a stock certificate, <em>see id. </em>at 563, 731 A.2d at 965, a promissory note, <em>see Thomson v. Gortner, </em>73 Md. 474, 478, 21 A. 371, 372 (1891), or a document that embodies the right to a life insurance policy, <em>see Durst v. Durst, </em>225 Md. 175, 180, 169 A.2d 755, 757 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In <em>Jasen, </em>this Court held that a defendant does not convert a plaintiffs intangible property where: (1) no document embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property; or (2) a document embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property, but the defendant does not convert the document. <em>See </em>354 Md. at 562, 731 A.2d at 965 (\u201cWe refuse ... to extend [conversion] to cover completely intangible [property] rightsf,] or[,] as [Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242(2) ] contemplates, ... situations in which the relevant document itself has not been transferred.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This Court pointed out that, as Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242\u2019s authors acknowledged, removing conversion of a document as an element of conversion of intangible property would \u201cnot accord very well with the traditional common law limitations of conversion^]\u201d <em>Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 561, 731 A.2d at 964 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242 cmt. e).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Because Petitioners urge us to overrule <em>Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 562, 731 A.2d at 965, this case implicates <em>stare decisis. </em>Under <em>stare decisis, </em>absent \u201cextremely narrow\u201d exceptions, an appellate court does not overrule its precedent. <em>DRD Pool </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Serv., Inc. v. Freed, </em>416 Md. 46, 63, 5 A.3d 45, 55 (2010) (citation omitted). <em>Stare decisis </em>\u201cpromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 5 A.3d at 55 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). An appellate court need not adhere to <em>stare decisis </em>where \u201cchanged conditions or increased knowledge\u201d have rendered the appellate court\u2019s precedent \u201cunsound in the circumstances of modern life, a vestige of the past, [and] no longer suitable to [the] people[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 5 A.3d at 56 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also State v. Stachowski, </em>440 Md. 504, 520, 103 A.3d 618, 627 (2014) (\u201cWe may decline to follow <em>[stare decisis </em>] when ... the precedent has been rendered archaic and inapplicable to modern society through the passage of time and evolving events[.]\u201d (Citation omitted)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Here, we reaffirm <em>Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 562, 731 A.2d at 965, and again hold that a defendant does not convert a plaintiffs intangible property where the defendant does not convert a document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property; far from archaic, <em>Jasen </em>remains as suitable to society today as it was when this Court issued it. Petitioners\u2019 attack on <em>Jasen </em>is based on the false premise that, for conversion\u2019s purposes, the document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property must be paper (as opposed to digital). To the contrary, such a document need not be paper, as long as it is tangible and transferable; in <em>Jasen, id. </em>at 562, 563, 564, 731 A.2d at 965, 966, without ever using the word \u201cpaper,\u201d this Court characterized such a document as \u201ctangible\u201d in three instances, and as \u201ctransferable\u201d in another. Digital media is both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>tangible (ie., capable of being seen on an electronic device\u2019s screen) and transferable <em>(ie., </em>subject to an exertion of ownership or dominion). <em>See, e.g., Thyroff v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>8 N.Y.3d 283, 832 N.Y.S.2d 873, 864 N.E.2d 1272, 1278 (2007) (\u201c[I]t is customary that stock ownership exclusively exists in electronic format. Because shares of stock can be transferred by mere computer entries, a thief can use a computer to access a person\u2019s financial accounts and transfer the shares to an account controlled by the thief. Similarly, electronic documents and records stored on a computer can also be converted by simply pressing the delete button[.]\u201d (Citation omitted)). Thus, as the Honorable Glenn T. Harrell, Jr. concluded in <em>Medi-Cen Corp. of Md. v. Birschbach, </em>123 Md.App. 765, 777 n. 6, 720 A.2d 966, 972 n. 6 (1998), for conversion\u2019s purposes, there is \u201cno distinction between hard copy and electronic data[,]\u201d as long as a document, either paper or digital, embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">In sum, because digital media is capable of being converted, there is no need for us to \u201cmodernize\u201d conversion by adopting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242(2) (\u201cOne who effectively prevents the exercise of intangible [property] rights of the kind customarily merged in a document is subject to a liability similar to that for conversion, even though the document is not itself converted.\u201d). Several other considerations militate against adopting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 <em>242(2) </em>\u2014 ie., removing conversion of a document as an element of conversion of intangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">First, to remove conversion of a document as an element of conversion of intangible property would destroy conversion\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>common law foundation. Ever since its inception, conversion has been based on a defendant taking a plaintiffs personal property. <em>See Nickens, </em>429 Md. at 77, 54 A.3d at 756 (A \u201c[cjonversion is [a defendant\u2019s] intentional ... exertion of ownership or dominion over [a plaintiffl\u2019s personal property in denial of or inconsistent with the [plaintiffl\u2019s right to [the plaintiffs personal] property.\u201d (Citations omitted)). Even as conversion expanded to apply to a plaintiffs intangible property (such as shares of stock), conversion has remained based on a defendant taking a plaintiffs personal property \u2014 in the form of a document (such as a stock certificate) that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property. <em>See Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 562, 731 A.2d at 965 (\u201c[C]onversion generally may extend to the type of intangible property rights that are merged or incorporated into a transferable document.\u201d). To no longer require a defendant\u2019s taking of a plaintiffs personal property would distort conversion into an entirely different tort. <em>See id. </em>at 561, 731 A.2d at 964 (Removing conversion of a document as an element of conversion of intangible property would \u201cnot accord very well with the traditional common law limitations of conversion^]\u201d (Quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242 cmt. e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Second, to remove conversion of a document as an element of conversion of intangible property would expand conversion so much that it could essentially swallow other torts, such as unfair competition and wrongful interference with contractual or business relations, also known as tortious interference with contract or with economic relations. <em>See Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 562, 731 A.2d at 964 (Instead of expanding conversion, \u201cit would seem preferable to fashion other remedies, such as unfair competition, to protect people from having intangible [property] values used and appropriated in unfair ways.\u201d (Citation omitted)); <em>Elecs. Store, Inc. v. Cellco P\u2019ship, </em>127 Md.App. 385, 407, 732 A.2d 980, 991 (1999) (Unfair competition is \u201cdamaging or jeopardizing another\u2019s business by fraud, deceit, trickery or unfair methods of any sort.\u201d (Quoting <em>Balt. Bedding Corp. v. Moses, </em>182 Md. 229, 237, 34 A.2d 338, 342 (1943)) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Kaser v. Fin. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Prot. Mktg., Inc., </em>376 Md. 621, 628-29, 831 A.2d 49, 53 (2003) (Wrongful interference with contractual or business relations is comprised of: \u201c(1) intentional and wilful acts; (2) calculated to cause damage to the plaintiffs in their lawful business; (3) done with the unlawful purpose to cause such damage and loss, without right or justifiable cause on the part of the defendants (which constitutes malice); and (4) actual damage and loss resulting.\u201d (Citation, footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Without conversion of a document as one of its elements, conversion of intangible property would essentially be any kind of interference by a defendant with a plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property, and would thus overlap with almost any unfair competition or wrongful interference with contractual or business relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Third, to remove conversion of a document as an element of conversion of intangible property could lead to expanding and distorting conversion one small step further \u2014 by removing as an element of conversion of intangible property the existence of a document that embodies a plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property. In other words, a defendant would be able to convert a plaintiffs intangible property even where no document embodied the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property (for example, as in the case of a business\u2019s goodwill). Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242\u2019s authors indicated that removing conversion of a document as an element of conversion of intangible property could lead to removing a document\u2019s existence as an element of conversion of intangible property. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242 cmt. f (\u201cThus far the liability stated in Subsection (2) has not been extended beyond the kind of intangible [property] rights which are customarily represented by and merged in a document. It is at present the prevailing view that there can be no conversion of an ordinary debt not represented by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>document, or of such intangible [property] rights as the goodwill of a business or the names of customers. The process of extension [of conversion] has not, however, necessarily terminated; and nothing that is said in this Section is intended to indicate that in a proper case liability for intentional interference with some other kind of intangible [property] rights may not be found.\u201d). Such an expansion of conversion would cause confounding problems of proof for both parties; plaintiffs would have difficulty articulating how defendants \u201ctook\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 intangible property where there was no document to be taken, and defendants would have difficulty defending, given that the absence of any document would no longer be a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Finally, as Petitioners\u2019 counsel candidly conceded at oral argument,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> no other jurisdiction has expressly adopted Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242(2). In their original brief, Petitioners misplaced their reliance on out-of-State cases that do not weigh in favor of adopting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Specifically, Petitioners relied on four unreported opinions in which courts in other jurisdictions favorably cited Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242(2). <em>See Hunt v. Team Performance, Inc., </em>No. CV08-69-S-EJL, 2009 WL 2044682, at *6 n. 11 (D.Idaho July 8, 2009); <em>Sports Imaging of Ariz.

Unreported opinions do not constitute law, even in the jurisdictions whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>courts issued them; thus, Petitioners\u2019 reliance on the above cases is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Petitioners also relied on two out-of-State cases in which courts stated (just as this Court has held, and now holds again) that a defendant can convert a plaintiffs intangible property under certain circumstances. <em>Compare Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 562, 731 A.2d at 965 (\u201c[Conversion generally may extend to the type of intangible property rights that are merged or incorporated into a transferable document.\u201d) <em>with M.C.

Bowles Rice McDavid Graff &amp; Love LLP, </em>617 F.Supp.2d 447, 455 (W.D.Va.2008), <em>aff'd, </em>360 Fed.Appx. 400 (4th Cir.2010) (There is \u201can action for the conversion of intangible [property] rights merged within a document.\u201d (Footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Similarly, Petitioners relied on an out-of-State case in which a court held (just as we do and the Court of Special Appeals has) that, for conversion\u2019s purposes, the document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property can be digital (as opposed to paper). <em>Compare Birschbach, </em>123 Md.App. at 777 n. 6, 720 A.2d at 972 n. 6 (For conversion\u2019s purposes, there is \u201cno distinction between hard copy and electronic data[,]\u201d as long as a document, either paper or digital, embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property.) <em>unth Thyroff, </em>832 N.Y.S.2d 873, 864 N.E.2d at 1278 (\u201c[Electronic records that [a]re stored on a computer and [a]re indistinguishable from printed documents[ are] subject to a claim of conversion[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Petitioners also relied on an out-of-State case in which a court held a plaintiff established a claim, not for conversion, but instead for tortious deprivation of an interest in a corporation. <em>See Monterrey Mexican Rest, of Wise, Inc. v. Leon, </em>282 Ga.App. 439, 638 S.E.2d 879, 887 (2006) (\u201cAlthough technically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the circumstances of the case at bar do not amount to conversion, nonetheless, under these facts, there has been a deprivation of [the plaintiffTs stock interest in the Corporation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">That said, Petitioners relied on one out-of-State case in which a court, at least implicitly, endorsed the principle behind Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242(2). Specifically, in <em>Fremont Indem. Co. v. Fremont Gen. Corp., </em>148 Cal.App.4th 97, 103, 125-26, 55 Cal.Rptr.3d 621 (2007), the Second District Court of Appeal of California held that a plaintiff stated a claim for conversion of the plaintiffs net operating losses,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> even though the plaintiffs right to the net operating losses was not \u201cmerged or reflected in a document!.]\u201d In other words, that Court concluded that a defendant can convert a plaintiffs intangible property even where no document embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property. Thus, that Court implicitly concluded that, as Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242(2) contemplates, a defendant can convert a plaintiffs intangible property even where the defendant does not convert a document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">For three reasons, however, we are unpersuaded by <em>Fremont Indem., </em>148 Cal.App.4th at 103, 125-26, 55 Cal.Rptr.3d 621. First, as we did above, the Second District Court of Appeal of California correctly acknowledged that conversion should not be expanded so much that it could essentially swallow other torts, <em>see id. </em>at 124, 55 Cal.Rptr.3d 621 (\u201c[N]ewer economic torts have developed that may better take into account the nature and uses of intangible property, the interests at stake, and the appropriate measure of damages. On the other hand, if the law of conversion can be adapted to particular types of intangible property and will not displace other, more suitable law, it may be appropriate to do so.\u201d (Citation omitted)); in its analysis of conversion, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Court did not address whether that Court\u2019s holding would expand conversion so much that it could essentially swallow other torts. Second, in <em>Fremont Indem., id. </em>at 123-24, 55 Cal.Rptr.3d 621, the Second District Court of Appeal of California was bound by, and relied on, <em>Payne v. Elliot, </em>54 Cal. 339, 342, 340 (1880), in which the Supreme Court of California held that a plaintiff stated a claim for conversion of shares of stock, even though the plaintiff did not allege that the defendants converted stock certificates; <em>Payne, id., </em>is itself unpersuasive, as the Supreme Court of California did not explain how the defendants allegedly converted shares of stock without allegedly converting stock certificates,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> thus rendering unclear whether some of that Court\u2019s statements were <em>dicta. See, e.g., Payne, </em>54 Cal. at 342 (\u201c[I]f [conversion] is maintainable for the [stock] certificate, there is no valid reason why [conversion] is not also maintainable for the thing itself which the [stock] certificate <em>represents\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., shares of stock.). Third, <em>Fremont Indem. </em>is not the law of California; in <em>Fremont Indem., </em>148 Cal.App.4th at 125, 55 Cal.Rptr.3d 621, the Second District Court of Appeal of California contributed to a split of authority within that State by \u201cdeclining] to follow\u201d cases from two other intermediate appellate courts in California: (1) <em>Olschewski v. Hudson, </em>87 Cal.App. 282, 262 P. 43, 46, 44 (1927) (The First District Court of Appeal of California held that a plaintiff failed to state a claim for conversion of an unwritten \u201claundry route\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>the set of a laundry\u2019s customers); that Court reconciled its holding with <em>Payne, </em>54 Cal. 339, on the grounds that part of <em>Payne </em>was <em>dicta, </em>and that <em>Payne </em>involved shares of stock, which \u201care represented by [stock] certificates[.]\u201d); and (2) <em>Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bezenek, </em>46 Cal.App.4th 1559, 1565, 54 Cal.Rptr.2d 468 (1996) (The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Fourth District Court of Appeal of California stated in <em>dicta </em>that \u201c[c]ourts have traditionally refused to recognize as conversion the unauthorized taking of intangible interests that are not merged with, or reflected in, something tangible.\u201d (Citations omitted)). The Supreme Court of California has not resolved this split of authority. Thus, no jurisdiction, including California, has expressly adopted Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242(2), and we decline Petitioners\u2019 invitation to make Maryland the first to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Instead, Maryland will remain among the many jurisdictions that maintain conversion of a document as an element of conversion of intangible property (and thus reject the principle behind Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242(2)). <em>See, e.g., Narragansett Elec. Co. v. Carbone, </em>898 A.2d 87, 97 (R.I.2006) (\u201c[A] conversion action will not lie for a partnership interest or other intangible property right that is not manifested by a tangible instrument, such as a written agreement, a bankbook, or a promissory note, that may, in turn, be converted.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Rehak Creative Servs., Inc. v. Witt, </em>404 S.W.3d 716, 734 (Tex.App.2013) (\u201c[intangible property cannot be converted unless the underlying intangible [property] right has been merged into a document that has been converted.\u201d (Citations omitted)); <em>The Film &amp; Tape Works, Inc. v.

The initial focus continues to be on the tangible item withheld.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 518 A.2d at 176. This comports with <em>Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 561, 731 A.2d at 964, in which this Court pointed out that removing conversion of a document as an element of conversion of intangible property would \u201cnot accord very well with the traditional common law limitations of conversion^]\u201d (Quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242 cmt. e).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">For the above reasons, we again hold that a defendant does not convert a plaintiffs intangible property where the defendant does not convert a document that embodies the plaintiffs right to the plaintiffs intangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Applying our holding to this case\u2019s facts, we conclude that Petitioners failed to establish a claim against Witherspoon for conversion of the life insurance policy, as Petitioners failed to establish that Witherspoon converted any document that embodied Petitioners\u2019 right to the life insurance policy. It is undisputed that the Thompson Children, including Petitioners, owned the life insurance policy. We assume, without deciding, that: (1) the policy notices and policy statements that the life insurance company mailed to Witherspoon embodied Petitioners\u2019 right to the life insurance policy; and (2) Witherspoon intentionally exerted ownership or dominion over the policy notices and policy statements by receiving them in the mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>and not informing Petitioners of their contents. That said, Petitioners did not offer any evidence that they did not consent to Witherspoon\u2019s intentional exertion of ownership or dominion over the policy notices and policy statements; to the contrary, Petitioners expressly consented to the life insurance company mailing the policy notices and policy statements to Witherspoon. Specifically, Petitioners signed the application for the life insurance policy, which listed Witherspoon\u2019s address under \u201cSend Premium Notices To:[.]\u201d Because Petitioners consented to Witherspoon\u2019s intentional exertion of ownership or dominion over the policy notices and policy statements, Witherspoon did not convert the policy notices and policy statements; accordingly, Witherspoon did not convert the life insurance policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the circuit court erred in denying Witherspoon\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Petitioners contend that the circuit court was correct in denying Witherspoon\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to constructive fraud, as they established a claim against Witherspoon for constructive fraud. Specifically, Petitioners argue that they established that the parties were in a confidential relationship, as: (1) Witherspoon was Petitioners\u2019 brother-in-law; (2) Witherspoon was a financial advisor, and Petitioners lacked financial expertise; and (3) Witherspoon was the life insurance policy\u2019s broker, and, during the relevant time frame, the life insurance company mailed all policy-related documents to Witherspoon\u2019s address.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Witherspoon responds that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to constructive fraud, as Petitioners failed to establish a claim against him for constructive fraud.

Buxton, </em>363 Md. 634, 654, 770 A.2d 152, 164 (2001) (citation omitted). Accordingly, a plaintiff and a defendant are in a confidential relationship only if the plaintiff depends on the defendant. <em>See Upman v.

Thus, all fiduciary relationships are confidential relationships, <em>see id. </em>at 42, 753 A.2d at 9 (\u201cIn some relationships, such as attorney-client or trustee-beneficiary, a confidential relationship is ... presumed as a matter of law.\u201d); <em>B.N. v.

Petitioners do not contend that the parties were in a fiduciary relationship, and instead misplace their reliance on three sets of circumstances in a vain attempt to establish that the parties were in a confidential relationship.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">First, the parties were not in a confidential relationship by virtue of the circumstance that Witherspoon was Petitioners\u2019 brother-in-law. A family relationship is not necessarily a confidential relationship; and, in any event, the types of family relationships that are most conducive to being confidential relationships are relationships between spouses and relationships between parents and children, not relationships between siblings or siblings-in-law. <em>See Upman, </em>359 Md. at 42, 753 A.2d at 9 (\u201c[I]n family relationships, such as parent-child and [spouse]-[spouse], the existence of a confidential relationship is an issue of fact and is not presumed as a matter of law.\u201d (Citation omitted)). Here, Petitioners do not point to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>any evidence that they reposed confidence in Witherspoon by virtue of the circumstance that Witherspoon was their brother-in-law; indeed, unlike the rest of the Thompson Children, Kathy disliked Witherspoon so much that she transferred her share of the life insurance premium directly to the life insurance company instead of maintaining an account over which Witherspoon had control.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Second, the parties were not in a confidential relationship by virtue of the circumstances that Witherspoon was a financial advisor and that Petitioners lacked financial expertise. Petitioners do not point to any evidence that they depended on Witherspoon for financial advice. Indeed, the core of Petitioners\u2019 claims against Witherspoon is simply that Witherspoon failed to inform them that the annual life insurance premiums were not being paid; any layperson who received the policy statements and policy notices that the life insurance company mailed to Witherspoon could have informed Petitioners that the annual life insurance premiums were not being paid, thus, Witherspoon\u2019s role as a financial advisor is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Third, the parties were not in a confidential relationship by virtue of the circumstances that Witherspoon was the life insurance policy\u2019s broker and that, during the relevant time frame, the life insurance company mailed all policy-related documents to Witherspoon\u2019s address. Petitioners did not solely depend on Witherspoon to know whether the annual life insurance premiums were being paid. In other words, Witherspoon was not the exclusive source of that information. The Thompson Parents \u2014 the ones who were supposed to pay for the annual life insurance premiums, and who did so for years \u2014 obviously knew whether they were paying for the annual life insurance premiums. At any time during the relevant time frame, Petitioners could have asked the Thompson Parents whether they were still paying for the annual life insurance premiums. A plaintiff and a defendant are not in a confidential relationship where the plaintiff does not \u201cdepend! ]\u201d on the defendant. <em>Upman, </em>359 Md. at 41-42, 753 A.2d at 9 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>For the above reasons, Petitioners failed to establish a claim against Witherspoon for constructive fraud, as Petitioners failed to establish that the parties were in a confidential relationship.

Petitioners also misplace their reliance on other circumstances\u2014 such as Witherspoon\u2019s failure to tell Petitioners that the annual life insurance premiums were not being paid \u2014 that could establish a breach of an equitable duly, not the existence of an equitable duty in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b119-6\">McDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFNI\">concurring, in which BARBERA, C.J., and ADKINS, J., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">I join in the judgment of the Court, but not in its opinion. My primary concern has to do with the Court\u2019s emphatic embrace of the 1999 <em>Jasen </em>decision that limits the tort of conversion with respect to intangible property rights to circumstances where the defendant converts a document that embodies those rights. This seems antiquated, even if one is willing to include a \u201cdigital document\u201d within the concept of document.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Many important and valuable property rights are not embodied in a physical document \u2014 or even something that could be called a \u201cdigital document.\u201d For example, few shareholders of corporations possess physical stock certificates \u2014 or even \u201cdigital\u201d stock certificates \u2014 embodying their intangible economic rights as a shareholder. When physical certificates exist, they generally remain in a depository and changes in ownership are reflected, not by a transfer of the certificate, but by book entries by the custodian or by a bank or brokerage Arm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similar methods for efficiently attributing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>transferring other types of intangible economic rights are no doubt developing with advances in technology. The Court\u2019s holding in this case would seem to foreclose the possibility in many instances that one who has suffered a misappropriation of those rights could pursue a conversion remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">It seems that we should leave open the development of the tort of conversion to cover the misappropriation of such rights when other remedies prove unavailing \u2014 or at least we should allow for the development of a similar common law tort, perhaps under a different name. <em>See, e.g., </em>3 D.B. Dobbs, P.T. Hayden &amp; E.M. Bublick, The Law of Torts \u00a7 711 at p. 805 (2d ed. 2011) (\u201c[I]t is also plausible to treat some accounts or \u201cfunds\u201d as subject to conversion even where the defendant does not physically withhold a negotiable instrument from its owner. If the defendant, without authority to do so, transfers funds from the plaintiffs account to his own or another account, he is a converter even though the transfer is purely a bookkeeping entry, not a physical movement of cash.\u201d) That is what the Restatement, in a passage just following the sentence quoted several times in the Court\u2019s opinion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> suggests: \u201c[Cjourts which prefer to adhere to the older theory may prefer to regard the liability as one for an intentional interference with the right, which is not identical with conversion, but is similar to it in its nature and legal consequences. It is, however, of very little practical importance whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tort is called conversion, or a similar tort with another name. In either case the recovery is for the full value of the intangible right so appropriated.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 242, <em>comment e.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Chief Judge BARBERA and Judge ADKINS have indicated that they join this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\">.
