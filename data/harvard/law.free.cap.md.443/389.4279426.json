Bar Counsel charged Katz with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stemming from his failure to timely file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>federal income tax returns and pay the appropriate amount of federal income taxes due in tax years 1996 through 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">As permitted by Maryland Rule 16-752(a), we referred the Petition to the Honorable Richard E. Jordan of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law. Following a two-day hearing conducted on September 2-3, 2014, Judge Jordan dictated into the record his findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law. On September 24, 2014, Judge Jordan issued an Order adopting the transcribed statement of his oral findings and proposed conclusions. Judge Jordan found by clear and convincing evidence that Katz violated MLRPC 8.4(a), (b), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">THE HEARING JUDGE\u2019S FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Judge Jordan found the following facts by clear and convincing evidence. Katz was admitted to the Maryland Bar on June 2, 1983. Over the course of his 38-year legal career, Katz practiced law in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. At the time of the hearing, Katz was a member in good standing of the bars of Virginia and the District of Columbia, but was indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Maryland. This indefinite suspension was the result of Katz\u2019s failure to file Maryland state tax returns.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In November 2012, Katz signed an Agreed Order in a civil tax action pending against him in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. In this Order, Katz and the federal government consented to entry of a tax judgment against Katz in the amount of $5,462,935.25, which represent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ed the amount of federal income tax owed between tax years 1996 and 2009, plus interest and penalties. Katz agreed to pay a lump sum of several hundred thousand dollars against the judgment, but as of the time of the hearing before Judge Jordan, Katz had made no such payment. Katz also agreed to make monthly payments in accordance with a payment plan, and he was complying with that aspect of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Katz filed late tax returns for tax years 1996 through 2005 and 2007 through 2010, and \u201cgrossly underpaid\u201d his income taxes for tax years 1996 through 2010. In the table below, we summarize the hearing judge\u2019s findings regarding Katz\u2019s late filings and underpayments:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">AMOUNT OP INCOME (rounded to</p>\n<p id=\"AqL8\">TAX DATE TAX the lower TAX PAYMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">YEAR RETURNS FILED thousand) ASSESSMENT MADE</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">1996 March 16,2001 $788,000 $315,433 $123,000</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">1997 March 16,2001 $661,000 $263,239 $91,000</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">1998 March 16,2001 $390,000 $146,812 $1,200</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">1999 March 16,2001 $673,000 $269,819 $23,000</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">2000 May 28,2002 $478,000 $161,318 $41,000</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">2001 October 1,2003 $477,000 $166,711 $15,200</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">2002 February 16,2007 $319,000 $103,208 $80,000</p>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">2003 February 16,2007 $268,000 $82,525 $2,050</p>\n<p id=\"b441-19\">2004 February 16,2007 $592,000 $205,070 $1,800</p>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">2005 February 16,2007 $573,000 $184,299 $1,850</p>\n<p id=\"b441-21\">2006 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> $758,000 $267,014 $145,648</p>\n<p id=\"b441-22\">2007 May 9,2008 $768,054 $236,528 $-</p>\n<p id=\"b441-23\">2008 June 4,2010 $565,000 $186,840 $61,368</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>2009 December 21,2010 4 $736,000 $248,424 $29,106</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">2010 September 26,2011 $874,000 $284,539 $1,800</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Totals: $8,920,054 $3,121,779 $618,022</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Although the hearing judge did not explicitly state this figure on the record, simple subtraction shows that Katz underpaid his federal income taxes by $2,503,757. The table also reflects that he filed his returns from one to five years late. Notwithstanding his failure to timely file his returns and pay his taxes, Katz was \u201cforthrightly aware of his obligation to file taxes in a timely manner and to pay what was due in taxes.\u201d Moreover, Katz\u2019s tax \u201cshortcomings\u201d continued even after he began addressing his deficiencies with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). While Katz was negotiating with the IRS, he owed $284,539 in income taxes for tax year 2010, but \u201castoundingly\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> only paid a meager $1,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Regarding the criminal nature of Katz\u2019s conduct, the hearing judge found that Katz \u201cunquestionably\u201d violated 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 (2012) by willfully failing to pay his taxes and timely file his tax returns<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>And the court finds by \u2014 unquestionably finds that [Katz] did willfully fail to file on time and, more significantly perhaps, did willfully fail to pay estimated tax on time as required by law and, by not only clear and convincing evidence but by a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, finds that [Katz] did commit a criminal act or acts [from 1996 to 2010], despite the fact that he was not charged by the federal government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">THE HEARING JUDGE\u2019S CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The hearing judge concluded that Katz\u2019s misconduct violated MLRPC 8.4(b) because he committed criminal acts under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, and these criminal acts reflected adversely on his trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">The court ... find[s] that [Katz\u2019s violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203] reflect[s] adversely on his trustworthiness and his fitness as a lawyer in other respects in that the failure repeated and in such extreme, given the amount of income and the deficiencies of payments ... that does reflect on ... Katz because a lawyer has to be trusted. Somebody that does not take care of one of the most basic duties as a citizen, particularly as a lawyer, to pay income taxes on time and in reasonable amounts on estimates is somebody who cannot be fully trusted as a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The hearing judge also concluded Katz\u2019s misconduct violated MLRPC 8.4(d) because it was prejudicial to the administration of justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">The court does find by clear and convincing evidence that [Katz\u2019s] conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice in that an attorney is, if anything, held to an even higher standard than a layperson in being the face of the law, of being a person to be trusted and see that the law is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>honored. The conduct here does show a disregard for the law, the government, and for one\u2019s own responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQc\">Because Katz violated MLRPC 8.4(b) and (d), Judge Jordan also concluded that Katz violated MLRPC 8.4(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">With respect to 8.4(a), it appears to the court that once you violate one of the rules of professional conduct, then you, therefore, violate (a), so the court will find a violation of 8.4(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The hearing judge did not conclude, however, that Katz violated MLRPC 8.4(c) because he did not find by clear and convincing evidence that there was dishonest conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">[T]he court has significant concerns that [Katz\u2019s conduct reflects] a strategy over the years to minimize tax exposure, but the evidence is lacking to enable the court to find by clear and convincing evidence that dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation was the level to which ... delaying tactics or even gaming the system rose to the level of misconduct under 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Judge Jordan also found that Katz\u2019s law firm filed \u201caccurate\u201d IRS Schedule K-l\u2019s<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to report Katz\u2019s share of his law partnership\u2019s income and explained that this conduct militated against a finding that Katz engaged in dishonest conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Judge Jordan concluded that Katz\u2019s lack of prior discipline over his lengthy legal career and his acceptance of responsibility were mitigating factors weighing in his favor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">[I]t is in ... Katz\u2019s favor that he has been an attorney for 38 years, that he\u2019s been successful, that he\u2019s not had charges before. It\u2019s in his favor that he\u2019s forthrightly accepted responsibility for his shortcomings. He hasn\u2019t come in and tried to tell the court that he was ... under stress, using alcohol, had family problems. And that is a substantially beneficial fact for ... Katz. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>... And while the Court\u2019s flabbergasted at the extreme underpayment and repeated conduct here, it is to ... Katz\u2019s credit that he\u2019s practiced for 38 years otherwise without blemish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Our standard of review in attorney discipline matters is well-settled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">In attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record. We accept a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless we determine that they are clearly erroneous. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16 \u2014 759(b)(1), we review the hearing judge\u2019s proposed conclusions of law without deference. Thus, the ultimate determination ... as to an attorney\u2019s alleged misconduct is reserved for this Court. In that regard, we examine the record to ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to support the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusions, by a clear and convincing standard of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A57u\"><em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cocco, </em>442 Md. 1, 8, 109 A.3d 1176, 1180 (2015) (ellipses in original) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Exceptions And Conclusions Of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">In attorney discipline proceedings, parties are permitted to file \u201c(1) exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the hearing judge and (2) recommendations concerning the appropriate disposition.\u201d Md. Rule 16-758(b). Bar Counsel filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law. Specifically, Bar Counsel excepts to several figures within the hearing judge\u2019s recitation of the amount of taxes Katz owed and paid for tax years 1996 through 2010.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Bar Counsel also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Katz did not violate MLRPC 8.4(c). For his part, Katz did not except to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, but he did except to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, arguing his conduct did not violate MLRPC 8.4(a), (b), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\n<em>Whether Katz Violated MLRPC 8.4(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Katz relies on <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Worthy, </em>436 Md. 633, 84 A.3d 113 (2014), to argue the hearing judge was correct in not finding a violation of 8.4(c). In that case, this Court concluded that an attorney who willfully failed to timely file his federal tax returns did not violate 8.4(c). <em>See id. </em>at 641-43, 84 A.3d at 118-19. <em>Worthy, </em>however, is readily distinguishable from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In <em>Worthy, </em>the attorney failed to timely file his federal returns for only two years: 2006 and 2007. <em>Id. </em>at 639, 84 A.3d at 117. Moreover, the hearing court found that \u201cduring the period of time when those returns were due, Mr. Worthy had lost some of his financial records and had to order additional bank records. Those records were insufficient to adequately prepare the returns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, Katz failed to timely file his returns for 14 years, and there is no evidence that his repeated failure to file his returns resulted from his loss of financial records. Due to these marked differences in facts, <em>Worthy </em>provides no help for Katz.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">To support its argument that Katz violated MLRPC 8.4(c), Bar Counsel relies on <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 745 A.2d 1086 (2000). We agree that <em>Atkinson </em>is instructive because it also dealt with an attorney\u2019s willful failure to file income tax returns and pay income taxes over a protracted period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In <em>Atkinson, </em>Bar Counsel charged attorney Rena Vaughn Atkinson with several violations of the MLRPC arising out of her failure to file and pay federal and state income taxes for</p>\n<p id=\"A25\">tax years 1986 through 1996. <em>Id. </em>at 647, 745 A.2d at 1087. The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County found that Atkinson <em>willfully </em>failed to file or pay federal and state income taxes over this 11-year period. <em>Id. </em>at 650, 745 A.2d at 1088. After Bar Counsel initiated disciplinary proceedings against Atkinson, she filed returns for every year starting in 1986, except for 1988. <em>Id. </em>at 649, 745 A.2d at 1088. Although Atkinson remedied, for the most part, her failure to file returns, she still owed $93,000 in back taxes and penalties and made only one payment of $15,546.61 toward that balance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">This Court agreed with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Atkinson\u2019s misconduct violated MLRPC 8.4(c). <em>Id. </em>at 656, 745 A.2d at 1091. This Court determined the hearing judge was \u201ccorrect in characterizing [Atkinson\u2019s] particular misconduct as dishonest, if only because of the <em>substantial duration </em>in time over which she failed to pay <em>both </em>state and federal income taxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655, 745 A.2d at 1091 (first emphasis added). The Court continued that \u201c[t]he repeated failure to file tax returns \u2014 particularly when it spans an uninterrupted period of over ten years \u2014 is not a minor criminal offense, is a <em>dishonest </em>act, and reflects adversely on a lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness and fitness to practice law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Additionally, the Court clarified that \u201c[a] conviction for tax evasion is not a necessary predicate to support a finding of dishonesty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655-56, 745 A.2d at 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Here, Katz also repeatedly failed to file tax returns. He grossly underpaid his federal income taxes for 15 years and failed to timely file his returns for 14 of those years. If Atkinson\u2019s 11-year period of misconduct qualifies as a \u201csubstantial duration\u201d of time, then so, too, does Katz\u2019s 15-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>period. <em>Id. </em>Although Katz was not convicted of tax evasion for these years, such a conviction is not required for us to conclude that Katz violated MLRPC 8.4(c). <em>Id. </em>The factual conclusion of the hearing judge, who declined to find dishonest intent, is overridden by the holding in <em>Atkinson </em>that \u201c[t]he repeated failure to file tax returns ... is a dishonest act\u201d as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 745 A.2d at 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Katz\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>Atkinson </em>are unavailing. First, Katz argues that Atkinson never filed her tax returns, whereas Katz did file his tax returns, \u201calbeit late.\u201d Atkinson did in fact file her returns, although much belatedly, and at the request of an IRS agent. <em>See Atkinson, </em>357 Md. at 649, 745 A.2d at 1088 (\u201c[Atkinson] has since filed [a] return for each year from 1986 through to the present, except for 1988.\u201d (second alteration in original)). We are not persuaded that the difference between Katz\u2019s filing from one to five years late for a period of 14 years and Atkinson\u2019s misconduct works in Katz\u2019s favor in any meaningful way.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Second, Katz argues that Atkinson never engaged with the IRS to establish a payment plan to rectify her tax deficiencies. Here, although the hearing judge found that Katz engaged with the IRS, Katz\u2019s tax deficiencies \u201ccontinued even after he was addressing with the IRS his tax problems.\u201d The hearing judge specified \u201c[t]hat is not a factor that weighs in [Katz\u2019s] favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\"><em>Atkinson </em>is not the only case in which we have concluded an attorney violated MLRPC 8.4(c) after having willfully failed to file tax returns and pay taxes over a period of multiple years. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Worsham, </em>attorney Michael Craig Worsham failed to file federal and state income tax returns and pay income taxes for tax years 2005 through 2012. 441 Md. 105, 110-12, 105 A.3d 515, 518-19 (2014). The hearing judge found that Worsham carried out this misconduct \u201cwillfully, knowingly, and purposefully.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>117, 105 A.3d at 522. Relying on <em>Atkinson, </em>we concluded Worsham\u2019s misconduct violated MLRPC 8.4(c). <em>Id. </em>at 129, 105 A.3d at 529. In reaching this conclusion, we recited the rule from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Atkinson </em>that \u201cthe repeated failure to file income tax returns is \u2018a <em>dishonest </em>act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Tayback, </em>attorney Matthew G. Tayback willfully failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 1987 through 1989 and 1990 through 1993, resulting in $118,000 in unpaid federal income taxes. 378 Md. 578, 583, 837 A.2d 158, 161 (2003). The hearing judge found that, due to a lack of dishonest intent, Tayback\u2019s misconduct did not violate MLRPC 8.4(c), and Bar Counsel took exception to that finding. <em>Id. </em>at 590-91, 837 A.2d at 165-66. We sustained Bar Counsel\u2019s exception, relying on the rule from <em>Atkinson. </em>Thus, we concluded that Tayback\u2019s misconduct violated MLRPC 8.4(c). <em>Id. </em>at 591-92, 837 A.2d at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In sum, based on <em>Atkinson, Worsham, </em>and <em>Tayback, </em>we conclude that Katz\u2019s repeated, willful failure to pay his federal income taxes and timely file his federal income tax returns represents dishonest conduct that violated MLRPC 8.4(c). Accordingly, we sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\n<em>Whether Katz Violated MLRPC 8.4(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">To establish a violation of MLRPC 8.4(b), Bar Counsel must prove two elements by clear and convincing evidence: (1) Katz committed a criminal act; and (2) that criminal act reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. O\u2019Toole, </em>379 Md. 595, 610, 843 A.2d 50, 59 (2004); MLRPC 8.4(b). Katz argues Bar Counsel did not prove either of these elements. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Katz highlights that he was never charged criminally under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, contending his lack of criminal conviction precludes a violation of 8.4(b). We have consistently held that \u201cso long as there is clear and convincing evidence of facts constituting a criminal offense, there need not be a criminal conviction in order to find that an attorney violated MLRPC 8.4(b).\u201d <em>Worsham, </em>441 Md. at 129, 105 A.3d at 529. Here, Judge Jordan found by clear and convincing evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Katz willfully failed to pay his federal income taxes or timely file his federal income tax returns. Based on our independent review of the record, this finding was not clearly erroneous, and we will not disturb it. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ugwuonye, </em>405 Md. 351, 368, 952 A.2d 226, 236 (2008) (\u201cFactual findings by the hearing judge will not be interfered with if they are founded on clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (citation omitted)). The willful failure to file federal income tax returns or to pay federal income taxes is a criminal act under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. <em>Worsham, </em>441 Md. at 129, 105 A.3d at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Katz relies on <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Post, </em>350 Md. 85, 710 A.2d 935 (1998) and <em>Atkinson, supra, </em>to argue that his misconduct does not reflect adversely on his trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer. In <em>Post, </em>attorney Alan Franklyn Post failed, for a period of four years, to timely file withholding income tax returns, to remit the taxes withheld from his employees\u2019 wages, and to hold the withheld taxes in trust. <em>Post, </em>350 Md. at 87-88, 710 A.2d at 936. Post arranged a payment plan with the Maryland Comptroller to rectify the deficiencies, but his payments against the plan were consistently late. <em>Id. </em>at 89-90, 710 A.2d at 937. In some instances, Post failed to make any payments at all. <em>Id. </em>Although Post and Bar Counsel stipulated that Post \u201cdid not intend to defraud the Comptroller or to deprive the Comptroller permanently of the funds,\u201d Post acknowledged, and the hearing judge found, \u201cthat the withheld funds were not placed in his payroll account on multiple occasions due to his cash flow problems and that he used the funds withheld from his employees\u2019 wages to pay business expenses of the law firm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 710 A.2d at 937-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The hearing judge concluded that Post\u2019s misconduct violated MLRPC 8.4(b) and (d), and Post excepted with respect to MLRPC 8.4(b). <em>Id. </em>at 92, 94, 710 A.2d at 938, 939. This Court agreed with Post and sustained his exception, concluding that although Post\u2019s misconduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice, it did not \u201creflect! ] adversely on his fitness as a lawyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 710 A.2d at 942. We explained that the only basis for the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Post\u2019s misconduct did \u201creflect adversely on his fitness as a lawyer is that failure to practice what one preaches undermines one\u2019s credibility as a provider of legal counsel. But that is simply another way of saying that the administration of justice may be prejudiced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also highlighted that the hearing judge \u201cdiagnosed the problem as one involving [Post\u2019s] office management skills rather than \u2018his performance or abilities as an attorney.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">We see several material differences between <em>Post </em>and this case. The sheer difference in the amount of taxes owed by Katz, as compared to Post is material. With income in amounts ranging from $268,000<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to $874,000, Katz had available to him large amounts of discretionary income which he chose not to use for his tax obligations. In comparison, <em>Post, </em>who owed less than $20,000 in withholding taxes, used the tax money he should have paid to the government to cover business expenses in order to keep his law firm afloat. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 91, 710 A.2d at 937, 938. There is no indication that Katz used the money for anything other than personal, excessive expenditures. Finally, four years of late payments is markedly less than 14 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Walman, </em>280 Md. 453, 374 A.2d 354 (1977), we concluded that the attorney\u2019s misconduct reflected adversely on his fitness to practice law when he failed to pay personal income taxes. Joseph Walman was indicted by a federal grand jury with \u201cwillfully and knowingly\u201d failing to file his federal income tax return for tax years 1967, 1968, and 1969. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 374 A.2d at 355. Walman pled guilty to willfully and knowingly failing to file his 1968 return. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 374 A.2d at 355-56. He used the tax money he did not pay to the government to provide financial assistance to his grandfather and to pay his nephew\u2019s college tuition. <em>Id. </em>at 456, 374 A.2d at 356-57. This Court concluded it was \u201cbeyond debate\u201d that Walman\u2019s misconduct reflected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>adversely on his fitness to practice law. <em>Id. </em>at 463, 374 A.2d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Additionally, we find guidance in Comment 2 to MLRPC 8.4, which states that \u201c[m]any kinds of illegal conduct reflect adversely on fitness to practice law, such as offenses involving fraud and the offense of <em>willful failure to file an income tax </em>return.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The hearing judge found that there was clear and convincing evidence that Katz willfully failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 1996 through 2005 and 2007 through 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Baldwin, </em>308 Md. 397, 407, 519 A.2d 1291, 1296 (1987), we endorsed a two-part inquiry for determining whether an attorney\u2019s misconduct reflects adversely on his fitness to practice law: \u201c(1) Does the misconduct reveal some flaw in the attorney\u2019s personality that if manifested in his professional activity would cause him to violate his obligations to his clients, the courts, or fellow attorneys? (2) Is it likely that the deleterious personality trait will be carried over into the attorney\u2019s professional life?\u201d In this case, we answer both of these questions in the affirmative. Practicing law in an effective manner regularly requires meeting strict deadlines and responsibly managing client funds in trust accounts. Katz\u2019s underpayment of his taxes by approximately $2.5 million and his repeated failure to meet filing deadlines for 14 years exhibits egregious financial irresponsibility and a complete disregard for critical government-imposed deadlines. His financial irresponsibility and indifference to his legal obligations as a citizen of his country and state could cause him to violate his obligations to his clients, the courts, and his fellow attorneys. Furthermore, although Katz does not have a disciplinary record, other than his earlier suspension for failing to file his state income tax returns, his misconduct was repeated each year for 14 years \u2014 certainly an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In sum, we conclude that Katz\u2019s misconduct violated MLRPC 8.4(b) because he willfully failed to file his federal income tax returns and pay his federal income taxes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 for 14 years, and this misconduct reflects adversely on his fitness to practice law. Accordingly, we overrule Katz\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\n<em>Whether Katz Violated MLRPC 8.4(a) And (d)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"> Katz also takes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s proposed conclusions that he violated MLRPC 8.4(a) and (d). \u201c[I]t is well-settled that a lawyer\u2019s willful failure to file his or her personal income tax returns violates the prohibition of [MLRPC] 8.4(d) of engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hoang, </em>433 Md. 600, 610, 72 A.3d 548, 554 (2013) (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201c[e]ven though it does not directly injure a client, the willful failure to file returns or pay taxes is ... prejudicial to the administration of justice because it cheats and defrauds the government.\u201d <em>Worsham, </em>441 Md. at 130, 105 A.3d at 530 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Because Katz willfully failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 1996 through 2005 and 2007 through 2010 and he underpaid his federal income taxes by approximately $2.5 million for tax years 1996 through 2010, we conclude Katz violated MLRPC 8.4(d) and overrule his exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">It goes -without saying that because Katz violated MLRPC 8.4(b), (c), and (d), he also violated MLRPC 8.4(a), which states, in part, that it is professional misconduct for an attorney to violate the MLRPC. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brigerman, </em>441 Md. 23, 41, 105 A.3d 467, 477 (2014) (\u201cBased on [Brigerman\u2019s] numerous other violations of the MLRPC, [Brigerman] also violated MLRPC 8.4(a).\u201d). Thus, we overrule Katz\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Sanction For Violation Of MLRPC 8.4(a), (b), (c), And (d)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Bar Counsel contends that Katz should be disbarred.

Furthermore, as we explained in <em>Walman, </em>preserving the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession is particularly pertinent in cases involving the willful failure to file tax returns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac0\">An attorney\u2019s willful failure to file income tax returns may seriously impair public confidence in the entire profession. The need, therefore, to maintain public respect for the bar is a vital consideration in the imposition of disciplinary sanctions.

By willfully failing to file his tax returns, a lawyer appears to the public to be placing himself above that law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">280 Md. at 464-65, 374 A.2d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The appropriate severity of the sanction we impose depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. <em>Atkinson, </em>357 Md. at 656, 745 A.2d at 1092 (citation omitted). When evaluating these facts and circumstances, we consider \u201cthe attorney\u2019s prior grievance history, as well [as] any mitigating factors.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We may also consider aggrava<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ting factors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Worsham, </em>441 Md. at 135-36, 105 A.3d at 533 (considering aggravating factors in failure-to-file case).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">We begin with the severity of Katz\u2019s misconduct. Katz failed to timely file his income tax returns for 14 years, and he underpaid his taxes for 15 years to the tune of approximately $2.5 million. This misconduct is far more egregious than that of other attorneys we have suspended for failure to file and pay their incomes taxes. <em>See, e.g., Worthy, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>436 Md. 633, 84 A.3d 113 (indefinite suspension with right to reapply after six months for attorney who failed to timely file his federal returns for tax years 2006 and 2007, resulting in at least $70,000 in unpaid taxes); <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>379 Md. 595, 843 A.2d 50 (30-day suspension for attorney who willfully failed to file federal and state income tax returns for three years, with an attendant arrearage of $7,354.98); <em>Tayback, </em>378 Md. 578, 837 A.2d 158 (indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after 60 days for attorney who failed to file returns and pay taxes for seven years, resulting in $118,000 in unpaid taxes); <em>Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 745 A.2d 1086 (indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after one year for attorney who failed to file and pay federal and state income taxes for 11 consecutive years, resulting in $93,000 in unpaid taxes); <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Generally, suspension is the appropriate sanction when the willful failure to file is not the result of fraudulent or dishonest intent. <em>Worsham, </em>441 Md. at 132,105 A.3d at 531 (collecting cases). Disbarment is appropriate when the failure to file \u201cwas the result of intentional dishonest conduct for personal gain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132-33, 105 A.3d at 531. When an attorney engages in intentional dishonest conduct motivated by the desire for personal gain, disbarment is warranted \u201cregardless of whether the conduct is criminal or resulted in a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134, 105 A.3d at 532 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Katz\u2019s repeated, willful failure to pay his taxes and timely file his tax returns represents intentional dishonest conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>for personal gain. \u201cIn attorney grievance matters based on the willful failure to file tax returns, this Court has consistently defined <em>willfulness </em>as the voluntary, <em>intentional </em>violation of a known legal duty....\u201d <em>Tayback, </em>378 Md. at 589, 837 A.2d at 165 (emphasis added) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). And, as we explained <em>supra, </em>\u201c[t]he repeated failure to file tax returns ... is a <em>dishonest </em>act\u201d as a matter of law. <em>Atkinson, </em>357 Md. at 655, 745 A.2d at 1091 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">We have consistently emphasized the unparalleled importance of honesty in the practice of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">Unlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an attorney\u2019s character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\"><em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

As mitigation, Katz points to several factors. First, he highlights that he cooperated with the IRS to negotiate a payment plan to discharge his multimillion dollar tax deficiency. But although \u201cwe have said that an offending attorney\u2019s after-the-fact cooperation with authorities is commendable, nonetheless we have consistently refused to treat such cooperation as a mitigation of the underlying conduct.\u201d <em>Atkinson, </em>357 Md. at 658, 745 A.2d at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Second, Katz argues that his misconduct did not injure or negatively impact any clients or courts. He emphasizes that he did not steal a client\u2019s money or display a lack of candor with a court. As we have stated, however, \u201c[w]e see no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>significant moral distinction between willfully defrauding and cheating for personal gain a client, an individual, or the government.\u201d <em>Gore, </em>380 Md. at 472, 845 A.2d at 1213 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Katz willfully cheated the federal government out of approximately $2.5 million. His attorney said at oral argument that he did not currently have the means to pay and would not ever have, if we disbarred him.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This misconduct is equally as reprehensible as cheating a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Third, Katz points to his acceptance of responsibility and his lack of prior disciplinary offenses. Regarding his lack of a disciplinary record, Katz states that \u201c[o]ther than these regrettable Maryland and federal tax issues, which are essentially one singular set of circumstances from the same time period, [his] record is spotless.\u201d Katz\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and lack of prior disciplinary offenses outside his Maryland and federal tax offenses are outweighed by the aggravating factor of Katz\u2019s pattern of misconduct. Katz\u2019s transgressions are not limited to a few isolated occurrences\u2014 he willfully failed to file his tax returns for 14 years and he drastically underpaid his taxes for 15 consecutive years. That he has verbally accepted responsibility for his transgressions and, other than the 2012 suspension, has not received any other discipline from this Court are not sufficient to compensate for his cheating the government out of approximately $2.5 million over the course of a decade-and-a-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In light of the severity of Katz\u2019s intentional dishonest conduct, and finding no mitigating factors, we concluded that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.
