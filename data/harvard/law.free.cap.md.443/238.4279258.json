The 2007 Article suggested that prosecutors around the state \u201cwill likely be dealing with fallout from the investigation [into Kopera\u2019s qualifications] for years.\u201d That predicted fallout continues to rain-down in the two cases we discuss together today.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Pursuant to Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol, 2014 Cum.Supp.), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 8-301, Ronnie A. Hunt, Jr. (\u201cHunt\u201d), and Kevin Hardy (\u201cHardy\u201d) (collectively, \u201cRespondents\u201d), both incarcerated currently, filed in 2011 and 2012, respectively, Petitions for Writ of Actual Innocence in their unrelated cases. Both alleged that newly discovered evidence relative to Kopera, who testified in their trials as a prosecution witness, created a substantial or significant possibility that the outcomes (convictions) in their respective 1991 and 1989 trials may have been different (had Kopera not lied) and that such evidence could not have been discovered in time for them to move timely for a new trial pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-331.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their petitions characterized the questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>about Kopera\u2019s qualifications as \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that warranted reversals of their convictions and/or new trials.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Baltimore City denied their petitions without a hearing. On direct appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, the intermediate appellate court reversed in both instances the rulings of the Circuit Court and remanded for'further proceedings. Today we affirm the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals, and, in considered dicta, provide guidance on remand for the hearings and evaluation of petitions for writ of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>A. Ronnie A. Hunt, Jr.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Following a jury trial spanning several days in September of 1991, Ronnie A. Hunt, Jr. (\u201cHunt\u201d) was convicted on 25 September 1991 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of first-degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The jury found that Hunt, along with his co-defendant, Harry Johnson, III, on 10 April 1991 shot to death Sheldene Simon on the front lawn of the victim\u2019s home in Baltimore during a gunfight involving multiple shooters. Hunt was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, plus a consecutive twenty years for the handgun offense. Hunt\u2019s convictions were affirmed in 1993 by the Court of Special Appeals on direct appeal in an unreported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Hunt filed on 8 April 1997 a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, which was denied by the Circuit Court on 19 August 1997. Hunt filed on 22 September 1997 an Application for Leave to Appeal, which was denied by the Court of Special Appeals on 23 January 1998. Hunt filed <em>pro se </em>on 31 January 2011 an Amended Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence (the \u201cHunt Amended Petition\u201d or \u201cHunt\u2019s Amended Petition\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the Amended Petition he set out the procedural history of his case and claimed that his federal Constitutional Rights to due process and equal protection of the law afforded under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were denied him \u201cbased on false evidence.\u201d Hunt alleged the following, under a heading titled \u201cNEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">In 2007 it was unveiled by the Office of the Public Defender Innocence Project and the Maryland State Police that Joseph Kopera, reportedly an expert in ballistics, had in fact testified and lied under oath about his academic credentials for years, and probably falsified evidence as well. At the time of Kopera\u2019s reported death as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, he was employed with the Maryland State Police, after being employed with the Baltimore City Police Department for approximately 21 years. Kopera was the lynchpin in the State\u2019s case, in which [Hunt] was convicted based solely on the testimony of Kopera, who has since become known as a liar and fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">(minor alterations added). Later, in a section of Hunt\u2019s Amended Petition titled \u201cSTATEMENT OF FACTS,\u201d Hunt alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">A number of inconsistencies in Kopera\u2019s trial testimony in several or more cases regarding his academic credentials prompted an investigation or background check on Kopera by Ms. Michele Nethercott, chief attorney, out of the Office of the Public Defender Innocence Project. That also led to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>a subsequent investigation by the Maryland State Police, which unveiled some very troubling facts, that Kopera had been \u201clying\u201d about his academic credentials for years, all while testifying under oath in countless court rooms in Baltimore City, the State of Maryland, and perhaps, state and federal courts in Virginia, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. It has been proven that Kopera wasn\u2019t only a liar, but a fraud as well....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">(minor alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Hunt argued that Kopera\u2019s testimony in his capacity as the State\u2019s ballistics expert was the State\u2019s \u201conly evidence\u201d against him and \u201cthe lynch [sic] pin in the State\u2019s case.\u201d Hunt reproduced a portion of the trial transcript in his case where Kopera discussed his (fraudulent) qualifications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He reproduced then portions of the trial transcript where Kopera discussed a bullet specimen recovered from Simon\u2019s body, a semiautomatic pistol, and Kopera\u2019s process of \u201cmatching]\u201d the two. Hunt noted that the State had not produced any DNA, fingerprints, or eye witnesses who placed him at the scene of the murder, and so, \u201cwithout the false testimony of [Kopera], regarding both credentials and the murder weapon, it is highly unlikely that the State would have proven their case against [Hunt] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Hunt surmised penultimately:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">Every factual finding made by the jury hinged upon a determination that Kopera testified credibly. If Kopera\u2019s fake credentials and/or false testimony had been known, however, it is reasonably probable that the outcome of the trial would have been different!,] because his testimony probably would not have been as credible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Hunt concluded by requesting, among other things, \u201ca reversal of his conviction and unconditional release, otherwise, a new trial\u201d and that \u201ca prompt hearing be set in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The Circuit Court denied Hunt\u2019s Amended Petition, without a hearing, on 15 February 2011 because the petition \u201cfail[ed] to state a claim or assert grounds for which relief may be granted pursuant to [\u00a7 8-301(a) ].\u201d Hunt filed then a motion for reconsideration on 3 March 2011, which was denied by the Circuit Court on 7 March 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>B. Kevin Hardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Following a jury trial, Kevin Hardy (\u201cHardy\u201d) was convicted on 22 March 1991 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of first-degree murder, use of a handgun in a crime of violence, and unlawfully wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun. The jury found that Hardy, along with his co-defendant Ronald Nance, shot to death Aaron Carroll and shot and wounded Sandra Keve in the Flag House housing projects in Baltimore City on 3 April 1990. Hardy was sentenced to life imprisonment, plus forty-five years. Hardy\u2019s convictions were affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals on direct appeal and ultimately the Court of Appeals. <em>Nance and Hardy v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 475, 613 A.2d 428 (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>331 Md. 549, 629 A.2d 633 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Hardy filed on 11 March 1997 a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, which was denied on 26 March 1998. Hardy followed that with an Application for Leave to Appeal in the Court of Special Appeals, which was denied in an unreported, per curiam opinion on 25 June 1998. Hardy filed <em>pro se </em>on 31 July 2012 a Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence (the \u201cHardy Petition\u201d or \u201cHardy\u2019s Petition\u201d) in the Circuit Court. Hardy\u2019s Petition reproduced the list of \u201crequirements\u201d from \u00a7 8-301 in numerical list form and marshalled various allegations and arguments in subheadings under each called-out statutory requirement. Under a heading titled \u201cGrounds,\u201d Hardy alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">The State\u2019s key witness, Joseph Kopera, was an imposter. Kopera lied relentlessly about his credentials to the jury in [Hardy\u2019s] case. And, Kopera manufactured his testimony to bolster the State\u2019s case-in-chief against Petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>(minor alterations added). Kopera was called by the State to examine four bullets removed from the victim\u2019s body. Hardy reproduced portions of the transcript of his trial where Kopera testified regarding his qualifications as a ballistics expert.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hardy argued that, in light of an eye witness\u2019s arguably inconsistent testimony, Kopera\u2019s testimony \u201cwas desperately needed and used in[ ] [the State\u2019s] case to bolster the State\u2019s theory of two shooters of the victim.... \u201d Hardy maintained that Kopera \u201cfalsified himself in order to impress upon [the jury] the untrue accusation from the State, that [Hardy] planned and participated in the killing of Mr. Carroll.\u201d In a subheading concerning \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d Hardy characterized Kopera as \u201ca ballistic expert imposter.\u201d In support of his argument, Hardy attached to his Petition a press release from the Department of Maryland State Police, dated 8 March 2007 (\u201cState Police Press Release\u201d), announcing concern over Kopera\u2019s scholastic credentials, a copy of the 2007 Article, and an Affidavit of Suzanne Drouet in which Ms. Drouet recounted her discovery of Kopera\u2019s misrepresentations. Finally, Hardy concluded by \u201cemphatically requesting/seeking\u201d a hearing on the petition \u201cto prove that Mr. Joseph Kopera\u2019s perjured testimony, absolutely, affected the judgment of the jury in [Hardy\u2019s] case\u201d and requested further that the Circuit Court grant him a new trial or other relief as deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The Circuit Court denied, without a hearing, Hardy\u2019s petition on 14 August 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\n<em>C. All Together Now</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Hunt and Hardy appealed individually to the Court of Special Appeals, claiming that the Circuit Court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> erred in denying their petitions without a hearing. In separate unreported opinions, the intermediate appellate court reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that <em>Douglas v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 31 A.3d 250 (2011), where we concluded a hearing was warranted, presented a very similar factual scenario to the cases at hand. Accordingly, the appellate court reversed the rulings of the Circuit Court in Hunt\u2019s and Hardy\u2019s cases and remanded them for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In each case, the State petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which petitions we granted on 21 October 2014 to consider the following common question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">Did the Court of Special Appeals incorrectly reverse the circuit court\u2019s denial of [the Respondents\u2019] amended petition[s] for writ of actual innocence without a hearing where [the Respondents] did not satisfy the statutory requirements of Section 8-301 and where the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 ruling was inconsistent with its own case authority on the issue?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\"><em>State v. Ronnie A. Hunt, Jr., </em>440 Md. 225, 101 A.3d 1063 (2014); <em>State v. Kevin Hardy, </em>440 Md. 225, 101 A.3d 1063 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">II. Are Hunt and Hardy Entitled to Hearings on Their Petitions for Writ of Actual Innocence?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">In <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 165, 31 A.3d at 255, we held that \u201cthe denial of a petition for writ of actual innocence is an immediately appealable order, regardless of whether the trial court held a hearing before denying the petition.\u201d We did not set out the appropriate standard of review for appeals in such matters; however, the Court of Special Appeals concluded rightly elsewhere that the standard of review when appellate courts consider the legal sufficiency of a petition for writ of actual innocence is <em>de novo. See Ward v. State, </em>221 Md.App. 146, 156, 108 A.3d 507, 513 (2015); <em>Hawes v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 105, 133, 85 A.3d 291, 308 (2014); <em>Keyes v. State, </em>215 Md.App. 660, 669-70, 84 A.3d 141, 146-47 (2014); <em>id. </em>at 670 n. 6, 84 A.3d at 147 n. 6. Courts reviewing actions taken by a circuit court after a hearing on a petition for writ of actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>innocence limit their review, however, to whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 188, 31 A.3d at 269 (\u201c[DJecisions on the merits of requests for new trials based on newly discovered evidence, whether filed pursuant to Rule 4-331 or [\u00a7 8-301], are committed to the hearing court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d); <em>see Ward, </em>221 Md.App. at 156,108 A.3d at 512-13 (\u201cAccordingly, we review a circuit court\u2019s ruling upon the merits of a petition for a writ of actual innocence for an abuse of discretion.\u201d); <em>Keyes, </em>215 Md.App. at 669, 84 A.3d at 146-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\n<em>B. Section 8-301</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Section 8-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article allows certain individuals<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to petition for a writ of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence. Section 8-301 (e) provides that a court \u201cshall\u201d hold a hearing on a petition for writ of actual innocence in certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">(e) <em>Hearing. </em>\u2014 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the court shall hold a hearing on a petition filed under this section if the petition satisfies the requirements of subsection (b) of this section and a hearing was requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">(2) The court may dismiss a petition without a hearing if the court finds that the petition fails to assert grounds on which relief may be granted.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Subsection (b) of \u00a7 8-301 sets out the pleading sufficiency requirements for petitions for writ of actual innocence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">(b) <em>Requirements. </em>\u2014 A petition filed under this section shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">(1) be in writing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">(2) state in detail the grounds on which the petition is based;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>(3) describe the newly discovered evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">(4) contain or be accompanied by a request for hearing if a hearing is sought; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">(5) distinguish the newly discovered evidence claimed in the petition from any claims made in prior petitions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Maryland Rule 4-332, effective 1 October 2011, particularizes the required contents of petitions for writ of actual innocence. In addition to requiring the recitation of certain procedural information,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rule 4-332(d) elaborates on the contents of petitions for writ of actual innocence. Such petitions must state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">(6) that the request for relief is based on newly discovered evidence which, with due diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">(7) a description of the newly discovered evidence, how and when it was discovered, why it could not have been discovered earlier, and, if the issue of whether the evidence could have been discovered in time to move for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>pursuant to Rule 4-331 was raised or decided in any earlier appeal or postjudgment proceeding, the identity of the appeal or proceeding and the decision on that issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">(8) that the newly discovered evidence creates a substantial or significant possibility, as that standard has been judicially determined, that the result may have been different, and the basis for that statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">(9) that the conviction sought to be vacated is based on an offense that the petitioner did not commit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">(12) the relief requested; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">(13) whether a hearing is requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The \u201cgrounds\u201d referred to in \u00a7 8-301(e)(2) and (b)(2) are set out in \u00a7 8-301(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">(a) <em>Grounds. </em>\u2014 A person charged by indictment or criminal information with a crime triable in circuit court and convicted of that crime may, at any time, file a petition for writ of actual innocence in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction was imposed if the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">(1) creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">(2) could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">When ruling on the merits of petitions for writ of actual innocence, circuit courts have at their disposal the ability to \u201cset aside the verdict, resentence, grant a new trial, or correct the sentence, as the court considers appropriate.\u201d \u00a7 8-301(f)(1); <em>see </em>Rule 4-332(Z). Whichever of these results obtain, the hearing judge must state on the record the reasons for his or her ruling. \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">We determined in <em>Douglas </em>that \u00a7 8-301 \u201cimposes a burden of pleading, such that a petitioner is entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>hearing on the merits of the petition, provided the petition sufficiently pleads grounds for relief under the statute, includes a request for a hearing, and complies with the filing requirements\u201d of \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 165, 31 A.3d at 255. Petitioners must \u201c \u2018assert\u2019 grounds for relief; [\u00a7 8-301] does not require the petitioner to satisfy the burden of proving those grounds in the papers submitted.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 179, 31 A.3d at 264. If a petitioner satisfies the pleading standard, \u00a7 8-301(e)(l) directs that a hearing be held. The pleading requirement \u201cmandates that the trial court determine whether the allegations could afford a petitioner relief, if those allegations would be proven at a hearing, assuming the facts in the light most favorable to the petitioner and accepting all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the petition.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 180, 31 A.3d at 264. Finally, we \u201cconstrue liberally filings by <em>pro se </em>inmates, particularly when the statute involved is remedial.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 182, 31 A.3d at 266; <em>see State v. Matthews, </em>415 Md. 286, 312, 999 A.2d 1050, 1066 (2010) (referring to \u00a7 8-301 as both \u201cprocedural\u201d and \u201cremedial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In <em>Douglas, </em>we concluded that that petition<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> satisfied \u00a7 8-301\u2019s pleading requirement. 423 Md. at 183, 31 A.3d at 266. Douglas met easily the requirement of \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(b)(1) by sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>mitting his petition in writing. <em>Id. </em>In the cases at bar, both the Hunt and Hardy Petitions were filed in writing, and therefore cleared \u00a7 8-301(b)(l)\u2019s initial hurdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">We concluded that Douglas satisfied \u00a7 8-301(b)(2)\u2019s requirement that the petition \u201cstate in detail the grounds in which the petition is based.\u201d <em>See id. </em>As noted above, \u00a7 8-301(e)(2) authorizes a court to dismiss a petition for writ of actual innocence, without a hearing, \u201cif the court concludes that the allegations, if proven, could not entitle a petitioner to relief.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 185, 31 A.3d at 267. We concluded ultimately that the grounds alleged by Douglas, \u201cif proven, <em>could </em>entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">Douglas asserted that there was newly discovered evidence that Officer Kopera, who had testified at Douglas\u2019s trial, had falsified his credentials. Douglas submitted as an exhibit with his petition a newspaper article explaining his allegation of newly discovered evidence. Dated March 9, 2007, the article reported that \u201cJoseph Kopera, head of the Maryland State Police firearms unit, claimed on witness stands to have degrees that he never earned.... Questions regarding the longtime firearms and toolmarks examiner\u2019s credentials were raised several weeks ago by state public defenders working with the Innocence Project.\u201d The article explained that \u201cthe chief attorney with the ... Innocence Project ... became concerned about Kopera\u2019s qualifications while reviewing transcripts\u201d and noting inconsistencies regarding the credentials he testified he earned. Given that there were \u201chundreds of people he helped convict\u201d and that Kopera had worked for \u201c21 years in the Baltimore Police Department\u2019s crime laboratory before he was lured away in 1991 to join the state police,\u201d viewing inferences in the light most favorable to Douglas, it could be that the evidence could not have been discovered within time to move for a new trial under Rule 4-331.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\"><em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 185-86, 31 A.3d at 267-68. Hunt\u2019s and Hardy\u2019s petitions make almost identical allegations to those in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Douglas\u2019s petition and therefore satisfy similarly the requirements of \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(b)(2). Hunt\u2019s Amended Petition identified also the 2007 revelation that Kopera\u2019s qualifications and veracity may not be what they seemed. Although Hunt did not attach a copy of the 2007 Article to his petition, he related the substantive contents of the article, including the discovery by Michele Nethercott, Esquire, of the Innocence Project, of Kopera\u2019s inconsistent trial testimony in several cases and the results of an initial investigation into Kopera\u2019s academic credentials. Hardy\u2019s Petition discussed also the questions surrounding Kopera\u2019s credentials. Further, Hardy attached a copy of the 2007 Article, as well as copies of the State Police Press Release and an affidavit of Suzanne Drouet, an Assistant Public Defender, prepared apparently in connection with another case<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in which Ms. Drouet recounted her experience auditing Kopera\u2019s claimed credentials.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Douglas \u201cdescribe[d] the newly discovered evidence,\u201d in satisfaction of \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(b)(3), by alleging that on 9 March 2007 \u201can article was published that \u2018exposed Joseph Kopera ... as [a] perjurer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 183, 31 A.3d at 266. We noted that, as Kopera testified as an expert witness for the State during Douglas\u2019s trial, the \u201callegation, viewed in the light most favorable to Douglas, could be proven to be newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 184, 31 A.3d at 266. By the same token, the Hunt and Hardy Petitions satisfy also \u00a7 8-301 (b)(3)\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Construing liberally Douglas\u2019s <em>pro se </em>petition, we concluded that it satisfied \u00a7 8-301(b)(4)\u2019s requirement that a petition \u201ccontain or be accompanied by a request for hearing if a hearing is sought.\u201d <em>See id., </em>31 A.3d at 266-67. Although Douglas did not state expressly \u201cI request a hearing,\u201d we concluded that the petition \u201creflect[ed] Douglas\u2019s indicated desire for a hearing\u201d as his petition recited the complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>language of the statute, including the text of \u00a7 8-301(b)(4) itself. <em>Id. </em>He filed also a proposed \u201cWrit of Habeas Corpus\u201d for the warden to produce him for a hearing on his petition. <em>Id., </em>31 A.3d at 267. The Hunt and Hardy Petitions requested hearings explicitly (Hardy\u2019s even \u201cemphatically\u201d so).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">As Douglas had not filed previously a petition for writ of actual innocence,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u00a7 8-301(b)(5) did not apply in his case as he had no claims to distinguish from those made in prior filings. <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 184-85, 31 A.3d at 267. Like Douglas, Hunt and Hardy filed various postconviction motions, but neither filed previously a petition for writ of actual innocence, and so \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(b)(5) does not figure here.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">As Maryland Rule 4-332, noted earlier, became effective 1 October 2011, it does not apply to Hunt\u2019s Amended Petition, which was filed on 31 January 2011.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See Hawes, </em>216 Md. App. at 133 n. 18, 85 A.3d at 308 n. 18. Hardy\u2019s Petition was filed 31 July 2012, however, and so must comply with Rule 4-332.. Rule 4-332(d)(6) elaborates on \u00a7 8-301(b)(3)\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d requirement, adding that a petition for writ of actual innocence must allege that the newly discovered evidence, \u201cwith due diligence, could not have been discovered\u201d in time to move for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331. The explicit requirement that a petitioner (or their attorney) must not have been able to discover the new evidence \u201cwith due diligence\u201d does not alter our conclusion that Hardy\u2019s Petition satisfies \u00a7 8-301(b)(3).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rule 4-332(d)(7) goes on to say that petitions must state how and when the new evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>discovered and why it could not have been discovered earlier. Hardy\u2019s Petition satisfies the pleading requirement of Rule 4-832(d)(7) by attaching the 2007 Article, as well as the affidavit of Ms. Drouet, and reiterating the substantive contents of the same in the body of his petition. Rule 4-332(d)(9) requires further that the petition must assert that the contested conviction \u201cis based on an offense that the petitioner did not commit.\u201d In his petition, Hardy states that he \u201chas maintained his innocence in the crimes charged and still does to this date.\u201d Finally, as noted earlier, Rule 4-332(d) requires the recitation of certain procedural information. Hardy\u2019s Petition was in writing and signed by him. It was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in Case Nos. 190274025, 27, and 29, which were the original file numbers of his cases; therefore, the Petition contains the identifying information required by Rule 4-332(d)(l). Hardy attached also to his Petition a compliant certificate of service, satisfying Rule 4-332(d)(ll)\u2019s requirement that a copy of the Petition was mailed to the appropriate State\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Hardy\u2019s Petition does not comply, however, with other technical requirements of Rule 4-332(d), in that his petition does not set out each offense of which he was convicted, the date of the conviction, and the sentence imposed (Rule 4-332(d)(3)), nor the procedural history of his cases on appeal (Rule 4 \u2014 332(d)(4)), nor does his petition contain a recitation of the procedural history of each motion or petition for post-judgment relief (Rule 4 \u2014 332(d)(5)).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Circuit Court need not dismiss Hardy\u2019s Petition, however, if it concludes that the petition complies substantially with the requirements of subsection (d). <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-332(i)(l)(A) (providing that the court may \u201cdismiss the petition if it finds as a matter of law that the petition fails to comply <em>substantially </em>with the requirements of section (d) of this Rule or otherwise fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>assert grounds on which relief may be granted\u201d (emphasis added)). It does not appear that the Circuit Court dismissed Hardy\u2019s Petition on 14 August 2012 on any of these grounds. Had that been the apparent basis for that dismissal, without a hearing, the trial court did not appear to consider the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d relief valve of Rule 4-332(i)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We could find no reported appellate cases in which a petition filed after 1 October 2011 was dismissed for lack of compliance with the more technical requirements of Rule 4-332.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Where petitions were dismissed, it was for more substantive violations of other requirements. <em>See, e.g., Ward, </em>221 Md.App. at 168-70, 108 A.3d at 520-21 (concluding that the circuit court erred in concluding that certain \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d was \u201cmerely impeaching,\u201d and remanding the case for further consideration); <em>Yonga v.

Variations on a Theme: What Could Happen at the Hearings To Be Held?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">In <em>Douglas, </em>after we concluded that the petitioner<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> was entitled to a hearing, we emphasized that \u201calthough Douglas has satisfied the pleading requirement to assert grounds for relief, it does not follow automatically that he can prove his claim.\u201d 423 Md. at 186, 31 A.3d at 268. We recognized that \u201cdecisions on the merits of requests for new trials based on newly discovered evidence, whether filed pursuant to Rule 4-331 or [\u00a7 8-301], are committed to the hearing court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 188, 31 A.3d at 269. The Court of Special Appeals in the present cases expressed reservations as to the likelihood of success at Respondents\u2019 prospective hearings. Both unreported opinions concluded with the same paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">Although we conclude that [the Respondent] is entitled to a hearing, having sufficiently met the pleading requirements of [\u00a7 8-301], \u201cit does not follow automatically,\u201d as the Court of Appeals has noted, \u201cthat he can prove his claim\u201d at that hearing. <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 186 [31 A.3d 250]. We observe that Hunt may have difficulty doing so. In <em>Jackson v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 347 [86 A.3d 97] (2014), this Court affirmed a circuit court\u2019s denial of a petition for writ of actual innocence based on Kopera\u2019s perjury, after holding a hearing on Jackson\u2019s petition. The circuit court denied Jackson\u2019s petition, after concluding that Jackson had not shown that Kopera\u2019s misrepresentations were material, that he had not established that the purported \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d \u201ccreated a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different,\u201d and that he had not acted with due diligence in discovering that Kopera had misrepresented his qualifications at his trial... .[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Such reserve is warranted, as Respondents face significant hurdles in convincing a hearing judge that the questions regarding Kopera\u2019s qualifications \u201ccreate[] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different\u201d and \u201ccould not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial.\u201d \u00a7 8-301(a). Respondents\u2019 causes are by no means doomed, however; a hearing judge may determine, based on whatever evidence and arguments as may be presented at the hearing, that Respondents are entitled to a new trial, resentencing, or other appropriate relief. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8 \u2014 301(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In <em>Douglas, </em>we concluded that the allegations contained in the petition, if proven at the hearing, could have entitled Douglas to such relief. 423 Md. at 185, 31 A.3d at 267. As discussed earlier, Douglas\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d regarding Kopera\u2019s scholastic qualifications are almost verbatim those of Hunt and Hardy. Douglas\u2019s convictions<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> arose out of an altercation between himself and several Baltimore City police officers outside a bar in Baltimore City where he shot two police officers. <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 165, 31 A.3d at 255-56. Seven police officers and two ballistics experts were called to testify at his trial, one of the latter of which was Kopera. <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 166, 31 A.3d at 256. Each of the two experts examined at least one bullet and both linked the bullet with Douglas\u2019s gun. <em>Id. </em>Even in light of the other evidence against Douglas, we determined that a Circuit Court <em>could </em>find that the new evidence \u201ccreates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 185-86, 31 A.3d at 267-68. In the present cases, the Circuit Court may very well find, after a hearing, that Hunt and Hardy carry successfully their burdens of proof and are entitled to relief based solely on proof of the allegations contained in their respective petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We note further that Hunt and Hardy\u2019s Petitions are not doomed necessarily because the newly discovered evidence, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>characterized by the Court of Special Appeals, may be only \u201cimpeaching.\u201d In considering whether certain forms of newly discovered evidence might create a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different,\u201d cases from the Court of Special Appeals develop the concept of \u201cimpeaching,\u201d as opposed to \u201cmerely impeaching,\u201d evidence in the context of \u00a7 8-301 petitions for writ of actual innocence. The reasoning of these cases stems in large part from two cases \u2014 one from the Court of Special Appeals and one from this Court \u2014 discussing the value of \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d in the context of Rule 4-331 motions for a new trial. In <em>Campbell, </em>after noting that the newly discovered evidence must be \u201cmaterial\u201d (among other things) in order to justify a new trial, we stated that the evidence must be \u201cmore than \u2018merely cumulative or impeaching.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell v. State, </em>373 Md. 637, 669, 821 A.2d 1, 20 (2003) (quoting <em>Argyrou v. State, </em>349 Md. 587, 602, 709 A.2d 1194, 1201 (1998)). In <em>Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 884 A.2d 694 (2005), again considering the value of newly discovered evidence in the context of a motion for a new trial, the Court of Special Appeals reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlV\">The distinction between \u201cimpeaching\u201d and \u201cmerely impeaching,\u201d albeit nuanced, is pivotally important. Newly discovered evidence that a State\u2019s witness had a number of convictions for crimes involving truth and veracity or had lied on a number of occasions about other matters might have a bearing on that witness\u2019s testimonial credibility, but would not have a direct bearing on the merits of the trial under review. Such evidence would constitute collateral impeachment and would, therefore, be \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d If the newly discovered evidence was that the State\u2019s witness had been mistaken, or even deliberately false, about inconsequential details that did to [sic] go to the core question of guilt or innocence, such evidence would offer peripheral contradiction and would, therefore, be \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d If the newly discovered evidence, on the other hand, was that the State\u2019s witness had actually testified falsely on the core merits of the case under review, that evidence, albeit coincidentally impeaching, would be directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>exculpatory evidence on the merits and could not, therefore, be dismissed as \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"><em>Jackson, </em>164 Md.App. at 697-98, 884 A.2d at 704-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The intermediate appellate court deployed this reasoning at least twice in cases where convicted persons challenged their convictions and relied at least in part on the revelations regarding Kopera\u2019s mis-represented qualifications. In <em>Kulbicki v. State, </em>207 Md.App. 412, 53 A.3d 361 (2012), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>440 Md. 33, 99 A.3d 730 (2014), <em>petition for cert, filed, Maryland v. Kulbicki, </em>U.S., Jan. 16, 2015 (No. 14-848), after a hearing on a petition for postconviction relief, Kulbicki argued (among other things) that the State\u2019s use of \u201cperjured, false, and misleading expert ballistics testimony\u201d denied him a fair trial. 207 Md.App. at 435, 53 A.3d at 374-75. Before moving on to substantive discussion of Kulbicki\u2019s other arguments on appeal, the Court of Special Appeals noted that \u201cKulbicki waived any claims regarding Kopera\u2019s perjury. To the extent that ... a background investigation would have revealed that Kopera lacked the claimed college degrees, Kulbicki could have raised his contentions on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Kulbicki, </em>207 Md.App. at 444, 53 A.3d at 380. Because Kulbicki did not show that Kopera\u2019s perjury was \u201cmaterial,\u201d concluded the intermediate appellate court, his \u201cvalid constitutional claim recognizable under the [Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act]\u201d failed on the merits. <em>Kulbicki, </em>207 Md.App. at 446, 53 A.3d at 381. The court concluded that portion of its analysis by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">[T]here simply is no likelihood that the jury\u2019s determination would have been influenced by the fact that Mr. Kopera did not have the academic credentials he claimed. As the State notes in its brief, the record reflected that ballistics is a field for which no college degree is offered, and the expertise for the field is usually based on experience, which Kopera had in copious amounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-8\"><em>Kulbicki, </em>207 Md.App. at 447, 53 A.3d at 382 (internal quotations omitted). A majority of this Court reversed the Court of Special Appeals on other grounds.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Kulbicki v. State, </em>440 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Md. 33, 99 A.3d 730 (2014) (discussing the Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis evidence used in Kulbicki\u2019s trial). <em>See Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 446, 918 A.2d 470, 497-98 (2007) (Wilner, J., concurring) (characterizing a \u201cdecision\u201d of the Court of Special Appeals \u201cthat this Court later vacated\u201d as one with \u201cutterly no precedential value\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Next, in <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 356-57, 86 A.3d at 102-03, a circuit court granted a hearing on a petition for writ of actual innocence where the petitioner alleged that Kopera\u2019s alleged perjury was \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d and that Kopera\u2019s testimony bolstered critically the testifying victim\u2019s version of events. At the hearing on his petition, Jackson introduced into evidence his trial transcript, as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>State Police Press Release, the 2007 Article, and an article published in <em>USA Today </em>entitled \u201cExpert\u2019s Ruse Raises Legal Questions.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 357, 86 A.3d at 103. The State stipulated that Jackson did not know of Kopera\u2019s perjury during his 1987 trial and that he did not learn that information until he was advised by a fellow inmate in 2010. <em>Id. </em>The petitioner argued that the evidence was not \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d because the trial judge instructed the jury that \u201cyou must take into account the qualifications of the expert\u201d in weighing his testimony. <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 357-58, 86 A.3d at 103. He argued also that he could not have discovered Kopera\u2019s perjury even with the exercise of reasonable due diligence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The Court of Special Appeals reviewed the lower court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion, in light of the trial court ruling on the merits after a hearing on the petition. <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 363-64, 86 A.3d at 106-07. In considering the \u201cthreshold question\u201d of whether the newly discovered evidence could have been discovered in time to move for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331, the intermediate appellate court concluded that Jackson needed to show that the evidence regarding Kopera\u2019s qualifications \u201ccould not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence prior to October 1990.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 364, 86 A.3d at 107. The appellate court found no abuse of discretion in the hearing judge\u2019s determination that, \u201c[g]iven that another attorney was able to discover the misstatements, one may also conclude that [appellant] did not exercise due diligence in obtaining this readily available evidence at the time of his trial.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 365, 86 A.3d at 107. It concluded also, relying on the earlier <em>Jackson </em>case (sharing coincidentally a common surname), 164 Md.App. 679, 884 A.2d 694, and <em>Kulbicki, </em>that, regardless of the jury instructions, Kopera\u2019s false testimony was \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d and Kopera\u2019s academic qualifications were not material as Kopera testified that \u201c \u2018ballistics is a field for which no college degree is offered,\u2019 \u201d and the acquisition of expertise is \u201c \u2018usually based on experience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson, </em>216 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Md.App. at 369-71, 86 A.3d at 110-11 (quoting <em>Kulbicki, </em>207 Md.App. at 447, 53 A.3d at 382).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Notwithstanding the court\u2019s acknowledgement that other courts have held that \u201cwhere expert testimony is critical, false testimony about the expert\u2019s credentials requires a new trial,\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 374 n. 16, 86 A.3d at 113 n. 16, the appellate court concluded that Kopera\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot critical\u201d in Jackson\u2019s trial, <em>id., </em>and there was no significant or substantial possibility that the jury could have reached a different result had it known of his prevarication regarding his academic degrees. <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 373-75, 86 A.3d at 112-13. It determined that a correct statement of Kopera\u2019s qualifications would not have altered the result, as Kopera\u2019s substantive testimony did not weigh heavily in favor of either litigant and that the evidence of Jackson\u2019s guilt, without consideration of Kopera\u2019s testimony, was compelling, based on the testimony of other witnesses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We offer no comment on the reasoning of the hearing judge or the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Jackson </em>of 2014 as that case is not before us. We note, however, that it would not be an abuse of discretion for a hearing judge to find that a defense attorney might fail, after nonetheless exercising due diligence before the revelations of 2007, to discover Kopera\u2019s alleged fraud.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We note also that a hearing judge might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>conclude reasonably that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s distinction between \u201cimpeaching\u201d and \u201cmerely impeaching,\u201d in the context of \u00a7 8-301 petitions for writs of actual innocence, is overly rigid.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> When an expert is called to testify, it is conceivable that, based on the cumulative body of evidence presented at a given trial, falsity regarding the expert\u2019s credibility and qualifications might \u201ccreate[ ] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different.\u201d \u00a7 8-301(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">If the Respondents prove their newly discovered evidence and also persuade the trial judge that they could not have discovered it in time to move for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331, the Circuit Court must determine whether the new evidence regarding Kopera creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result of their trials may have been different. We suggest that the answer to that question depends in large part on the particular set of facts and comprehensive body of evidence introduced at trial in each case. In some trials, Kopera\u2019s testimony may be assigned lesser value, whereas in others his testimony may have been of greater weight and consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Because the Petitions filed by Hunt and Hardy satisfy the pleading standards established by \u00a7 8-301 and evaluated in <em>Douglas, </em>Respondents are entitled to hearings on their Petitions.

In its briefs in the present cases, the State argues that the majority opinion in <em>Kulbicki </em>\u201cconfirms that the evidence which Hunt claimed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>be newly discovered was available and could have been uncovered by him at the time of his trial.\u201d The State asserts in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">In <em>Kulbicki, </em>this Court, addressing the right to effective assistance of counsel in the context of a challenge to Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis (CBLA) evidence, concluded that evidence calling into question the conclusions of CBLA \"was available\u201d to Kulbicki\u2019s counsel at trial but \"was never exhumed\u201d and \"never explored, even though opportunity knocked.\u201d This Court faulted Kulbicki's attorneys for failing to investigate and discover what the Court determined to be available material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">(citations omitted). The majority in <em>Kulbicki </em>held that his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when they failed to investigate and cross-examine thoroughly the State's CBLA expert because that expert co-authored a report four years prior to trial that \"presaged the flaws in CBLA evidence.\u201d <em>Kulbicki, </em>440 Md. at 40, 99 A.3d at 734. Hunt suggests that the Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Kulbicki </em>is inapposite because \u201c[i]t is one thing to impose upon counsel the minimum requirement of readiness to impeach an opposing party's expert on the basis of ... a prior inconsistent <em>opinion-, </em>it is another to suggest that a criminal defense attorney must do what the State suggests would be so easy to do \u2014 but apparently failed to do itself \u2014 and perform a 'thorough background investigation\u2019 to discover <em>fraud.\" </em>(emphasis in original). Hardy echoes Hunt's sentiment: \"To require 'a thorough background investigation,\u2019 as the State puts it, from every defense counsel for every State\u2019s expert disclosed in discovery of every criminal case is unworkable. To expect it when the expert is the State\u2019s own employee is absurd____A scientific report published and circulated in academic journals four years prior to trial does not equate with affirmative fraud and perjury.\u201d (citations omitted). We agree with the Respondents that the majority opinion in <em>Kulbicki </em>\u2014 which did not even mention Kopera and did not involve a \u00a7 8-301 petition for writ of actual innocence \u2014 is distinguishable. <em>See infra </em>note 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">. At oral argument in the present cases, much discussion ensued over what constitutes reasonable trial preparation by defense attorneys. The State suggested that, as Kopera\u2019s alleged perjury could have been discovered at trial or beforehand, it should have been. Attorneys for the Respondents suggested that it is unreasonable to expect defense attorneys to be the \u201chuman resources department\u2019\u2019 for the State\u2019s employees who act as expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Kopera testified for over twenty years at trials as a State\u2019s witness in his capacity as a municipal or State employee. As an objective fact, attorneys with unlimited time and resources could have discovered Kopera's fraud at any point during that time. We would avoid, however, the negative inference from the opinions of the Court of Special Appeals that no defense attorney representing a defendant at a trial in which Kopera testified exercised due diligence (prior to the discoveries made by the attorneys of the Innocence Project) in failing to discover his charade.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\">.
