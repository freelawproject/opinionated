This is not one of those cases. The sin in this case was inattention \u2014 inattention to clients, inattention to an attorney trust account, and inattention to the activities of a non-lawyer assistant in whom the attorney misplaced his trust and who misused the attorney trust account to the detriment of the. attorney\u2019s clients. Sadly, this too merits disbarment, as our regulation of the practice of law must protect the public not only from those attorneys who engage in deliberate, egregious acts of misconduct, but also those who fail to fulfill the routine duties of the profession that serve and safeguard their clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">\n<em>A. Procedural Context</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">The Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) charged Earl Americus Smith, III with violating numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>provisions of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) arising out of the management of his attorney trust account, his delegation of tasks to his non-lawyer assistant, and his handling of several client matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Specifically, the Commission charged Mr. Smith with violating MLRPC 1.1 (competence), 1.2(a) (scope of representation), 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 1.5(c) (fees), 1.15 (safekeeping property), 5.3 (responsibilities regarding nonlawyer assistants), 5.5(a) (unauthorized practice of law), 8.1(a) (false statement in connection with disciplinary matters), and 8.4(a) (violation of MLRPC), (c) (conduct involving deceit) and (d) (prejudice to the administration of justice). The Commission also charged Mr. Smith with violating Maryland Rules 16-606.1 (attorney trust account record keeping), 16-607 (commingling of funds), and 16-609 (prohibited transactions). The Commission later withdrew the charge as to MLRPC 8.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a), this Court designated Judge Larnzell Martin, Jr. of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to conduct a hearing concerning the alleged violations and to provide findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law. Following a three-day hearing at which Mr. Smith testified and was represented by counsel, the hearing judge issued his findings of fact and conclusions of law. On the basis of those factfindings, the hearing judge concluded that Mr. Smith committed all of the alleged violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The Commission did not except to the hearing judge\u2019s findings and conclusions; it recommended that we disbar Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith conceded most of the violations, but filed an exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he was responsible for violations of MLRPC 8.4 and argued for a suspension rather than disbarment. The Court heard oral argument on Mr. Smith\u2019s exception and the recommendations for sanction in January 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\n<em>B. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are uncontested; we therefore treat them as established. Maryland Rule 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>759(b)(2)(A). The hearing judge\u2019s findings, the parties\u2019 stipulations, and the undisputed evidence in the record establish the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\n<em>Mr. Smith\u2019s Law Practice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Mr. Smith was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1983. He is also a member of the District of Columbia Bar. During 1991, Mr. Smith established a law practice under the name of Bryan &amp; Smith, P.C., which focused on personal injury matters. Since the mid-1990s, Mr. Smith has been the only attorney at the firm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The key facts relevant to the alleged violations concern Mr. Smith\u2019s delegation of responsibility to \u2014 and failure to supervise \u2014 his legal assistant, his mishandling of his attorney trust account related to personal injury cases, and his neglect of several client matters, all during the period 2009-2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>Delegation of Responsibility to Dawn Staley-Jackson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">During 1993, Mr. Smith hired Dawn Staley-Jackson<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a paralegal. Ms. Staley-Jackson worked for the firm for the next two decades as a legal assistant. During the time period relevant to the alleged violations, her name appeared on the firm\u2019s stationery with the title \u201cLegal Assistant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Mr. Smith delegated substantial authority to Ms. StaleyJackson. Indeed, the hearing judge found that he \u201callowed Ms. Staley-Jackson to run his law practice without any meaningful oversight.\u201d With Mr. Smith\u2019s knowledge and acquiescence, Ms. Staley-Jackson independently sent demand letters to defendants, negotiated settlements with insurance carriers, communicated with and advised clients, dealt with medical providers, drafted pleadings and other papers for filing in court (frequently signing Mr. Smith\u2019s name), and deposited checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Mr. Smith gave Ms. Staley-Jackson responsibility for preparing settlement disbursement sheets, and for meeting with the client to explain the settlement sheet. Mr. Smith would not check the accuracy of the lists of disbursements with the client\u2019s file, other than to check the gross amount and his own fee. Mr. Smith also delegated to Ms. Staley-Jackson the responsibility to inform clients that settlement funds had been received.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">After Ms. Staley-Jackson informed Mr. Smith that she was suffering from a serious illness, he permitted her to work from home, to take client files to her house, and to forward the office phone to her home and personal cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>Operation of Personal Injury Trust Account</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Mr. Smith maintained two attorney trust accounts at Sun-Trust Bank \u2014 one for attorney\u2019s fees and the other for receiving and disbursing funds in personal injury cases. The alleged violations concern the operation of the personal injury trust account. At all relevant times, Mr. Smith had sole check-signing authority for the personal injury trust account and used a computer software program to record deposits and disbursements and to issue checks payable from that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">From January 2009 continuing through September 2012, Mr. Smith failed to create or maintain any meaningful records relating to the personal injury trust account. He did not keep accurate chronological listings of all deposits and disbursements, and failed to generate individual client matter records. Mr. Smith did not reconcile his trust account records on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Mr. Smith ordinarily received monthly bank statements by mail. He testified that, sometime during 2010, the bank statements began to arrive by mail either sporadically or not at all. He said that he would go to the local branch to obtain a bank statement each month, but did not request copies of the negotiated checks. When Mr. Smith did receive a statement in the mail, it included photocopies of checks drawn on his trust account, but he did not regularly review these checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\n<em>Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Beginning in at least 2009, Ms. Staley-Jackson regularly and systematically misappropriated funds from the firm\u2019s personal injury trust account by diverting checks drawn on that account payable to others or by fraudulently creating and cashing checks made payable to herself. During the first seven months of 2009, Ms. Staley-Jackson took checks made payable to Jason Carle, a chiropractor who had rendered services to Mr. Smith\u2019s clients. Ms. Staley-Jackson would forge Mr. Carle\u2019s endorsement, sign the check herself, and cash the check. She cashed approximately 15 checks payable to Mr. Carle for more than $34,000 from January to July 2009. After July 2009, Ms. Staley-Jackson was apparently able to create and cash checks drawn on the trust account that listed herself as the payee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties stipulated that, during the period from January 2009 through September 2012, Ms. Staley-Jackson misappropriated the proceeds of checks exceeding $600,000 in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\n<em>Deposit of Personal Funds into Attorney Trust Account</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s diversion of funds from the personal injury trust account resulted in insufficient funds in that account to cover the purposes for which the funds had been deposited. When Mr. Smith realized in 2010 that the personal injury trust account was short of funds, he attempted to compensate for the shortfall with personal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Mr. Smith deposited his own personal funds or placed borrowed funds into the trust account on five separate occasions from December 2010 through June 2012. On December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>1, 2010, Mr. Smith cashed out his personal retirement account and deposited that money ($85,900) into the personal injury trust account. On February 10, 2011, Mr. Smith obtained a $10,000 loan from his father and deposited it into the trust account. On April 18, 2011, Mr. Smith deposited into the trust account another loan from his father in the amount of $50,000. On March 5, 2012, Mr. Smith deposited into the trust account another $25,000 \u2014 this time a loan from his father-in-law. On June 21, 2012, Mr. Smith deposited $100,000 into the trust account, also obtained from his father-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The hearing judge found that these deposits belied any assertion that Mr. Smith was unaware of the serious deficiencies in the personal injury trust account \u2014 that it lacked sufficient funds to cover his existing fiduciary obligations to clients and third parties. In other words, Mr. Smith was aware for more than a year and a half that his personal injury trust account at SunTrust Bank was out of trust. However, as the hearing judge found, his \u201cpersistent failure over a period of almost four years to comply with the trust account record-keeping requirements\u201d of the Maryland Rules meant that he was unable to detect the source of the shortfall and enabled Ms. Staley-Jackson \u201cto get away with her theft scheme for as long as she did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Eventually the influx of personal funds failed to compensate for the misappropriations. In September 2012, SunTrust Bank reported to Bar Counsel an overdraft of Mr. Smith\u2019s trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\n<em>Late Payments to Medical Providers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">In many of Mr. Smith\u2019s personal injury cases, the client and Mr. Smith signed an undertaking requested by a medical provider who had treated the client in which they agreed that Mr. Smith would pay fees owed to the provider directly from any settlement proceeds that he received on behalf of the client. During the time that Ms. Staley-Jackson was misappropriating funds from the trust account, these payments were made late, or sometimes not at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>For example, in July 2010, Mr. Smith deposited a personal injury settlement check in the amount of $4,000 for the benefit of his client Teonka Young. On August 5, 2010, Ms. Young signed a settlement disbursement sheet that listed a disbursement of $625 to New Carrollton Therapy, a medical provider that had treated Ms. Young. Ms. Young received her portion of the settlement. However, a check payable to New Carroll-ton Therapy for the benefit of Ms. Young was not issued until April 17, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">On March 31, 2011, Mr. Smith deposited a settlement check for the benefit of his client Robert Mayo in the amount of $7,300. On May 26, 2011, Robert Mayo signed a settlement disbursement sheet that listed disbursements of $1,216.50 to Chris Brannigan, an attorney, and $2,500 to Alpha Health Center-Oxon Hill. A check for Mr. Mayo\u2019s portion of the settlement was issued on May 25, 2011. However, the checks payable to Mr. Brannigan and Alpha Health Center-Oxon Hill were not issued until 10 months later, on March 9, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">On March 31, 2011, Mr. Smith deposited a personal injury settlement check in the amount of $15,500 for the benefit of client Robin Mayo. In September 2011, Mr. Smith provided Robin Mayo with a settlement disbursement sheet that listed a disbursement of $5,305 to Alpha Health Center. Ms. Mayo received her portion of the settlement on September 23, 2011. A check payable to Alpha Health Center for the benefit of Robin Mayo was not issued until April 3, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Mr. Smith testified that he would not have sent out these payments in March and April 2012 without first checking his computer program\u2019s accounts to ensure he had not already paid these medical providers. However, Mr. Smith did not check the client files, which were then located in Ms. StaleyJackson\u2019s house, or examine his bank statements. Instead, he talked with Mr. Staley-Jackson regarding the discrepancy and relied on her information.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Beginning in the late summer of 2011, James Bolger, a collection agent for several chiropractor facilities, began to call Mr. Smith to alert him about unpaid bills owed to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>facilities by Mr. Smith\u2019s clients. When Mr. Smith was unresponsive, Mr. Bolger filed several complaints with the Commission regarding his inability to obtain payment from Mr. Smith on the unpaid medical bills. After Mr. Bolger filed complaints with the Commission, Mr. Smith issued ten checks in March and April 2012 to various medical providers represented by Mr. Bolger. Mr. Smith was aware that his trust account did not contain the necessary funds to pay the amounts due and obtained the $25,000 loan from his father-in-law in March 2012 to help cover the deficit.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>Discovery of the Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Following notice in September 2012 from SunTrust Bank that he had an overdraft on his trust account, Mr. Smith discovered that the bounced checks had been payable to Ms. Staley-Jackson. Mr. Smith then retrieved his client files from Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s home on October 4, 2012, and shortly thereafter fired Ms. Staley-Jackson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\n<em>Unauthorized settlements and diversion of proceeds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Several complaints received by the Commission concerning Mr. Smith revealed a pattern of delegation to Ms. StaleyJackson, settlement of claims by her without the client\u2019s knowledge, and the diversion of the settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\n<em>\u2014Orin H. Thomas, Jr.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Mr. Smith represented Orin H. Thomas, Jr. on a contingent fee basis with regard to a personal injury claim arising out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on September 1, 2006. On August 27, 2009, Mr. Smith filed a complaint on behalf of Mr. Thomas in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The complaint named two defendants, Joy Felicia Lee, who was insured by Allstate, and Mr. Thomas\u2019s own insurance carrier, Metlife Auto &amp; Home Insurance Company, later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>amended to name Metropolitan Group Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cMetropolitan\u201d) with respect to under-insured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Following a settlement with Allstate for the policy limits, a check in the amount of $50,000 issued by Allstate and payable to \u201cEarl Smith, Esquire &amp; his client, Or\u00edn Thomas\u201d was deposited into Mr. Smith\u2019s attorney trust account on October 13, 2009. On November 12, 2009, Mr. Smith issued a check drawn on his trust account and payable to Bryan &amp; Smith, P.C. representing a partial attorney\u2019s fee payment. Mr. Smith did not inform Mr. Thomas that this fee disbursement was made and did not provide Mr. Thomas with a written settlement disbursement statement. Mr. Smith testified that he wrote checks to medical providers and lien holders on Mr. Thomas\u2019 behalf; but these checks were somehow converted into checks payable to Ms. Staley-Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">On January 28, 2010, Mr. Smith filed a stipulation of voluntary dismissal as to Ms. Lee following the settlement with Allstate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In October 2010, more than a year after depositing the settlement check from Allstate, Mr. Smith first issued a check from the settlement proceeds to Mr. Thomas for $3,000. From October 2010 to June 2012, Mr. Thomas received six checks from Mr. Smith, totaling $13,200. Mr. Thomas received no other disbursements from the settlement proceeds of $50,000. Mr. Smith testified that he did not distribute the remaining proceeds from the Allstate settlement because he expected there to be additional liens. Mr. Smith did not respond to Mr. Thomas\u2019 repeated requests for an accounting and for information regarding the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">After the settlement with Allstate, the claim against Mr. Thomas\u2019 own insurance company, Metropolitan, remained pending in the circuit court. On February 24, 2011, Metropolitan filed a motion to compel discovery based on Mr. Smith\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>failure to respond to discovery requests. Mr. Smith neither responded to the motion nor filed any discovery responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Mr. Thomas\u2019 case was scheduled for a pretrial conference on May 3, 2011. Mr. Smith did not appear for the pretrial conference and the court dismissed Mr. Thomas\u2019 case with prejudice. Mr. Smith testified that he did not appear for the pretrial conference because he never received the scheduling order or the discovery requests, and because he did not know that Metropolitan had been served. Instead, he thought negotiations (as conducted by Ms. Staley-Jackson) were ongoing. Mr. Smith knew of the dismissal of Mr. Thomas\u2019 claim against Metropolitan, but did not inform Mr. Thomas that his case had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>\u2014Terry Hardy and the Hardy children</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Mr. Smith represented Terry Hardy and his two minor children, Terry Hardy Jr. and Deja Hardy, in a personal injury matter following a motor vehicle accident that occurred on August 26, 2009. The representation was on a contingent fee basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Without Mr. Hardy\u2019s knowledge or consent, Ms. StaleyJackson negotiated a settlement for Mr. Hardy and his daughter, Deja Hardy. On March 2, 2011, Mr. Smith picked up two settlement checks from the Silver Spring office of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. One check was payable to \u201cTerry D. Hardy &amp; Earl A. Smith, his attorney\u201d in the amount of $7,000. The second check was payable to \u201cTerry D. Hardy, as parent and natural guardian of Deja Hardy, a minor, &amp; Earl A. Smith, his attorney\u201d in the amount of $3,600. Mr. Smith personally deposited both checks into his trust account on March 2, 2011. No settlement was negotiated or received on behalf of Terry Hardy, Jr. A signature purporting to be Mr. Hardy\u2019s appeared on the back of both checks, although Mr. Hardy was not aware of either check and had not authorized anyone to sign his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Neither Mr. Hardy nor his children received any of the settlement proceeds. Mr. Smith did not create or provide settlement disbursement sheets to Mr. Hardy and he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>create client matter records for the funds deposited in trust. Mr. Smith was not responsive to Mr. Hardy\u2019s telephone calls and requests for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\n<em>\u2014Sharon Hardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Mr. Smith also represented Sharon Hardy, Terry Hardy\u2019s wife, in connection with a personal injury claim following a separate motor vehicle accident that occurred on September 1, 2009. Without Mrs. Hardy\u2019s knowledge or consent, Ms. Staley-Jackson negotiated a settlement of her claim. On May 25, 2011, a check from Progressive Insurance Company payable to Mrs. Hardy and Bryan &amp; Smith, P.C. in the amount of $6,007 was deposited into Mr. Smith\u2019s trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Mrs. Hardy never received any of the settlement proceeds. Mr. Smith did not generate or provide a settlement disbursement sheet to Mrs. Hardy, and did not create a client matter record for her funds deposited in trust. Mr. Smith was not responsive to Mrs. Hardy\u2019s telephone calls and voicemails.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\n<em>\u2014Sheila Matthews</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Mr. Smith represented Sheila Matthews regarding a personal injury claim on a contingent fee basis following a motor vehicle accident that occurred on February 16, 2011. On December 8, 2011, Mr. Smith filed a civil complaint on behalf of Ms. Matthews in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Prince George\u2019s County. The complaint named two defendants, Oscar Tyler, who was insured by Bankers Independent Insurance, and Tiffany Johnson, who was insured by ELCO Administrative Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Without Ms. Matthews\u2019 consent or knowledge, Ms. StaleyJackson presented written settlement demands and eventually negotiated a settlement with ELCO Administrative Services for $1,600 in exchange for a release. On June 17, 2012, Ms. Staley-Jackson forged Ms. Matthews\u2019 signature on the release. On August 17, 2012, the settlement check in the amount of $1,600 payable to Sheila Matthews and Bryan &amp; Smith, P.C. was deposited into Mr. Smith\u2019s personal injury trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Ms. Matthews never received the settlement proceeds from the ELCO settlement. Mr. Smith did not provide a written settlement statement or other accounting of settlement funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">After ELCO settled, the claim against the second defendant, Oscar Tyler and Bankers Independent Insurance, remained pending in the District Court and was scheduled for trial on September 26, 2012. Ms. Matthews received notice from Mr. Smith\u2019s office that her case had been set for trial, but she had no further contact with Mr. Smith prior to the trial date. Mr. Smith testified that he was aware of the trial date but that he had been told by Ms. Staley-Jackson that the entire case had settled. Ms. Matthews appeared in court but Mr. Smith did not appear. When Ms. Matthews called Mr. Smith\u2019s office, she was told by Ms. Staley-Jackson that the entire case had been settled and that she should tell this fact to the court. Accordingly, Ms. Matthews informed the court that the case had settled, although in fact only a portion of her case had been settled. The court then dismissed the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Smith did not communicate with Ms. Matthews regarding the status of her case and had done no work to prepare for trial on September 26, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The hearing judge concluded that Mr. Smith committed all of the violations alleged by the Commission, except for the allegation relating to MLRPC 8.1(a), which the Commission had withdrawn. We review the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>\u2014 ie., without any special deference. Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(l). In the course of this review, we consider the exception filed by Mr. Smith. In particular, Mr. Smith excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he is responsible for the violation of several sections of MLRPC 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Mr. Smith\u2019s misconduct may be considered in three categories: (1) his failure to supervise Ms. Staley-Jackson; (2) his failure to comply with rules concerning his representation of his clients and the management of his personal injury attorney trust account; and (3) misconduct of Ms. Staley-Jackson for which Mr. Smith is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\n<em>A. Failure to Supervise Non-Lawyer Assistant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">At the heart of most of the alleged violations in this case is the unsupervised delegation of many of Mr. Smith\u2019s responsibilities to his legal assistant. That unsupervised delegation is intertwined with violations directly committed by Mr. Smith as well as the misconduct of his legal assistant for which he bears responsibility. Unsupervised delegation is also itself a violation of the MLRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\"><em>MLRPC 5.3(a) and (b) </em>\u2014 Supervision <em>of Non-Lawyer Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">MLRPC 5.3(a) and (b) require attorneys to take certain steps to ensure that non-lawyer employees act consistently with the lawyer\u2019s ethical responsibilities. MLRPC 5.3(a) requires that an attorney with managerial responsibilities in a firm \u201cmake reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the [non lawyer\u2019s] conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer.\u201d MLRPC 5.3(b) requires attorneys with direct supervisory authority over a nonlawyer to make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to ensure that employee\u2019s conduct is in fact compatible with the attorney\u2019s professional responsibilities. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 373-74, 872 A.2d 693 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Instead of establishing reasonable measures to ensure that Ms. StaleyJackson\u2019s conduct complied with his ethical obligations, Mr. Smith delegated to Ms. Staley-Jackson broad authority to act on his behalf with little supervision \u2014 such as permitting Ms. Staley-Jackson to negotiate with insurance companies and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>obtain consent from clients to settle. He apparently relied on Ms. Staley-Jackson to run his practice with little to no supervision or effort to ensure that she actually performed the tasks delegated to her in a manner consistent with his ethical obligations. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Ficker, </em>349 Md. 13, 24, 706 A.2d 1045 (1998) (attorney was not responsible for employee\u2019s misconduct under MLRPC 5.3(c)(2) because, upon discovery of the misconduct the attorney took immediate remedial measures by stopping the misconduct, docking the employee\u2019s pay, and refunding money to clients harmed by the employee\u2019s misconduct); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McDowell, </em>439 Md. 26, 44, 93 A.3d 711 (2014) (lawyer not responsible under MLRPC 5.3(c)(2) because the attorney took reasonable remedial action once he learned of the misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The hearing judge concluded that Mr. Smith was responsible for Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s misconduct pursuant to MLRPC 5.3(c), although the judge did not specify which subsection supported that conclusion. With respect to MLRPC 5.3(c)(1), the record does not indicate that Mr. Smith ordered the misconduct by Ms. Staley-Jackson. Nor is there clear and convincing evidence that he ratified specific misconduct \u2014 as opposed to failing to supervise her adequately. It appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>that the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion was based on MLRPC 5.3(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Under MLRPC 5.3(c)(2), four elements must be present to impute an employee\u2019s misconduct to an attorney: (1) misconduct by the employee that would violate the MLRPC if done by the attorney; (2) partnership status or a direct supervisory relationship; (3) the attorney\u2019s knowledge of the wrongdoing at a time when its consequences can be mitigated; and (4) the attorney\u2019s failure to take reasonable remedial action. There is no question that, had Ms. Staley-Jackson been an attorney, her conduct \u2014 including the intentional misappropriation of client funds, concealment of material facts, and misrepresentation \u2014 would have violated the MLRPC. Nor is there any question that Mr. Smith had the requisite supervisory relationship with Ms. Staley-Jackson. Thus, Mr. Smith\u2019s responsibility for her actions turns on the timing and extent of his knowledge of her misconduct and what, if any, remedial action he took.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\n<em>Mr. Smith\u2019s Knowledge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">As the hearing judge found, Mr. Smith had to know that there were serious deficiencies in his trust account by at least December 1, 2010, when he cashed out his personal retirement account and deposited $35,900 into the trust account to prevent the account from falling further out of trust. This knowledge was repeatedly confirmed as Mr. Smith found it necessary to deposit substantial personal funds into his trust account on four other occasions over the next 18 months.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, Mr. Smith was not ignorant of the fact that his trust account was being violated. <em>See Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 466, 671 A.2d 463 (accepting the hearing judge\u2019s finding that, although the attorney did not have specific knowledge of his employees\u2019 misconduct, he could not have been ignorant to the jeopardy facing his trust account because the attorney had exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>check -writing authority and the potential for a shortfall was apparent).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Second, as of March 2012, when Mr. Smith received complaints from Mr. Bolger regarding unpaid client bills, Mr. Smith also had to know that, despite the receipt of settlement proceeds by his office, various medical providers and third parties were not receiving payments promised from those proceeds. Mr. Smith also knew that he had presented settlement disbursement sheets to certain clients listing payments to medical providers that Mr. Smith now knew had not been made. For example, on August 6, 2010, Mr. Smith presented to his client Teonka Young a settlement sheet listing a disbursement of $625 to New Carrollton Therapy. As a result of Mr. Bolger\u2019s communications with Mr. Smith and Mr. Bolger\u2019s complaints to the Commission, Mr. Smith paid $625 to New Carrollton Therapy in April 17, 2012. He testified that he would not have made this payment without checking his computer program to make sure the payment had not been made previously. Similarly, the settlement disbursement sheets presented to Robert and Robin Mayo in May and September 2011 listed payments to medical providers that Mr. Smith knew, as of April 2012, had not been made. Nor could the discrepancies with respect to these clients be disregarded as isolated occurrences, as Mr. Bolger complained of nonpayment for multiple clients treated in multiple medical facilities. Thus, as of March and April 2012, Mr. Smith knew or should have known that, although he deposited settlement checks, disbursements to medical providers were not being made, and the disbursement statements presented to clients were not accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Thus, Mr. Smith had knowledge that his client trust fund was continually being invaded and that payments were not reaching their intended recipients, contrary to the representations made on settlement sheets presented to clients. However, there was no specific factual finding by the hearing judge that Mr. Smith knew Ms. Staley-Jackson was re-creating checks drawn on the trust account and making them payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>to herself or that she was creating false settlement disbursement sheets.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Mr. Smith\u2019s ignorance of the details of the invasion of his trust account and the diversion of funds did not absolve him from the obligation to take reasonable remedial measures with respect to his trust fund for several reasons. First, Ms. Staley-Jackson was Mr. Smith\u2019s only employee. Second, this is not a case where the fraud was well concealed; rather a review of the account statements and negotiated cheeks would have revealed multiple checks over a four-year period payable from the trust account to Ms. Staley-Jackson. For example, during December 2010, Ms. Staley-Jackson cashed six checks payable to herself drawn on the trust account, for a total of $20,010, almost completely offsetting Mr. Smith\u2019s deposit of personal funds made that same month. Third, the fraud would also have been detected had Mr. Smith been in contact with his clients, as any communication was likely to reveal that the clients had not received portions of the settlements to which they were entitled. Mr. Smith cannot avoid responsibility for the misconduct of his employee under MLRPC 5.3(c)(2) by remaining willfully ignorant of the employee\u2019s conduct in the face of clear indications of misconduct. <em>See Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 481, 671 A.2d 463 (concluding in the alternative that, even if the attorney did not have knowledge of the misconduct, he was responsible under MLRPC 5.3(c)(2) because, had the attorney exercised a reasonable degree of supervision over the employee, he would have discovered the employee\u2019s misconduct earlier).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Mr. Smith had sufficient knowledge of misconduct relating to the operating of his trust account that his obligation to take reasonable remedial measures under 5.3(c)(2) was triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\n<em>Reasonable remedial measures</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Despite Mr. Smith\u2019s knowledge that client funds in the trust account were being invaded as of December 2010, he failed to take any reasonable efforts to investigate why the trust account did not contain sufficient funds to cover his obligations and instead deposited personal funds into his trust account for more than a year. The failure to examine his client\u2019s files, check bank statements and negotiated checks, or otherwise attempt to investigate the deficiencies in his trust account amounts to a failure to take reasonable remedial measures. Moreover, despite knowledge that medical providers were not receiving payments, Mr. Smith did not attempt to obtain the relevant client files, which he knew were then located at Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s home, or otherwise investigate why a substantial number of payments had not been received by medical providers. Mr. Smith wrote checks to satisfy Mr. Bolger\u2019s concerns after Mr. Bolger complained to the Commission, but Mr. Smith apparently made little or no effort to investigate the cause of the problem or address the harm or potential harm to his clients. He made no efforts to confirm whether Ms. Staley-Jackson was sending out checks to appropriate payees, but continued to rely on Ms. Staley-Jackson to prepare settlement sheets, transmit checks, and inform him which checks should be written.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Had Mr. Smith taken reasonable remedial measures in March and April 2012 to investigate why medical providers were not paid, he likely would have noticed the numerous checks payable to Ms. Staley-Jackson and would have been able to mitigate or prevent the misappropriation of $100,000 from the trust account by Ms. Staley-Jackson between April and September 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Mr. Smith knew of the invasion of his trust account beginning in 2009 and would surely have learned the details of Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Staley-Jackson\u2019s misconduct had he taken reasonable remedial measures at that time, and might well have prevented most of the misappropriation of funds and other violations. But he failed to do so. Had Ms. Staley-Jackson been an attorney, her conduct would have violated multiple provisions of the MLRPC and Title 16 of the Maryland Rules. Most egregiously, that conduct would have violated MLRPC 8.4(c) and (d) for the intentional misappropriation of client trust funds, and the creation of materially false disbursement sheets. Mr. Smith had direct supervisory authority over Ms. Staley-Jackson. Under MLRPC 5.3(c)(2), Mr. Smith is responsible for her misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\n<em>Mr. Smith\u2019s Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Mr. Smith argues that he should not be held responsible for Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s intentional misappropriation of funds, false statements, or fraud that, if committed by an attorney, would amount to violations of MLRPC 8.4(c) and (d). Mr. Smith argues that, because the court must find intentional or willful conduct by an attorney for a violation of MLRPC 8.4(c) or (d), and because he did not intentionally violate those rules himself, he cannot be held responsible for violations of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Even assuming Mr. Smith is correct that an attorney can never violate MLRPC 8.4(c) or (d) except through the attorney\u2019s own intentional misconduct, prior cases that refer to the necessity of intentional conduct were addressing direct responsibility.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> MLRPC 5.3(c)(2) imposes responsibility on the attorney for failing to take appropriate action once the attorney has knowledge of an employee\u2019s misconduct. In the context of the attorney\u2019s responsibility under MLRPC 5.3(c)(2), it is the attorney\u2019s knowledge and failure to take reasonable remedial actions that imposes responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Mr. Smith also argues that, because Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s conduct was criminal and because he could not have foreseen such intentional wrongdoing, he should not be held responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>for it. This Court has not adopted such a distinction. <em>See Johnson, </em>409 Md. at 507, 976 A.2d 245 (imputing a violation of MLRPC 8.4(c) to an attorney under 5.3(c)(1) based on the intentional misconduct of an employee that resulted in the submission of a false statement). Nor would such a distinction serve the purpose of the rule, which is to ensure that attorneys take prompt remedial action once misconduct by a subordinate is discovered. We overrule Mr. Smith\u2019s exception and conclude that he can be held responsible for the intentional misconduct of Ms. Staley-Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">As in many attorney discipline cases, at this stage of the proceeding, the essential facts are no longer a matter of dispute and the legal determinations are either obvious or f\u00edne points with relatively little effect on the ultimate outcome. Our primary function is to fashion a sanction appropriate to the facts and the violations. As always, our purpose is \u201cnot to punish the errant lawyer but rather to protect the public, to maintain the integrity of the legal profession and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Webster, </em>348 Md. 662, 678, 705 A.2d 1135 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Bar Counsel argues for disbarment. Mr. Smith counters that his misconduct, although negligent, was not intentional and that the appropriate sanction is a suspension that allows for reinstatement \u201cafter a reasonable period of time.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">In determining the appropriate sanction, this Court considers the answers to four questions derived from the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions: </em>(1) What ethical duty was violated? (2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state? (3) What was the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the misconduct? and (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Are any aggravating or mitigating factors present?<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Taylor, </em>405 Md. 697, 720, 955 A.2d 755 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\n<em>Nature of ethical duties violated</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Mr. Smith failed to comply with the rules governing attorney trust accounts with the result that he failed to carry out his fiduciary obligation to his clients and his promises to third parties to maintain funds in trust and to disburse funds promptly. Mr. Smith also failed his clients in delegating large parts of his practice to his lay assistant without supervision, failing to communicate with his clients, and failing to stay abreast of his cases. The apparent abandonment of his practice to his assistant compromised his ability to fulfill the ethical duties that govern the practice of law. These are serious lapses.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\n<em>State of mind</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The hearing judge did not find that Mr. Smith acted with malicious intent, and the record does not suggest that he did. But the hearing judge did find that Mr. Smith had reason to know his trust account was being invaded. Moreover, Mr. Smith\u2019s blanket delegation of authority to Ms. Staley-Jackson to communicate with clients, negotiate settlements, sign pleadings and other court papers, obtain client consent for settlements, and transmit and cash checks without adequate supervision relinquished his role and obligations under the disciplinary rules and was, at best, gross negligence. For example, when it became evident that his trust account was being invaded and payments were not being received by the appropriate payees, he was slow to investigate, to the detriment not only of his clients and the third party payees, but also of his own financial well-being as well. In attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>make the trust account whole with family loans and out of his own pocket without conducting a thorough audit of the account, he delayed discovery of Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s defalcation and effectively facilitated her final theft of funds. We need not pinpoint where along the spectrum between gross negligence and knowing misconduct<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> he ultimately landed to conclude that his state of mind, while perhaps not evil, was not innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\n<em>Extent of injury to clients and others</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Mr. Smith\u2019s misconduct resulted in foregone claims, monetary injury to his clients, and delayed payments to third parties. A court dismissed with prejudice claims brought on behalf of Ms. Matthews and Mr. Thomas. Ms. Matthews, Mr. and Mrs. Hardy and the Hardys\u2019 daughter had their cases settled without their knowledge. The Hardys and Ms. Matthews never received proceeds from settlements to which they were entitled. Mr. Thomas intermittently received only a portion of the settlement in his case. Multiple medical providers were not paid fees to which they were entitled for months after Mr. Smith had received settlement proceeds out of which he and his clients had agreed payment would be made. Ironically, on the record before us, it appears that Mr. Smith and his family members may have incurred the greatest monetary loss as a result of his misguided efforts to shore up his trust account with personal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\n<em>Aggravating and mitigating factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Mr. Smith\u2019s neglect as to his trust account and his clients constitutes a \u201cpattern of misconduct\u201d that is an aggravating factor. <em>See Kremer, </em>432 Md. at 340, 68 A.3d 862. The fact that Mr. Smith is an experienced attorney with more than 30 years in the practice of law also counts against him as an aggravating factor. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fader, </em>431 Md. 395, 435-37, 66 A.3d 18 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>As the hearing judge found, there are mitigating factors present. This was the first disciplinary proceeding initiated against Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith cooperated with Bar Counsel and took responsibility for his failure to manage his trust account and to supervise Ms. Staley-Jackson. He also admitted to most of the violations charged by the Commission. The hearing judge found that Mr. Smith did not receive any personal benefit from Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s fraud and that he had no knowledge of criminal activity. It also appears to be undisputed that Mr. Smith is very active in his community as a leader in youth activities and as a volunteer in a local band that gives charitable performances.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">We also note that Mr. Smith made an effort to rectify some of the consequences of Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s misappropriations and his own misconduct by trying to make the trust account whole out of his own pocket. This factor cuts both ways, however. Restitution of a loss caused by misconduct is what we would want of anyone in his place \u2014 and too few do.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But the manner in which Mr. Smith made this restitution violated Maryland Rule 16-607, delayed the notice of the shortfall to the Bar Counsel,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and had the effect of extending the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Mr. Smith\u2019s conduct evidences an inexcusable pattern of neglect with respect to the representation of several clients and the management of his trust account. It is this pattern of neglect towards the interests of his clients, the failure to conduct a reasonable investigation into his accounts and client files once he had notice of misconduct, and the significant harm to clients that warrants disbarment in this case. This Court has disbarred attorneys in prior cases involving a pattern of neglect of clients, even when there were no prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>disciplinary actions against the attorney. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 293, 793 A.2d 535 (2002); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dominguez, </em>427 Md. 308, 327, 47 A.3d 975 (2012); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lara, </em>418 Md. 355, 365, 14 A.3d 650 (2011); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Faber, </em>373 Md. 173, 183, 817 A.2d 205 (2003). Moreover, under MLRPC 5.3(c)(2), Mr. Smith is responsible for Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s misappropriation of client funds and her misrepresentations to conceal her fraud even though he did not himself intentionally misappropriate client funds or deceive clients. Given the volume and severity of Mr. Smith\u2019s misconduct, including the resulting misappropriation of client funds and concealment of information from clients, the factors found in mitigation do not warrant a lesser sanction than disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">It is so Ordered; Respondent Shall Pay All Costs as Taxed by the Clerk of the Court, Including Costs of All Transcripts, Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-76KB), for Which Sum Judgment is Entered in Favor of the Attorney Grievance Commission Against Earl Americus Smith, III.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\">. Joseph M. Bryan, the other named member of Bryan &amp; Smith, P.C., retired from the practice of law and had no involvement with Mr. Smith or the firm during the time relevant to these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\">. In the record, Ms. Staley-Jackson is referred to variously as Dawn M. Staley, Dawn M. Jackson, or Dawn Staley-Jackson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">. The record does not indicate how Ms. Staley-Jackson was able to create checks with her own name as the payee. Mr. Smith testified that he would cut checks by using a computer software program that printed each check after he input the payee's name and the amount. According to Mr. Smith, he was the only one who knew the password for the computer program, and there had been no duplicate orders of blank checks. Mr. Smith testified that he failed to notice the fraud because Ms. Staley-Jackson created checks payable to herself for the exact amount due to an actual client or third party, ensuring that the balance noted in the computer program would match the balance in his trust account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\">. Mr. Smith reported Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s misappropriation to the police and obtained the assistance of the Calvert County Sheriff's Office in retrieving his files from her. Criminal charges were initiated against her in the District Court in Prince George\u2019s County. Those charges were apparently dismissed. We were informed at oral argument that a criminal investigation remains open.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">. The Commission did not allege, and the hearing judge did not find, that Mr. Thomas' case against Ms. Lee was settled without Mr. Thomas' consent or knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\">. After terminating Ms. Staley-Jackson, Mr. Smith filed a motion to vacate the dismissal of Ms. Matthews\u2019 case, which was granted. However, Ms. Matthews later discharged Mr. Smith as her attorney and later elected to voluntarily dismiss her case as to both defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b419-11\">. There are some exceptions. Under Maryland Rule 16-607(b)(l), an attorney may deposit personal funds to satisfy bank fees or minimum balance requirements, as well as funds expected to be advanced on behalf of a client prior to reimbursement by the client. Funds that belong to both the client and the attorney may be deposited in the trust account, but the portion belonging to the attorney must be withdrawn when the attorney becomes entitled to them. Maryland Rule 16-607(b)(2). None of these exceptions pertain to the violations alleged in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b422-5\">. In contrast, there is not clear and convincing evidence to find that Mr. Smith knew of the settlements but intentionally concealed the existence of the settlements from the Hardys or Ms. Matthews. Similarly, the record does not show that, at the time Mr. Smith presented clients with settlement disbursement sheets, he knew that the representations on the settlement disbursement sheets were false. Thus, he did not make an intentionally false statement in violation of MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">. At the hearing, Mr. Smith testified that he believed the deposits of personal funds in the trust account were necessary to offset \u201coperating expenses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">. Mr. Smith may not have had specific knowledge of every aspect of Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s scheme. For example, Mr. Smith did not seem to be aware that Ms. Staley-Jackson fraudulently settled claims without the client\u2019s knowledge or consent, forged client signatures on releases, or concealed the receipt of settlement funds from clients. Although his ignorance of her conduct is itself a violation of his duty to supervise under MLRPC 5.3(a)-(b), <em>see </em>Part II.A of this opinion above, there is not clear and convincing evidence to demonstrate that Mr. Smith had knowledge of this aspect of Ms. Staley-Jackson\u2019s scheme or that he was willfully blind to her misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b430-9\">. <em>See </em>pp. 375-76, 116 A.3d at 991-92 above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">.
