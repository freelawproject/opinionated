We granted separate petitions for certiorari in <em>Woznicki v. GEICO Gen. Ins., </em>439 Md. 694, 98 A.3d 233 (2014) and <em>Morse v. Erie Ins. Exch, </em>439 Md. 694, 98 A.3d 233 (2014), to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">(1) Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it held that, as a matter of law, the UM carrier did not waive its right to receive written notice of a pending settlement with the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier where there was unequivocal testimony from Petitioner\u2019s counsel that he received oral consent to settle from a UM carrier claims representative?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">(2) Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it held that the uninsured motorist (UM) carrier did not bear the burden of proving prejudice arising from Petitioners\u2019 failure to give written notice of the pending settlement with the tortfeasors\u2019 insurance carrier?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">As explained in greater detail below we shall answer each of the questions in the negative and affirm the respective judgments of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AbL\">A. Jessica N. Woznicki</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Woznicki\u2019s dispute with GEICO arises out of injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision between Woznicki and James Bowman Houston (\u201cHouston\u201d), which occurred on November 12, 2010. Woznicki was struck, while operating an automobile in Cecil County, after Houston failed to yield the right-of-way while making a turn. It is undisputed that the accident was caused entirely by the negligence of Houston.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>At the time of the accident, Houston was insured by Nationwide Insurance Company (\u201cNationwide\u201d) under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy which carried a liability limit of $20,000. Woznicki was covered by a motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued by GEICO.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the insurance policy, GEICO provided uninsured/underinsured motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) coverage of $300,000. As a condition to UM coverage under the GEICO policy, Woznicki was required to notify GEICO of any settlement offer which would exhaust the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance policy limits and obtain GEI-CO\u2019s consent to settle prior to accepting any such settlement with the tortfeasor. For a discussion of the policy language see <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">As a result of the injuries sustained during the accident, Woznicki asserted a claim against Houston, through her then-counsel, Ben T. Castle (\u201cCastle\u201d), a Delaware attorney. Nationwide offered to settle all claims for $20,000 \u2014 Houston\u2019s liability policy limit \u2014 in exchange for a release of all claims against Nationwide and Houston at some time in March, 2011. In a letter dated March 29, 2011, Nationwide wrote to Castle stating \u201c[t]he enclosed Release of All Claims document confirms our settlement with you/your client.\u201d On the same day, Castle sent a letter to the GEICO claims adjuster handling the matter, Ms. Rebecca Davis, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">At this time it appears that the driver of the car that caused the accident injuring Ms. Woznicki, James Houston, has only limited liability coverage through Nationwide Insurance Company. We will provide more information as it becomes available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The letter does not mention the Nationwide settlement offer letter received by Castle on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Central to the dispute between Woznicki and GEICO before this Court, Castle contacted GEICO by phone at some point on or about July 7, 2011,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and obtained, what Castle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Woznicki characterize as GEICO\u2019s oral consent to settle without prejudice to any potential UM claim against GEICO. Castle, who was unable to reach Ms. Davis, the claims adjuster assigned to Woznicki\u2019s case, could not recall who he spoke with about the matter. Castle only remembered that the person was a woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">By letter dated July 7, 2011, Woznicki executed a Release of all claims against Houston. The same day, Castle wrote to GEICO, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">The tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier, Nationwide, has a limited bodily injury liability policy of $20,000 and has tendered those limits to the injured driver, Jessica Woznicki. We are writing to request GEICO\u2019s consent to acceptance of the settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">Enclosed for your file is a copy of the Nationwide Policy insuring tortfeasor, James B. Houston, and the Release in exchange for the $20,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">GEICO responded on August 15, 2011, denying \u201cany and all Underinsured Motorist (UIM) coverage to [Woznicki] ... because [Woznicki] failed to obtain our consent to settle, which is required by both [\u00a7 19-511 of the Insurance Article] and [Section IV of] the policy contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Woznicki, represented by new counsel, filed a Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial against GEICO on April 8, 2012, for breach of the insurance policy. Woznicki sought to hold GEICO liable for damages in excess of the $20,000 she received from Nationwide. After filing its answer, GEICO moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Woznicki was precluded from receiving UM benefits under the insurance policy because she failed to obtain GEICO\u2019s consent to settle as required by Maryland law and the insurance policy. Following a hearing on the matter, the trial judge granted GEICO\u2019s motion. Judge J. Frederick Price explained from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">It\u2019s clear and undisputed that Section 19-511 was not complied with. In other words, there is \u2014 the plaintiffs attorney did not comply with that section. And that\u2019s also refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>enced \u2014 incorporated into the policy; therefore, the terms of the policy were not complied with. That\u2019s undisputed, I believe. But the court finds that there could be a question of waiver. And I believe that these matters could be waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">The question then arises is does the vague reference to a telephone conversation constitute \u2014 or viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, does that constitute sufficient evidence to be material in a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">And quite simply, the court finds that under the facts of this case that that reference to a telephone call, with nothing more than has been put forth today, does not constitute sufficient evidence to be material, to affect the decision. The Court of Special Appeals upheld the decision of the trial</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW8\">court. <em>Woznicki v. GEICO Gen. Ins. Co., </em>216 Md.App. 712, 90 A.3d 498 (2014). Specifically, the intermediate appellate court concluded that (1) an insurer could waive the requirements of Section 19-511 of the Insurance Article, (2) Woznicki failed to demonstrate a dispute as to material fact concerning whether GEICO had waived such requirements, and (3) GEICO was not required to demonstrate prejudice caused by Woznicki\u2019s breach of Section 19-511 or the insurance policy in order to deny her UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">B. Jeannine Morse</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Petitioner, Jeannine Morse (\u201cMorse\u201d), was injured in a motor vehicle collision on April 28, 2007 in New Castle, Delaware, when her vehicle was struck by a vehicle driven by Paula Smallwood (\u201cSmallwood\u201d). As a result of her injuries, Morse incurred medical expenses in excess of $22,500. At the time of the collision, Smallwood, the at-fault driver, carried automobile liability insurance with Nationwide Insurance Company (\u201cNationwide\u201d). Smallwood\u2019s policy with Nationwide included a single incident liability limit of $15,000. Also at the time of the collision, Morse maintained UM/UIM coverage through her motor vehicle insurance policy with Bespondent, Erie Insurance Exchange (\u201cErie\u201d), with bodily injury limits of $250,000. Morse\u2019s \u201cUninsured/Underinsured Motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ists Coverage Endorsement\u201d in her policy with Erie contained a condition that required Morse to notify Erie of any settlement offer which would exhaust the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance policy limits and to obtain Erie\u2019s consent to settle prior to accepting any such settlement with the tortfeasor. For a discussion of the policy language see <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">After the accident, Morse retained a Delaware attorney, Beverly A. Bove, Esq. (\u201cBove\u201d), to represent her. Upon demand from Bove, on October 18, 2008, Nationwide offered Morse its entire $15,000 policy limit in settlement of Morse\u2019s claims against Smallwood. Nationwide also sent Bove a notarized letter confirming that Smallwood had no other insurance polices applicable to Morse\u2019s claims. On October 14 or 15, 2008, Bove contacted by telephone a claims adjuster at Erie to report Morse\u2019s UM claim and the settlement offer from Nationwide. In a letter dated October 27, 2008, Bove sent Erie a copy of the Nationwide settlement offer letter. The letter to Erie was not sent by certified mail and was addressed to an incorrect P.O. box. Erie contends that it did not receive the letter until December 5 or 6, 2008. Meanwhile, Morse accepted Nationwide\u2019s settlement offer and signed a Release of All Claims on November 3, 2008. Accordingly, at the time of Morse\u2019s acceptance of Nationwide\u2019s settlement offer, Erie had not given its consent. Morse\u2019s attorney wrote on the release: \u201c[Njothing contained in this release waives, limits, or extinguishes any future claims for UM/UIM or PIP benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">On February 4, 2009, after accepting Nationwide\u2019s settlement offer, Bove first informed Erie by telephone that she had accepted Nationwide\u2019s settlement offer and signed a release.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Following the February 4th telephone conversation, Erie requested by phone and by mail a copy of the release on March 19 and 27, 2009, respectively. Erie did not receive a copy of the signed release until July 8, 2009, over seven months after it was executed, and nearly four months after Erie requested a copy of the release by letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">On November 5, 2009, Rucker wrote Bove to advise her that Erie had denied Morse\u2019s UM claim, because she failed to send written notice of the Nationwide offer and accepted the offer without Erie\u2019s written consent. On June 17, 2011, Morse sued Erie in the Circuit Court for Cecil County for breach of contract. A jury trial was held on April 22-28, 2013, following which the jury returned a verdict in favor of Erie, finding that Erie did not breach its contract with Morse. Morse appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In a reported opinion, a majority of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, concluding that the failure to comply with the consent to settle procedure contained in the insurance policy and \u00a7 19-511 does not trigger Maryland\u2019s prejudice rules, and that, for the purposes of \u00a7 19-110, obtaining consent to settle is not the equivalent of providing notice. <em>Morse v. Erie Ins. Exch., </em>217 Md.App. 1, 12, 90 A.3d 512, 518 (2014). The author of the dissenting opinion would have reversed, because, in that judge\u2019s view, construing the statute within the context and purpose of the statutory scheme, which is to maintain \u201cbalance between the insured\u2019s right to speedy recovery and the protection of the UM carrier\u2019s subrogation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>rights!,]\u201d leads to the conclusion that the insurer must show prejudice before disclaiming liability. 217 Md.App. at 37, 90 A.3d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Ultimately at issue in this case is the extent to which an individual\u2019s failure to comply with the settlement procedures outlined in Md.Code (1995, 2012 Repl.Vol., 2014 Supp.), \u00a7 19-511 (\u201cUninsured motorist Coverage-Settlement procedures\u201d) of the Insurance Article affects that individual\u2019s right to receive UM coverage from his or her UM carrier.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, in reaching our conclusion, we must consider two sections of the Insurance Article. Under \u00a7 19-511:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">(a) If an injured person receives a written offer from a motor vehicle insurance liability insurer or that insurer\u2019s authorized agent to settle a claim for bodily injury or death, and the amount of the settlement offer, in combination with any other settlements arising out of the same occurrence, would exhaust the bodily injury or death limits of the applicable liability insurance policies, bonds, and securities, the injured person shall send by certified mail, to any insurer that provides uninsured motorist coverage for the bodily injury or death, a copy of the liability insurer\u2019s written settlement offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">(b) Within 60 days after receipt of the notice required under subsection (a) of this section, the uninsured motorist insurer shall send to the injured person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">(1) written consent to acceptance of the settlement offer and to the execution of releases; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">(2) written refusal to consent to acceptance of the settlement offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">(c) Within 30 days after a refusal to consent to acceptance of a settlement offer under subsection (b)(2) of this section, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the uninsured motorist insurer shall pay to the injured person the amount of the settlement offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">(d) (1) Payment as described in subsection (c) of this section shall preserve the uninsured motorist insurer\u2019s subrogation rights against the liability insurer and its insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">(2) Receipt by the injured person of the payment described in subsection (c) of this section shall constitute the assignment, up to the amount of the payment, of any recovery on behalf of the injured person that is subsequently paid from the applicable liability insurance policies, bonds, and securities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">(e) The injured person may accept the liability insurer\u2019s settlement offer and execute releases in favor of the liability insurer and its insured without prejudice to any claim the injured person may have against the uninsured motorist insurer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">(1) on receipt of written consent to acceptance of the settlement offer and to the execution of releases; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">(2) if the uninsured motorist insurer has not met the requirements of subsection (b) or subsection (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">(f) Written consent by an uninsured motorist insurer to acceptance of a settlement offer under subsection (b)(1) of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">(1) may not be construed to limit the right of the uninsured motorist insurer to raise any issue relating to liability or damages in an action against the uninsured motorist insurer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">(2) does not constitute an admission by the uninsured motorist insurer as to any issue raised in an action against the uninsured motorist insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">Secondly, we consider whether \u00a7 19-110 (\u201cDisclaimers of coverage on liability insurance policies\u201d) applies to an insurer seeking to disclaim UM coverage to its insured for the insured\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 19-511. Section 19-110 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-14\">An insurer may disclaim coverage on a liability insurance policy on the ground that the insured or a person claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the benefits of the policy through the insured has breached the policy by failing to cooperate with the insurer or by not giving the insurer required notice only if the insurer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the lack of cooperation or notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We review issues of statutory construction <em>de novo. See Nesbit v. Gov\u2019t Emps. Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879, 883 (2004) (quoting <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002)) (\u201cWhen the trial court\u2019s order \u2018involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u2019 \u201d). It is well established that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology. In construing the plain language, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. Statutory text should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.... It is also clear that we avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">We analyze the contested provisions of Maryland\u2019s Insurance Article in the context of the statutory scheme and construe the plain language so that the various sections of the article do not conflict with one another.... In addition, the meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which it appears. As this Court has stated, because it is part of the context, related statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered. Thus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><em>Stickley v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>431 Md. 347, 358-59, 65 A.3d 141, 148 (2013) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">A. Maryland\u2019s Uninsured Motorist Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Prior to addressing the questions raised before this Court, some background is appropriate. The settlement procedures of \u00a7 19-511 must be understood in the context of Maryland\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage scheme, now codified at \u00a7\u00a7 19-509-19-511 of the Insurance Article. \u201cThis procedure was enacted in the context of a broader statutory goal to enable recovery for injured victims.\u201d <em>Brethren Mut. Ins. Co. v. Buckley, </em>437 Md. 332, 348, 86 A.3d 665, 674 (2014) <em>(\u201cBuckley II </em>\u201d). The General Assembly enacted Maryland\u2019s UM statute in 1972, which provided originally, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgQ\">\n<em>[EJvery policy of motor vehicle liability insurance issued, sold, or delivered in this State ... MAY contain coverage, in at least the amounts required under Section 7-101 of Article 66% of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1970 Replacement Volume and 1972 Supplement), for damages which the insured is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injuries sustained in an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such uninsured motor vehicle.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\"><em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. DeHaan, </em>393 Md. 163,171-72, 900 A.2d 208, 213 (2006) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Since its enactment, the UM statute has undergone several changes, the most salient of which was the decision of the Legislature, in 1975, to make UM coverage mandatory for all motor vehicle liability insurers issuing, selling, or delivering such policies in the State by replacing the term \u201cmay\u201d with \u201cshall.\u201d 1975 Laws of Maryland 562. UM coverage has steadily expanded in scope over the past several decades. Importantly, the General Assembly recognized \u201cuninsured motor vehicles\u201d as including \u201cunderinsured motor vehicles.\u201d 1981 Laws of Maryland 510 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Laws of Maryland 656 (permitting excess coverage insurers to offer UM coverage); 1989 Laws of Maryland 542 (requiring motor vehicle liability insurers to offer insureds, in writing, the option to purchase higher UM limits); 1992 Laws of Maryland 641 (requiring insurers to provide UM coverage \u201cequal to the amount of motor vehicle liability coverage\u201d); 1995 Laws of Maryland 515 (expanding the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicles\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">As this Court explained in <em>Erie Ins. Exch. v. Heffernan, </em>399 Md. 598, 925 A.2d 636 (2007):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">The purpose of the uninsured motorist statute is to provide minimum protection for individuals injured by uninsured motorists ... [the] statute creates a floor to liability not a ceiling. Consistent with the public policy of affording minimal protection for innocent victims, an insured can purchase \u201ca higher amount of uninsured motorist insurance which will become available when the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, as well his damages, exceed the liability coverage of the tortfeasor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">399 Md. at 612, 925 A.2d at 644 (citations omitted). <em>See also Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 737, 436 A.2d 465, 474 (1981) (citation omitted) (\u201cThe courts have repeatedly stated that the purpose of uninsured motorist statutes is \u2018that each insured under such coverage have available the full statutory minimum to exactly the same extent as would have been available had the tortfeasor complied with the minimum requirements of the financial responsibility Law.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Kritsings v.

Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">With respect to Petitioner Woznicki, we must first determine whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that GEICO, as a matter of law, did not waive its right to receive written notice of Woznicki\u2019s settlement offer from Nationwide under \u00a7 19-511 of the Insurance Article and Section IV of the GEICO insurance policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Prior to addressing whether GEICO <em>did </em>waive its rights, we must determine whether GEICO <em>could </em>waive such rights under \u00a7 19-511. At the outset, we note that there is no dispute that Woznicki failed to send written notice of the settlement offer and failed to obtain GEICO\u2019s written consent to settle. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the question of whether Woznicki complied with \u00a7 19-511 is a question separate and apart from whether GEICO could, and did, waive compliance. We conclude that, consistent with the underlying purpose of \u00a7 19-511, an insurer may waive strict compliance with the relevant provisions at issue \u2014 namely the insured\u2019s duty to send the insurer written notice of the pending settlement offer. We also conclude, as did the intermediate appellate court, that Woznicki failed to overcome GEICO\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Summary judgment was entered in favor of GEICO on the ground that Woznicki had not satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 19-511 or Section IV of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>Does \u00a7 19-511 Permit Waiver?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Under \u00a7 19-511(a), where an injured insured receives a settlement offer from a tortfeasor\u2019s motor vehicle liability insurer, \u201cand the amount of the settlement offer, in combination with any other settlements arising out of the same occurrence, would exhaust the bodily injury or death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>limits of the applicable liability insurance policy ... the injured person shall send by certified mail ... a copy of the liability insurer\u2019s written settlement offer\u201d to his or her UM carrier.

State, </em>332 Md. 511, 522, 632 A.2d 768, 773 (1993) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Tucker v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 295, 298, 598 A.2d 479, 481 (1991)). Although \u00a7 19-511 \u201cestablishes a settlement procedure to be followed when a claimant is injured by a party whose liability insurance limit is less than the claimant\u2019s uninsured motorist limits\u201d <em>Buckley II, </em>437 Md. at 348, 86 A.3d at 674 (quoting Senate Floor Report for S.B. 253 (1995)), \u00a7 19-511 is silent as to whether the various provisions may be waived by the parties involved.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In its brief before this Court, GEICO argues that, as a matter of law, neither an insurer nor an insured may waive the procedural requirements of \u00a7 19-511. In support of its contention, GEICO points to the plain language of the statute and the General Assembly\u2019s use of the term \u201cshall.\u201d GEICO further states that, as we pointed out in <em>Buckley II, </em>\u00a7 19-511 \u201cestablishes a settlement procedure to be followed.\u201d 437 Md. at 348, 86 A.3d at 674 (emphasis added) (quoting Senate Floor Report for S.B. 253 (1995)). This choice of language, GEICO argues, \u201cprovides [a] clear indication that the Maryland Legislature did not intend that the parties could waive the statutory requirements under Insurance Art., \u00a7 19-511.\u201d Ultimately, GEICO asserts that the decision of the intermediate appellate court would \u201cwreak havoc on Maryland\u2019s statutory insurance scheme\u201d by permitting parties to circumvent the plain language of numerous statutory provisions of the Insurance Article. Strict adherence to the statute\u2019s language, in GEI-CO\u2019s view, promotes the remedial nature of \u00a7 19-511 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>serves to better meet \u00a7 19-51 l\u2019s goals of protecting the insurer and its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Although the Legislature elected to use the term \u201cshall,\u201d we decline to hold, as a matter of law, that an insurer may not waive its right to receive written notice under \u00a7 19-511. To be sure, the statute states neither that it is waivable nor nonwaivable. Permitting an insurer and its insured to waive the written notice component of the statute, however, is clearly consistent with both the purpose of \u00a7 19-511 and Maryland\u2019s UM scheme in general. Waiver of the relevant provisions of \u00a7 19-511 in the context of the instant case is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s goal of expediting recovery for the innocent victim. <em>Buckley v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>207 Md.App. 574, 590, 53 A.3d 456, 465 (2012) <em>(\u201cBuckley I </em>\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>437 Md. 332, 86 A.3d 665 (2014) (\u201cThe purpose of the UM settlement scheme is to expedite settlement negotiations; not to prolong them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Section 19-511 was enacted primarily to remedy the standstill that occurred between the uninsured/underinsured tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer, unwilling to provide the injured victim the limits of the at-fault party\u2019s policy in the absence of a full release of all claims, and the injured victim\u2019s UM carrier, unwilling to provide a full release of all claims. <em>Buckley II, </em>437 Md. at 347, 86 A.3d at 673-74. This standoff between insurers acted to prevent the injured party from obtaining a prompt recovery. In other words, \u00a7 19-511 was enacted principally to promote prompt settlement and recovery for the victim. We do not see how permitting a waiver in the instant case would be contrary to the \u201cbroader statutory goal to enable recovery for injured victims.\u201d <em>Buckley II, </em>437 Md. at 348, 86 A.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Our decision does not suggest that an insurer or its insured may waive any provision of an insurance statute in the interest of convenience as GEICO argues. For instance, under our reasoning the parties could not \u201cagree for insurance to be issued at limits less than the statutorily required limits in exchange for lower premiums\u201d as GEICO suggests. Such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>waiver would be entirely inconsistent with the purpose of \u201cproviding] minimum protection for individuals injured by uninsured motorists[.]\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>399 Md. at 612, 925 A.2d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Apart from GEICO\u2019s reliance on the language of \u00a7 19-511, GEICO cites to several opinions of this Court and the Court of Special Appeals, which, in its view, demonstrate that \u201cwhere there are statutory or regulatory procedures that, by their very terms, delineate what parties \u2018shall\u2019 do, such directives are mandatory and cannot be waived or ignored.\u201d GEICO, for instance, relies on our decision in <em>Gorge v. State, </em>386 Md. 600, 873 A.2d 1171 (2005) to emphasize the \u201cconsequences of a failure to abide by statutorily-imposed procedures.\u201d In <em>Gorge, </em>this Court was asked to consider \u201cwhether [a defendant] may be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole without having received written notice of the State\u2019s intention to pursue that sentence [as required by Md.Code (2002, 2012 Repl.Vol., 2014 Supp.), \u00a7 2-203 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d).]\u201d 386 Md. at 610, 873 A.2d at 1177. Under CL \u00a7 2-203, \u201c[a] defendant found guilty of murder in the first degree may be sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole only if: (1) at least 30 days before trial, the State gave written notice to the defendant of the State\u2019s intention to seek a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Although the State in <em>Gorge </em>failed to demonstrate that it provided written notice to the defendant, it argued that oral notice \u2014 which defendant admitted to receiving more than 30 days before trial \u2014 was sufficient to meet the requirements of the statute. <em>Gorge, </em>386 Md. at 611, 873 A.2d at 1177. Alternatively, the State contended that the defendant had waived his right to receive written notice under the statute. <em>Id. </em>We held that the State\u2019s oral notice to defense counsel was insufficient to satisfy the requirements of CL \u00a7 2-203. As to the issue of waiver, however, we explicitly stated that \u201c[b]ecause the facts do not present themselves, however, we will not address whether [CL] \u00a7 2-203 contemplates permitting a waiver by a defendant of the requirements of the statute.\u201d <em>Gorge, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>386 Md. at 611-12 n. 2, 873 A.2d at 1178 n. 2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><em>Gorge </em>has little bearing on our decision in the instant case because we declined to address the issue of whether the statute at issue permitted a waiver. Instead, we focused upon whether the conduct of the State complied with the language of the relevant statute. That is not the issue presented in this case. Rather, Woznicki argues that GEICO permitted her to deviate from the statutory language. We also note that, while not expressly addressed by this Court in <em>Gorge, </em>our opinion at least suggests that the defendant could have waived compliance with the relevant statute if the appropriate facts presented themselves. <em>See Gorge, </em>386 Md. at 611-12 n. 2, 873 A.2d at 1178 n. 2 (\u201cInsofar as the State is making the additional argument that the defendant waived the requirements of the statute itself, we note that there is no evidence in this record to suggest that the defendant or his counsel, at least 30 days before trial, exercised such a waiver.\u201d). Our decision in <em>Gorge </em>does not suggest that, as a result of the Legislature\u2019s use of the words \u201conly if,\u201d we must necessarily conclude that a statute is non-waivable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">GEICO\u2019s reliance on <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Baptist, </em>185 Md.App. 56, 968 A.2d 638 (2009), is similarly misplaced. In <em>Baptist, </em>the intermediate appellate court considered, among other things, whether the trial court improperly ordered the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) to enroll appellee, Baptist, in the MVA\u2019s Ignition Interlock Program following Baptist\u2019s license suspension for driving under the influence. Baptist was advised of his responsibilities for enrollment \u2014 which would permit him to drive under an ignition-interlock restricted license in lieu of suspension \u2014 but nonetheless faded to complete the requirements within the statutorily proscribed time period of thirty days. 185 Md.App. at 72, 968 A.2d at 648. Indeed, Baptist missed the deadline by nearly one month. <em>Id. </em>Despite this failure, the trial court ordered the MVA to enroll Baptist in the program. 185 Md.App. at 63-64, 968 A.2d at 643. The Court of Special Appeals reversed, concluding that \u201cthe court had no authority to excuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Baptist\u2019s noncompliance [under the statute].\u201d 185 Md.App. at 72, 968 A.2d at 648. Moreover, the intermediate appellate court explained that permitting the trial court to waive Baptist\u2019s compliance with the statute would be in contravention of the Legislature\u2019s \u201c \u2018paramount purpose\u2019 ... to \u2018craft[ ] a regulatory scheme of expedient procedures that swiftly would impose penalties for drunk driving[.]\u2019 \u201d 185 Md.App. at 73, 968 A.2d at 649 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We fail to see the similarity between disallowing a trial court to waive an individual\u2019s failure to comply with a statute, which would contravene the Legislature\u2019s intent to impose penalties for drunk driving, as in <em>Baptist, </em>and an alleged waiver between an insurer and its insured, where such waiver would be consistent with the Legislative purpose of the statute, as in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Lastly, GEICO directs us to <em>Kennedy Temps. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>57 Md.App. 22, 468 A.2d 1026 (1984), in which the Court of Special Appeals addressed, among other things, whether a bid protestor\u2019s failure to comply with the protest regulations under the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) requiring bid protests to be in writing and filed within seven days, was excused by the alleged waiver by a procurement officer of the Comptroller. 57 Md.App. at 39-40, 468 A.2d at 1034-35. The intermediate appellate court noted, importantly, that the requirements imposed on bid protestors \u201cw[ere] not that of the Comptroller. [Instead, the regulation] was adopted by the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning, with the approval of the Governor and the Board of Public Works, and was imposed by those agencies upon the Comptroller\u2019s office.\u201d <em>Kennedy Temps., </em>57 Md.App. at 41, 468 A.2d at 1035. The Court of Special Appeals, in reaching its conclusion, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">Whatever the procurement officer\u2019s authority might be to waive a procedural regulation of the Comptroller, we find no authority in the law for him to waive a requirement externally imposed pursuant to clear statutory authority. Such a power would be inconsistent with the whole thrust and scheme of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>Id. </em>Apart from the factual difference between <em>Kennedy Temps, </em>and the instant case, <em>Kennedy Temps., </em>similar to <em>Baptist, </em>was based, in part, on the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s determination that waiver would be inconsistent with the purpose underlying the law. As outlined above, that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\n<em>Was Summary Judgment Appropriate?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Having determined that GEICO could have waived compliance with the relevant portions of \u00a7 19-511, we now address whether the trial court and Court of Special Appeals erred in holding, as a matter of law, that GEICO had not waived any requirements under \u00a7 19-511 or Section IV of the insurance policy. As we stated in <em>Butler v. S &amp; S P\u2019ship, </em>435 Md. 635, 665-66, 80 A.3d 298, 316-17 (2013):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">The question of whether a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper is a question of law. Pursuant to Md. Rule 2 \u2014 501(f), summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. To establish a genuine issue of material fact, a \u201cparty opposing summary judgment must do more than simply show there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. In other words, the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs claim is insufficient to preclude the grant of summary judgment; there must be evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">(citations omitted). Accordingly, we must determine whether Woznicki demonstrated the existence of \u201ca genuine dispute as to a material fact by proffering facts which would be admissible in evidence\u201d concerning the alleged waiver by GEICO to survive summary judgment. <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005, 1011 (1993). We agree with the Court of Special Appeals and conclude that there existed no dispute as to a material fact.

In some instances, however, the waiver, or lack thereof, may be so apparent that a court can make a determination as a matter of law. 421 Md. at 124, 25 A.3d at 984. <em>See also Myers, </em>391 Md. at 207, 892 A.2d at 531 (affirming grant of summary judgment because \u201c[no] rational trier of fact [could] conclude that appellants\u2019 [sole] statement^] ... standing alone, constituted an implied waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Central to the dispute between Woznicki and GEICO is the deposition testimony of Woznicki\u2019s former attorney, Castle, concerning the alleged telephone conversation between Castle and an unknown GEICO claims representative. On the one hand, Woznicki asserts that based on Castle\u2019s deposition testimony \u201cthere is [ ] <em>no question </em>that Mr. Castle received oral consent to settle.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Woznicki directs us to Castle\u2019s statement that \u201c[GEICO] told me [they needed] the Release and the evidence of the coverage and that they would grant their consent.\u201d This oral consent, Woznicki contends, \u201cwas sufficient to establish a waiver of the statutory and contractual requirements for written notice[.]\u201d On the other hand, GEICO avers that \u201cno rational trier of fact could conclude that GEICO orally provided [Woznicki] its consent to settle with the tortfeasor, or waived the provisions of its GEICO Policy or the requirements of Insurance Art., \u00a7 19-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>511.\u201d GEICO notes that it would \u201cstrain[ ] credulity to assert that [Woznicki\u2019s then-attorney] just happened to attempt to comply\u201d with \u00a7 19-511 where he was admittedly unaware of any such requirements. GEICO notes that Woznicki has relied upon an incomplete portion of Castle\u2019s deposition testimony. GEICO argues that the deposition testimony, when considered in its entirety, does not support a reasonable inference that GEICO waived any provision of \u00a7 19-511 or its insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Accepting the statements in Castle\u2019s deposition as true, nothing in the record supports a reasonable inference that GEICO waived compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 19-511 or Section IV of the insurance policy. Notably, Castle testified at his deposition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">[Counsel for GEICO]: Did, in fact, GEICO ever give you consent to settle [ ] Woznicki\u2019s claim against [ ] Houston who was insured by Nationwide?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">[Castle]: It was my understanding that they had, and it was done by telephone.

Whether I said has been settled or will be settled or we need your permission to settle \u2014 I don\u2019t think I said that, but I told them what the facts were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">[Counsel for GEICO]: Did GEICO ever tell you that it did not require written notification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">[Castle]: Only the conversation I referred to in which I asked them what they needed, and I was told the Release and the Declaration Page.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">[Counsel for GEICO]: But you would agree you were never told that you do not need to get written consent from GEICO?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">[Castle]: I don\u2019t recall ever being told that in so many words, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">Absent from Castle\u2019s testimony is any indication that GEI-CO informed Castle, or that Castle requested, that GEICO was waiving compliance with the relevant statutory and contractual provisions. That Castle did not request that GEICO waive the procedural requirements of \u00a7 19-511 and Section IV of the insurance policy is not unexpected given that he, admittedly, was unaware of any such requirements at the time of the conversation. Nor is there any indication that GEICO was actually aware that Woznicki intended to assert a claim for UM coverage against GEICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">Woznicki\u2019s argument rests upon the notion that GEICO, through an unknown claims representative, orally consented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the Nationwide settlement of the underlying bodily injury claim during the telephone conversation with Castle. We disagree with Woznicki that there is \u201cno question\u201d that Castle requested and received GEICO\u2019s consent to settle during the alleged phone call. Indeed, during deposition, Castle stated that \u201c[wjhether I said has been settled or will be settled or we need your permission to settle \u2014 I don\u2019t think I said that[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). As stated above, it is not entirely surprising that Castle failed to request GEICO\u2019s consent given that he was unaware of such requirements imposed on Woznicki.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Although Castle testified that it was his understanding that GEICO had consented to the settlement with Nationwide during the telephone conversation, we are left to speculate as to what was actually said by either individual during this conversation. Importantly, Castle admittedly was never told \u201cthat [he] d[id] not need to get written consent from GEICO\u201d prior to settling with Nationwide. Castle\u2019s subjective understanding of what occurred during the conversation lies in contrast to his subsequent correspondence with GEICO by mail. Particularly, on July 7, 2011, the same day Woznicki executed the Release, Castle wrote GEICO stating that \u201c[w]e are writing to request GEICO\u2019s consent to acceptance of the settlement.\u201d (Emphasis added). When confronted with this language, Castle testified that \u201cIf I read that letter the way I\u2019m thinking about it, is that I called, asked what information they needed. They told me the Release and the evidence of the coverage and that they would grant their consent.\u201d There is no indication in the record that this letter was simply confirming the conversation Castle had with the unknown GEICO representative. Furthermore, following GEICO\u2019s denial of UM coverage to Woznicki, Castle wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">Your letter of August 15, 2011 disclaiming GEICO\u2019s under-insured coverage for this loss surprised me. Cognizant of the notice requirement[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] I contacted your office and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>formed the person who took the call for you that the tortfeasor\u2019s carrier had tendered its limits of $20,000, and inquired what should be done to obtain GEICO\u2019s \u201cconsent.\u201d I was instructed to forward a copy of the declaration page for the tortfeasor\u2019s policy and a copy of the release. This was done by letter on July 7, 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">No rational trier of fact could conclude that Castle\u2019s sole statement that it was his understanding that he had obtained GEICO\u2019s consent, standing alone, constituted a waiver, express or implied, of the statutory or contractual requirements imposed on Woznicki. <em>Myers, </em>391 Md. at 207, 892 A.2d at 531. Castle, who was admittedly unaware of the requirements of \u00a7 19-511 of the Insurance Article or the GEICO policy, was unable to recall what he might have said to the unknown claims representative who was not handling Woznicki\u2019s claim, and was never informed that he did not need GEICO\u2019s written consent to settle. Given Castle\u2019s own testimony, it can hardly be said that the GEICO representative and Castle had \u201cmutual knowledge and acceptance ... of the non-conforming action.\u201d Hov<em>nanian, </em>421 Md. at 120, 25 A.3d at 982. Castle\u2019s subjective understanding of this conversation is simply not enough to establish a genuine dispute of material fact. To hold otherwise would permit a jury to impermissibly engage in speculation on the basis of a single unsubstantiated statement. <em>Segerman v. Jones, </em>256 Md. 109, 134, 259 A.2d 794, 806 (1969) (explaining that \u201ca jury should not be permitted to engage in speculation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Woznieki directs us to several out-of-state cases, in support of her argument that summary judgment is inappropriate under the facts here. Woznieki relies almost entirely upon <em>Swiderski v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>672 S.W.2d 264 (Tex.Ct.App.1984), noting that it \u201cis particularly instructive.\u201d In <em>Swiderski </em>the Court of Appeals of Texas held that a letter sent by the insurer to its insured was sufficient to create a factual issue as to whether the insurer waived compliance with the \u201cconsent to settle\u201d clause of its insurance contract, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>precluding summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 269-70. The letter at issue stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">\n<em>[PJlease provide with proper documentation when you settle with Dairyland Ins. Co. so that I can give consideration to the UIM (under-insured motorist coverage) possibility.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). This evidence, the Court held, \u201cwas sufficient to raise a fact issue of the material elements of waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Woznicki asserts that \u201cthe only material difference between the fact situation in <em>Swiderski </em>and that in the present case is that the claims representative\u2019s communications in <em>Swiderski </em>w[ere] in writing, while the communication at issue here was oral[.]\u201d We disagree and note that, unlike <em>Swiderski, </em>there is no record of what was actually said during the conversation at issue apart from Castle\u2019s subjective understanding of what the unknown GEICO representative informed him. Moreover, in the instant case, Castle admittedly never asked GEICO for their consent, or to waive the requirements of the statute or the contract. Furthermore, GEICO never specifically informed Castle that Woznicki did not need written consent to settle. We also note that Castle\u2019s own letters to GEICO belie his subjective understanding of the conversation. <em>Swiderski </em>does not save Woznicki from summary judgment where the only support for Woznicki\u2019s position is the equivocal statement of Castle concerning his subjective understanding of an undocumented conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">C. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">GEICO and Erie justify their disclaimer of coverage to Petitioners Woznicki and Morse respectively on the basis that Petitioners failed to obtain the insurers\u2019 consent to settle as required by the insurance policies and \u00a7 19-511 of the Insurance Article. There is no dispute that Woznicki and Morse failed to comply, substantially or otherwise, with \u00a7 19-511 and the consent to settle provisions at issue. Rather, Petitioners assert that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that a UM carrier is not required to demonstrate prejudice in order to deny UM coverage to its insured for the insured\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>failure to comply with the consent to settle provision of the insurance policy and \u00a7 19-511 of the Insurance Article. We must, therefore, consider whether the prejudice rules are triggered in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">As explained below, the prejudice rules arise from statute, <em>see </em>\u00a7 19-110, and common law, <em>see Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. 162, 879 A.2d 81 (2005). The prejudice rules apply where an insurer disclaims coverage as a result of the insured\u2019s noncompliance with a condition contained in the insurance policy requiring notice or cooperation. We conclude that noncompliance with \u00a7 19-511 and the liability policies\u2019 consent to settle provision is neither a failure to notify nor a failure to cooperate as contemplated by the prejudice rules. Therefore the instant cases fall outside of the ambit of the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\n<em>Pre-\u00a7 19-110 Common Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In addition to the duty to pay premiums, automobile insurance policies commonly require insureds, as a condition to the insurance policy, to both (1) promptly notify an insurer of any accident and, where suit is filed against the insured, promptly forward any suit papers served (the \u201cduty to notify\u201d) and (2) cooperate with the insurer during the investigation and subsequent defense or settlement of any claim brought against the insured (the \u201cduty to cooperate\u201d). <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. 106, 118-19, 767 A.2d 831, 838 (2001). Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 482 of Article 48A (now \u00a7 19-110), Maryland courts took two different approaches when determining whether an insured\u2019s noncompliance with the duty to notify or cooperate with his or her insurer relieved the insurer of its responsibilities. As explained by this Court in <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. v. McConnaughy, </em>228 Md. 1,179 A.2d 117 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">There [were] two main lines of authority in the country. One line takes the formalistic, technical view and holds that policy provisions for notice, forwarding of suit papers and cooperation are conditions precedent to liability by the insurer, and that a breach by the insured discharges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>insurer regardless of prejudice. Some courts so holding presume prejudice. The other line holds that the policy provisions are conditions subsequent and prejudice must be shown by the insurer, if it is to be absolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">228 Md. at 12, 179 A.2d at 122-23. \u201cAs a matter of Maryland common law, we did not appear to adopt either view completely.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. at 119, 767 A.2d at 838. \u201cRather ... we drew distinctions both between the requirements of notice and cooperation and between non-cooperation based on false statements made by the insured and noncooperation based on the insured\u2019s failure to attend depositions, hearings, or trial, or to assist in giving or obtaining evidence regarding the accident or claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">On the one hand, where the insured failed to give proper notice of an accident or promptly forward suit papers, we applied the formalistic \u201cno-prejudice\u201d approach. <em>See Watson v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>231 Md. 266, 189 A.2d 625 (1963). In <em>Watson, </em>the appellee, United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company (\u201cCompany\u201d) issued an automobile liability insurance policy to appellant, Watson, requiring Watson to provide the Company written notice of an accident \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d as a condition precedent to coverage under the policy. 231 Md. at 269, 189 A.2d at 626. The Company sought to deny coverage under the policy as a result of Watson\u2019s failure to provide prompt notice following an automobile accident. 231 Md. at 269-71, 189 A.2d at 626-27. In concluding that the Company could deny coverage as a result of Watson\u2019s failure to provide notice without a showing of prejudice, this Court began by noting that, under contract principles, the notice requirement at issue was a condition precedent \u201cthat must be performed before any obligation on the part of the assurer commences.\u201d 231 Md. at 271, 189 A.2d at 627. We rejected Watson\u2019s contention that the insurer must demonstrate prejudice prior to a disclaimer of liability, and emphasized that \u201c[t]his contention [was] not in accord with the Maryland decisions, nor with the weight of authority elsewhere in this county.\u201d 231 Md. at 272, 189 A.2d at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>On the other hand, where an insured failed to cooperate by providing false statements to the insurer, a showing of prejudice to the insurer was required prior to any disclaimer. <em>See McConnaughy, </em>228 Md. at 13, 179 A.2d at 123 (\u201cThe cooperation clause is included ... so that the insurance company will not be prejudiced in investigation and defense at trial.

Smith, </em>197 Md. 160, 164, 78 A.2d 461, 463 (1951) (\u201cIt is thus a well settled rule that to relieve an insurer of liability on the ground of lack of cooperation, discrepancies in statements made by the insured must be made in bad faith and must be material in nature and prejudicial in effect.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\n<em>\u00a7 19-110\u2019s Enactment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Following our decision in <em>Watson, </em>the Legislature enacted Md.Code Art. 48A, \u00a7 482, now codified at \u00a7 19-110 of the Insurance Article.

Through the enactment of \u00a7 482, the Legislature sought to abrogate the \u201cno-prejudice rule\u201d as articulated by this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>in <em>Watson, </em>which permitted insurers to disclaim liability to an insured where the insured failed to comply with his or her contractual duty to notify, which served as a condition precedent to the insurer\u2019s liability, irrespective of whether prejudice occurred. <em>Hearn, </em>242 Md. at 582-88, 219 A.2d at 824. <em>See also Allstate Ins.

Under the County\u2019s policy with the Trust, service of such notice is a condition precedent to coverage. <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins.

Trust, </em>388 Md. at 181, 879 A.2d at 92. Despite not fitting neatly into the confines of \u00a7 19-110, we held that, where the Trust attempted to disclaim coverage to its insured based on a violation of a condition requiring notice, \u201cthe Trust was required to show prejudice under the common law.\u201d 388 Md. at 169, 879 A.2d at 85. We explained that \u201c[i]n passing the [prejudice] statute, the Legislature apparently aimed to abrogate the common law [\u2018no-prejudice\u2019] rule as articulated in <em>Watson[.]\u201d </em>388 Md. at 181, 879 A.2d at 92-93. By enacting \u00a7 19-110 the Legislature \u201cannounced the public policy of this state that an insurer must show prejudice before disclaiming coverage based on the insured\u2019s breach of a notice provision.\u201d 388 Md. at 187, 879 A.2d at 96. Requiring the Trust to demonstrate prejudice in the context of a failure to notify was consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 19-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Although our holding implies that a broader class of \u201cinsurers\u201d than those defined under \u00a7 19-110 are required to show prejudice, <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust </em>was confined to a disclaimer based upon the failure to notify. 388 Md. at 187, 879 A.2d at 96-97. There is no suggestion that the reasoning of <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust </em>would apply outside of a disclaimer based upon the failure to notify or cooperate with the insurer. Therefore, to the extent <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust </em>recognized a change in the pre-\u00a7 19-110 \u201ccommon law\u201d rule, that change is confined to the same circumstances contemplated by \u00a7 19-110. <em>See also Sherwood Brands, Inc. v. Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>418 Md. 300, 323 n. 18, 13 A.3d 1268, 1282 n. 18 (2011) (explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>that in <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust </em>\u201cwe stated merely that, in requiring an insurer to show prejudice when it denies coverage based on a breach of a notice provision, we were not unlike the overwhelming majority of our sister states\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\n<em>Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Petitioners contend that the intermediate appellate court erred in concluding that Maryland\u2019s prejudice rules are inapplicable to a failure to comply with \u00a7 19-511 and the corresponding consent to settle provisions. Morse avers that we must, as a starting point, consider that \u00a7 19-511 was enacted for the benefit of the insured, asserting that \u201cthere was never an intention to benefit UIM carriers.\u201d Considering its purpose, and that the statute does not expressly contain a sanction, Morse asserts that the Legislature never intended \u00a7 19-511 to serve as the basis for denying coverage. Where a failure to comply with \u00a7 19-511 is used as the basis for an insurer\u2019s disclaimer, both Woznicki and Morse argue that the prejudice rules apply. Petitioners contend that a failure to comply with \u00a7 19-511 and the corresponding consent to settle provisions is essentially a failure to provide the required notice as contemplated by the prejudice rules. Ultimately, Petitioners assert that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decisions, here, are in contravention of Maryland\u2019s public policy regarding UM insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Respondents GEICO and Erie begin by noting that \u00a7 19-110, by its own terms, applies only to a disclaimer of liability based upon a lack of cooperation or notice. The legislative history as well as our case law, Respondents maintain, demonstrate that \u00a7 19-110 narrowly applies to these circumstances. A failure to comply with \u00a7 19-511 and the corresponding consent to settle clause, Respondents contend, do not fall into either category. Although \u00a7 19-511 contains the term \u201cnotice,\u201d Respondents argue that the obligations on the insured extend beyond mere notice and include permitting an insurer to consent or refuse to consent to the settlement offer. Erie further argues that the reasoning of <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust </em>is likewise inapplicable as it is similarly confined to an insurer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>disclaimer based upon the insured\u2019s failure to give the required notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\n<em>Is A Showing of Actual Prejudice Required Here?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It is undisputed that Petitioners Woznicki and Morse failed to comply with \u00a7 19-511 and the consent to settle clauses of their insurance policies by accepting the liability insurers\u2019 settlement offers without obtaining the prior written consent of their UM carriers. The question before this Court is whether, in denying coverage to Petitioners for their noncompliance with the consent to settle clause and \u00a7 19-511, the insurers are required to demonstrate prejudice. Stated differently, we consider whether the failure to comply with a consent to settle clause or \u00a7 19-511 fits into the circumstances contemplated by the prejudice rules \u2014 namely a failure to cooperate or failure to notify.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude that it does not.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">At the outset, we note that \u201c \u2018consent to settle\u2019 clauses are generally upheld, at least to the extent that settlements, consent judgments, releases, covenants not to sue, etc. between insureds and the uninsured motorists are not binding upon insurers unless the insurers have given their consent.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>291 Md. at 740, 436 A.2d at 476; <em>Waters v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>328 Md. 700, 717, 616 A.2d 884, 892 (1992). By including a consent to settle clause in its policy, an insurer can protect itself where its insured and an uninsured tortfeasor settle a tort suit which exhausts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>applicable liability insurance policy limits. <em>Waters, </em>328 Md. at 717, 616 A.2d at 892; <em>Webb, </em>291 Md. at 739-40, 436 A.2d at 476 (\u201c[T]he insurer can easily protect itself from being bound by [a settlement between the insured and the uninsured motorist].

Penn. Nat. Mut. Cas. Ins.

Under such circumstances, there exists a \u2018consent to settle\u2019 clause by statute.\u201d) (emphasis added). Section 19-511 plainly requires that the insured send to his or her UM carrier written notice of a settlement offer which would exhaust the tortfeasor\u2019s applicable liability insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>policy limit. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19 \u2014 511(a) (\u201c[T]he injured person shall send by certified mail, to any insurer that provides uninsured motorist coverage for the bodily injury or death, a copy of the liability insurer\u2019s written settlement offer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Upon receipt of the required notice, the UM carrier has a period of 60 days in which it must either send \u201c(1) written consent to acceptance of the settlement offer and to the execution of releases; or (2) written refusal to consent to acceptance of the settlement offer.\u201d \u00a7 19-511(b). If the UM carrier sends its written refusal, it \u201cshall pay to the injured person the amount of the settlement offer [within 30 days after refusal].\u201d \u00a7 19-511(c). Because the UM carrier has a 60 day period in which to make its decision, or 30 days to issue payment following a refusal, the statute necessarily imposes a reciprocal duty on the insured to allow the insurer to make this decision, or permit the insurer to make payment following a refusal. To hold otherwise would render the express time periods outlined in \u00a7 19 \u2014 511(b) and (c) superfluous. Moreover, it would be contrary to the statute itself, which further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">The injured person may accept the liability insurer\u2019s settlement offer and execute releases in favor of the liability insurer and its insured without prejudice to any claim the injured person may have against the uninsured motorist insurer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">(1) on receipt of written consent to acceptance of the settlement offer and to the execution of releases; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">(2) if the uninsured motorist insurer has not met the requirements of subsection (b) or subsection (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u00a7 19 \u2014 511(e). <em>See also Maurer, </em>404 Md. at 74 n. 4, 945 A.2d at 637 n. 4 (\u201c[T]he uninsured/underinsured carrier is by statute given the option to consent or not to consent to the settlement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Section 19-110 is inapplicable in the instant case. It is significant that \u00a7 19-511 does not contain a prejudice requirement, nor does it reference \u00a7 19-110. As a general matter \u201c[i]t is not the task of the Judiciary to re-write [a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Statute and devise a statutory procedure for the imposition of a statutory remedy.

Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 584, 911 A.2d 427, 439 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Section 19-110 applies only where an insurer disclaims coverage to its insured on the ground that the insured has failed to notify the insurer or cooperate with the insurer. The decision to limit the scope of the statute was deliberate. We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">As originally introduced before the General Assembly, \u00a7 482 [now \u00a7 19-110] provided that an insurance company was required to prove actual prejudice in an action under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy where it filed a disclaimer of insurance for \u201cany reason.\u201d The words \u201cany reason\u201d were deleted from the bill prior to final passage. As amended and ultimately enacted, \u00a7 482 [now \u00a7 19-110] required insurance companies to prove actual prejudice only where the disclaimer was based on the insured\u2019s failure \u201cto cooperate with the insurer or by not giving requisite notice to the insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\"><em>Harvey, </em>278 Md. at 552, 366 A.2d at 16-17 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Maryland Courts have rejected attempts to apply \u00a7 19-110 outside of this context. This Court had occasion to consider the scope of \u00a7 482 \u2014 \u00a7 19-110\u2019s predecessor \u2014 in <em>Gov\u2019t Emps. Ins. Co. v. Harvey, </em>278 Md. 548, 366 A.2d 13 (1976). Specifically, we considered whether \u00a7 482 applied to a disclaimer of Personal Injury Protection (\u201cPIP\u201d) coverage on the basis of the insured\u2019s noncompliance with the proof of claim provision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Following an automobile accident, the injured insured provided GEICO with notice of the accident and was instruct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>ed to submit proof of loss forms within six months to make a PIP claim. 278 Md. at 550-51, 366 A.2d at 15-16. Despite GEICO\u2019s subsequent correspondence informing Harvey that proof of loss must be submitted within six months, Harvey submitted the required forms nearly one and a half months late. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, GEICO denied Harvey PIP coverage. 278 Md. at 551, 366 A.2d at 16. In light of the Legislature\u2019s decision to limit \u00a7 482 to an insured\u2019s failure to cooperate and failure to give notice, this Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">We think it clear from the history and language of \u00a7 482 that its provisions do not apply to insurance disclaimers grounded on the insured\u2019s failure to submit proof of loss within the time specified in the policy. That a proof of loss or claim is separate and distinct from a notice of accident is well recognized. A proof of loss enables the insurer to ascertain the nature, extent and character of the loss and to set reserves accordingly. <em>Empire State Ins. Co. v. Guerriero, </em>193 Md. 506, 69 A.2d 259 (1949). The chief purpose of a proof of loss \u201cis to acquaint the insurance company with certain facts and circumstances relative to the loss, forming a basis for further steps to be taken by the company, ranging from full settlement to absolute repudiation of liability.\u201d <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Merrick, </em>171 Md. 476, 489, 190 A. 335, 341 (1937). The insurer\u2019s right to a proof of loss, where required by the policy, has been characterized as \u201can important one to the insurer, and one in which it is to be protected.\u201d <em>Automobile Ins. Co. v. Thomas, </em>153 Md. 253, 261, 138 A. 33, 37 (1927). <em>See also </em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice s.3481, et seq. (1970); 8 Blashfield, Automobile Law and Practice s.331.5 (1966). GEICO\u2019s policy issued to the appellee in this case clearly distinguished between the required notice of an accident and the proof of claim; the provisions with respect to each were contained in separate paragraphs in the policy under the heading \u2018Conditions.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">278 Md. at 553, 366 A.2d at 17. The basis for the insurer\u2019s disclaimer of PIP coverage was the insured\u2019s failure to submit a timely \u201cproof of loss\u201d claim. Accordingly, the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>requirement that the insured show actual prejudice to deny the claim was inapplicable because a \u201cproof of loss\u201d is not equivalent to a failure to notify.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">More recently, the Court of Special Appeals considered the scope of \u00a7 19-110 in <em>Phillips Way, Inc. v. Am. Equity Ins. Co., </em>143 Md.App. 515, 795 A.2d 216 (2002).

Appellant argued that \u00a7 19-110 applied because, \u201c[obtaining [the insurer\u2019s] consent naturally requires [appellant] to notify [the insurer] of a pending agreement with the [third party] and to cooperate by giving [the insurer] an opportunity to decide whether to consent thereto.\u201d 143 Md.App. at 519-20, 795 A.2d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The Court of Special Appeals rejected the appellant\u2019s attempt to equate a failure to obtain the insurer\u2019s consent to settle with a failure to notify or cooperate, explaining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>\u201c[t]he appellant\u2019s argument, while ingenious, is unpersuasive____If [appellant] <em>had </em>notified [the insurer] of the intended settlement and gave the latter its full cooperation, the condition precedent would still have been breached if [the insurer] failed to give its written consent to that settlement.\u201d 143 Md.App. at 520, 795 A.2d at 218 (emphasis in original). The Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u00a7 19-110 \u201cis inapplicable when an insurer defends on the basis that its insured failed to meet the condition precedent set forth in a no-action clause.\u201d 143 Md.App. at 524, 795 A.2d at 221. Similar to the insurance policy at issue in <em>Harvey, </em>\u201cthe requirements for notice of claim and the separate requirement for cooperation with the insurer, [were] contained in separate paragraphs from the \u2018no-action\u2019 clause.\u201d 143 Md.App. at 522-23, 795 A.2d at 220. The intermediate appellate court further reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">[0]ne of the main purposes of a no-action clause is to protect [the insurer] \u201cfrom collusive or overly generous or unnecessary settlements by the insured at the expense of the insurer.\u201d That last-mentioned purpose would be difficult to accomplish if an insured could disregard the no-action clause, sue its insurer, and put the nearly impossible burden on the latter of showing collusion or demonstrating, after the fact, the true worth of the settled claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">143 Md.App. at 524, 795 A.2d at 220-21 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">A failure to comply with a consent to settle clause or \u00a7 19-511 is not equivalent to a failure to notify or cooperate, therefore \u00a7 19-110 is inapplicable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although predating the enactment of \u00a7 19-511, our decision in <em>Waters v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>328 Md. 700, 616 A.2d 884 (1992), is instructive. In relevant part, the Court considered the effect that a settlement between the injured insured and the uninsured tortfeasor had on the UM carrier where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>insurer had notice of the settlement, but had not given its consent. 328 Md. at 715, 616 A.2d at 891. Although the policy contained a duty to notify the insurer, there was no clause requiring the insured to obtain the insurer\u2019s consent before settling. 328 Md. at 716, 616 A.2d at 891. Concluding that the insurer was bound by the settlement, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2k\">When the uninsured motorist carrier fails to include a consent to settle clause in the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy, and when the carrier, with notice of the tort suit, does not attempt to litigate at trial the underlying tort issues of liability and/or damages, the carrier will ordinarily be bound by a settlement of the tort suit entered into between its insured and the uninsured tortfeasor</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR1\">328 Md. at 719, 616 A.2d at 893. We explained that a consent to settle clause offered an insurer protection against settlements between the insured and an uninsured tortfeasor, and by not including a consent to settle clause in its insurance policy the insurer had \u201cfailed to utilize this method of protecting itself.\u201d 328 Md. at 717, 616 A.2d at 892. Or, stated differently, a consent to settle clause acts separate and apart from a duty to notify. <em>See also West American Ins. Co. v. Popa, </em>352 Md. 455, 468, 723 A.2d 1, 7 (1998) (noting that \u201cwhen the uninsured/underinsured provisions of the insurance policy do not contain a clause requiring the carrier\u2019s consent before the insured can settle with the tortfeasor, the insured is entitled to enter a settlement or a consent judgment with the tortfeasor without obtaining the consent of or without further notice to the carrier\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Apart from providing an insurer greater protection than a notice clause, an insured\u2019s obligations under \u00a7 19-511 and the consent to settle clauses contained in the policies extend beyond mere notice, and include permitting an insurer to make a determination to consent to the acceptance of the settlement offer within the specified time frame. Consequently, the failure goes beyond a technical failure to provide notice. Rather it is a failure to provide notice <em>and </em>to allow an insurer the legislatively supplied period to decide whether to consent or refuse to consent prior to entering into a settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>agreement. We also note that compliance with the duty to notify or cooperate under the relevant insurance policies is not equivalent to, and would not necessarily satisfy, the consent to settle clauses and \u00a7 19-511. Indeed, assuming that both GEICO and Erie had been notified of the settlement offer and the underlying incident, \u00a7 19-511 and the consent to settle clause would still have been breached, as here, where the insured accepted the settlement offer prior to giving the insurer time to make a determination as to whether to consent to acceptance of the settlement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We also note that the unilateral decision of the insured to accept the liability insurer\u2019s settlement offer and execute a release of claims without his or her UM carrier\u2019s consent negatively impacts the UM carrier\u2019s ability to preserve its subrogation rights against the tortfeasor. The insurer\u2019s right to seek subrogation against the uninsured tortfeasor is expressly provided by \u00a7 19-511. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19 \u2014 511(d)(1) (\u201cPayment [by the UM carrier to its insured under \u00a7 19-511(c) ] shall preserve the uninsured motorist insurer\u2019s subrogation rights against the liability insurer and its insured.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Morse suggests that \u201cthe common law prejudice rule should apply even if a case does not fit neatly into the specific language of \u00a7 19-110.\u201d The rule expressed in <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>888 Md. 162, 879 A.2d 81 (2005), may be broader in terms of to <em>whom </em>it applies, however, we disagree that it is broader than \u00a7 19-110 in <em>where </em>it applies. As we explained above, there is no indication that <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust </em>extends the prejudice rule beyond the circumstances contemplated by \u00a7 19-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Petitioners ultimately rely upon the remedial purposes underlying the enactment of Maryland\u2019s UM scheme, arguing that it would be inconsistent with the purpose of \u00a7 19-511 to permit an insurer to disclaim liability where the insured fails to comply with the settlement procedures.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To be sure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\u201c[t]his procedure was enacted in the context of a broader statutory goal to enable recovery for injured victims,\u201d <em>Buckley II, </em>437 Md. at 348, 86 A.3d at 674, and given its remedial nature, the statute is \u201cto be liberally construed to ensure that innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents can be compensated for the injuries they suffer as a result of such accidents.\u201d <em>DeHaan, </em>393 Md. at 194, 900 A.2d at 226. Essentially, Petitioners aver that by imposing the prejudice rules in the context of this case, we would better effectuate the purpose underlying UM insurance. Despite a liberal construction of \u00a7 19-511, we must not depart from the Legislature\u2019s intended application of \u00a7 19-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">That \u00a7 19-511 \u201cwas enacted in the context of a broader statutory goal to enable recovery for injured victims,\u201d <em>Buckley II, </em>437 Md. at 348, 86 A.3d at 674, does not necessitate that it falls under the purview of \u00a7 19-110, enacted for a different purpose some thirty years earlier. As we explained above, the Legislature \u201cin enacting \u00a7 19-110, announced the public policy of this state that an insurer must show prejudice before disclaiming coverage based on the insured\u2019s breach of a notice provision.\u201d <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. at 187, 879 A.2d at 96 (emphasis added). Although these cases present us with sympathetic individuals, we decline to ignore the Legislature\u2019s deliberate choice to limit the application of \u00a7 19-110. Had the Legislature intended for \u00a7 19-110 to apply to an insured\u2019s noncompliance with a consent to settle clause, a notice of claim clause, a no-action clause, or any number of clauses commonly found in insurance policies, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>certainly could have said so. Moreover, had the Legislature intended to insert a prejudice requirement in \u00a7 19-511 when it was enacted three decades later, or make reference to \u00a7 19-110, it had the ability to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Petitioners cite to numerous out-of-state cases which require prejudice in the context of an insured\u2019s noncompliance with a consent to settle clause.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Our emphasis in the instant case is on the text of \u00a7 19-110 and the General Assembly\u2019s underlying purpose in enacting \u00a7 19-110. The evolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the prejudice rule in Maryland is rather unique. As we explained in <em>Sherwood Brands, Inc. v. Great Am. Ins.

The parties appear to contest what was said during this conversation, or rather <em>who </em>said what. On the one hand, Morse, in her brief, asserts that \"Mr. Rucker told [Bove] ... that Ms. Morse did not need Erie\u2019s consent to settle with Nationwide. Mr. Rucker memorialized that telephone conversation by letter, which he wrote to \u2018confirm our telephone conversation several weeks ago regarding your acceptance of Nationwide\u2019s offer of its limit of liability and the fact that you did not need our consent to accept that offer of its limit of coverage.\u2019 \u201d On the other hand, Erie asserts that it was Bove who advised Rucker that she did not need to obtain Erie\u2019s consent or send Erie a copy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>settlement and release because Delaware law applied. Erie asserts that the letter \"restated what attorney Bove had stated to [Rucker.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Bove's testimony, upon which Morse relies, is not particularly helpful. Although Bove noted that during the conversation the two discussed \"not needing consent\u201d she did not expressly state that she was advised by the claims adjuster that no consent was needed. Rucker, however, testified that \u201c[Bove] said that ...

There is no suggestion that Erie had waived its rights under the policy or any applicable Maryland law at the time of acceptance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\">. Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references hereinafter are to the Maryland Insurance Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">.

Therefore, only the facts underlying Woznicki\u2019s petition are considered for the purpose of our waiver discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b159-5\">. We note that there is no dispute that the relevant provisions of the GEICO insurance policy could, in theory, be waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">. As noted above, Castle, by his own admission, was unaware of any notice requirement under Maryland Law or the insurance policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">. Our decision in <em>Indemnity Ins. Co. </em>appears to have suggested that no prejudice is required where the insured fails to cooperate by failing to attend hearings, depositions, or trial, or fails to provide the insurer evidence. 197 Md. at 164, 78 A.2d at 463. After the Legislature\u2019s enactment of \u00a7 482 (now \u00a7 19-110), these distinctions are no longer relevant. The statute does not distinguish between non-compliance with the duty to notify and the duty to cooperate. Rather, the statute applies equally. \"It is thus clear that the <em>Watson </em>approach of regarding notice provisions as conditions, enforceable without regard to prejudice or lack thereof, has not been the law in Maryland for more than three decades.\" <em>Sherwood Brands, Inc. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>347 Md. 32, 42, 698 A.2d 1078, 1083 (1997). \"In order to avoid its duty to defend or to indemnify on the ground of delayed notice, the insurer must establish by a preponderance of affirmative evidence that the delay in giving notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">. To be sure, the Legislature expanded the scope of the original rule in 1966. As originally enacted, the statute applied to \"motor vehicle insurers.\u201d The term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d was ultimately removed. 1966 Laws of Maryland Chapter 205. Now the statute applies to all insurers as defined under the relevant provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\">. The use of the term \"common law\u201d prejudice rule is misleading. Prior to \u00a7 19-110 the common law required no prejudice where an insurer sought to disclaim coverage to its insured for the insured\u2019s noncompliance with the duty to notify the insurer. By enacting \u00a7 19\u2014 110, the Legislature sought to alter this approach. Or put differently, by enacting \u00a7 19-110, the Legislature announced that it is the policy of this state that insurers must demonstrate prejudice prior to disclaiming coverage to an insured as a result of the insured\u2019s noncompliance with a duty to notify. In <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>cognizant of the Legislature\u2019s announcement, we imposed a prejudice requirement on an entity not expressly defined as an \"insurer\u201d under the statutory rule. In other words, an insurer may not disclaim coverage to its insured for a failure to give notice or a failure to cooperate under the policy without a showing of prejudice even if the entity does not fit neatly within the statutory definition of an insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\">. An \"insurer\u201d as defined for the purposes of \u00a7 19-110, \"includes each person engaged as indemnitor, surety, or contractor in the business of entering into insurance contracts.\u201d Section 1-101 (emphasis added). The Trust is a public entity which acted as an insurance pool under \u00a7 19-602. Although the Trust was perhaps colloquially referred to as an insurer, it was not engaged \"in the business of entering into insurance contracts.\u201d Therefore 19-110 was inapplicable on its face.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">. Both Petitioners assert that noncompliance with the consent to settle clauses and \u00a7 19-511 is essentially a failure to notify, as opposed to a failure to cooperate. As we explain herein, noncompliance with a consent to settle clause is neither a failure to notify nor a failure to cooperate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">. Although we need only determine whether the prejudice rules apply in the context of this case, we note that \u201c[a] suit based upon the insured's allegations that he is entitled to payment under one of the first party coverage clauses in the contract [i.e. UM coverage] he entered into with his insurance carrier, and that the carrier has refused payment thereby breaching its promise, is clearly a contract action.\u201d <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>285 Md. 548, 552-53, 403 A.2d 1229, 1232 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">.

We note further that if the Legislature had intended for \u00a7 482 to apply broadly, it could have expanded the scope of \u00a7 482 in response to our interpretation of that statute in <em>Harvey. </em>Notably, the statute has remained substantively the same since its original enactment and recodification as \u00a7 19-110. We pointed out in <em>Jones v. State, </em>362 Md. 331, 337-38, 765 A.2d 127, 131 (2001) (citations omitted) that \"[t]he General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court's interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation. This presumption is particularly strong whenever, after statutory language has been interpreted by this Court, the Legislature re-enacts the statute without changing in substance the language at issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">. The provision stated that \"No action shall be maintained against the Company by the Insured to recover for any loss under this Insurance Policy unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the Insured shall have fully complied with all the terms and conditions of this Insurance Policy, nor until the amount of such loss has been fixed or rendered certain by either final judgment against the Insured after trial of the issues and the time to appeal therefrom has expired without an appeal having been taken, or, if an appeal has been taken, then after the appeal has been determined or <em>by agreement between the parties with the written consent of the Company.\u201d </em>143 Md.App. at 517, 795 A.2d at 216-17 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\">. If a UM carrier seeks to disclaim coverage to its insured on the ground that its insured failed to give proper notice or cooperate under the policy, \u00a7 19-110 would likely apply. That is not the issue before us. As explained throughout this opinion, we are dealing with neither a failure to notify nor a failure to cooperate as contemplated by \u00a7 19-110.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\">. Morse makes two additional arguments. First Morse avers that \"the trial court should have granted [her] motion for partial judgment at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>close of all evidence\u201d because Erie failed to demonstrate prejudice. As indicated above, \u00a7 19-110 and <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust </em>are inapplicable. Therefore no showing of prejudice was required. Alternatively, Morse contends that the jury should have been given Morse's requested jury instruction, MPJI-Cv 14:11. The requested juiy instruction as amended provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he failure of the insured to give [] notice frees the insurance company from responsibility ... provided that the failure actually prejudiced the insurance company[.]\u201d This juiy instruction plainly applies to an insured\u2019s failure to notify his or her insurer. As we have stated above, noncompliance with \u00a7 19-511 and the consent to settle clauses at issue is not equivalent to a failure to notify. Therefore the requested jury instruction was not proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b190-5\">.

Several of the jurisdictions upon which Petitioners rely have concluded that the insured's failure to obtain his or her insurer's consent before settling with the liability insurer for policy limits creates a rebuttable presumption of prejudice to the insurer. <em>See, e.g., Am.

But I do not join the opinion, as I come to a different conclusion on one of the issues. I agree with the Majority Opinion as to the disposition of the first issue in <em>Woznicki </em>(waiver). I disagree with the Majority Opinion as to the disposition of the second issue common to both cases (required showing of prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">As the Majority Opinion explains, although an insurer may waive compliance with IN \u00a7 19-511, Ms. Woznicki did not establish a genuine dispute of material fact to avoid summary judgment on that issue. But neither GEICO nor Erie should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>be excused from their undertakings to provide under-insured motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) benefits unless they are able to show they were prejudiced by the failure of the insured to obtain the UM insurer\u2019s consent prior to settling for the limits of the at-fault driver\u2019s policy. In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Majority Opinion misinterprets IN \u00a7 19-511. Judge Woodward\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Morse </em>explains well the prejudice issue, <em>see </em>217 Md.App. at 33-39, 90 A.3d 512 and I will only briefly summarize it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">As the Majority Opinion recounts, UM coverage is designed to compensate a victim of an automobile accident when the at-fault driver lacks sufficient insurance to make the victim whole. Majority op. at 109-11, 115 A.3d at 161-63. To facilitate the payment of that compensation to the injured person, the Legislature enacted IN \u00a7 19-511 to eliminate the standoffs that had developed between liability insurers and UM insurers and that delayed payment of compensation to victims from either insurer. Majority op. at 110-12, 114-15, 115 A.3d at 162-63, 164-65. The statute does so by requiring the UM insurer to make a prompt choice between (1) paying UM benefits, as well as the amount offered by the at-fault driver\u2019s insurer, but preserving subrogation rights and (2) simply paying UM benefits and forgoing subrogation rights. The statutory consent-to-settle process is essentially a notice that starts the clock ticking for the UM insurer to make that choice. Indeed, the UM insurer\u2019s consent is not a condition for the injured party to obtain compensation. The statute provides for the injured party to obtain compensation from the UM insurer, as well as the liability insurer, even if the UM insurer neglects to make that choice and neither consents nor declines to consent to the settlement. <em>See </em>IN \u00a7 19 \u2014 511(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The General Assembly, in enacting IN \u00a7 19-110,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and this Court, in expounding the common law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have both directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>that a provision like IN \u00a7 19-511 is not a basis on which an insurer may avoid payment unless there is a showing of actual prejudice to the insurer. To come to a contrary conclusion, the Majority Opinion reasons that neither IN \u00a7 19-110 nor the common law prejudice rule apply because they are not mentioned in IN \u00a7 19-511. Majority op. at 148-44, 115 A.3d at 182. By the same token, however, nothing in IN \u00a7 19-511 states that noncompliance results in forfeiture of UM insurance benefits, but the Majority Opinion is willing to read that result into the legislative silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Under the Majority Opinion, the UM insurer escapes its obligation to pay UM benefits entirely without any need to show that it suffered any disadvantage from the failure of its insured to obtain a timely consent to the settlement with the liability insurer. This is a windfall to the insurer and a trap for the insured. I would hold, consistent with IN \u00a7 19-110 and the common law, that the UM insurer must show prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\">. <em>See Sherwood Brands Inc. </em>v. <em>Great American Ins.
