In 2004, the Shaders purported to subdivide their property to create an additional undeveloped parcel with a new address: 606A East Seminary Avenue. Within five years, the Shaders offered 606A for sale through real estate agents, who listed the \u201cnew\u201d acreage as separate and buildable.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The Hampton Improvement Association (hereinafter \u201cHIA\u201d), Respondent, thereafter, contacted the Shaders\u2019s real estate agents by letter and noted that Paragraph C, in the Schedule of Restrictive Covenants and Easements recorded by the Hampton Company in 1931, \u201cspecifically prohibited\u201d property owners from the \u201c[e]rection of more than one house per deeded lot, <em>as shown on the original [1980] Plat Map </em>at the time the property was recorded\u201d, (emphasis in original). Paragraph C provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">The land included in said tract except as hereinafter provided shall be used for private residence purposes only and no building of any kind whatsoever shall be erected or maintained thereon except private dwelling houses each dwelling being designed for occupation by a single family and private garages for the sole use of the respective owners or occupants of the plots upon which such garages are erected there shall not be erected or maintained on said tract of land an apartment house or house designed or altered for occupation by more than one family and no more than one dwelling may be erected on a lot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>In late 2012, the Shaders filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against the HIA seeking a declaration that their property consisted of two separate buildable lots and that the restrictive covenants did not prohibit the building of a home on the second lot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In their complaint, the Shaders recited both the history of the restrictive covenants in the Hampton community and of their specific property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">3. Hampton was originally formed in 1930 via the recordation of a Plat by the Hampton Company, dated July 16, 1930, [ (hereinafter \u201c1930 Plat\u201d) ] which plat is recorded among the Land Records of Baltimore County in Plat Book 9 folio 109....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">4. On April 6, 1931, The Hampton Company recorded a Schedule of Restrictive Covenants and Easements (\u201cCovenants\u201d) which Covenants were recorded among the Land Records of Baltimore County in Liber 866, folio 475-478....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">5. Among the restrictions in the Covenants, was Paragraph C, found at Liber 866, folio 476. That covenant read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">The land included in said tract except as hereinafter provided shall be used for private residence purposes only and no building of any kind whatsoever shall be erected or maintained thereon except private dwelling houses each dwelling being designed for occupation by a single family and private garages for the sole use of the respective owners or occupants of the plots upon which such garages are erected there shall not be erected or maintained on said tract of land an apartment house or house designed or altered for occupation by more than one family and no more than one dwelling may be erected on alot.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>6. The word \u201cLot\u201d was defined at Liber 866, folio 475 as \u201cone unit of said tract as at present shown by the recorded map of said tract. (\u201cTract\u201d or \u201cTract of Land\u201d was defined on the same page as the Plat No. 1 of Hampton.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\">7. On February 10, 1939, a Revised Plat of Lots 40, 42 and 44 to 54, inclusive was filed among the Land Records of Baltimore County in Plat Book 12, folio 38....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">10. When the Shaders purchased the Property, it consisted of two parcels, to wit; Lot 59 and the easterly portion of Lot 75, as shown on Plat No. 1 of Hampton____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">11. On September 10, 2004, the Shaders reconfigured the two parcels and recorded deeds to that effect____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">12. The Shaders have a home on the lot known as 606 E. Seminary Avenue and wish to either build a house on Lot 606A East Seminary Avenue or sell 606A East Seminary Avenue as a buildable lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">13. The HIA has communicated to the Shaders that the Covenants prevent them or their successors in title from building 606A East Seminary Avenue____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">The Shaders alleged, specifically, that Paragraph C had been abandoned by the HIA due to numerous violations of Paragraph C that occurred in the other lots in Hampton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">14. Over the years, numerous homes have been built in Hampton which violate the Covenants in numerous ways. For example:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-14\">a) There are several instances where due to lot reconfigurations (similar to the Shader lot re-configuration) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>homes have been built such that there are more than one home on a given Lot as Lot was defined in the 1930 Plat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">b) There are numerous Lots on which buildings other than single family dwellings and private garages have been constructed and maintained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The HIA timely filed an answer, not only denying the Shaders\u2019s allegations, but also affirmatively defending that the Shaders\u2019s claims were barred by laches and the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The Shaders, thereafter, moved for summary judgment, arguing that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law as a result of a prior judgment entered against the HIA in <em>Cortezi et al. v. Duval Four-A, LLC, </em>No. C-07-002587 (Cir.Ct.Balt.Cnty.2008) (\u201cDuva<em>l\u201d), </em>in which, they alleged, Paragraph C was not enforced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">2. The issue in this case (whether the covenants found at Liber 866, folio 475-478 are still enforceable or whether they have been abandoned) has already been decided as a matter of fact by this Court in a prior case <em>(Cortezi, et al. v. Duval-Four, LLC, </em>Case No. C-07-002587).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">3. Hampton Improvement Association, Inc. was a party plaintiff in <em>Cortezi.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\"><em>4. </em>The findings of this Court in the <em>Cortezi </em>case were not appealed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">The HIA filed its own motion for summary judgment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and opposed the Shaders\u2019s summary judgment motion, alleging that they could not avail themselves of the <em>Duval </em>judgment because offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> had not been recognized in Maryland, as well as that genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>issues of material fact existed regarding whether the HIA had actually waived Paragraph C. Judge John F. Fader II, retired from the Circuit Court of Baltimore County, sitting as a motions judge, denied both motions for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5B\">First, I do not feel that \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d is able to be applied here.... [This doctrine] require[s] the placing of one face plate over another to see if the issues are the same and if the parties are fundamentally the same so as to be bound by a prior decision. There is nothing in the Shader motion that would allow me to see the face plate of the actual controversy before [the <em>Duval </em>court] and the decision by [the <em>Duval </em>court] as to the structures or buildings to which it refers as a violation of what covenant or issue presented. Second, the Response ... makes an important distinction between the erection of houses as opposed to other sheds or buildings, the fact that there is argued not to have been an abandonment of covenants for Plat # 1, differences that may exist between the covenants, and application of the covenants as to different plats. That all means that a significant amount of additional facts needs to be gone through by the court before summary judgment or any judgment would be able to be entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">A non-jury trial was held before Judge Kathleen G. Cox of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, at which time the parties renewed their motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a memorandum opinion, Judge Cox also denied both motions for summary judgment and ultimately denied the Shaders\u2019s request for declaratory relief. The court, first, denied the HIA\u2019s motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">The Court does not believe that the claim is barred by limitations simply because the Shaders received a letter that placed them on notice of [the] Covenants. The Shaders\u2019 claim did not ripen until they intended or sought to take action that was arguably barred by the Covenants. The Covenants arguably constitute a continuing restriction on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the use of the property. In the context of the present dispute, one basis for the Shaders\u2019 claim for relief is that the HIA has abandoned the right to enforce the Covenants, based upon other neighborhood development. Thus the status of enforceability, to some extent, remains in a state of flux. The Shaders filed for declaratory relief concerning the continued viability of the Covenant governing construction of a second residence. Given this declaratory posture, the claim is not time barred. Accordingly, the HIA\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Judge Cox then turned to the Shaders\u2019s collateral estoppel argument in their motion for summary judgment and recognized that it required an application of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel, but determined that the <em>Duval </em>case dealt with different and distinct issues than the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">The Shaders\u2019 argument requires application of the doctrine of non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel to the <em>Duval </em>ruling. Non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel requires four determinations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">1. Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical with the one presented in the action in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">2. Was there a final judgment on the merits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">3. Was the party against whom the plea is asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">4. Was the party against whom the plea is asserted given a fair opportunity to be heard on the issue?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-11\"><em>Leeds Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Metcalf, </em>332 Md. 107, 117\u2014 18, 630 A.2d 245, 250 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">In the present case, the issues decided in the prior <em>Duval </em>matter are not identical to the issue presented in this case. While the issues are clearly related, the Shaders\u2019 property consists of one \u201coriginal\u201d lot and a portion of another lot that were joined in one parcel. The Shaders then sought to re-configure the lot line between these two parcels....</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>After denying the Shaders\u2019s summary judgment, Judge Cox acknowledged the separation of clauses in Paragraph C, and distinguished between the restriction of \u201cno building of any kind whatsoever shall be erected or maintained thereon except private dwelling houses\u201d and the clause that requires \u201cno more than one dwelling may be erected on a Lot\u201d. Judge Cox rejected the Shaders\u2019s argument that the HIA had failed to enforce the clause restricting \u201cno more than one dwelling may be erected on a Lot\u201d due to the construction of separate structures, such as pool houses, gazebos, guest houses and sheds, on the other lots, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\">Although the Shaders were able to show numerous instances of violations based upon construction of separate structures on properties throughout the community, they were unable to demonstrate construction of a second residence on a single lot. Rather, the evidence demonstrates that the HIA has consistently taken action to enforce the restriction in the Covenants that requires \u2018no more than one dwelling may be erected on a Lot.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Judge Cox opined that \u201crestrictive Covenants may be abandoned in part without resulting in a wholesale abandonment of all restrictive Covenants\u201d, and although there were additional non-residential buildings constructed on single lots in violation of one clause in Paragraph C, such construction did not invalidate the restriction on the construction of separate dwellings on a single lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Judge Cox also addressed the Shaders\u2019s argument that they owned two separate lots and, therefore, would not be in violation of the restriction prohibiting the construction of a second dwelling on a single lot were they to construct a dwelling on 606A East Seminary. She rejected this argument, and concluded that the term \u201clot\u201d in Paragraph C was intended by the grantors to refer to the \u201cLots as displayed on the initial plat from 1930\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">The deed in the chain of title to Lot 75 states clearly that it is not a buildable lot. Lot 75, as indicated on the 1930 plat, already contains a residential dwelling. The proposal to build another residence on lots that have been reconfig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ured, but nevertheless already each support a residence, would violate the Covenants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The Shaders noted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Shader v. Hampton Imp. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>217 Md.App. 581, 94 A.3d 224 (2014). Our intermediate appellate court determined that the Circuit Court correctly denied the Shaders\u2019s attempted use of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel, because the issues in <em>Duval </em>were not identical to the issues in the instant case. The Court of Special Appeals noted that the issues were distinct, because \u201cthe <em>Duval </em>case involved a lot\u2014 Lot 4-A \u2014 that was created more than 50 years prior by the Hampton Company as shown on the 1949 Plat\u201d, whereas the Shaders\u2019s lot consists of one lot from the original 1930 Plat and a portion of another lot that was joined in a single parcel. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 94 A.3d at 238. With respect to the issue of waiver by abandonment, the Court of Special Appeals determined that the Circuit Court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the restriction prohibiting the construction of more than one dwelling on a single lot was not abandoned. The Court of Special Appeals also agreed with Judge Cox that \u201crestrictions in a set of covenants may be severable\u201d and thus, although the clause restricting the erection of additional non-residential buildings had been waived by the construction of additional buildings, such as pool houses, gazebos, guest houses and sheds, the balance of Paragraph C, including the restriction on the construction of more than one dwelling, was not abandoned by the HIA and was, therefore, enforceable. <em>Id. </em>at 624, 94 A.3d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">We granted certiorari. 440 Md. 225, 101 A.3d 1063 (2014). Before us, the Shaders rely on substantially the same arguments as were presented before the Court of Special Appeals, as does the HIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">We shall hold that the Circuit Court did not err in denying the Shaders\u2019s motion for summary judgment because we have not adopted the doctrine of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel and decline to do so in the present case, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>instant issues are not identical to those in <em>Duval. </em>We shall hold that the Circuit Court did not err in determining that the HIA did not waive by abandonment the clause restricting the construction of more than one residential dwelling per lot in Paragraph C of the recorded Schedule of Restrictive Covenants and Easements. We shall also hold that the HIA\u2019s waiver of the clause restricting the construction of a building aside from a residential dwelling on a single lot may be severed from the remainder of the covenants and does not make the remaining covenants in Paragraph C unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Av2\">I. Collateral Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We initially address the Shaders\u2019s claim that the HIA is barred from relitigating the enforcement of Paragraph C because the issue was decided in the <em>Duval </em>ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">When the doctrine of collateral estoppel is applied, \u201cfactual issues resolved in the adjudication of one claim are binding for purposes of subsequent adjudication of another claim.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> John A. Lynch, Jr. &amp; Richard W. Bourne, Modern Maryland Civil Procedure 1242-43 (2d ed. 2004, 2014 Supp.). \u201cThe determination of ultimate fact underlying the judgment in a previous proceeding is the gravamen of the doctrine.\u201d <em>Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Berrett, </em>395 Md. 439, 457, 910 A.2d 1072, 1083 (2006). The purpose of the doctrine, like <em>res judicata, </em>is \u201cto avoid the expense and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and foster reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibilities of inconsistent decisions.\u201d <em>Rourke v. Amchem Products, Inc., </em>384 Md. 329, 359, 863 A.2d 926, 944 (2004), quoting <em>Murray Int'l Freight Corp. v. Graham, </em>315 Md. 543, 547, 555 A.2d 502, 504 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In its traditional form, collateral estoppel may be invoked when \u201cin a second suit <em>between the same parties, </em>even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>if the cause of action is different, any determination of fact that was actually litigated and was essential to a valid and final judgment is conclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340-41, 863 A.2d at 933 (emphasis in original). A four-part test is used, generally, to determine whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">1. Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical with the one presented in the action in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">2. Was there a final judgment on the merits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">3. Was the party against whom the plea is asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">4. Was the party against whom the plea is asserted given a fair opportunity to be heard on the issue?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-8\"><em>Burruss v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Frederick Cnty., </em>427 Md. 231, 249-50, 46 A.3d 1182, 1193 (2012), quoting <em>Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. TKU Assocs., </em>281 Md. 1, 18-19, 376 A.2d 505, 514 (1977). \u201c[F]or the doctrine of collateral estoppel to apply, the probable fact-finding that undergirds the judgment used to estop must be scrutinized to determine if the issues raised in that proceeding were actually litigated, or facts necessary to resolve the pertinent issues were adjudicated in that action.\u201d <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 391-92, 761 A.2d 899, 910 (2000), citing <em>Burkett v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 459, 466, 633 A.2d 902, 906 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The traditional principle of mutuality of parties as an element of collateral estoppel has not always been required \u201cif one of the parties in the original case is involved in relitigating one of the issues determined against a different party in a successive suit.\u201d <em>Berrett, </em>395 Md. at 457, 910 A.2d at 1083. Considered \u201cnon-mutual\u201d collateral estoppel, it has been used both defensively, as well as offensively. <em>See Burruss, </em>427 Md. at 249-50, 46 A.3d at 1193; <em>Berrett, </em>395 Md. at 458, 910 A.2d at 1083; <em>Rourke, </em>384 Md. at 341, 863 A.2d at 933. <em>Defensive </em>non-mutual collateral estoppel has been invoked in Maryland, \u201cwhen a defendant seeks to prevent a plaintiff from relitigating an issue the plaintiff has previously litigated unsuccessfully in another action against a different party.\u201d <em>Welsh v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>Gerber Products, Inc., </em>315 Md. 510, 517 n. 6, 555 A.2d 486, 489 n. 6 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The doctrine of <em>offensive </em>non-mutual collateral estoppel has not been embraced and applied by this Court, but has been invoked by other courts \u201cwhen a plaintiff seeks to foreclose a defendant from relitigating an issue the defendant has previously litigated unsuccessfully in another action against a different party\u201d. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Burruss v. Board of County Commissioners of Frederick County, </em>427 Md. 231, 46 A.3d 1182 (2012), we declined to adopt the doctrine of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel in a situation in which the Board of County Commissioners of Frederick County appointed a nine-member charter board to draft and present a charter to Frederick voters pursuant to Section 1A of Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ellis C. Burruss and other individuals who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>sought membership on the charter board submitted a petition, (collectively, \u201cthe Petitioners\u201d), purportedly signed by 2,915 registered voters, requesting a special election to nominate additional charter board members. The Board denied the request, determining that the petition did not satisfy the requirements to hold a special election because many of the petition signatures were invalid under Section 6-203 of the Election Law Article of the Maryland Code.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Prior to the action at the heart of <em>Burruss, </em>in <em>Maryland State Board of Elections v. Libertarian Party, </em>426 Md. 488, 492, 44 A.3d 1002, 1004 (2012), plaintiffs in Anne Arundel County filed an action challenging the legal standard the Maryland State Board of Elections applied in evaluating petition signatures, and the Circuit Court issued a declaratory judgment adopting the \u201csufficient cumulative information standard\u201d. The <em>Burruss </em>Petitioners filed for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Frederick County and attempted to invoke offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel to prevent the Board from relitigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ing the proper legal standard, based on the ruling in the <em>Libertarian Party </em>case. The Circuit Court Judge affirmed the Board\u2019s denial of the special election and declined to apply offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel because he found that the Board was not a party in the <em>Libertarian Party </em>case and that the issues in <em>Burmss </em>were different.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">We granted certiorari and affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court Judge. We declined to apply the doctrine of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel and noted that even \u201cassuming that all the elements of non-mutual collateral estoppel are satisfied\u201d, its application was not appropriate, Burrus, 427 Md. at 252, 46 A.3d at 1194. We surveyed the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel in <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 99 S.Ct. 645, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979), in which the Supreme Court discussed the dual policy concerns underlying the application of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel, those being judicial economy and fairness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">First, offensive use of collateral estoppel does not promote judicial economy in the same manner as defensive use does. Defensive use of collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff from relitigating identical issues by merely \u201cswitching adversaries.\u201d <em>Bernhard, v. Bank of America Nat. Trust &amp; Savings Assn. [ </em>(1942) <em>], </em>19 Cal.2d [807], at 813, 122 P.2d [892], at 895.12 Thus defensive collateral estoppel gives a plaintiff a strong incentive to join all potential defendants in the first action if possible. Offensive use of collateral estoppel, on the other hand, creates precisely the opposite incentive. Since a plaintiff will be able to rely on a previous judgment against a defendant but will not be bound by that judgment if the defendant wins, the plaintiff has every incentive to adopt a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude, in the hope that the first action by another plaintiff will result in a favorable judgment. <em>E.g., Nevarov v. Caldwell [ </em>(1958) <em>], </em>161 Cal.App.2d 762, 767-768, 327 P.2d 111, 115; <em>Reardon v. Allen, </em>88 N.J.Super. 560, 571-572, 213 A.2d 26, 32 [ (Law Div. 1965) ]. Thus offensive use of collateral estoppel will likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>increase rather than decrease the total amount of litigation, since potential plaintiffs will have everything to gain and nothing to lose by not intervening in the first action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">A second argument against offensive use of collateral estoppel is that it may be unfair to a defendant. If a defendant in the first action is sued for small or nominal damages, he may have little incentive to defend vigorously, particularly if future suits are not foreseeable. <em>The Evergreens v. Nunan, </em>141 F.2d 927, 929 (C.A.2 [1944]); cf. <em>Berner v. British Commonwealth Pac. Airlines, </em>346 F.2d 532 (C.A.2 [1965]) (application of offensive collateral estoppel denied where defendant did not appeal an adverse judgment awarding damages of $35,000 and defendant was later sued for over $7 million). Allowing offensive collateral estoppel may also be unfair to a defendant if the judgment relied upon as a basis for the estoppel is itself inconsistent with one or more previous judgments in favor of the defendant. Still another situation where it might be unfair to apply offensive estoppel is where the second action affords the defendant procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action that could readily cause a different result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 329-31, 99 S.Ct. at 650-51, 58 L.Ed.2d at 561-62. Considering the dual policy concerns and our review and subsequent vacation of the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Libertarian Party, </em>426 Md. at 522, 44 A.3d at 1022, we determined the application of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel was not appropriate. We concluded its application would be inappropriate because the circuit court ruling in the <em>Libertarian Party </em>case was an incorrect interpretation of the law, and our holding in <em>Libertarian Party, </em>which vacated the circuit court ruling, \u201creaffirmed that the petition signature requirements in \u00a7 6-203(a) are mandatory\u201d, and thus, \u201cit would be unfair to bind [the Board] to an interpretation of the law inconsistent with our holding in that case.\u201d <em>Burruss, </em>427 Md. at 252, 46 A.3d at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The Shaders urge us to adopt and apply in their favor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>doctrine of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in the present case and argue that the <em>Duval </em>ruling, that the HIA \u201cha[s] waived the right to seek to enforce the provisions of Paragraph C of the Covenants by abandonment\u201d, collaterally estops the HIA from relitigating the enforcement of Paragraph C.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">In <em>Duval, </em>the HIA had filed a declaratory and injunctive relief action against Duval Four-A, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company (\u201cDuval\u201d), that owned Lot 4A in Hampton. The Hampton Company, the original developer of the lots, had revised the original 1930 Plat in 1949 and reconfigured Lot 4 to create two additional lots: Lot 4A and Lot 4B. The HIA filed suit against Duval to prevent the construction of a dwelling on Lot 4A, and sought relief \u201cbased on the theory that the prohibition against the construction of more than one dwelling on a \u2018lot\u2019 refers to the \u2018lots\u2019 depicted in the 1930 Plat.\u201d After hearing testimony and argument of the parties, Judge Robert E. Cahill, Jr. of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, denied relief to the HIA based on the 1949 revision of the 1930 Plat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">2. In 1949, a Revised Plat was filed by the Hampton Company which reconfigured the lot lines for several lots, and in fact, created Lot 4A, the lot owned by [Duval], and Lot 4B. Thereafter, on a least three of the lots depicted in the original 1930 Plat (Lots 18, 24 and 25) more than one dwelling was built per lot as those lots were originally configured on the 1930 Plat. Indeed, the evidence was undisputed that the dwelling which straddles what were depicted on the 1930 Plat as Lots 22 and 24 was built as recently as 2005....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">3. There is no evidence that any of the lot owners in Hampton ever objected to the construction of more than one house per lot as the lots were depicted on the 1930 Plat in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>these three other cases (Lots 18, 24 and 25). There is no evidence that the Hampton Improvement Association, Inc. ever objected. Neither the Plaintiffs, nor any of the other property owners in the subdivision sued or otherwise sought to enforce this interpretation of the covenant in these three situations, each of which involved lots oriented just adjacent to Lot 4A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">4. In addition, the testimony was undisputed that in some 30 instances in the subdivision, the Plaintiffs and their predecessors have permitted lot owners in Hampton to erect and maintain buildings other than single family dwellings and garages on their lots in violation of the very same covenant which they seek to enforce in this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">(footnotes omitted). Judge Cahill concluded, \u201c[biased on the fact that the Plat presently in effect portrays [Duval\u2019s] property as a separate lot, designated as Lot 4A, the construction of [Duval\u2019s] dwelling, as planned, will not frustrate the original intent or purpose of the covenants\u201d and that the HIA \u201cha[s] waived the right to seek to enforce the provisions of Paragraph C of the Covenants by abandonment.\u201d In footnote four to his opinion, Judge Cahill attempted to limit the breadth of his decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">The decision in this matter is limited to the facts of this case. This Court specifically does <em>not </em>conclude that the covenants are \u201cvoid\u201d. This Court specifically does <em>not </em>conclude that the waiver defense would apply in any other action to enforce the covenants in the future.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Although we may disagree with the ability of a trial court to specifically limit the application of non-mutual collateral estoppel, we decline to embrace the doctrine of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel, under the circumstances in this case, because the issues in <em>Duval </em>differ from the issues in the Shaders\u2019s case. In the instant case, the Shaders\u2019s rely upon Judge Cahill\u2019s determination that the HIA \u201cha[s] waived the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>right to seek to enforce the provisions of Paragraph C of the Covenants by abandonment.\u201d In her denial of the Shaders\u2019s motion for summary judgment based upon the application of waiver through collateral estoppel, Judge Cox specifically found that the issues in <em>Duval </em>were dissimilar to those in the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">In the present case, the issues decided in the prior <em>Duval </em>matter are not identical to the issue presented in this case. While the issues are clearly related, the Shaders\u2019 property consists of one \u201coriginal\u201d lot and a portion of another lot that were joined in one parcel. The Shaders then sought to reconfigure the lot line between these two parcels....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APS\">We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We have not embraced the doctrine of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel, but even were we, the doctrine could not be applied in the present case because the issues addressed in <em>Duval </em>are different from those queued up here. As the trial court found, <em>Duval </em>dealt specifically with \u201ca revision in the subdivision plat that was filed in 1949 that reconfigured some of the original lot lines and created at least two new lots\u201d, whereas here, the Shaders\u2019s property consists of one lot from the original 1930 Plat and a portion of another lot that was joined in a single parcel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The issues, thus, are dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">II. Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">We next address the Shaders\u2019s argument that the HIA waived by abandonment the restrictions within Para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>graph C, by allowing the construction of numerous buildings such as pool houses, gazebos, guest houses and sheds. Paragraph C provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">The land included in said tract except as hereinafter provided shall be used for private residence purposes only and no building of any kind whatsoever shall be erected or maintained thereon except private dwelling houses each dwelling being designed for occupation by a single family and private garages for the sole use of the respective owners or occupants of the plots upon which such garages are erected there shall not be erected or maintained on said tract of land an apartment house or house designed or altered for occupation by more than one family and no more than one dwelling may be erected on a lot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Judge Cox, after having heard testimony and reviewed the exhibits, some of which were photos depicting the structures, determined that the restriction prohibiting the construction of \u201cno more than one dwelling\u201d on a single lot was not waived by abandonment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">With the exception of the caveat pertaining to garages, Covenant C clearly states that \u201cno building of any kind whatsoever shall be erected or maintained thereon except private dwelling houses.\u201d Although the Shaders were able to show numerous instances of violations based upon construction of separate structures on properties throughout the community, they were unable to demonstrate construction of a second residence on a single lot. Rather, the evidence demonstrates that the HIA has consistently taken action to enforce the restriction in the Covenants that requires \u2018no more than one dwelling may be erected on a Lot.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">Maryland law holds that restrictive Covenants may be abandoned in part without resulting in a wholesale abandonment of all restrictive Covenants. <em>See King v. Waigand, </em>208 Md. 308, 313 [117 A.2d 918] (1955) ([holding, where a restrictive covenant prohibited the sale of \u201cmalt and spirituous liquors,\u201d the abandonment of the restriction on the sale of malt liquors, i.e. beer and wine, did not effect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>enforcement of the restrictive covenant regarding the sale of \u201cspirituous liquors.\u201d). Here, violations of the portion of the covenant prohibiting the construction of buildings other than residential dwellings does not necessarily mean that the restriction on building more than one residence per lot has been abandoned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">The evidence at trial clearly demonstrated that the HIA has continuously enforced the restriction on building more than one residential dwelling per lot. This enforcement has allowed Hampton to remain a neighborhood of large, single family properties, with a low population density____Here, the Covenant is still serving its purpose in ensuring the residential character of the neighborhood. The Shaders had constructive notice of the Covenants at the time they purchased their property. For these reasons, this Court does not find that the HIA has abandoned enforcement of the Covenant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The Court of Special Appeals agreed, holding that \u201cthe circuit court did not err in concluding that the HIA did not waive the restriction prohibiting more than one house per lot, consistent with the original Plat filed in 1930.\u201d <em>Shader, </em>217 Md.App. at 626, 94 A.3d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">We have long recognized the equitable defense of waiver in restrictive covenant cases. <em>See City of Bowie v. MIE Properties, Inc., </em>398 Md. 657, 697, 922 A.2d 509, 533 (2007) (citing numerous cases). In the context of restrictive covenants, \u201cwaiver deems unenforceable a covenant because some word or act of the [individual benefitting from the covenant] communicated to the [individual burdened by the covenant] that the covenant would not be enforced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Waiver by abandonment occurs when an individual benefiting from a restrictive covenant relinquishes his or her right to enforce the covenant, because he or she has previously allowed a violation of the covenant by other individuals burdened by the covenant. <em>See id. </em>\u201c[W]here conduct [related to the use of benefitted land] indicates the actor\u2019s intent to relinquish the benefit of the covenant, the doctrine [of abandonment] prevents that person from gaining any benefit from the further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>existence of the obligation.\u201d Richard R. Powell, Powell on Real Property \u00a7 60.10[1] (2000). \u201cAbandonment may be explicit, <em>e.g., </em>through a written statement abandoning claim to benefit of the promise. Abandonment may also be implied by a court, usually by clear and convincing evidence, from actions that the court reads to show a definite, specific intent to abandon the covenant.\u201d 2 David A. Thomas, Thompson on Real Property \u00a7 61.07(b)(2)(iii), at 628 (2006). \u201cThe question of whether waiver has occurred is a question of fact, which is reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>MIE Properties, Inc., </em>398 Md. at 699, 922 A.2d at 534 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The Shaders urge that the trial court erred, because, they allege, the evidence adduced at trial demonstrates that the HIA, in fact, waived the restriction that \u201cno building of any kind whatsoever shall be erected or maintained thereon except private dwelling houses\u201d and the restriction prohibiting more than one residential dwelling per single lot, by permitting other prohibited buildings to be erected. They argue that they produced numerous exhibits with pictures of \u201cout buildings\u201d on other lots in Hampton, including photographs of pool houses, gazebos, guest houses and sheds and that, \u201c[i]f the one house per lot restriction was designed to maintain a certain appearance within Hampton, it is beyond legitimate argument that allowing dozens and dozens of additional buildings, including guest houses, pool houses, apartments over garages, and the like, has completely altered the concept spelled out in the Covenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The HIA conversely alleges that the existence of other non-residential buildings on lots does not result in an abandonment of the restriction prohibiting the construction of multiple residences on a single lot because the other buildings are not single family dwellings, and it only enforced the restriction when a property owner sought to increase the residential density of Hampton by constructing an additional residence on a single lot.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Judge Cox specifically found that there had not been construction of a second residence on a single lot in the community, and this factual finding is supported by the record. As a result, the HIA did not engage in a waiver by abandonment of the clause in Paragraph C restricting the construction of more than one dwelling per single lot, consistent with the original 1930 Plat, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The Shaders argue, though, alternatively, that the HIA, by allowing the erection of pool houses, gazebos, guest houses and sheds in violation of the clause restricting the erection of \u201cbuilding[s] of any kind ... except private dwelling houses\u201d triggers a waiver of the entirety of Paragraph C.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Judge Cox found, with respect to the alleged waiver of the entirety of Paragraph C, \u201cthat restrictive Covenants may be abandoned in part without resulting in a wholesale abandonment of all restrictive Covenants.\u201d She noted that, \u201c[h]ere, violations of the portion of the covenant prohibiting the construction of buildings other than residential dwellings does not necessarily mean that the restriction on building more than one residence per lot has been abandoned\u201d. She concluded that the purpose of Paragraph C was to ensure the residential character of the neighborhood and that the HIA\u2019s enforcement of the provision restricting the building of more than one residential dwelling per lot \u201chas allowed Hampton to remain a neighborhood of large, single family properties, with a low population density\u201d. As a result, she determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>HIA had not abandoned enforcement of the restriction on the construction of more than one residence per single lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The Court of Special Appeals agreed with Judge Cox \u201cthat restrictions in a set of covenants may be severable.\u201d <em>Shader, </em>217 Md.App. at 622, 94 A.3d at 248. Our intermediate appellate court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">The second clause, which defines the acceptable appurtenances for each single family dwelling, is the clause that the circuit court found was violated due to evidence of additional buildings, such as sheds, gazebos and pool houses on various lots in Hampton. Permitting the HIA to expand the concept of garage or building does not destroy the purpose of Paragraph C, so long as these buildings are appurtenant to and for the use of one single family dwelling. For this Court to hold that the abandonment of one restriction in Paragraph C results in the abandonment of all restrictions would be inequitable. Hampton could lose its aesthetic character and low residential density, as homeowners would be able to subdivide their lots and construct multiple dwellings and units to the limits of applicable zoning regulations. This would defy the clear intent of Paragraph C of the Covenants: to restrict the use of each lot in Hampton to residential, single-family purposes. As the Court of Appeals has instructed, we \u201c \u2018are under a duty to effectuate rather than defeat an intention which is clear from the context, the objective sought to be accomplished by the restriction and from the result that would arise from a different construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>MIE Props., Inc., supra, </em>398 Md. at 680, 922 A.2d 509 (quoting <em>Belleview Construction Co.

Therefore, we hold that the circuit court did not err in concluding that the HIA did not waive the restriction prohibiting more than one house per lot, consistent with the original Plat filed in 1930.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzG\"><em>Id. </em>at 624-26, 94 A.3d at 249-50 (internal footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">We agree that the HIA waived the clause in Paragraph C restricting the erection of \u201cbuilding[s] of any kind ... except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>private dwelling houses\u201d by allowing the erection of pool houses, gazebos, guest houses and sheds in violation of the clause. Nonetheless, restrictions in a set of covenants may be severable from one another. <em>See </em>Powell, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 60.10[1] (2000) (In the similar doctrine of acquiescence, \u201c[ajcquiescence in the violation of one restriction does not constitute acquiescence in the violation of a different restriction unless the violation defeats the object of the entire plan.\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Paragraph C can be divided into four separate and independent clauses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">[1.] The land included in said tract except as hereinafter provided shall be used for private residence purposes only and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">[2.] no building of any kind whatsoever shall be erected or maintained thereon except private dwelling houses each dwelling being designed for occupation by a single family and private garages for the sole use of the respective owners or occupants of the plots upon which such garages are erected</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">[3.] there shall not be erected or maintained on said tract of land an apartment house or house designed or altered for occupation by more than one family and</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKM\">no more than one dwelling may be erected on a lot.

The findings of the trial judge include:</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The evidence demonstrated that Lot 75 in the original 1930 subdivision plan was subdivided in the late 1940s. The eastern portion of Lot 75 that is currently owned by the Shaders was originally conveyed to Raymond Moore and Louise Moore on March 4, 1948. At the time of that conveyance, the property deed was encumbered by the following covenant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">It is expressly covenanted and agreed as part of the consideration for this Deed by the said Raymond and Louise S. Moore, his wife, for themselves, their heirs and assigns with the Hampton Company for itself, its successors and assigns, that at no time shall any dwelling be erected on the lot hereby conveyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">The largest portion of the original Lot 75 has a home on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">. The Shaders and the HIA argue, additionally, that the Covenants are not enforceable or enforceable based on the standard of \"changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>relevant circumstances\u201d in the surrounding neighborhood, which they conflate with the standard for waiver by abandonment. When a covenant is challenged based on changed relevant circumstances, \"[t]he proper legal standard for this inquiry is to examine whether, after the passage of a reasonable period of time, the continuing validity of the covenant cannot further the purpose for which it was formed in light of changed relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>City of Bowie v. MIE Properties, Inc., </em>398 Md. 657, 685, 922 A.2d 509, 526 (2007). In contrast, waiver by abandonment focuses on violations of the covenant in areas of land subject to covenant aside from the property at issue in the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 698 n. 27, 922 A.2d at 534 n. 27. As a result, we do not need to address any issues related to a change in relevant circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">. Various of our sister courts also have held that clauses in restrictive covenants may be severable. <em>See Dauphin Island Prop. Owners Ass\u2019n v. Kuppersmith, </em>371 So.2d 31, 34 (Ala.1979) (\"[W]e hold that any failure of the Association to enforce the two-tie pilings restriction did not constitute estoppel by acquiescence to assert either the height and roof restrictions or the building permit restriction.\u201d); <em>Swaggerty v. Petersen, </em>280 Or. 739, 572 P.2d 1309, 1314 (1977) (\u201cAssuming that plaintiffs were, or should have been, aware of these violations [in a series of restrictions] and failed to object to them does not preclude them from suing to enforce the density restrictions. The right to enforce one restrictive covenant is not lost by acquiescence in the violation of another restriction.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
