The initial complaint filed by the plaintiff failed to comply with a statutory prerequisite for maintaining a medical malpractice action \u2014 the attachment of an expert report concerning the alleged malpractice. That defect would result in dismissal of the complaint under the statute governing malpractice actions. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the action, corrected the defect, and re-filed the action. In the meantime, the statute of limitations had expired well before the filing of the second action.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">A statute specific to medical malpractice actions provides some relief from the statute of limitations when an initial complaint is dismissed for the particular defect that affected the plaintiffs complaint. However, the statutory savings provision does not apply in cases in which a plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed the prior complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The Maryland Rules allow a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss a complaint by filing a simple notice of dismissal before the defendant has answered the complaint. After an answer has been filed, the plaintiff can accomplish a voluntary dismissal only by obtaining the defendant\u2019s assent or the court\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">This case turns on whether it makes a difference that the voluntary dismissal in this case was effected by a stipulation of dismissal, necessary because the defendant had already answered the complaint, as opposed to a notice of dismissal. We hold that it does not and that the savings provision does not apply to any case in which there has been a voluntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\n<em>A. Voluntary Dismissals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">For various reasons, a plaintiff in a civil action may choose to dismiss a claim \u2014 or an entire complaint \u2014 voluntarily. The process that a plaintiff must follow to do so \u2014 and the consequences of the dismissal \u2014 varies according to the stage of the proceeding and whether the plaintiff has previously dismissed the same claim, as elaborated in Maryland Rule 2-506.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That rule, entitled \u201cVoluntary Dismissal,\u201d states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB0\">(a) By notice of dismissal or stipulation. Except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute, a party who has filed a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim may dismiss all or part of the claim without leave of court by filing (1) a notice of dismissal at any time before the adverse party files an answer or (2) a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties to the claim being dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>(c) By order of court. Except as provided in section (a) of this Rule, a party who has filed a complaint ... may dismiss the claim only by order of court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">(d) Effect. Unless otherwise specified in the notice of dismissal, stipulation, or order of court, a dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a party who has previously dismissed ... an action based on or including the same claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">According to the plain language of the rule, a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss a complaint in one of three ways: by a notice of dismissal, by a stipulation of dismissal, or by court order. <em>State ex rel. Lennon v. Strazzella, </em>331 Md. 270, 275-76, 627 A.2d 1055 (1993). Thus, the concept of voluntary dismissal encompasses a stipulation of dismissal after an answer has been filed. <em>Milburn v. Milburn, </em>142 Md.App. 518, 533, 790 A.2d 744 (2002). In fact, since the predecessor of Rule 2-506 was adopted in 1956, the Maryland Rules have consistently provided that a plaintiff may accomplish a voluntary dismissal by filing a stipulation of dismissal. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 541(a)(2) (1956) (a party may voluntarily dismiss an action by \u201cfiling a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This aspect of Rule 2-506 is modeled after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">As Rule 2-506 indicates, on the first occasion that a claim is voluntarily dismissed, the dismissal is \u201cwithout preju<em>dice\u201d </em>\u2014 ie., it is not an adjudication on the merits that would, under the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>foreclose a plaintiff from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>refiling the action. (A second notice of dismissal, however, does operate as an adjudication on the merits and forecloses refiling.) It is well settled under the federal rule that, even though a dismissal is without prejudice, there is ordinarily no tolling of the statute of limitations and a plaintiff may be barred by limitations from re-filing an action that has been voluntarily dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d 9 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 2367 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201c[I]t seems well settled in the case law that the statute of limitations is not tolled by bringing an action that later is dismissed voluntarily under Rule 41(a)\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, even though <em>res judicata </em>may not prevent a plaintiff who has voluntarily dismissed a claim from refiling the claim, the statute of limitations \u2014 if it has expired in the meantime \u2014 may do so. Although this Court has not had occasion to confirm that the same principle applies with respect to Rule 2-506, as with respect to the federal rule on which it is based, the Court of Special Appeals has characterized that conclusion as \u201c[w]hat would seem to be certain to most\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and there is no evident reason to come to a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\n<em>B. Bringing a Claim under the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The Health Care Malpractice Claims Act (\u201cHCMCA\u201d), codified at Maryland Code, Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), \u00a7 3-2A-01 <em>et seq., </em>establishes procedures for all \u201cclaims, suits, and actions ... by a person against a health care provider for medical injury allegedly suffered by the person in which damages of more than the limit of the concurrent jurisdiction of the District Court are sought.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-2A-02(a)(l). The HCMCA creates a mandatory arbitration system for all medical malpractice claims alleging damages over a certain limit in order to weed out non-meritorious claims and reduce the costs of litigation. <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 582, 911 A.2d 427 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Pertinent to this case, the HCMCA sets forth the process that an individual must follow as a prerequisite to bringing a civil action in court. The individual must first file a claim with the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office (\u201cHCA-DRO\u201d). CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(a)(l)(i). The claimant must then file, within 90 days of filing the claim, a certificate of a qualified expert with \u201ca report of the attesting expert<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> attached.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\"> The expert certificate and report must attest that the treatment in question departed from the standard of care and that the departure was the proximate cause of the claimant\u2019s alleged injury. CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (No certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>or report need be filed if the sole issue is lack of informed consent. CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)). The expert report is an integral part of the certificate \u2014 the failure to attach an expert report is tantamount to filing no certificate at all. <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 578-79, 911 A.2d 427. Defending parties, if they contest liability, must then file their own expert certificate and report attesting to their compliance with the standard of care. CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(2), (3). The expert certificate and report requirement is a mechanism to reduce the number of frivolous claims by requiring the parties to substantiate the merit of their claims and defenses early in the process. <em>See Carroll v. Konits, </em>400 Md. 167, 199-201, 929 A.2d 19 (2007) (1986 amendment adding expert certificate requirement to HCMCA was \u201cintended to curtail frivolous malpractice claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Once the claimant has filed an expert certificate and report, the claimant may either proceed with arbitration or, in the alternative, unilaterally waive arbitration and file a complaint in a circuit court. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 3-2A-06B.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">A circuit court is to dismiss a complaint without prejudice if the claimant fails to timely file an expert certificate and report. CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i); <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 578-79, 911 A.2d 427. Although the statute mandates that the dismissal be without prejudice, a claimant may be barred from refiling if the statute of limitations has expired in the interim. To ameliorate the possibility that a claim dismissed without prejudice for failure to file a timely certificate might be barred by the concurrent running of the limitations period, the statute includes several provisions for enlarging the period of time for filing the expert certificate and report.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>failure to file both the certificate and report within the statutory period and any extension will result in dismissal of a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\n<em>C. Limitations for Malpractice Actions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\"><em>The Statute of Limitations </em>\u2014 CJ <em>\u00a7 5-109</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">A medical malpractice claim must be filed within the earlier of five years from the date the injury was committed or three years from the date the injury was discovered. CJ \u00a7 5-109(a). The filing of a claim with HCADRO in accordance with CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04 constitutes the filing of an action for statute of limitations purposes. CJ \u00a7 5-109(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\"><em>The Savings Provision </em>\u2014 CJ <em>\u00a7 5-119</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">CJ \u00a7 5-119 provides a limited exception to the limitations period when a civil action or claim has been dismissed once for failure to file an expert report in accordance with CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(3). In full, CJ \u00a7 5-119 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">(a) (1) This section does not apply to a voluntary dismissal of a civil action or claim by the party who commenced the action or claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">(2) This section applies only to a civil action or claim that is dismissed once for failure to file a report in accordance with \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(3) of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">(b) If a civil action or claim is commenced by a party within the applicable period of limitations and is dismissed without prejudice, the party may commence a new civil action or claim for the same cause against the same party or parties on or before the later of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(1) The expiration of the applicable period of limitations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">(2) 60 days from the date of the dismissal; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">(3) August 1, 2007, if the action or claim was dismissed on or after November 17, 2006, but before June 1, 2007.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Thus, if a claimant commences a medical malpractice claim within the period of limitations and the claim is dismissed without prejudice for failure to file an expert report, the claimant has up to 60 days to file a new civil action for the same cause against the same parties, even if the statute of limitations has otherwise run in the interim. This grace period does not apply, however, when there is a voluntary dismissal by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The issue in this case is whether a plaintiff is precluded under CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 119(a)(1) from refiling a dismissed claim under CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 119(b) when the voluntary dismissal is effected by a stipulation of dismissal. In other words, does the exclusion in CJ \u00a7 5-119(a)(l) of a \u201cvoluntary dismissal of a civil action or claim by the party who commenced the action\u201d encompass a voluntary dismissal by stipulation signed by all the parties?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">\n<em>D. Ms. Wilcox\u2019s Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">\n<em>Alleged malpractice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Petitioner Lydia Wilcox<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was referred to Respondent Tristan Orellano, a physician who practices general surgery, for treatment of suspected breast cancer in September 2004.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A biopsy confirmed the existence of cancer and Dr. Orellano performed an operation on her right breast on October 26, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>After the surgery, Ms. Wilcox experienced swelling and redness in her right breast. Her radiation oncologist was unable to begin radiation treatment because of the swelling and placed Ms. Wilcox on antibiotics to treat a suspected infection. Ms. Wilcox called Dr. Orellano twice in December 2004 complaining of the swelling and discomfort and discussed the swelling and redness at an appointment with him that month. Dr. Orellano advised her to remain on the antibiotics, wear a support bra, and seek further follow-up treatment with her radiation oncologist. Dr. Orellano did not prescribe any treatment. Ms. Wilcox last visited Dr. Orellano on January 26, 2005, when he again noted the continued swelling and redness and her inability to commence radiation treatment but prescribed no treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In March 2005, Ms. Wilcox moved to North Carolina and began seeing a new radiation oncologist. Ms. Wilcox received radiation therapy but the swelling and redness continued. In June 2005, tests confirmed that she had a MRSA infection.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The infection grew worse, and additional infections developed, necessitating treatment in August and September 2005. Ms. Wilcox was required to visit a medical facility on a daily basis for approximately nine months for treatment of the infected areas. On March 17, 2006, Ms. Wilcox had surgery to resolve the infections.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\n<em>First Claim and Voluntary Dismissal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Ms. Wilcox first filed a claim against Dr. Orellano with HCADRO on June 12, 2008. HCADRO granted an automatic 90-day extension under CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(ii), which allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Ms. Wilcox a total of 180 days from June 12, 2008 to early December to file an expert certificate and report. Ms. Wilcox requested and obtained an additional extension until December 26, 2008. On December 23, 2008 \u2014 three days before the expiration of that extension \u2014 Ms. Wilcox filed a certificate of a qualified expert, but did not attach an expert report.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Ms. Wilcox then waived arbitration and filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Howard County on May 14, 2009. The complaint alleged that Dr. Orellano was negligent in failing to diagnose and treat her post-surgical infection and included counts of negligence, breach of contract, and loss of consortium. Ms. Wilcox did not allege that Dr. Orellano was negligent in performing the initial surgery or that he had chosen an inappropriate surgical procedure. Dr. Orellano answered the complaint a month later.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In September 2009, Dr. Orellano moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to attach an expert report as required by CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(3). On October 14, 2009, before the court considered that motion, Ms. Wilcox voluntarily dismissed the complaint. Because an answer had already been filed, she needed to obtain the assent of Dr. Orellano. A stipulation of dismissal signed by the attorneys for both parties was filed to effectuate the voluntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\n<em>Second Claim and Dismissal on Limitations Grounds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Approximately a week after Ms. Wilcox dismissed her complaint in the Circuit Court for Howard County, she filed a second claim against Dr. Orellano with HCADRO. This claim not only alleged that Dr. Orellano was negligent in failing to treat her post-surgical infection, as her original claim had alleged, but also included new allegations that Dr. Orellano had been negligent in performing the surgery \u2014 in particular, that he had undertaken a surgical procedure greater in scope than had been recommended by Ms. Wilcox\u2019s treating oncologist and thereby increased the risk of infection. This time, Ms. Wilcox\u2019s claim was accompanied by an expert certificate with an expert report attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>In April 2010, Ms. Wilcox waived arbitration as to her second claim. On May 14, 2010, she filed a three-count complaint that was similar to her first complaint and that also included the new claim of negligence related to her initial surgery. This time, however, she filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County instead of the Circuit Court for Howard County.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Dr. Orellano moved to dismiss the complaint on limitations grounds. The Circuit Court initially denied that motion. The Circuit Court held that Ms. Wilcox\u2019s claim accrued by March 2006, at the latest, and therefore her claim had to be filed by March 2009. The Circuit Court reasoned that even though the second claim was not filed until October 2009, it was not barred by the statute of limitations because it was essentially an extension of the first claim filed in June 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Dr. Orellano sought reconsideration of his motion to dismiss after the Court of Special Appeals held, in <em>Bi v. Gibson, </em>205 Md.App. 263, 45 A.3d 305 (2012), that, if a civil action is voluntarily dismissed pursuant to Rule 2-506(a), any subsequent similar action must still be filed within the applicable period of limitations. In other words, the filing of the initial complaint did not toll limitations with respect to the second, similar complaint.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Circuit Court reconsidered and dismissed the complaint. The Circuit Court concluded that the statute of limitations expired at the latest in March 2009 and, given that Ms. Wilcox\u2019s second claim was not filed until October 2009, her complaint based on that claim was untimely. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The court concluded that her second claim did not come within the scope of CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 119(b) because she had voluntarily dismissed her first complaint and under CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 119(a)(1), the grace period did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Ms. Wilcox appealed the dismissal of her second complaint. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court in a reported decision. 217 Md.App. 417, 94 A.3d 127 (2014). We then granted a writ of certiorari to consider whether CJ \u00a7 5-119 provides relief from the running of limitations in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">This case presents a question of statutory interpretation. As indicated above, Ms. Wilcox asserts that her initial medical malpractice claim was filed within the period of limitations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Her second claim, which was initiated in October 2009 after dismissal of the first, was filed after the period of limitations would ordinarily expire. There is no dispute that CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 119(b) may provide relief from the expiration of the statute of limitations for up to 60 days when a timely-filed medical malpractice claim is dismissed without prejudice for failure to file an expert report. And there is no dispute that this grace period is not available in cases in which an initial complaint has been voluntarily dismissed. The only issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>concerns the interpretation of CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 119(a)(1)\u2014in particular, whether it forecloses application of the grace period in CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 119(b) when a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action voluntarily dismisses a complaint by means of a stipulation of dismissal, as opposed to a notice of dismissal. As this is a question of law, we accord no special deference to the decisions of the Circuit Court or Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\n<em>B. Whether the Savings Provision of CJ \u00a7 5-119 Applies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">As noted above, CJ \u00a7 5-119(a)(l) provides that \u201c[t]his section does <em>not </em>apply to a voluntary dismissal of a civil action or claim by the party who commenced the action or claim.\u201d (emphasis added). Ms. Wilcox voluntarily dismissed her initial action in the only way that she could without court permission, as Rule 2-506(a) requires the assent of the opposing party for a voluntary dismissal after an answer has been filed. Under a straightforward reading of CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 119(a)(1), the savings provision of CJ \u00a7 5-119(b) does not apply in this case because there was a \u201cvoluntary dismissal [of that action] by the party who commenced the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Ms. Wilcox advances two arguments why we should not read the statute this way. First, she argues that the reference to \u201cvoluntary dismissal\u201d in paragraph (a)(1) only encompasses a voluntary dismissal by a plaintiff without the assent of the opposing <em>party </em>\u2014 i.e., only a voluntary dismissal effected before the filing of an answer. Second, she argues that paragraph (a)(2) of the statute \u2014 which limits the savings provision to medical malpractice actions \u2014 somehow frees her case from the limitation of paragraph (a)(1). In our view, neither argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\n<em>Whether the usual definition of \u201cvoluntary dismissal\u201d applies for purposes of (a) (1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Ms. Wilcox asserts that, given the statute\u2019s remedial purpose of saving certain medical malpractice claims from the operation of the statute of limitations, the phrase \u201cvoluntary dismissal ... by the party who commenced the action or claim\u201d in paragraph (a)(1) should be construed to apply only to</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>a voluntary dismissal accomplished unilaterally by the plaintiff. However, the statute does not include its own special definition for \u201cvoluntary dismissal.\u201d In the absence of a special definition, we assume the Legislature used the phrase in accordance with its ordinary meaning. <em>Tatum v. Gigliotti, </em>321 Md. 623, 628, 583 A.2d 1062 (1991). In particular, when a phrase in a statute refers to a specific procedural mechanism, we presume that reference to be to the ordinary understanding of the procedural term. <em>See Dean v. Finder, </em>312 Md. 154, 161, 538 A.2d 1184 (1988) (\u201cwhen the term in a statute is a legal term, absent any legislative intent to the contrary, the term is presumed to be used in its legal sense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Ax1\">The longstanding Maryland rule on voluntary dismissals by \u201ca party who has filed a complaint\u201d encompasses a dismissal by stipulation after an answer has been filed. That was certainly the case when CJ \u00a7 5-119 was enacted in 2007. Chapter 324, Laws of Maryland 2007. The Legislature is presumed to be aware of the rule concerning voluntary dismissals by plaintiffs and, because the Legislature did not indicate to the contrary in the statute, it follows that the Legislature did not intend for some other meaning to apply for purposes of paragraph (a)(1).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A review of the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>files relating to the enactment of CJ \u00a7 5-119 discloses no indication that the Legislature intended any special or peculiar meaning of \u201cvoluntary dismissal.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Ms. Wilcox notes that the consequence of employing the usual meaning of \u201cvoluntary dismissal\u201d in the interpretation of paragraph (a)(1) is that the grace period in CJ \u00a7 5-119(b) does not apply unless the claim has been dismissed <em>by a court </em>at the behest of the opposing party. Ms. Wilcox argues that this result \u201cflouts common sense\u201d and that it could not have been the Legislature\u2019s intent to require a court to effect the dismissal because it is more efficient, both for the litigators and the court, to permit the parties to dismiss the claim by stipulation when it is clear that a dismissal is mandated. Ms. Wilcox argues that requiring judicial action to activate the savings provision wastes judicial resources and increases the cost of litigation, contrary to the purpose of the HCMCA. We are unpersuaded for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">First, Ms. Wilcox\u2019s argument is really a policy argument for allowing all voluntary dismissals based on a defective expert certificate to have the benefit of the savings provision \u2014 in other words, the Legislature should not have included paragraph (a)(1) in CJ \u00a7 5-119 at all. That is not our call.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Second, given that paragraph (a)(1) is in the statute and cannot be ignored, Ms. Wilcox\u2019s contention that it should be applied only to voluntary dismissals that can be effected without court permission or the assent of the adversary leads to arbitrary or nonsensical results. Consider the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>example. Plaintiff A files a medical malpractice action with a defective expert certificate. Plaintiff A realizes the defect almost immediately and voluntarily dismisses his complaint before an answer is filed pursuant to Rule 2-506 without need for the court\u2019s permission or the adversary\u2019s agreement. In the meantime, the period of limitations has expired. Even Ms. Wilcox would concede that Plaintiff A does not get the benefit of the savings provision and is barred from filing a new action.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Plaintiff B files an identical action with all other circumstances the same, except that Plaintiff B does not realize the defect in the complaint until the defendant has filed an answer (which perhaps, as in this case, asserts a limitations defense). Plaintiff B then voluntarily dismisses the complaint but under Rule 2-506 needs to do so by stipulation. Again, limitations has run. But under Ms. Wilcox\u2019s interpretation of paragraph (a)(1), unlike Plaintiff A, Plaintiff B would have the benefit of the savings provision and would not be barred from filing a new complaint. This would seemingly make the applicability of the savings provision turn on whether a defendant had filed an answer, an odd if not perverse result.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Finally, the facts of this case suggest a policy reason why the Legislature would not extend the savings provision to voluntary dismissals. The stipulation of dismissal in this case did not state the basis for the dismissal. The reason for the dismissal is critical because CJ \u00a7 5-119 applies \u201conly\u201d when the claim has been dismissed for failure to file an expert report in accordance with CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(3). <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 5-119(a)(2). While there seems little reason to doubt that the incomplete expert certificate was a motivating factor in the dismissal in this case, Ms. Wilcox did more than simply correct that defect. When the complaint was refiled, it was filed in a different circuit court. Moreover, the allegations of negligence had changed, now targeted for the first time at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>initial surgery in addition to the follow-up care. It may well be that the Legislature, in creating a safety valve \u201conly\u201d for actions dismissed because of an incomplete expert certificate, did not wish to allow the savings provision to be used to allow a plaintiff to do such things as amend a complaint outside the period of limitations or obtain a change of venue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\n<em>Whether (a)(2) negates the application of (a)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In an effort to find some support in the statutory language, Ms. Wilcox suggests that the two paragraphs that limit the scope of the statute in CJ \u00a7 5-119(a) operate in exclusive spheres. She asserts that the exclusion in paragraph (a)(1) for actions previously the subject of a dismissal does not apply to actions described in paragraph (a)(2) \u2014 the paragraph that limits the savings provision to medical malpractice actions. In effect, she is arguing that the statute contains two savings provisions \u2014 one for medical malpractice actions that is not limited by a prior voluntary dismissal and a second savings provision, presumably for all other civil actions, that is limited to cases where there has not been a prior voluntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">This interpretation finds no footing in the statute. Paragraph (a)(1) states that \u201cthis <em>section\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., CJ \u00a7 5-119 in its entirety \u2014 does not apply in a case where there was a previous voluntary dismissal. Paragraph (a)(2) states that \u201cthis section\u201d \u2014 again, CJ \u00a7 5-119 in its entirety \u2014 \u201capplies only\u201d to medical malpractice actions dismissed for failure to file an expert report. There is nothing contradictory in these two limitations, nor any language to suggest that one excludes the operation of the other. And there is nothing odd in stating scope limitations separately \u2014 those who comply with a traffic sign setting HOV lane restrictions are not exempt from a separate sign setting a speed limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Ms. Wilcox attempts an argument based on legislative history. She notes that the bill that ultimately enacted CJ \u00a7 5-119 originally would have created a grace period for the re-filing of any civil action that was terminated without a final judgment on the merits. Senate Bill 309 (2007), first reader. As the bill progressed through the General Assembly, it was narrowed in scope, as the Senate amended the bill to add what became paragraph (a)(1)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the House further amended it to add paragraph (a)(2) and limit the provision to medical malpractice actions dismissed once as a result of an incomplete expert report. She argues that, because paragraph (a)(2) was added to the bill after paragraph (a)(1), medical malpractice actions are not subject to the limitation of paragraph (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">If, as Ms. Wilcox contends, the Legislature had intended the savings provision of CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 119(b) to apply to medical malpractice claims regardless of the manner of dismissal, it would have eliminated paragraph (a)(1) when enacting paragraph (a)(2). The fact that it did not do so indicates that the Legislature intended to exclude from the savings provision any malpractice claim that had previously been voluntarily dismissed. <em>See </em>Fiscal and Policy Note (Revised) for Senate Bill 309 (2007) (stating that the bill authorizes a party to commence a new health care malpractice action but noting that the bill \u201cdoes not apply to a voluntary dismissal\u201d). Thus, the legislative history confirms what the statute\u2019s plain language indicates \u2014 that the savings provision does not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>any medical malpractice claim that was previously voluntarily dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Ms. Wilcox failed to file the required expert report to prosecute her first claim against Dr. Orellano and voluntarily dismissed her complaint. Her second claim, which resulted in the current action, was filed after the expiration of the relevant period of limitations and would ordinarily be barred on that ground. While the Legislature created a special savings provision for medical malpractice actions, it did not extend that grace period to actions that had previously been the subject of a voluntary dismissal. In our view, that exclusion encompasses a voluntary dismissal after a defendant has filed an answer, for which a plaintiff is required to obtain the assent of the defendant. Accordingly, Ms. Wilcox cannot rely on the saving provision of CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 119(b) to refile her untimely claim because she voluntarily dismissed her previous claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed.

At oral argument, counsel for Dr. Orellano advised that the 2006 surgery had been inaccurately described in their brief and other pleadings \u2014 and as a result, in the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals \u2014 as a mastectomy.

In <em>Bi, </em>the Court of Special Appeals reasoned that statutes of limitations are to be strictly construed and applied, subject to certain well-recognized exceptions, none of which applied to the case before it. The court further observed that the fact that Rule 2-506 allows for the voluntary dismissal of a complaint \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d itself provides no authority for extending a period of limitations. Neither party in this case questions the correctness of that decision. As noted earlier, the conclusion reached by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Bi </em>is consistent with the federal case law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41, on which Maryland Rule 2-506 is based. <em>See </em>Part I.A. of this opinion. In any event, the savings provision of CJ \u00a7 5-119(b) would be completely unnecessary if the filing of an initial action later voluntarily dismissed tolled limitations for a second similar action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b237-10\">. In his brief before us, Dr. Orellano argues that, regardless of the interpretation of CJ \u00a7 5-119(a), Ms. Wilcox's <em>first </em>claim related to the complaint filed in Howard County was itself barred by limitations. He further reasons that the grace period in CJ \u00a7 5-119(b) applies only \u201d[i]f a civil action or claim is commenced by a party within the applicable period of limitations\u201d and thus, the timeliness of the first claim is relevant to the applicability of CJ \u00a7 5-119(b). Although Dr. Orellano asserted unsuccessfully in the Circuit Court that the first claim was time-barred, this argument was not included in his brief in the Court of Special Appeals, or in a cross-petition for certiorari, and was first advanced in his brief to us. We need not resolve whether it was properly preserved for our review, given our resolution of the issue that clearly was preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\">. Ms. Wilcox attempts to draw a textual distinction between the statute and the rule. She notes that CJ \u00a7 5-119(a)(1) refers to a dismissal by <em>\"the </em>party\u201d that filed the action, while Rule 2-506(a) authorizes a voluntaiy dismissal by <em>\"a </em>party\u201d who has filed a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim. She argues that the definite article indicates that paragraph (a)(1) is limited to dismissals involving action by the plaintiff alone while the use of the indefinite article in the rule signals a broader usage, <em>i.e., </em>paragraph (a)(1) does not encompass dismissals by voluntary stipulation, as such cases are not dismissed by \"the\u201d party who filed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The rule is indeed broader, but not in the way that Ms. Wilcox suggests. The rule governs voluntary dismissals not only by the party that commenced the action by filing a complaint, but also dismissals by other parties, such as defendants who assert counterclaims, which may or may not have occurred in any particular case \u2014 therefore the reference to \"a party.\u201d The statute only concerns voluntary dismissals of complaints \u2014 a necessary pleading in any civil action \u2014 therefore, the reference to the \"the party\u201d that filed the complaint. The notion that the Legislature intended to limit the type of voluntary dismissal for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>purposes of CJ \u00a7 5-119(a)(1) in such an opaque manner as changing an \"a\u201d to \"the\u201d is just the sort of forced or subtle interpretation that a court construing a statute is to avoid. <em>See Baltimore Sun Co. v. Univ. of Maryland Med. Sys. Corp., </em>321 Md. 659, 669, 584 A.2d 683 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">In fact, to reach the ultimate conclusion she favors, Ms. Wilcox actually reads words into the <em>statute' </em>\u2014 i.e., that the limitation in (a)(1) applies to a voluntary dismissal \"by <em>only </em>the\" party that initiated the action. We shall not, however, read additional words into the statute. <em>See Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 572, 911 A.2d 427.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">. The legislative history of CJ \u00a7 5-119 is recounted in some detail by the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion. 217 Md.App. at 425-26, 94 A.3d 127.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\">. We set aside for the moment Ms. Wilcox's contention that paragraph (a)(1) does not apply to medical malpractice actions at all. That argument is discussed in the next section of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\">. To be clear, we are not ruling on whether Ms. Wilcox could have obtained change of venue or amended her original complaint to expand the allegations of negligence in a way that would relate back to the original filing. Rather, these circumstances illustrate that significant changes might be made in the course of a voluntary dismissal and refiling that might expand the effect of the savings provision beyond its intended purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b243-6\">. The Senate also amended the bill to clarify that the savings provision only applied if the dismissal of the action had been without prejudice. As noted by the Court of Special Appeals, the Senate presumably amended the legislation in response to testimony from interested parties that argued the legislation effectively eliminated the statute of limitations and created the potential for harassment of defendants by plaintiffs who could file, voluntarily dismiss, and re-file claims continuously. <em>See e.g., </em>Memorandum for Legislative Committee, Maryland Judicial Conference, to Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (Feb. 20, 2007) (arguing the proposed legislation would permit a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action for any reason, then refile, regardless of the statute of limitations). We note that a concern about repeated re-filings of dismissed complaints is, to some extent, unfounded as Rule 2-506(d) provides that a second notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
