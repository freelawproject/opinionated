Dashiell,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent, filed a complaint for declaratory <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and injunctive relief under the Maryland Public Information Act, Maryland Code (1984, 2010 Repl.Vol.), Sections 10-611 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against the Maryland State Police Department. Ms. Dashiell\u2019s complaint was based upon the State Police\u2019s refusal to provide her with records of an internal investigation conducted by them in response to a complaint Ms. Dashiell filed against Sergeant John Maiello of the State Police that was \u201csustained\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Judge Patrick J.

Maryland State Conference of NAACP Branches, </em>430 Md. 179, 59 A.3d 1037 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Teleta Dashiell had, in 2010, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County in which she alleged that Sergeant John Maiello of the State Police, during a search for a fugitive, had left a voicemail for her, which included a racially perverse reference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">13. On or about November 2, 2009, Ms. Dashiell was questioned by MSP officers during the MSP\u2019s search for an alleged fugitive. During this initial questioning, Ms. Dashiell informed the MSP that she did not know the location of the alleged fugitive and had no other information that would assist the MSP in its search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">14. On or about November 3, 2009, during the course of the MSP search, MSP Sergeant John Maiello called Ms. Dashiell and left the following message asking her to call him back: \u201cHey, it\u2019s Sergeant Maiello with the State Police. Call me back.\u201d Then, erroneously believing he had ended the call, Sergeant Maiello stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\"><em>Why, that\u2019s what I think about it, and I need to hear some shit like that ... That\u2019s when I say to myself, \u2018Oh my God ... I\u2019m listening to some God dang n[* </em>* * * <em>*J\u2019s voice mail play for 20 minutes.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">In addition to the use of the word <em>n </em>[*****] in the above statement, Sergeant Maiello was recorded using the slur a second time on Ms. Dashiell\u2019s voicemail. A second MSP officer can be heard laughing in the background.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Ms. Dashiell further alleged that she complained to the State Police, which investigated and disciplined Sergeant Maiello, the particulars of which were included in his personnel file, but the details of which were not disclosed to Ms. Dashiell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>15. On or about November 5, 2009, Ms. Dashiell contacted MSP Lieutenant Krah Plunkert, believing him to be the Commander of the Princess Anne Barrack, made a complaint regarding MSP Sergeant Maiello. At the time Ms. Dashiell made her complaint she gave a statement to MSP personnel, which she believes to have been recorded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">16. Ms. Dashiell\u2019s complaint was allegedly assigned to Detective Sergeant Kristi Meakin of the MSP Internal Affairs Section. Detective Sergeant Meakin allegedly investigated Ms. Dashiell\u2019s complaint regarding MSP Sergeant Maiello and later informed Ms. Dashiell that she had confirmed the allegations of derogatory racial comments made by Sergeant Maiello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">17. Upon information and belief, the MSP closed its alleged investigation into Ms. Dashiell\u2019s complaint on or about the second week of February 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">18. By letter to Ms. Dashiell dated February 17, 2010 from MSP Captain Kristina Nelson, the MSP stated that there exists an \u201cinvestigative file\u201d regarding Ms. Dashiell\u2019s complaint. This letter also indicated that, among other things, the MSP\u2019s alleged investigation confirmed Ms. Dashiell\u2019s allegations concerning Sergeant Maiello and stated that \u201c[a]s a result of these findings the appropriate disciplinary action was taken against Sergeant Maiello and documented in his personnel file.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">19. The MSP did not inform Ms. Dashiell of the details of the alleged investigation, or of the content of the MSP\u2019s files, including the results of any investigation into her complaint or whether (and to what extent) Sergeant Maiello was reprimanded or actually disciplined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Ms. Dashiell, thereafter, according to her complaint, sent a formal request to the State Police to inspect and copy various records related to the internal investigation of Sergeant Maiello:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">20. On March 2, 2010, following completion of MSP\u2019s alleged investigation of Ms. Dashiell\u2019s complaint, the ACLU of Maryland, acting on its own behalf and on behalf of Ms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Dashiell, sent a formal MPIA request to MSP Lieutenant Colonel Michael Fischer \u2014 believed to be the MSP custodian of records \u2014 seeking records from the MSP\u2019s closed investigation into Ms. Dashiell\u2019s complaint against Sergeant Maiello.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">21. Specifically, Ms. Dashiell and the ACLU requested to inspect and copy records pertaining to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">The internal investigation conducted by the Maryland State Police pursuant to the complaint lodged against Sergeant John Maiello by Teleta Dashiell on November 5, 2009, and closed the second week of February, 2010, relating to the offensive voicemail message left on Ms. Dashiell\u2019s cell phone on November 3, 2009, including, but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">a. Any documents, including video and/or audio recordings, obtained during the investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">b. Any document, including video and/or audio recordings created during the investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">c. Incident reports;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">d. Witness statements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">e. Charging documents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">f. Complaint control card;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-12\">g. Results of internal investigation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">h. Results of the review of findings of the internal investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-14\">22. Ms. Dashiell sought records concerning the MSP\u2019s handling of the complaint that she filed; where such records are classified as investigatory records, the MPIA makes them available for inspection by a \u201cperson of interest.\u201d The MPIA defines a \u201cperson in interest\u201d as \u201ca person or governmental unit that is the subject of a public record or a designee of the person or governmental unit____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">(emphasis in original). Ms. Dashiell\u2019s complaint further alleged that initially her request was returned stamped \u201caddressee unknown\u201d, because the identified custodian of records had retired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>23. The MSP returned the March 2, 2010 MPIA request to the ACLU stamped \u201caddressee unknown.\u201d Apparently, unbeknownst to Ms. Dashiell and the ACLU at the time the MPIA request was sent, Lieutenant Colonel Fischer had retired from the MSP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">24. The MSP returned the MPIA request, failing to even identify the new custodian, rather than deliver it to the current custodian of records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Ms. Dashiell, thereafter, according to her complaint, sent a new request to review the same records, which was denied \u201cin its entirety\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">25. Subsequently, the ACLU of Maryland, on its own behalf and on behalf of Ms. Dashiell, again submitted the MPIA request by letter dated March 11, 2010, this time with a copy to MSP Principal Counsel, Ronald M. Levitan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">26. By letter dated March 22, 2010, Mr. Levitan acknowledged receipt of the MPIA request by the MSP Custodian of Records, as well as himself, on March 17, 2010. He promised a response to the request within 30 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">27. On April 15, 2010, MSP responded in writing, declining Ms. Dashiell\u2019s MPIA request in its entirety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The complaint further stated that, after the State Police denied the request, Ms. Dashiell then sought, at minimum, a \u201cdetailed index of the records being withheld\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">28. By letter dated June 7, 2010, Dickstein Shapiro\u2014 having then become counsel for Ms. Dashiell along with the ACLU \u2014 sent the MSP a letter challenging the MSP\u2019s denial of Ms. Dashiell\u2019s MPIA request, and seeking, at the very least, a detailed index of the records being withheld, including a summary of each document, and a statement concerning the particular exemption that the MSP claims for each document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">29. The MSP refused, and continues to refuse, to produce any records stemming from Ms. Dashiell\u2019s complaint, or detailing its handling of that complaint, or an index of the documents it is withholding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The State Police moved to dismiss the complaint, or in the alternative, for summary judgment, arguing that it had \u201cproperly denied inspection of the records as it was required to do under the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, Md.Code Ann., Public Safety \u00a7\u00a7 3-101-3-113 (\u201cLEOBR\u201d)[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>], and the mandatory personnel [record] exemption of the [M]PIA, Md. Code Ann., State Government \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) <em>[</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>]\u201d. </em>Discretionary denial of disclosure was also authorized, the State Police alleged, \u201cunder the [M]PIA\u2019s permissive denial provisions for intra-agency memoranda, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10 \u2014 618(b) [<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>], and investigatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>records, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>].\u201d Ms. Dashiell, conversely, argued that the information she requested was not exempt from disclosure under the Act, and further, that the State Police had failed to meet its burden to justify its failure to disclose the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">A hearing was held before Judge Cavanaugh, who granted the State Police\u2019s motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">This is a case where Ms. Dashiell filed suit against the State Police alleging violation of the Maryland Public Information Act. Suit was filed on October 27, 2010. Prior to filing suit, they inquired of the Maryland State Police as to what actions they had taken regarding this incident. The Maryland State Police were required to respond on February 17, 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">Maryland State Police Captain [Kristina Nelson] sent a letter to Ms. Dashiell stating \u2014 I\u2019m not quoting \u2014 in response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>to her inquiry there was an investigative file created regarding Ms. Dashiell\u2019s complaint. Second, that the Maryland State Police confirmed Ms. Dashiell\u2019s allegations, and third, that appropriate disciplinary action was taken against Sergeant Maiello, and documented in his personnel file as stated in the letter of February 17, 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">Shortly thereafter, March 2, 2010, Ms. Dashiell, through her counsel, requested, one \u2014 facts gathered during the investigation itself, and an Internal Affairs Investigation. Two \u2014 witnesses\u2019 statements, incident reports, documents obtained or created during the investigation, and again, an Internal Affairs Investigation, the results of the Internal Affairs Investigation, and five \u2014 the results of the review findings of the Internal Investigation. That\u2019s what counsel is asking for. Basically, that\u2019s what the suit is asking for. All five of these items are contained in the man\u2019s personnel file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">The law is very clear. The personnel record is confidential.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]The only exceptions that I see in the case law involve criminal cases, such as <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287 [730 A.2d 181 (1999) ] <em>Baltimore City Police v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 273. These Internal Affairs Investigation records are clearly personnel records under Section 10-616, the State Government section of the annotated code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">It clearly states they shall deny \u2014 unless you got a criminal case involving constitutional issues usually related to the Sixth or Fourteenth Amendment. There\u2019s no question in my mind based upon Ms. Dashiell\u2019s attorney\u2019s requests they are looking for a result of an internal investigation by the Maryland State Police, and everything they are looking for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>is personnel records which are confidential and are protected. Therefore, I\u2019m granting the motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">An order, thereafter, was entered, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">Upon consideration of the Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment, and any response thereto, a hearing having been held, for good cause having been shown, it is this 24th day of June, 2011;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">ORDERED, that the Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is Granted with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Ms. Dashiell noted an appeal. The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, vacated the ruling and remanded the case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Dashiell v. Maryland State Police Dep\u2019t, </em>219 Md.App. 647, 672-73, 101 A.3d 562, 577 (2014). Our intermediate court, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>NAACP Branches, </em>430 Md. at 190, 59 A.3d at 1043, concluded that <em>\u201cNAACP Branches </em>requires the trial court to determine whether each requested document in the investigatory record is exempt from disclosure under any provision of the MPIA advanced by the [State Police], and if exempt, whether any such document is subject to disclosure as severable under SG \u00a7 10-614(b)(3)(iii)[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>].\u201d <em>Dashiell, </em>219 Md.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>666, 101 A.3d at 573. The Court of Special Appeals, relying on <em>NAACP Branches, </em>also emphasized that \u201c[t]he plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 10-616(a) and 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) authorizes redactions so that the applicant can receive portions of an exempt record which are severable and the receipt of which does not violate the substance of the exemption\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 669,101 A.3d at 575 (emphasis removed), and concluded that the Circuit Court erred in failing to require the State Police to create an index of the withheld documents and, in addition, not conducting an <em>in camera </em>review of the documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">Given the state of the record before us in the instant case, we conclude that we cannot conduct a review of the legality or propriety of the MSP\u2019s refusal to disclose the requested documents in the investigative file created as a result of appellant\u2019s complaint. Without the identification of each withheld document, along with detailed information about it, appellant was not able to develop cogent arguments regarding whether a particular document is exempt or severable. Without such identification and detailed information, or an <em>in camera </em>review of the withheld documents, the trial court did not have a sufficient factual basis to determine the applicability of an exemption to such documents, and if exempt, the severability of any portion thereof. Finally, the lack of identification and information about the withheld documents precluded the trial court from determining, as occurred in <em>NAACP Branches, </em>whether any redactions agreed to by appellant would remove a particular document from an exemption or would make such document severable from other exempt documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 672, 101 A.3d at 577. Our intermediate appellate court also addressed Ms. Dashiell\u2019s argument that she constituted a \u201cperson in interest\u201d under the Public Information Act, and determined that she was not because, although she was \u201cthe complainant who triggered the investigation by the [State Police], [she was] not the subject of the investigation itself. Sergeant Maiello was the subject of the investigation, and thus a \u2018person in interest\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 662,101 A.3d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>We granted certiorari to address the issue raised by the State Police as to whether it properly denied disclosure of the internal investigation records under the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exemption of the Public Information Act. We also granted Ms. Dashiell\u2019s cross-petition to consider if Ms. Dashiell, in her role as a complaining individual, could be considered the subject of an investigation, such that she is a \u201cperson of interest\u201d under the Act. 441 Md. 61,105 A.3d 489 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In the present case, Ms. Dashiell had requested specific records from the State Police, such records relating to \u201c[t]he internal investigation conducted by the Maryland State Police pursuant to the complaint lodged against Sergeant John Maiello by Teleta Dashiell on November 5, 2009, and closed the second week of February, 2010, relating to the offensive voicemail message left on Ms. Dashiell\u2019s cell phone on November 3, 2009\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">a. Any documents, including video and/or audio recordings,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">obtained during the investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">b. Any document, including video and/or audio recordings,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">created during the investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">c. Incident reports;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">d. Witness statements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">e. Charging documents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">f. Complaint control card;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">g. Results of internal investigation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-14\">h. Results of the review of findings of the internal investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">The Circuit Court Judge determined that the requested records constituted \u201cpersonnel records\u201d of Sergeant Maiello, which were mandatorily exempt under the Public Information Act. The Court of Special Appeals disagreed to the extent that the intermediate appellate court concluded that the Circuit Court erred in faffing to require the State Police to create an index of the withheld documents and, in addition, by not conducting an <em>in camera </em>review of the documents, with a view to whether the documents could be redacted so as to render them disclosable under <em>NAACP Branches.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Before addressing the merits of this case, we must first address a procedural matter, because a judgment declaring the rights of the parties was not entered in the present case. This case comes to us as an appeal from a declaratory judgment action, in which the trial court must have entered \u201ca declaratory judgment, defining the rights and obligations of the parties or the status of the thing in controversy, and that judgment must be in writing and in a separate document.\u201d <em>Montgomery Cnty. Maryland v. Shropshire, </em>420 Md. 362, 371 n. 7, 23 A.3d 205, 210 n. 7 (2011), quoting <em>Lovell Land v. State Highway Admin., </em>408 Md. 242, 256, 969 A.2d 284, 292 (2009). \u201c[WJhether a declaratory judgment action is decided for or against the plaintiff, there should be a declaration in the judgment or decree defining the rights of the parties under the issues made.\u201d <em>Case v. Comptroller, </em>219 Md. 282, 288, 149 A.2d 6, 9 (1959); <em>accord Baltimore Cnty. v. Baltimore Cnty. Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 4, </em>439 Md. 547, 566, 96 A.3d 742, 753 (2014), <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 608, 937 A.2d 242, 254 (2007). In <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. 106,117 n. 1, 767 A.2d 831, 837 n. 1 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">Once again, we are presented with a declaratory judgment action in which there is no written declaratory judgment. We have admonished trial courts that, when a declaratory judgment action is brought and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, the court must enter a declaratory judgment and that judgment, defining the rights and obligations of the parties or the status of the thing in controversy, <em>must be in writing. </em>It is not permissible for the court to issue an oral declaration. The text of the judgment must be in writing. <em>See Harford Mutual Ins. Co. v. Woodfin, </em>344 Md. 399, 414-15, 687 A.2d 652, 659 (1997); <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 87, 660 A.2d 447, 455 (1995); <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 435, 644 A.2d 34, 38 (1994). Nor, since the 1997 amendment to Maryland Rule 2-601(a), is it permissible for the declaratory judgment to be part of a memorandum. That rule requires that \u201c[e]ach judgment shall be set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>on a separate document.\u201d When entering a declaratory judgment, the court must, in a separate document, state in writing its declaration of the rights of the parties, along -with any other order that is intended to be part of the judgment. Although the judgment may recite that it is based on the reasons set forth in an accompanying memorandum, the terms of the declaratory judgment itself must be set forth separately. Incorporating by reference an earlier oral ruling is not sufficient, as no one would be able to discern the actual declaration of rights from the document posing as the judgment.

In the case, the Montgomery County Office of the Inspector General sought to obtain records of a police department internal affairs investigation into transgressions allegedly committed by Sergeant Edward Shropshire and Captain Willie Parker-Loan. The Internal Affairs Division of the County Police Department had determined that Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan \u201chad committed no administrative violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 23 A.3d at 207. After the Inspector General had sought the records, Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan resisted disclosure, arguing that the records were exempt from disclosure under the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exemption of the Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">We determined that the internal investigatory affairs records involving Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan were related to employee discipline and were, therefore, \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exempt from disclosure, pursuant to Section 10 \u2014 616(i). <em>Id. </em>at 383, 23 A.3d at 218. We recognized that \u201crecords of internal investigations contain significant personal information, such as the investigated officer\u2019s name, date of birth, address, social security number, level of education, as well as the complaint, transcripts of witness interviews, and the investigator\u2019s notes, that if disclosed, could be potentially detrimental to not only the officers, but also the witnesses\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 23 A.3d at 217. We also recognized there is a \u201csignificant public interest in maintaining confidentiality,\u201d when the officer is cleared of wrongdoing. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 23 A.3d at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We distinguished <em>Shropshire </em>from the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Maryland Dep\u2019t of State Police v.

Records of alleged systemic racial profiling by a police department as a whole clearly are differentiated from records investigating alleged administrative rule violations by identified police officers in connection with a specific incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><em>Shropshire, </em>420 Md. at 382-83, 23 A.3d at 217. We held that \u201c[i]n sum, the internal affairs records involving alleged administrative rule violations by Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan are \u2018personnel records\u2019 pursuant to Section 10-616(i) of the State Government Article, and are, therefore, mandatorily exempt from disclosure by the custodian of records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 23 A.3d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Subsequently, we issued an opinion in <em>NAACP Branches, </em>430 Md. at 190, 59 A.3d at 1043, in which, we affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s Order releasing records omitting personal details of State Police internal investigations of 94 complaints concerning the use of racial profiling between 2003 and 2007. In a prior case between the NAACP and State Police, the parties had entered into a consent agreement, \u201cobligat[ing] the State Police to provide the NAACP with quarterly reports containing detailed information on the number, nature, location and disposition of complaints alleging racial profiling\u201d which was incorporated into an order of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 182 n. 1, 59 A.3d at 1038 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The NAACP, thereafter, requested inspection of documents \u201cobtained or created in connection with any complaint of racial profiling\u201d, in order to verify if the State Police had been complying with its obligations under the court order. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 59 A.3d at 1039. The State Police refused to disclose the records, claiming the records constituted \u201cpersonnel records\u201d pursuant to Section 10 \u2014 616(i) of the Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The NAACP then brought an action for declaratory relief to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. After hearing arguments, the Circuit Court Judge ordered the State Police to submit the documents for his <em>in camera </em>review, after which he determined that if identifying information was redacted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the records, the release of the records would not constitute an invasion of privacy. Although the records constituted \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under the Act, according to the Judge, the records could be disclosed if identifying information was redacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">In affirming the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals, we rejected the State Police\u2019s argument that the redacted records still would constitute \u201cpersonnel records\u201d of an individual, opining \u201c[ajfter the names of State Police troopers, the names of complainants, and all identifying information are redacted, the records clearly do not fall within the statutory language of \u2018record[s] of an individual.\u2019 There would be no \u2018individual\u2019 identified in the redacted records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 59 A.3d at 1046 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">After sifting through the statute and our cases, the State Police argues, as it did before the Court of Special Appeals, that the internal affairs investigatory records of Sergeant Maiello constitute \u201cpersonnel records\u201d, subject to the mandatory denial of disclosure, pursuant to Section 10-616(i), because the records are related to the \u201chiring, discipline, promotion, dismissal, or any matter involving an employee\u2019s status\u201d, relying on <em>Shropshire, </em>420 Md. at 378, 23 A.3d at 215, citing <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Ms. Dashiell argues that the requested records do not constitute \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under Section 10 \u2014 616(i) of the Act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Ms. Dashiell argues that even were the requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>records to constitute \u201cpersonnel records\u201d, then disclosure would not result in an unwarranted invasion of Sergeant Maiello\u2019s personal privacy under Section \u00a7 10 \u2014 612(b), because Sergeant Maiello\u2019s identity is already a matter of public record. Ms. Dashiell also contends that because her complaint against Sergeant Maiello was sustained, <em>Shropshire </em>is inapposite because the instant records \u201creveal <em>proven misconduct </em>by a state trooper.\u201d Ms. Dashiell next argues that the requested records pertain to the actions of a state trooper engaging in racial animus, and thus public policy would favor the transparency of the internal affairs process and the records generated therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In essence, the present situation presents us initially with the issue of whether the disclosure should occur under the Public Information Act of internal affairs records of a specifically identified officer where the complaint against the officer was sustained and the officer was identified by the complainant in a public forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">It is clear that under our jurisprudence a \u201cpersonnel record\u201d under the Act pertains to discipline of an employee. <em>See Shropshire, </em>420 Md. at 381, 23 A.3d at 216 (\u201c[BJecause the internal affairs records involving [two specifically identified officers] related to employee discipline, the records are indeed \u2018personnel records\u2019 exempt from disclosure pursuant to Section 10 \u2014 616(i) of the State Government Article.\u201d); <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d at 200 (\u201cpersonnel records\u201d may constitute records involving the \u201chiring, discipline, promotion, dismissal, or any matter involving his status as an employee.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The internal affairs records in this case are specific to Sergeant Maiello, and thus are \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under <em>Shropshire </em>and <em>Kirwan </em>and its progeny. The holding of <em>NAACP Branches, </em>is inapposite, because the instant records, even were redaction possible (which is highly unlikely), would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>be related to a specific identified individual. <em>See NAACP Branches, </em>430 Md. at 195, 59 A.3d at 1046 (\u201cAfter the names of State Police troopers, the names of complainants, and all identifying information are redacted, the records clearly do not fall within the statutory language of \u2018record[s] of an individual.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. Saginaw Cnty. Sheriff, </em>204 Mich.App. 215, 514 N.W.2d 213, 219 (1994), citing <em>Hunt v. FBI, </em>972 F.2d 286, 288 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cHad plaintiff requested the internal affairs records pertaining to a particular individual, redaction would serve no purpose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Because the records requested by Ms. Dashiell relate to discipline of Sergeant Maiello, they are \u201cpersonnel records\u201d and exempt from disclosure under Section 10-616(i) of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Ms. Dashiell argues, nevertheless, that the Act protects only against the unwarranted invasion of privacy of Sergeant Maiello, and Sergeant Maiello has already been identified as the actor in the incident under investigation. The fact that Ms. Dashiell identified Sergeant Maiello in a public forum does not undermine the importance of preserving a public employee\u2019s privacy in personal information in the records requested, namely, documents obtained or created during the investigation, incident reports, witness statements, charging documents, the complaint control card, the results of the internal investigation and the results of the review of findings of the internal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Ms. Dashiell also argues that the sustained finding against Sergeant Maiello undercuts the applicability of the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exemption. Knowing that the investigation resulted in a sustained finding, however, does not change the nature of the records sought with respect to the discipline imposed and the process for arriving at such discipline. The Court of Appeals of New York arrived at the same conclusion when it addressed the issue of disclosure of police officers\u2019s names who were involved in an off-duty egg throwing incident, when the charges were sustained. <em>Daily Gazette Co. v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>Schenectady, </em>93 N.Y.2d 145, 688 N.Y.S.2d 472, 710 N.E.2d 1072, 1078 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The plain language of the Public Information Act, also, does not differentiate between \u201csustained\u201d and \u201cunsustained\u201d complaints. A determination that a sustained finding requires disclosure of personnel information, though, would affect all public employees, not only the police force. Further, mandatory disclosure of personnel information related to sustained findings could chill the disciplinary process, rendering those in control less willing to sustain a finding of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Most troubling is the argument regarding whether the use of a racial epithet obviates the application of the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exemption to the requested records. Although Sergeant Maiello\u2019s voicemail message is repugnant to our sensibilities, we do not consider the substance of the employee\u2019s actions in determining whether the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exemption applies. It is noteworthy that in <em>NAACP Branches, </em>we did not consider racial animus in our decision, although it was foundationally a part of the context of the case. Because the Act itself does not differentiate among the bases for internal affairs investigations and the records emanating therefrom, we will not.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">With respect to whether the Circuit Court should conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the records as ordered by the Court of Special Appeals, we disagree. The requested records constitute \u201cpersonnel records\u201d pursuant to Section 10-616(i) of the State Government Article, and <em>in camera </em>review cannot alter that decision, nor may redaction be effective under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">After having decided that the requested records are \u201cpersonnel records\u201d and, thus, exempt from disclosure, we need not address Ms. Dashiell\u2019s claim that, as the complainant, she is a \u201cperson in interest\u201d under the \u201cinvestigatory records\u201d exemption of the Maryland Public Information Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>so, however, to prevent confusion when the case is remanded to the Circuit Court for entry of a declaratory judgment regarding the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Section 10-618 of the State Government Article, entitled \u201cPermissible denials\u201d dictates that \u201ca custodian may deny inspection\u201d of certain records, most significantly in this case, records of investigations conducted by a police department, but only to \u201ca person in interest ... to the extent that the inspection would\u201d either \u201cinterfere with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding\u201d, \u201cdeprive another person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication\u201d, \u201cconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d, \u201cdisclose the identity of a confidential source\u201d, \u201cdisclose an investigative technique or procedure\u201d, \u201cprejudice an investigation\u201d, or \u201cendanger the life or physical safety of an individual\u201d. Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f).

The Court of Special Appeals, specifically, determined \u201c[Ms. Dashiell] here is the complainant who triggered the investigation by the [State Police], and not the subject of the investigation itself. Sergeant Maiello was the subject of the investigation, and thus a \u2018person in interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dashiell, </em>219 Md.App. at 662,101 A.3d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">As we explained in <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v.

In sustaining a complaint against one of its officers, a law enforcement agency acknowledges the truth of the very facts that \u201cdirectly pertain to employment and [the officer's ability to perform [his or her] job.\u201d <em>Washington Post, </em>360 Md. at 547, 759 A.2d at 264 (quoting <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d at 200). In contrast to such facts, the discipline that the law enforcement agency decides to administer to the officer does not directly pertain to employment or the officer\u2019s ability to perform his or her job. Plainly put, the officer did what the officer did, regardless of how the law enforcement agency decided to respond. The administration of the discipline is an action of \u2014 and thus reflects the judgment of \u2014 the law enforcement agency, not the officer. Thus, a record of discipline based on a sustained complaint against a law enforcement officer is not a personnel record; instead, it is among the very types of document that the Public Information Act is designed to make available to the public: a document that reflects how a public agency responds to an employee\u2019s proven misconduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>In addition to being the result that the law mandates, acknowledging the public\u2019s right to know how law enforcement agencies respond to sustained allegations of misconduct is critical to preserving the public\u2019s confidence in law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Judge GREENE has authorized me to state that he joins in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\">. I agree with the Majority that: (1) this Court should exercise its discretion to review this case's merits and remand for the entry of an appropriate declaratory judgment, <em>see </em>Maj.

Safety (2003, 2011 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 3-104(n)(l)(ii)l, which is part of the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, does not exempt from the Public Information Act a record of discipline based on a sustained complaint against a law enforcement officer, <em>see </em>Maj.

Making public a record of discipline based on a sustained complaint against a law enforcement officer would not \u201cchill\u201d the law enforcement disciplinary process. Maj. Op. at 459, 117 A.3d at 15. By the time that a complaint against a law enforcement officer has been sustained, an investigation has already concluded, and all that remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>is for the law enforcement agency to choose what discipline to administer.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Additionally, in <em>Daily Gazette Co. v. City of Schenectady, </em>93 N.Y.2d 145, 688 N.Y.S.2d 472, 710 N.E.2d 1072, 1078 (1999), see Maj. Op. at 459, 117 A.3d at 15, the Court of Appeals of New York concluded that records of discipline based on law enforcement officers' confirmed misconduct were exempt from New York\u2019s Freedom of Information Law under its \"personnel records\u201d exemption, but the fact that the misconduct was confirmed was not the basis of that Court's holding. In <em>Daily Gazette, </em>instead of addressing the critical circumstance that the law enforcement officers\u2019 misconduct had been confirmed, the Court of Appeals of New York focused on rejecting a newspaper's contention that \"the identity, statusf] and purpose of the [party] requesting access\u201d was relevant, 688 N.Y.S.2d 472, 710 N.E.2d at 1076; for example, the newspaper had contended that the record was not exempt because the newspaper did not intend to \"use the records in a legal proceeding,\u201d <em>id., </em>688 N.Y.S.2d 472, 710 N.E.2d at 1074. In other words, the Court of Appeals of New York failed to address the vital distinction between confirmed misconduct and unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct. By contrast, this Court has already explicitly recognized that distinction. <em>See Shropshire, </em>420 Md. at 374 n. 12, 23 A.3d at 212 n. 12 (This Court expressly declined to \"address whether records of 'sustained' complaints may be disclosed[.]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
