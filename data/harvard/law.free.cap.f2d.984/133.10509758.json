Finding that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and that the Corps is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-27\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b193-28\">Valley Construction Co. (Appellant) bids competitively on military and civil construction projects procured by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Appellee) and other U.S. agencies. Appellant is a small business concern within the meaning of 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 632,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but is not a socially and economically disadvantaged small business concern as defined in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These disadvantaged small business concerns are known as \u201c8(a)\u201d contractors, and may bid on contracts that are exclusively designated for the Small Business Administration\u2019s 8(a) Program.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Appellee sought to open bidding on a contract to build the Dewayne Hayes/Stin-son Creek Project (the contract), a recreation park to be built in Mississippi. Ap-pellee offered the contract to the SBA and, after considering the factors enumerated in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.804-1,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellee designated the contract for exclusive bidding by 8(a) contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Appellant, desiring to bid on the contract, sued alleging that the Corps failed to conduct a required proportional impact analysis to determine any possible effect exclusion would have on small business non-8(a) contractors, such as Appellant. Appellant argued that this failure caused Appellee to designate the contract for 8(a) contractors in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Appellant sought and was granted a temporary restraining order to prevent Appellee from awarding the contract. Appellant then sought a preliminary injunction, which was denied. Thereafter both parties requested summary judgment, and the district court ruled in favor of Appellee. Appellant appeals this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Summary judgment is appropriate if the record discloses \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In reviewing the summary judgment, we apply the same standard of review as did the district court. <em>Wattman v. International Paper Co., </em>875 F.2d 468, 474 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Moore v. Mississippi Valley State Univ., </em>871 F.2d 545, 548 (5th Cir.1989). We must \u201creview the facts drawing all inferences most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Reid v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>784 F.2d 577, 578 (5th Cir.1986). If the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>see Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\n<em>Impact Analysis Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">No impact analysis was conducted for this contract. Appellant argues that 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.804-l(2)(e) requires Appellee to conduct an impact analysis prior to offering the contract into the SBA\u2019s 8(a) Program.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellee responds that \u00a7 19.804-l(2)(e) only requires Appellee to consider whether the work being set aside for the 8(a) Program has \u201cpreviously been acquired using small business set-asides.\u201d Appellee has interpreted this regulation to require impact analysis only when a contract previously available to all small businesses is redesignated as an exclusive 8(a) contract, thereby causing a non-8(a) small business to lose the contract; such analysis does not apply to new, non-recurring construction contracts because \u201ca business cannot be historically dependent on a contract that it has never in fact obtained or performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">It is well settled that we must respect Appellee\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 19.804-1(2)(e) if it is reasonable, even if we may have interpreted the regulation differently. <em>Kinnet Dairies, Inc. v. Farrow, </em>580 F.2d 1260, 1270 (5th Cir.1978) (quoting <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 4, 85 S.Ct. 792, 795, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965)). Appellee\u2019s interpretation of the regulation to require impact analysis only when recurring contracts are redesignated as exclusively available to 8(a) contractors is well-reasoned. Furthermore, it is consistent with the plain meaning of the regulation, which states that Appellee should consider whether \u201cthe items or work have previously been acquired using small business set-asides.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.804-1(2)(e). The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Finding that Appellee is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 632(a) states in part \u2018\u2018[f]or the purposes of this chapter, a small business concern, ... shall be deemed to be one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637(a)(5) states \u201c[s]ocially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637(a)(6)(A) states in part \u201d[e]co-nomically disadvantaged individuals are those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\">. 48 C.F.R.

Appellant relies upon <em>Fordice Construction Co. v. Marsh, </em>773 F.Supp. 867 (S.D.Miss.1990). Not only is <em>Fordice </em>factually distinguishable from this case, but it is non-binding on this court. We are not persuaded to follow the reasoning in <em>Fordice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
