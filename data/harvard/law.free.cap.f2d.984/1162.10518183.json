For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-30\">I. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-31\">Johns was indicted by a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Georgia charging him (1) with possession of a shotgun with a barrel length of less than eighteen inches, which was not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d); and (2) with being a felon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). After a jury trial, Johns was convicted of both counts of the indictment. The district court sentenced Johns to 120 months\u2019 incarceration on count one and 235 months\u2019 incarceration on count two, with the sentences to run concurrently. Johns was also sentenced to a term of thirty-six months of supervised release, a $17,500.00 fine and a $100.00 special assessment. Johns then perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-4\">\n<em>II.Background Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">On September 23, 1991, at approximately 4:30 p.m., Lt. James Gagiliolo of the Helen, Georgia, Police Department was dispatched to Unicoi State Park to assist in stopping a vehicle. Lt. Gagiliolo observed a vehicle fitting the description of the one he was seeking and eventually stopped it. Johns was the sole occupant of the vehicle. Johns got out of the vehicle and put his hands up. For security reasons, Lt. Gagi-liolo looked in the cab on the passenger\u2019s side, and in plain view, he observed a shotgun on the floorboard of the pickup truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">The next day, Johns was interviewed by additional law enforcement officers, at which time he claimed that he had received a bump on the head and did not remember anything. Johns was read his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights and acknowledged understanding his rights. Because he could not remember his name, Johns placed an \u201cX\u201d in place of his signature on the waiver of rights form. Later that same day, in a second interview, Johns claimed that he and \u201cHarold\u201d had driven into the mountains and that Harold had hit Johns on the head and jumped from the vehicle. Johns did not know \u201cHarold\u2019s\u201d last name. Johns was also offered medical attention but declined it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">The vehicle that Johns w.as driving at the time he was arrested was a maroon 1971 Datsun pickup truck. William Hawkins (\u201cHawkins\u201d) was the owner, of that vehicle. Hawkins testified that the vehicle was stolen on September 19, 1991. Moreover, he testified that Johns did not have permission to have his pickup truck and that the shotgun in Hawkins\u2019 vehicle, at the time of Johns\u2019 arrest, did not belong to Hawkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">The shotgun retrieved from the pickup truck had a barrel length of just under fifteen and one-half inches, and it was operational. It was not registered to Johns in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-11\">The parties stipulated at trial that Johns was a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-12\">\n<em>III.Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-13\">In this appeal, Johns presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-14\">(1) Whether the district court erred in instructing the jury to \u201clet their verdict speak the truth;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-15\">(2) Whether the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence that the vehicle Johns was driving at the time of his arrest was stolen; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-16\">(3) Whether United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.4 violates the due process or equal protection provisions of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-17\">\n<em>IV.Standards of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-18\">A district court\u2019s instructions to the jury are erroneous only if the charge as a whole did not sufficiently instruct the jurors so that they understood the issues involved and were not misled. <em>United States v. Hooshmand, </em>931 F.2d 725, 733 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-19\">A district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence is reviewable under the clear abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Williford, </em>764 F.2d 1493, 1497 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-20\">The district court's determination that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) does not violate Johns\u2019 due process and equal protection rights is a question of law to be reviewed under the tie <em>novo </em>standard of review. <em>See Hooshmand, </em>931 F.2d at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>V. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">Having carefully reviewed the record and the briefs, we see no merit to the first two issues raised by Johns in this appeal and, accordingly, summarily affirm the district court as to those issues. The sentencing issue, however, involves a question of first impression in this circuit. Accordingly, we address that issue in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Johns contended at his sentencing that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it takes into account a defendant\u2019s criminal record in calculating both his criminal history and his offense level. For that reason, Johns objected to the district court sentencing him under that provision. The district court overruled Johns\u2019 objection and sentenced him pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Although this case presents an issue of first impression in this circuit, arguments that the armed career criminal sentencing scheme is unconstitutional on the basis of due process and equal protection violations have been flatly rejected by all courts of appeal which have considered the issue. <em>See, e.g., United States v. John, </em>936 F.2d 764, 766 n. 2 (3d Cir.1991) (due process); <em>United States v. Hayden, </em>898 F.2d 966, 967 (5th Cir.1990) (equal protection); <em>United States v. Baker, </em>850 F.2d 1365, 1372 (9th Cir.1988) (equal protection); <em>United States v. Clawson, </em>831 F.2d 909, 915 (9th Cir.1987), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>488 U.S. 923, 109 S.Ct. 303, 102 L.Ed.2d 323 (1988) (equal protection); <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>902 F.2d 1311, 1313 (8th Cir.1990) (due process); <em>United States v. Pinto, </em>875 F.2d 143, 144 (7th Cir.1989) (due process). Additionally, we have held generally that the Sentencing Guidelines are constitutional and do not violate due process. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>956 F.2d 248, 250 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">Moreover, Congress directed the Sentencing Commission to \u201cassure, that [for career offenders] the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 994(h) (West Supp.1992). The career offender scheme of using a defendant\u2019s criminal record in considering both his offense level and his criminal history under the Sentencing Guidelines bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose \u2014 \u201cto prevent repeat offenders from continuing to victimize society.\u201d <em>John, </em>936 F.2d at 766-67 n. 2. Consequently, Johns\u2019 due process claim lacks merit. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Erves, </em>880 F.2d 376, 379 (11th Cir.1989) (rejecting both procedural and substantive due process attacks on sentencing guidelines); <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>811 F.2d 210, 217 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 833, 108 S.Ct. 110, 98 L.Ed.2d 69 (1987) (holding sentencing enhancement scheme in armed career criminal amendment to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1202(a) constitutional). Defendant\u2019s equal protection claim is equally lacking in merit. <em>See Clawson, </em>831 F.2d at 915; <em>Baker, </em>850 F.2d at 1372. Accordingly, we hold Johns\u2019 sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 does not violate due process or equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Johns\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">. <em>Miranda v.
