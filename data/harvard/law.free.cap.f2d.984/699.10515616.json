We affirm, relying on the reasons stated by the magistrate and adopted by the district court as to all claims, except plaintiff\u2019s use of force claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Jackson, previously a prisoner confined in the Jefferson County Jail, based his excessive use of force claim on the following facts. While in prison, Jackson started a fire with a match and the core of a role of toilet paper. The fire alarm went off, prompting prison officials to take action. One official arrived with a fire extinguisher. The fire had already gone out by the time he arrived; nonetheless, the official sprayed the remaining ashes, as well as Jackson and two other inmates. Jackson testified at his <em>Spears </em>hearing that he did not receive any injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">Because our precedent at the time of the magistrate\u2019s decision required a \u201csignificant injury,\u201d <em>see Johnson v. Morel, </em>876 F.2d 477, 480 (5th Cir.1989) (en banc) (under the Fourth Amendment); <em>Oliver v. Collins, </em>914 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir.1990) (under the Eighth Amendment); <em>Shillingford v. Holmes, </em>634 F.2d 263 (5th Cir.1981) (under the Due Process Clause), the magistrate found this claim to be frivolous. However, after the magistrate\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court held that a significant injury is not required for an excessive force claim under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Although, Jackson need not show a significant injury, he must have suffered at least some injury. The Court in <em>Hudson </em>also stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-14\">The Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition <em>de minimis </em>uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort \u201crepugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-15\"><em>Id. </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 1000. Apparently, Jackson was a pretrial detainee so that his claim is governed by the Due Process Clause rather than the Eighth Amendment. Regardless, the standard is the same. <em>See Valencia v. Wiggins, </em>981 F.2d 1440 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that <em>Hudson\u2019s </em>test for excessive force under the Eighth Amendment applies to a pretrial detainee\u2019s excessive force claim under the Due Process Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-17\">Because he suffered no injury, we find that the spraying of Jackson with the fire extinguisher was a <em>de minimis </em>use of physical force and was not repugnant to the conscience of mankind. <em>Cf. Olson v. Coleman, </em>804 F.Supp. 148, 150 (D.Kan.1992) (finding a single blow to the head causing a contusion to be <em>de minimis </em>and not repugnant); <em>Candelaria v. Coughlin, </em>787 F.Supp. 368, 374 (S.D.N.Y.1992) (allegation of single incident of guard using force to choke inmate was <em>de minimis), aff'd, </em>979 F.2d 845 (2d Cir.1992). The dismissal of Jackson\u2019s claims under \u00a7 1915(d) is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
