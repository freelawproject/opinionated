Neher, appeal the decision of the United States Claims Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reversing the special master\u2019s award of a $100,000 lump sum payment in addition to a lifetime annuity which covers all anticipated costs. Because the Claims Court correctly determined that the lump sum award by the special master is an impermissible award under the vaccine statute, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b981-19\">On May 21, 1990, the Nehers filed a petition in the United States Claims Court for compensation under The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (codified, as amended, at 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-1\u2014300aa-34 (West 1991)) (hereinafter \u201cVaccine Act\u201d) for injuries their daughter, Janine M. Neher, allegedly sustained as a result of a diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine she received on May 22, 1967. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 300aa-11(a)(1), the Nehers\u2019 petition was forwarded to the office of special masters for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-20\">Because the government conceded that Janine is entitled to compensation under the Vaccine Act, the special master only determined the amount of compensation to which she is entitled. The special master conducted a hearing on February 22, 1991, and issued a final decision on March 18, 1991. The special master awarded Janine an annuity in the amount of $16,200 for the first year after the award and $49,800 for each year thereafter. The award was broken down as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-21\">1st yr. 2nd yr. +</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-10\">Therapies/attendant care $12,000 0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJH\">Group Home 0 $14,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-uc\">Therapeutic services 0 $31,200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVm\">Medications &amp; related medical services $ 4,200 $ 4,200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADj\">Total $16,200 $49,800</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>In addition, the special master awarded Janine a lump sum in the amount of $100,-000 to be paid in four equal annual installments of $25,000. The special master stated that the lump sum was awarded \u201cto give a small level of flexibility to the compensation plan to deal with fluctuations in the yearly inflation rates and relatively minor changes in service needs not accounted for by the above levels of compensation.\u201d <em>Neher v. Secretary Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>No. 90-431V, slip op. at 2, 1991 WL 44451 (Cl.Ct. Mar. 18, 1991) (hereinafter <em>Decision of Special Master).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">The government filed a motion pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(1) to have the Claims Court review that portion of the special master\u2019s decision awarding the $100,000 lump sum. The government alleged that the lump sum award was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with the law. On review, the Claims Court held that the special master had erred in awarding the petitioner the lump sum payment in addition to the annuity. The Claims Court held that the lump sum award was improper and not authorized by the Vaccine Act because it was vague, speculative, and duplicative of compensation provided for in the annuity. <em>Neher v. Secretary Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>23 Cl.Ct. 508, 517 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">In the interest of judicial economy, the Claims Court did not remand the case to the special master to avoid giving petitioner \u201c[a] second bite at the apple to relitigate the petitioner\u2019s appropriate award for future care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the Claims Court ordered that \u201ca final judgment for the petitioner should be entered to fund the costs of purchasing an annuity to cover the petitioner\u2019s needs in the amount of $16,200 for the first year after the award, and $49,800 for the second year, and for the rest of petitioner\u2019s natural life.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the Claims Court\u2019s order stating that it \u201cfails to provide for an inflation factor and further, ... fails to define the standards for purchase by the respondent of annuities____\u201d <em>Neher v. Secretary Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>No. 90-431V, slip op. at 2 (Cl.Ct. July 16, 1991) (order denying motion for reconsideration). In denying the motion, the Claims Court reiterated its holding that the Vaccine Act does not authorize an award of a separate amount for inflation and emphasized that because \u201cthe annuity portion of the chief special master\u2019s Decision dated March 18, 1991 was left undisturbed,\u201d the standards for respondent\u2019s purchase of the annuity remained the same. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">In the instant petition, the Nehers challenge the Claims Court\u2019s reversal of the lump sum award. In addition, despite the Claims Court\u2019s explanation in its denial of the Nehers\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the Nehers again challenge the Claims Court\u2019s failure to include a \u201cgrowth factor, and financial criteria, in the Judgment.\u201d The Nehers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-12\">request that this Court clarify the Judgment herein so as to specify a 5% growth rate compounded annually via an annuity policy issued by a company gauged against appropriate standards, all as was originally ordered by the Chief Special Master herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">Because the Claims Court\u2019s reconsideration decision makes clear that the special master\u2019s annuity award, including the attendant growth factor and standards for purchasing the annuity, was unaffected by the Claims Court\u2019s judgment, further clarification by this court is unnecessary. Consequently, our analysis is limited to the propriety of the lump sum award.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">The Vaccine Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-16\">[A]ny petitioner aggrieved by the findings or conclusions of the court may obtain review of the judgment of the court in the United States court of appeals for the Federal Circuit____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-18\">42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 300aa-12(f). Although the statute does not expressly state the standard this court should apply in reviewing the Claims Court, the statutory scheme as a whole does suggest how this court should perform its function. In the case of <em>Hines </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number><em>v. Secretary of the Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>this court analyzed the statutory scheme and considered analogous situations to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-4\">[I]n a case arising under the 1989 amendments to the Vaccine Act, we review <em>de novo </em>the Claims Court\u2019s determination as to whether or not the special master\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">940 F.2d 1518, 1524 (Fed.Cir.1991). In <em>Munn v. Secretary of the Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>970 F.2d 863 (Fed.Cir.1992), the court elaborated how that standard of review operates, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-6\">These standards vary in application as well as degree of deference. Each standard applies to a different aspect of the judgment. Fact findings are reviewed by us, as by the Claims Court judge, under the arbitrary and capricious standard; legal questions under the \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d standard; and discretionary rulings under the abuse of discretion standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">Id. at 870 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">In the instant case we must determine whether the Vaccine Act authorizes the lump sum awarded by the special master. Because that is a legal question, we must apply the \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d standard in this appeal. While the Claims Court applied that same standard to conclude that the special master \u201cerred\u201d in awarding the lump sum, 23 Cl.Ct. at 510, we must review the statute and the special master\u2019s award <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the Claims Court reached the proper conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">III. THE STATUTORY COMPENSATION PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Section 300aa-15 of the Vaccine Act sets forth specific expenses for which compensation can be awarded to petitioner, including: expenses which \u201cresult from the vaccine-related injury for which the petitioner seeks compensation,\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(1)(A)(i), expenses \u201cincurred by or on behalf of the person who suffered such injury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 300aa-5(a)(1)(A)(ii), expenses \u201cfor diagnosis and medical or other remedial care determined to be reasonably necessary,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(1)(A)(iii)(I), and expenses \u201cfor rehabilitation, developmental evaluation, special education, vocational training and placement, case management services, counseling, emotional or behavioral therapy, residential and custodial care and service expenses, special equipment, related travel expenses, and facilities determined to be reasonably necessary,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(1)(A)(iii)(II). <em>See also id. </em>at \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(1)(B) (Subsection (a)(1)(B) covers the same types of expenses as subsection (a)(1)(A), except that the former covers expenses incurred before the date of the judgment while the later covers expenses incurred after the date of the judgment.).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">In the event of a vaccine-related death, the Vaccine Act authorizes payment of $250,000 to the estate of the deceased. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(2). In the case of a vaccine-related injury incurred after attaining the age of 18, the Vaccine Act additionally provides compensation for lost earnings. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(3)(A). Finally, the Vaccine Act authorizes compensation for pain and suffering, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(4), and for attorney fees and other costs \u201cincurred in any proceeding on [a] petition,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 300aa-15(e). The Vaccine Act does not authorize any other compensation. Indeed, the Vaccine Act specifically prohibits compensation for \u201cpunitive or exemplary damages,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 300aa-15(d)(1), and for anything \u201cother than the health, education, or welfare of the person who suffered the vaccine-related injury with respect to which the compensation is paid,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 300aa-15(d)(2), except as specifically provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">The government has not challenged the special master\u2019s award of the annuity to compensate the Nehers for expenses pertaining to therapy, attendant care, group housing, and medications and other medical services, presumably because these expenses clearly fall within the express provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>sions of the statute. Instead, what the government challenged in the Claims Court was the special master\u2019s award of the $100,000 lump sum \u201cto give a small level of flexibility to the compensation plan to deal with [1] fluctuations in the yearly inflation rates and [2] relatively minor changes in service needs not accounted for by the above levels of compensation.\u201d <em>Decision of Special Master </em>at 2. Analyzing both bases for the lump sum payment, we determine that the Vaccine Act does not authorize payment under either.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\"><em>1. Fluctuations in Inflation Rates. </em>The Vaccine Act specifically provides that \u201ccompensation under the Program shall be determined on the basis of the net present value of the elements of the compensation.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 300aa-15(f)(4)(A). <em>See also id. </em>at \u00a7 300aa-15(f)(4)(B) (also requiring compensation based on net present value for vaccines administered during a different time frame than those covered by subsection (f)(4)(A)). In the instant case, petitioners\u2019 economics expert provided testimony \u201con how to measure the growth rates to calculate the costs of care at present value.\u201d 23 Cl.Ct. at 514. Petitioners\u2019 expert concluded that a 6% growth factor would be sufficient to meet petitioners\u2019 future expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 515. After balancing this testimony against the government\u2019s evidence concerning inflation, the special master found that a 5% growth factor was appropriate. <em>Decision of Special Master </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">As with any attempt to adjust for inflation, anticipated fluctuations in the inflation rate must, as a practical matter, be considered in determining an appropriate constant growth factor. Therefore, the special master\u2019s annuity award, with the attendant growth factor, already accounts for inflation and any predicted fluctuations therein. Therefore, the special master\u2019s award of an additional lump sum \u201cto deal with fluctuations in the yearly inflation rates\u201d is duplicative and unauthorized, and cannot stand. <em>See also Loe v. Secretary Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>22 Cl.Ct. 430, 434 (1991) (stating that \u201cthe purchase price of an annuity is a valid measure of the present value of damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\"><em>2. Changes in Service Needs. </em>The Vaccine Act authorizes an annuity award only for expenses that can be \u201creasonably] projected.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(1)(A). In the instant case, the special master conducted a hearing to determine what petitioners\u2019 reasonably projected future expenses would be. Based on the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the special master awarded an annuity in the amount of $16,200 for the first year after the award and $49,800 for subsequent years. In making the award, the special master specifically listed the expected expenses for which the annuity was provided. As the Claims Court appropriately and rhetorically noted, \u201c[s]urely, the special master did not make an award of $16,200 for the first year and $49,800 for subsequent years, and at the very same time determine these amounts to be inadequate.\u201d 23 Cl.Ct. at 515-16 n. 8. Therefore, we conclude that the annuity accounts for all reasonably projected expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">As the annuity accounts for all reasonably projected expenses, the additional lump sum \u201cto deal with minor changes in service needs not accounted for by the annuities\u201d can only refer to possible expenses that cannot be reasonably projected. As such, the lump sum award is, on its face, inconsistent with the statutory requirement that compensable expenses be reasonably projected. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Petitioners argue that the Vaccine Act\u2019s legislative history evidences congressional intent that the vaccine program grant awards \u201cquickly, easily, and with certainty and <em>generosity.\u201d </em>H.R.Rep. No. 908, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6287, 6344 (emphasis added). A broad pronouncement of general congressional intent, however, cannot override an express requirement of the statute. Because the lump sum was awarded for expenses that do not satisfy the statutory requirement that they be reasonably projected, the lump sum award is not in accordance with the statute and cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Moreover, the Vaccine Act, as originally enacted, included a provision for increasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>the amount of an award if the award later proved insufficient to meet actual, necessary expenses. National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-660, \u00a7 2112(f), 100 Stat. 3755, 3762 (1986). In 1987, the Act was amended, however, to delete that provision.. Vaccine Compensation Amendments of 1987, Pub.L. No. 100-203, \u00a7 4303(d)(2)(A), 101 Stat. 1330-222 (1987). Such amendment suggests congressional intent to limit vaccine petitioners\u2019 entitlement to compensation to costs that can be reasonably anticipated at the time of the award. Once the special master had determined what compensation was due, there was no authority for adding \u201cflexibility\u201d to the plan. The special master\u2019s award is not subject to subsequent, or concurrent, enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">The Claims Court correctly determined that neither of the special master\u2019s bases for the lump sum award is authorized by the Vaccine Act. Because fluctuations in inflation rates are already accounted for in the annuity growth factor, an additional award to compensate for the fluctuation in inflation rates is duplicative. Further, the Vaccine Act does not allow compensation for changes in service needs that cannot be reasonably projected at the time of the award. Accordingly, the Claims Court\u2019s reversal of the special master\u2019s lump sum award is</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-15\">.
