Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-18\">Petitioner, a widow whose sole source of income is the proceeds from the sale of a farm which she and her deceased husband had owned, arranged with her neighbor Mr. Baugher to supervise the remodeling of her home. Mrs. Lewis requested, and Mr. Baugher consented, that he use Max Placincio the respondent and Robert Flores as laborers in the remodeling work. As work progressed other men were hired for specific tasks such as wiring, painting and floor sanding. The work extended over a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>period of about three months, during which time the respondent worked continuously.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Respondent was injured by a power saw and filed a claim with the Industrial Commission. The Commission found that at the time of the accident the respondent was employed by petitioner who had in her employ three or more workmen subject to the provisions of the Arizona Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and that petitioner was not insured against liability for the payment of accident benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Petitioner contends that the Commission err\u00e9d in assuming jurisdiction in this cause because she, Mrs. Lewis, was not an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of A.R.S. \u00a7 23-902 for the reason that she did not employ any workmen in the usual course of trade, business, profession, or occupation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The substance of respondent\u2019s argument is that he is a \"workman\u201d or \"operative\u201d within the meaning of A.R.S. \u00a7 23-901(4) (b), which includes every person in the service of any employer subject to the provisions of the Act except a person whose employment is casual <em>and </em>not in the usual course of trade, business or occupation of the employer. Respondent contends that his employment was not \u201ccasual\u201d and therefore it is immaterial whether his employment was in the usual course of petitioner\u2019s trade, business or occupation since a finding of either fact brings him within the Act. However true this contention may be it <em>misses </em>the point because satisfaction of A.R.S. \u00a7 23-901, defining <em>employees </em>covered by the Act, takes him only half way. Section <em>23-902, </em>defining <em>employers covered </em>by the Act, must also be satisfied before the Commission can assume jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\"> In order for an employer to come within the Act A.R.S. \u00a7 23-902 requires that his workmen or operatives be \u201cregularly employed.\u201d And for the purposes of this section \u201cregularly employed\u201d, as defined, includes all employments \u201cin the usual trade, business, profession, or occupation of an employer.\u201d This definition inferentially excludes employments which are <em>not </em>in the usual trade, business, profession, or occupation of an employer because of the rule of statutory construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>which applies in Arizona. O\u2019Malley Lumber Co. v. Martin, 45 Ariz. 349, 43 P.2d 200 (1935). See Forsythe v. Paschal, 34 Ariz. 380, 271 P. 865 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The facts of this case show clearly that Mrs. Lewis was not engaged in the general business of constructing or remodeling houses and indeed that she had no trade or business whatsoever. Therefore, she was not an employer within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The great majority of cases, regardless of their statutory background, do not apply Workmen\u2019s Compensation to construction or work done directly for a private householder. 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 50.21 (1952). This view accords with our own theory of the purpose for Workmen\u2019s Compensation as expressed in numerous cases. We have stated repeatedly that its purpose is to place the burden of injury from industrial causes upon industry. Dunlap v. Industrial Comm., 90 Ariz. 3, 363 P.2d 600 (1961). We said in Goodyear Aircraft Corp. v. Industrial Comm., 62 Ariz. 398, 402, 158 P.2d 511, 513 (1945):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">\u201cWhen, through accident arising out of the course of his employment, a worker is injured, he should be allowed due compensation, and the cost for such compensation is a charge against industry to the same extent as repair to a broken machine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Larson, in his treatise on Workmen\u2019s Compensation, states the principle succinctly as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">\u201cIt has always been assumed, rightly or wrongly, that the cost of compensation protection did not become a burden upon the employer directly, since he\u2019 was expected to pass the cost along to the consumer in the price of the product. There are those who argue that this does not go to the essence of the compensation idea, and perhaps does not really work out at all; but the fact remains that for decades the compensation principle has been made acceptable to employers (and, to some extent, also to skeptical courts) on the argument that the cost could be passed along through the medium of insurance whose premiums are reflected in the cost accounts on which the price is based.\u201d Larson, supra at 744.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">And again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">\u201cIt appears then, that whatever the statutory background, the courts will not ordinarily find in the compensation act coverage of work undertaken by a person as, so to speak, a consumer instead of a producer.\u201d Larson, supra at 740.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">This Court reached a similar result in Cooper v. Industrial Comm., 74 Ariz. 351, 249 P.2d 142 (1952), wherein a workman was injured while remodeling a private residence. The Commission\u2019s finding that the employer was not covered by the Act was upheld on the dual grounds that there were not (a) three or more workmen (b) regularly employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>For the foregoing reasons the award of the Industrial Commission is hereby set aside.</p>\n<judges id=\"b346-4\">BERNSTEIN, C. J., UDALL, V. C. J., and STRUCKMEYER and LOCKWOOD, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\">. \u201c\u00a7 23-902.
