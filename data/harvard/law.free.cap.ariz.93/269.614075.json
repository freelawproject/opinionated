Gilliland. The case was tried to the court without a jury. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case judgment was entered in favor of appellee, defendant below, and from this judgment, plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-22\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is based on a check for Twenty Thousand Dollars payable to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>and signed by the decedent. Above the line for signature is printed the name of a corporation owned by decedent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Gil-liland died before the check was cashed, and plaintiffs then filed a creditor\u2019s claim against his estate for the amount of the check. The claim was rejected by the executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">At the trial plaintiffs offered the check in evidence and defendant objected, on the grounds no foundation had been laid since plaintiffs\u2019 testimony as to the signature was barred by the Dead Man\u2019s Statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2251, and the check, bearing the name of a corporation, was not evidence of an individual\u2019s debt and was therefore immaterial. The trial court sustained defendant\u2019s objections and refused to admit the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The Arizona Dead Maris Statute, insofar as pertinent, precludes a party to an action against an estate from testifying to \u201ctransaction with or statement by\u201d the decedent. The trial court ruled that the Dead Maris Statute prevented plaintiff from testifying that the signature on the check was that of decedent. Without this evidence plaintiff could not make a prima facie case. The trial court also ruled that plaintiff could not testify that decedent gave him the check. This, however, would not impair plaintiffs\u2019 case, since a valid delivery is presumed between the original parties to a negotiable instrument until the contrary is proved. A.R.S. \u00a7 44-416.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">We hold that the rulings of the trial court were erroneous. The authorities generally agree that under statutory provisions similar to our own, testimony as to matters independent of the actual transaction, although material to the case is admissible. In re House\u2019s Estate, 145 Neb. 866, 18 N.W.2d 500, 159 A.L.R. 401 (1945). The statute was not intended to place an absolute prohibition on all testimony by parties to the action, but on the contrary, was meant to limit incompetency to matt\u00e9rs involving a transaction with or statement by the deceased.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such matters, it is assumed, are of a nature that the deceased would contradict them, if he were alive, and it is thought that to admit evidence which the estate may not be able to rebut will result in injustice. On the other hand, testimony bearing on the genuineness of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>signature falls in the.category of opinion evidence relating to an independent fact. While it is unquestionably material in an action on a negotiable instrument, it does not qualify as either a transaction or a statement. In re House, supra. In our view, such testimony does not come within the prohibition of the statute and is therefore admissible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">It is defendant\u2019s position that the check is evidence of a corporate obligation.. Above the line for signature are printed the words \u201cHitching Post Lodge, Inc.\u201d The signature, however, does not indicate in what capacity the maker intended to sign. The Negotiable Instruments Law, A.R.S. \u00a7 44--420, does not provide a conclusive answer in this situation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plain meaning of an integrated written contract cannot be varied by parol evidence. But where the meaning is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be offered to bring out the true intention of the parties. Gerber v. Cook, 90 Ariz. 390, 368 P.2d 458 (1962). We think that there is ambiguity on the face of the instrument in question, creating a necessity for the admission of parol evidence. We refer to Britton, Bills and Notes (1943), \u00a7 164 at 785:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-13\">\u201c[There is a] * * * group of cases * * * illustrated by signatures in the form: \u2018P. Company, A.\u2019 With respect to these cases, under the N.I.L., the general rule is that where an agent with authority to sign his principal\u2019s name, signs his own name and does not add to his signature any words indicating that he is acting in a representative' capacity, but the instrument does set forth, either immediately above the signature of the agent or elsewhere thereon the name of a third party, in an action by the payee against the signer, the latter is presumptively liable personally but that parol evidence is admissible to show that such signer was the agent of the party whose name was thus set forth and to show that the signer intended not be [sic] bind himseif.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">Thus defendant\u2019s objection as to the materiality of the check was not well taken. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>There is no evidence to support defendant\u2019s version of decedent\u2019s intention in signing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Although the foregoing is dispositive of this appeal, we will take up two other points raised in the briefs in order to expedite the retrial. Plaintiffs called as a witness a long time friend of the decedent. The witness testified that he had seen the decedent execute a promissory note for Four Thousand Dollars and deliver it to the plaintiff. Plaintiffs urge that judgment should not have been rendered against them at the end of their case because this uncontradicted testimony showed the existence of some indebtedness owing them from the decedent, at least in the sum of Four Thousand Dollars. Later in the trial, however, plaintiff himself testified that he returned this note and other papers to the decedent. He was permitted to testify that on the day the check for $20,000 was executed, he physically delivered to the decedent the $4,000 note and other documents representing amounts he had advanced to the decedent over a period of years. The trial judge ruled within his discretion that he could testify to what he did physically with the note and other documents, but that he could not testify to any other transaction had with the decedent. Since there is no showing that the trial judge abused his discretion we will not disturb his ruling. See footnote No. 3, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Defendant argues that plaintiffs did not present their claim within the statutory time. His argument ignores the fact that this matter is one of affirmative defense tO' be pleaded and proved by the defendant. Ariz.R.Civ.P. 8(d), 16 A.R.S. Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence was sufficient to make a prima facie case that the claim was timely presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b291-9\">STRUCKMEYER and JENNINGS, JJ., concurring.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\">. Counsel for plaintiffs made an avowal to the court that the two shareholders in this corporation had nothing to do with its operation and that decedent \u201coperated the corporation as general manager and in effect for and by and on behalf of himself as an individual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">. McCormick, Law of Evidence Handbook (1954) \u00a7 65 at 142. Professor McCormick points out that at common law all parties were disqualified from testifying at trial. This made it necessary for the adoption of statutes which would abolish the disqualification. The Dead Maris Statutes, therefore, are an exception to the general rule that a party is competent to testify in his own behalf and as an exception will be strictly construed in favor of admitting testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">. There is a body of authority in Arizona for the proposition that it is within the discretion of the trial court to admit testimony pertaining to transactions or communications that ordinarily could not come in under the statute. See, e. g., Goff v. Guyton, 86 Ariz. 349, 346 P.2d 286; Stewart v. Schnepf, 62 Ariz. 440, 158 P.2d 529; Goldman v. Sotelo, 7 Ariz. 23, 60 P. 696. These cases are to be distinguished from the case at bar. Here we are not dealing with evidence admissible only in the discretion of the trial judge, but with evidence wholly outside of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Aar\">. \u201cLiability of person signing as agent, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"AP0\">\u201cWhere the instrument contains or a person adds to his signature words indicating that he signs for or on behalf of a principal, or in a representative capacity, he is not liable on the instrument if. he was duly authorized; * * *</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
