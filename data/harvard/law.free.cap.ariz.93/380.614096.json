The S &amp; L Service, Inc., an Arizona corporation, hereinafter referred to as S &amp; L, was the plaintiff in said action. The case was tried on a stipulated statement of facts and judgment was entered for the S &amp; L against the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">The facts essential to the disposition of the case under the stipulation are as follows. S &amp; L operates a garage and wrecker service and holds itself out to render towing or wrecking service to the general public. It does not have a certificate of convenience and necessity to provide towing or wrecking service issued by the Arizona Corporation Commission. It employs one mechanic and one mechanic\u2019s helper and three service-tow truck drivers and it owns and operates four service-tow trucks with which it makes about 139 tows per month, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>approximately 85% of which are for AAA members. In addition to the towing service rendered by S &amp; L it also provides roadside mechanical service.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The Commission maintains that A.R.S. \u00a7 40-601 (A) (3) has defined \u201ccommon motor carrier\u201d such as to include the business carried on by S &amp; L of towing cars for others over the public highways for hire. The Commission also asserts that A.R.S. \u00a7 40-601 (A) (8), as amended, which defines \u201cprivate motor carriers\u201d is unconstitutional since it limits the powers granted to the Corporation Commission to regulate common carriers using the public highways. The Commission further contends that since S &amp; L, when engaged in towing motor vehicles, is a \u201ccommon motor carrier\u201d it must have a certificate of convenience and necessity issued pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 40-607.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">S &amp; L\u2019s position is that it is a \u201cprivate motor carrier\u201d, specifically authorized by statute to operate in the manner in which it is presently operating without being certificated by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Two questions are presented for determination by this appeal. (1) Is S &amp; L Service, Inc. a common or private carrier ?. (2) Does A.R.S. \u00a7 40-601 (A) (8), as amended, violate the Arizona Constitution regarding the jurisdiction of the Arizona Corporation Commission? This section, as amended in the laws of 1960, defines a private motor carrier as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9y\">\u201c \u2018Private motor carrier\u2019 means any person not included in the term \u2018common motor carrier\u2019 or \u2018contract motor carrier\u2019 who transports by any motor vehicle in excess of six thousand' pounds unladen weight property of which such person is the owner, lessee or bailee, when such transportation is for the purpose of sale, lease, rent or bailment, or in the furtherance of any commercial enterprise, * * *, provided that towing of disabled vehicles by tow trucks operated in connection with an automobile repair or service business or a wrecking yard shall be deemed to be incidental to a commercial enterprise, and the operator thereof shall be deemed to be a private motor carrier when engaged in such operations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Prior to passage by the legislature of A.R.S. \u00a7 40-601 (A) (8) in 1960, providing for the towing of disabled vehicles by tow trucks, this court in interpreting the old statute which made no reference to towing of disabled vehicles by tow trucks stated in the case of Killingsworth v. Morrow, 83 Ariz. 23, 26, 315 P.2d 873 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">\u201c * * * Certainly, if one whose principal business is that of servicing and repairing cars tows the same for the purpose of repairing or servicing, he would be transporting them for bailment or in furtherance of his principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>commercial enterprise and would thereby qualify as a private carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The opinion went on to say, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">\u201c * * * If any- portion of the receipts upon which this tax was levied was \u25a0 derived from towage charges not performed in the furtherance of or incident to his garage business but separate and apart therefrom, such receipts would be taxable as income derived from transporting property for compensation as a common carrier or contract carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Subsequent to the Killingsworth decision the legislature in 1960 amended the statute to the effect that \u201ctowing of disabled vehicles by tow trucks operated in connection with an automobile repair or service business or a wrecking 'yard shall be deemed to be incidental to a commercial enterprise, and the operator thereof shall be deemed to be a private motor carrier when engaged in such operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">We are of the opinion that under the provisions of A.R.S. \u00a7 40-601 (A) (8) as amended, the S &amp; L is a private motor carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In reference to the constitutional jurisdiction of the Commission, Art. 15, \u00a7 3, Const, of the State of Arizona, A.R.S., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201cThe Corporation Commission shall have full power to, and shall, prescribe just and reasonable classifications to be used and just and reasonable rates and charges to be made and collected, by public service corporations within the State for service .rendered therein, and make reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, by which such corporations shall be governed in the transaction of business within the State * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Art. 15, \u00a7 6, Const, of the State of Arizona, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">\u201cThe law-making power may enlarge the powers and extend the duties of the Corporation Commission, and may prescribe rules and regulations to govern proceedings instituted by and before it; but, until such rules and regulations are provided by law, the Commission may make rules and regulations to govern such proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">We have said in the case of Corporation Commission of Arizona v. Pacific Greyhound Lines, 54 Ariz. 159, 176, 94 P.2d 443, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\">\u201c \u2018full power to * * * make reasonable rules, regulations and orders, by which such corporations shall be governed in the transaction of business within the State\u2019, * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-15\">\u201crefers only to the power given the commission by the same section (the predecessor to A.R.S. \u00a7 40-601(a) (3)); to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u201c \u2018prescribe just and reasonable classifications to be used, and just and reasonable rates and charges to be made and collected, by public service corporation (s),\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">\u201cand that both under the direct language of the constitution and the police power inherent in the legislative authority, the paramount power to make all rules and regulations governing public service corporations not specifically and expressly given to the commission by some provision of the Constitution, rests in the legislature, and it may, therefore, either exercise such powers directly or delegate them to the commission upon such terms and limitations as it thinks proper. The limitation set forth in section 6, of chapter 100, supra, is, therefore, constitutional. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">It does not appear that there is anything in the constitutional authority which requires carriers to be certificated to perform functions that can be regulated by statute. While the Commission does have the power to prescribe just and reasonable classifications to be used, and just and reasonable rates and charges to be made and collected by public service corporations, there is nothing in the Constitution that forbids the legislature from enacting a law that permits private motor carriers to tow disabled vehicles by tow trucks operated in connection with an automobile repair or service business, or a wrecking yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We are of the opinion that A.'R.S. \u00a7 40-601(A) (8), as amended, does not invade the Commission\u2019s constitutional powers.'</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-8\">BERNSTEIN, C.
