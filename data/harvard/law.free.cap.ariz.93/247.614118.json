On October 1, 1962, without motion by any party, the Clerk of the Superior Court in Cochise County notified the attorneys for the parties that the case had been placed on the inactive list in accordance with Rule V(d) of the Uniform Rules of Practice. On December 5, 1962, without any intervening motions by petitioners, respondents moved in the superior court for additional time. Wine Glass Ranches, Inc. v. Deddens, 93 Ariz. 251, 379 P.2d 966, filed objections to this motion and moved to dismiss the action under Rule V (d). Hearing was had on these motions and the court, on December 16, 1962, ordered that the case be retained on the calendar for a period of 30 days from that date. Respondents filed a certificate of readiness and motion to set for trial on January 17, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The petitioners contend that the case should have been dismissed under Rule V (d) on October 8, 1962 when the periods of one year and two months mentioned in Rule V(d) expired. Alternatively, they contend that the case should have been dismissed on December 1, 1962, two months after notice of transfer to the inactive calendar was given. As a third alternative, they contend it should have been dismissed January 16, 1963, at the expiration of the 30-day period for which the court had ordered that the case be retained on the inactive calendar. The petitioners argue that Rule V(d) is mandatory, and that the trial court has no discretion to retain the case on the calendar after the time limits set forth therein have expired, unless the provisions of that rule which permit extensions of time are strictly followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Rule V(d) of the Uniform Rules of Practice was designed to standardize, among the Superior Courts in this state, the exercise of their inherent power to dismiss cases for want of prosecution, and to provide a convenient administrative practice which would bring to the attention of the court and the attorneys involved the fact that ample time had elapsed in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>to prepare a case for trial. It was not intended to place a sword in the hands of defendants\u2019 attorneys which will enable them to abruptly terminate litigation if their opponents miss a deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"> Rule V (d) is not self-executing. Under Ariz.R.Civ.P. 58(a), 16 A.R.S., \u201cAll judgments shall be in writing and signed by a judge or a court commissioner duly authorized to do so.\u201d \u201cJudgments,\u201d within the meaning of this rule, include orders from which an appeal lies, Ariz.R.Civ.P. 54(a). Since an order dismissing a case for want of prosecution under Rule V (d) of the Rules of Practice \u201cdetermines the action and prevents judgment from which an appeal might be taken\u201d it is an appeal-able order, A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101, subd. D. Rule 58(a) therefore applies and requires that such orders be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">While Rule V (d) of the Rules of Practice contemplates that the clerk of the court will transfer cases to the inactive calendar upon the anniversary of the filing of the complaint, a case remains upon the active calendar until this ministerial procedure is performed. Otherwise the purpose of notifying the attorneys of the change of the status of their case would be completely thwarted. Further, the rule contemplates that an order dismissing the case without prejudice will be routinely signed by the court at the expiration of the two month period during which the case is on the inactive calendar. However, if this is not done, the case remains on the inactive calendar until a written order of dismissal is entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">After the expiration of the two month period, when a case on the inactive calendar has not been routinely dismissed, defense attorneys may move the court to dismiss under Rule V(d), and an unopposed motion of this nature must be granted by the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, even at this stage of the proceedings, the trial court has some discretion. Ariz.R.Civ.P. 60(c) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permits the trial judge to grant relief from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>orders, and this would include an order dismissing a case under Rule V(d), upon the conditions therein set forth. When a motion to dismiss under Rule V(d) is opposed, or where, as here, a motion for additional time is made after the expiration of the time set for dismissal in the rule, and is opposed, the trial judge may-grant relief, including additional time on the inactive calendar, upon the same conditions that permit relief under Ariz.R.Civ. P. 60(c), provided the good cause required by Rule V(d) (2) is shown. We will not require the court to go through the needless formality of a dismissal under Rule V (d) of the Rules of Practice before he can exercise the discretion given him by Rule 60(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">We find no abuse of discretion in the respondent judge\u2019s action in this case. This litigation is related to litigation between the same parties in the federal courts. It is alleged by the respondents Stout that the damages recoverable in their superior court action depend on the outcome of the federal court litigation. Additionally, there was an undecided motion before the court for summary judgment made by the petitioners Campbell. Under these circumstances, mandamus will not lie to compel dismissal of a case for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The alternative writ previously issued in this case is quashed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b269-9\">BERNSTEIN, C.
