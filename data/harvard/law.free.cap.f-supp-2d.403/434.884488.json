This opinion is issued in the Strong sub-track, but addresses many issues common to all sub-tracks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">The named plaintiff in the lead case (No. 04-949) in the Strong sub-track is Brian Flynn. Flynn began employment with Strong Capital Management, Inc. (\u201cSCM\u201d) on September 14, 2001 and entered the Strong Capital Management, Inc. Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan (\u201cStrong Plan\u201d) that same day. On January 1, 2002, the \u201cEmployer\u201d for purposes of the Strong Plan became Strong Financial Corporation, and the name of the Plan was changed to the Strong Financial Corporation Profit Sharing and 401 (k) Plan. Flynn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>appears to have left Strong\u2019s employment on July 11, 2003, and at his direction the full amount of his account balance in the Plan was rolled over to an existing Strong IRA on July 13, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Flynn, who alleges that he \u201cwas a Strong employee, [and] is a participant in the Plan\u201d (Am.Compl. \u00a7 18), seeks to represent a class of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">All persons who were participants in or beneficiaries of the Strong Plan at any time between October 30, 1998 and the present (the \u201cClass Period\u201d) and whose accounts included investments in Strong Funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\"><em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 28). He alleges that the Strong Plan consists primarily of 28 investment alternatives from the Strong family of mutual funds. Named as defendants are Flynn\u2019s former employer SCM, the investment adviser for the Strong family of funds, and Richard S. Strong (\u201cR.Strong\u201d), Chairman of the Board of the Strong Funds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint identifies SCM and R. Strong as named or <em>de facto </em>fiduciaries of the Strong Plan and alleges that they breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA \u00a7 404(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a). Asserting that illegal late trading and/or market timing were permitted in a number of the Strong mutual funds, and that the value of Plan participants\u2019 investments was thereby diluted, Flynn claims that the Plan fiduciaries knew or should have known that the funds were an imprudent investment, yet failed to take action to protect the interests of the Plan participants. (Am. Compl. \u00a7\u00a7 41-49 and Count One). The plaintiffs also allege under ERISA \u00a7 404(a) a violation of the duty to monitor the Plan (Am. Compl., Count Three), and co-fiduciary liability under ERISA \u00a7 405. (Am. Compl., Count Four).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">Flynn seeks, as relief, a declaration that the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties; an order compelling the Defendants \u201cto make good to The Plan all losses to the Plan resulting from defendants\u2019 breaches of their fiduciary duties;\u201d a constructive trust; \u201cactual damages in the amount of any losses the Plan suffered, to be allocated among the Participants\u2019 individual accounts in proportion to the accounts\u2019 losses;\u201d and other injunctive and equitable relief, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. (Am. Compl., \u201cPrayer for Relief\u2019.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">The defendants raise several issues in their motions to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) including standing, adequacy of pleading, and the applicability of a \u201cpresumption of prudence.\u201d These issues will be discussed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">Plaintiffs have the burden of proving that subject matter jurisdiction exists. <em>See Evans v. B.F. Perkins, Co., </em>166 F.3d 642, 647 (4th Cir.1999). In reviewing a Fed.Civ.R.P. 12(b)(1) motion, \u201cthe district court is to regard the pleadings\u2019 allegations as mere evidence on the issue, and may consider evidence outside the pleadings without converting the proceeding to one for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R. Co. v. United States, </em>945 F.2d 765, 768 (4th Cir.1991). A court should grant a Rule 12(b)(1) mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>tion \u201cif the material jurisdictional facts are not in dispute and the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Evans v. B.F. Perkins Co., </em>166 F.3d at 647. When the jurisdictional facts are intertwined with questions of law, however, it may be appropriate to resolve the entire factual dispute at a later proceeding on the' merits. <em>See United States v. North Carolina, </em>180 F.3d 574, 580-81 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Adams v. Bain, </em>697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir.1982); <em>Bryant v. Clevelands, Inc., </em>193 F.R.D. 486, 488 (E.D.Va.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u201cThe purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is to test the sufficiency of a complaint; importantly, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion does not resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.\u201d <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). When ruling on such a motion, the court must \u201caccept the well-pled allegations of the complaint as true,\u201d and \u201cconstrue the facts and reasonable inferences derived therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ibarra v. United States, </em>120 F.3d 472, 474 (4th Cir.1997). Consequently, a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) may be granted only when \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); <em>see also Edwards, </em>178 F.3d at 244. In addition, because the court is testing the legal sufficiency of the claims, the court is not bound by the plaintiffs legal conclusions. <em>See, e.g., Young v. City of Mount Ranier, </em>238 F.3d 567, 577 (4th Cir.2001) (noting that the \u201cpresence ... of a few conclusory legal terms does not insulate a complaint from dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)\u201d when the facts alleged do not support the legal conclusions); <em>Labram v. Havel, </em>43 F.3d 918, 921 (4th Cir.1995) (affirming Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal with prejudice because the plaintiffs alleged facts failed to support her conclusion that the defendant owed her a fiduciary duty at common law).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In ruling on a motion to dismiss in an ERISA action, the court is not confined to the allegations in the complaint, but may review the plan documents referred to in the complaint and relied on by the plaintiff. <em>Beddall v. Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1998); <em>In re USEC Sec. Litig., </em>190 F.Supp.2d 808, 813 (D.Md.2002) (noting that in a securities fraud action, \u201cthe Court is entitled to rely on public documents quoted by, relied upon, incorporated by reference or otherwise integral to the complaint, and such reliance does not convert such a motion into one for summary judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertions, ERISA does not impose a heightened pleading standard, such as the Fed. R.Civ.P. 9(b) particularity requirement for fraud claims, on the plaintiffs\u2019 ERISA claims for breach of fiduciary duties. The basic notice pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8 apply to ERISA actions such as the one before the court. <em>See, e.g., Concha v. London, </em>62 F.3d 1493, 1502-03 (9th Cir.1995) (reviewing case law and holding that Rule 9(b) \u201cis not applicable in cases in which the complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duty under ERISA, and does not allege fraud or mistake\u201d); <em>In re AEP ERISA Litig., </em>327 F.Supp.2d 812, 822 (S.D.Ohio 2004) (noting that \u201ccourts.. .routinely apply only the general, liberal pleading standards of Rule 8 to ERISA claims,\u201d even when the ERISA claims are based on similar conduct underlying related securities fraud claims); <em>In re Enron Corp. Securities, Derivative &amp; ERISA Litig., </em>284 F.Supp.2d 511, 652 (S.D.Tex.2003) (applying Rule 8 notice pleading standards to ERISA claims). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations, however, as compared to mere legal conclusions, to state a claim properly under ERISA. <em>See Custer v. Sweeney, </em>89 F.3d 1156, 1163 (4th Cir.1996) (affirming dismissal of ERISA complaint that \u201clacked any specific factual allegations\u201d to support the assertion that the defendant was a <em>de facto </em>fiduciary of the plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The first issue to be addressed is statutory standing. A plan \u201cparticipant\u201d is authorized to bring suit under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(2) and (3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2) and (3). Flynn, like most if not all of the named plaintiffs in other sub-tracks, is a former employee who has accepted a lump-sum pay-out (or rollover) of his vested benefits. ERISA defines a \u201cparticipant\u201d as \u201cany employee or former employee. . .who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.\u201d ERISA \u00a7 3(7), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989), held that a former employee can be a participant if either 1) she has \u201ca reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment,\u201d or 2) she has a \u201ccolorable claim to vested benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 109 S.Ct. 948 (internal quotations omitted). None of the plaintiffs allege they will be returning to covered employment with their former employers. Thus, the issue centers on whether the plaintiffs, as former employees who have received a lump-sum payment of their ERISA benefits, retain a \u201ccolorable claim to vested benefits.\u201d Such a \u201ccolorable claim,\u201d the Court explained, is a claim that the former employee will either 1) \u201cprevail in a suit for benefits,\u201d or 2) fulfill the eligibility requirements for benefits at some point in the future. <em>Id. </em>at 117-18, 109 S.Ct. 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">The plaintiffs here argue that the defendants\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duty diminished the value of the shares in the mutual fund families in which their retirement accounts were invested,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Am.Compl^ 17), and thus they received less money than they were entitled to when they left the Plans. The Fourth Circuit has not adopted a categorical rule prohibiting former employees who have accepted a lump-sum payment from suing as participants under ERISA \u00a7 502. The defendants argue that in <em>Stanton v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>792 F.2d 432, 434-35 (4th Cir.1986), the Fourth Circuit rejected the \u201cbut for\u201d exception stated in <em>Swinney v. General Motors Corp., </em>46 F.3d 512 (6th Cir.1995), thus implying acceptance of the \u201cgeneral rule that a person who terminates his right to belong to a plan cannot be a \u2018participant\u2019 in the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518. But that argument reads <em>Stanton </em>too broadly. <em>Stanton </em>merely rejected a claim by a former employee who had received his benefits in full, but claimed he would have remained in employment had he known about a new pension program implemented immediately after he left. This new program would not have covered him initially even if he had remained with the company. 792 F.2d at 432-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">More closely analogous are the opinions in <em>Sommers Drug Stores Co. Employee Profit Sharing Trust v. Corrigan, </em>883 F.2d 345 (5th Cir.1989), and <em>Rankin v. Rots, </em>220 F.R.D. 511 (E.D.Mich.2004). In <em>Sommers,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the Fifth Circuit held the plaintiffs had standing, despite having received their benefits, where their claim was \u201cthat the amount received was not the full amount of vested benefits due under the terms of the profit sharing plan, but was less, because the amount received for the shares was less than fair market value.\u201d 883 F.2d at 350.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Rankin, </em>the court held that former participants in a plan sponsored by Kmart had standing to sue over alleged fiduciary breaches concerning the plan\u2019s continued inclusion of Kmart stock as an investment option \u201cat a time when Kmart was in serious decline and which resulted in significant .losses to the Plan.\u201d 220 F.R.D. at 514. The former participants sued to recover their losses, and the court stated that to find they had no standing \u201cwould permit Kmart to exclude potential class members by simply paying them their vested benefits. ERISA should not be interpreted to circumvent a plaintiffs recovery in this manner.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Kuper v. Quantum Chem. Corp., </em>829 F.Supp. 918, 923 (S.D.Ohio 1993), <em>aff'd sub nom. Kuper v. Iovenko, </em>66 F.3d 1447 (6th Cir.1995). While the defendants correctly note that employers generally cannot force their former employees out of ERISA plans, the motivating principle in these cases is that employees should not forfeit a cause of action under ERISA to recover what is rightfully theirs under their plan by taking a pay-out of what they incorrectly believe is all that is owed to them at the time. <em>See Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., </em>14 F.3d 697, 702 (1st Cir.1994) (\u201cTo hold otherwise would imply that when an employer breaches its 'fiduciary duty to an employee under ERISA, the employee would have standing to sue only if the employee finds out all of the facts constituting the breach prior to his receipt of retirement benefits. Such a holding would enable an employer to defeat the employee\u2019s right to sue for a breach of fiduciary duty by keeping his breach a well guarded secret until the employee receives his benefits or, by distributing a lump sum and terminating benefits before the employee can file suit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The defendants further argue that the plaintiffs fail to meet the statutory standing requirements because, even if they claim a right to benefits rather than damages, the current complaint is not one for vested benefits under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). The language in <em>Firestone, </em>however, is not limited to the present but explains that \u201c[i]n order to establish that he or she \u2018may become eligible\u2019 for benefits, a claimant must have a color-able claim that (1) he or she will prevail in <em>a suit </em>for benefits, or that (2) eligibility requirements will be fulfilled <em>in the future. </em>489 U.S. at 117-18, 109 S.Ct. 948 (emphasis added); <em>see also Astor v. Int\u2019l Business Mach. Corp., </em>7 F.3d 533, 538 (6th Cir.1993) (\u201cIn determining who is a \u2018participant,\u2019 for purposes of standing, the definition found in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7) must be read in the context of traditional concepts of standing, not in the context of adjudicating the ultimate issue of the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.... \u201d). Accordingly, at the motion to dismiss stage, it appears that the plaintiffs have alleged a colorable claim to vested benefits and have statutory standing under ERISA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The second issue is constitutional standing. Defendants do not contest that two of the three requirements for Article III standing \u2014 an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d and a \u201ccausal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of\u2019 \u2014 are satisfied, but assert that the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries would not be remedied in the present suit, and therefore the requirement of \u201credress-ability\u201d is not satisfied. <em>See, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The defendants argue that neither of the two operative provisions under which the plaintiffs bring this action, ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(2) and (3), would actually provide them with relief. Section 502(a)(3) authorizes a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary to seek various forms of equitable relief to redress ERISA violations, but does not authorize compensatory damages or monetary relief. <em>See Rego v. Westvaco Corp., </em>319 F.3d 140, 145 (4th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Mertens v. Hewitt Assoc., </em>508 U.S. 248, 257, 113 S.Ct. 2063, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993)). Therefore, the defendants appear to be correct that the plaintiffs cannot seek equitable relief in the form of restitution or constructive trusts directly from the breaching fiduciaries, as these would amount to monetary relief under the circumstances of this case. <em>See Rego, </em>319 F.3d at 145 (citing <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, </em>534 U.S. 204, 214, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635 (2002)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Section 502(a)(2) authorizes a participant, beneficiary, fiduciary, or the Secretary of Labor to bring an action against a plan fiduciary for breach of its duties under ERISA. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1132(a)(2). The Supreme Court has stated that this provision reflects a concern with remedies that protect the entire plan, rather than with the rights of an individual beneficiary. <em>See Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, </em>473 U.S. 134, 142-44, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985). In this case, the plaintiffs seek relief in the form of \u201ca monetary payment to the Plan to make good to the Plan the losses to the Plan resulting from the breaches of fiduciary duties\u201d (Am.ComplV 94), and also seek an order that the defendants \u201callocate the Plan\u2019s recoveries to the accounts of all Participants who had any portion of their account balances invested in the Strong Fund [ ] maintained by the Plan in proportion to the accounts\u2019 losses.\u201d (Am. Compl. \u201cPrayer for Relief\u2019 \u00b6 G.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The court need not decide at this stage of the litigation whether the second step in the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed scheme for relief is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>appropriate, but rather must focus on whether the plaintiffs presently meet the requirements for standing. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Smith v. Sydnor, </em>184 F.3d 356 (4th Cir.1999) is instructive. In <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff was an employee with the defendant company \u201cMcGraw\u201d until December 1997 and received a lump sum cash distribution in February 1998 from the company\u2019s 401(k) plan, representing the full value of his account. <em>Id. </em>at 359. Thus, when he brought suit in April 1998 alleging breaches of fiduciary duties by McGraw and the plan trustee Sydnor, he was a former McGraw employee who had received his vested benefits. Nonetheless, a unanimous three-judge panel found that Smith was entitled to bring his suit. <em>Id. </em>at 363. First, the court noted that Smith brought the action on behalf of himself, a class of employees and former employees, and \u201con behalf of the James McGraw, Inc. 401(k) Plan,\u201d and that the relief sought would inure directly to the plan. <em>Id. </em>The court continued: \u201cAlthough this remedy <em>will undoubtedly benefit </em>Smith and other participants in the Plan, it does not solely benefit the individual participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) Although the court did not directly address the plaintiffs statutory standing as a former employee, nor how exactly the relief to the plan would redress Smith\u2019s injury, the implication of the court\u2019s unequivocal language is that plan-wide relief will benefit a former employee who no longer has assets in the retirement plan. Indeed, it is relevant to consider that it would be impossible for the plaintiffs here to receive any money to which they might be entitled without having that relief first inure to the plan. <em>See Rankin, </em>220 F.R.D. at 520 (holding that a named plaintiff and former employee in a class action had standing because she was seeking recovery on behalf of the plan as well as herself and that \u201cdamages will presumably flow to the Plan and in turn, to class members, including Rankin\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In addition, the Third Circuit, in <em>In re Schering-Plough ERISA Litig., </em>420 F.3d 231 (3d Cir.2005), specifically rejected a reading of \u00a7 502(a)(2) and <em>Russell </em>that would bar the same kind of relief sought by the plaintiffs here. In that case, a group of former Schering-Plough employees brought an ERISA fiduciary breach suit, seeking money damages on behalf of the plan that would be allocated among the participants\u2019 individualized accounts in proportion to their losses. Declining to apply the Fifth Circuit\u2019s majority decision in <em>Milofsky v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>404 F.3d 338 (5th Cir.2005) \u2014 which the defendants cite \u2014 the court held that such relief is not barred even though it would only benefit a subset of plan participants.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 420 F.3d at 240. The court went further, stating that \u201c[t]he fact that damages paid to the Savings Plan for breaches of fiduciary duties will also indirectly benefit its participants does not bar a derivative action under \u00a7\u00a7 1109 and 1132(a)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241 (citing the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Smith, </em>184 F.3d at 363).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Accordingly, it would not be proper at this stage of the proceedings to dismiss the complaints on the grounds that the named plaintiffs lack constitutional standing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\n<em>Fiduciary Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Under ERISA, a person or entity may become a plan fiduciary through two means. The first way is by being expressly identified in the plan documents, either by name or according to a procedure specified in the plan, as having the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(a)(2). Defendants contend that \u201cmost of the Defendants are not identified in the plan documents\u201d as having the requisite authority to qualify as fiduciaries (Defs.\u2019 Mot. to Dismiss at 15), implying that they do not contest the status of those who are so identified.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Second, an entity can become an ERISA fiduciary by performing specified discretionary functions with respect to the plan\u2019s management, assets, or administration of a plan in a <em>de facto </em>capacity. <em>Custer, </em>89 F.3d at 1161. According to the statutory definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, (ii) he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A); <em>see also Mertens v. Hewitt </em>Assoc., 508 U.S. 248, 262, 113 S.Ct. 2063, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993) (noting that ERISA defines a fiduciary in <em>\u201cfunctional </em>terms of control and authority over the plan\u201d). Plan sponsors who adopt, modify, or terminate plans ordinarily act in a settlor capacity and not as a fiduciary. <em>See Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, </em>517 U.S. 882, 890, 116 S.Ct. 1783, 135 L.Ed.2d 153 (1996). It may be possible, however, for a plan fiduciary such as an employer to wear \u201ctwo hats,\u201d and, therefore, when assessing a breach of ERISA fiduciary duty claim, \u201cthe threshold question is not whether the actions of some person employed to provide services under a plan adversely affected a plan beneficiary\u2019s interest, but whether that person was acting as a fiduciary (that is, was performing a fiduciary function) when taking the action subject to complaint.\u201d <em>Pegram v. Herdrich, </em>530 U.S. 211, 226, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Thus, the dispute here largely revolves around (1) which functions and actions do or do not give rise to <em>de facto </em>fiduciary status; and (2) whether the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding fiduciary status are sufficient. The parties adopt quite different strategies in addressing these inquiries. Defendants argue that the discrete functions the plaintiffs invoke do not create fiduciary status, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 broader allegations of discretionary control are conclusory and fail to meet the appropriate pleading standard. Rather than counter each of the defendants\u2019 arguments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>plaintiffs argue that their claims should survive because (1) fiduciary status is a highly fact-intensive inquiry, (2) the definition has been interpreted broadly by courts, (3) they have in many cases alleged specific examples and inferences of discretionary control, and (4) they need discovery to determine the exact nature of each defendant\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Further, arguing that the complaints meet Rule 8\u2019s standard, the plaintiffs cite numerous decisions that decline to dismiss ERISA fiduciary duty claims supported by \u201ca bare minimum of factual allegations,\u201d or even by just a recitation of the statutory definition as quoted above. <em>See Concha v. London, </em>62 F.3d 1493, 1502 (9th Cir.1995); <em>In re Worldcom, Inc., </em>263 F.Supp.2d 745, 759 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (\u201cAlthough the Complaint\u2019s allegations against Ebbers do little more than track the statutory definition of fiduciary, similar allegations have been found sufficient to satisfy the Rule 8 pleading standard.\u201d); <em>Howell v. Motorola, Inc., </em>337 F.Supp.2d 1079, 1101 (N.D.Ill.2004); <em>In re Elec. Data Sys. Corp. \u201cERISA\u201d Litig., </em>305 F.Supp.2d 658, 664-65 (E.D.Tex. 2004) (noting that \u201ccourts will typically have insufficient facts at the motion to dismiss stage from which to make the law/ fact analysis necessary to determine functional or named fiduciary status.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Fourth Circuit law, however, requires more than the mere recitation of statutory language in an ERISA fiduciary breach case. The leading case is <em>Custer v. Sweeney, </em>89 F.3d 1156 (4th Cir.1996). In that case, the plaintiff Custer, a pension plan participant, alleged that Sweeney, the plan\u2019s attorney, was an ERISA fiduciary who breached his duties. The court held that Custer had not adequately pled Sweeney\u2019s fiduciary status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">While Custer\u2019s amended complaint is replete with assertions of Sweeney\u2019s \u201cdiscretionary authority, control, and responsibility over the management of the Fund and certain assets of the Fund,\u201d it nevertheless lacks any specific allegations. capable of demonstrating that Sweeney transcended his role as legal counsel. <em>See </em>5A Charles A. Wright <em>&amp; </em>Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1357, 317-18 (2d ed.1990) (noting that court need not accept plaintiffs \u201c .\u2018unwarranted deductions,\u2019 \u2018footless conclusions of law,\u2019 or \u2018sweeping legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations\u2019 \u201d (footnotes omitted)); <em>see also Randall v. United States, </em>30 F.3d 518, 522 (4th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1107, 115 S.Ct. 1956, 131 L.Ed.2d 849 (1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1163. The court noted that the facts as alleged only supported conclusions that Sweeney represented trustee subcommittees that made non-binding recommendations to the plan\u2019s board of trustees, and that he performed ministerial functions for the plan. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">In addition, defendants cite two more recent Fourth Circuit cases that adopt a stringent reading of Rule 8. <em>See Migdal v. Rowe Price-Fleming Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>248 F.3d 321, 326 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Bass v. E. I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co., </em>324 F.3d 761, 765 (4th Cir.2003) (cautioning that the circuit \u201chas not.. .interpreted <em>Swierkiewicz </em>as removing the burden of a plaintiff to allege facts sufficient to state all the elements of her claim.\u201d) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Despite the cases cited by plaintiffs\u2014 which are not in the Fourth Circuit and appear to be of varying soundness \u2014 the Fourth Circuit decisions strongly support the conclusion that the plaintiffs must do more than quote the statutory language regarding \u201cdiscretionary control\u201d to plead adequately that a given defendant is a <em>de facto </em>ERISA fiduciary. Further, allegations that a given defendant had the discretionary authority \u201cto add and/or remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>investment options,\u201d or \u201cto hire and terminate [] officers and employees,\u201d are not sufficient without a proffer of some factual basis for concluding that a given entity possessed such discretionary authority. The individual complaints must be examined to determine whether the plaintiffs have met their burden as to each defendant. For guidance, the court will address some of the parties\u2019 disputes as to what does or does not establish fiduciary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"> As mentioned above, plan sponsorship by itself does not create fiduciary status, because it is merely a corporate or settlor function. <em>See, e.g., Pegram, </em>530 U.S. at 225, 120 S.Ct. 2143; <em>Lockheed, </em>517 U.S. at 890, 116 S.Ct. 1783; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2509.75-8 at D-4-5. The parent companies of plan sponsors and administrators lack fiduciary status to the extent they do not actually exercise any control over plan assets or discretion over the plans of their subsidiaries, or exercise the power to appoint the actual fiduciaries. <em>See Gerzog v. London Fog Corp., </em>907 F.Supp. 590, 602 (E.D.N.Y.1995). Corporate officers and directors likewise do not become fiduciaries solely by virtue of their corporate position, even if the corporation is a fiduciary, \u201cunless it can be shown that they have <em>individual </em>discretionary roles as to plan administration.\u201d <em>Confer v. Custom Eng\u2019g Co., </em>952 F.2d 34, 37 (3d Cir.1991); <em>see also In re Worldcom, </em>263 F.Supp.2d at 759-61.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The defendants are correct that providing investment services to the underlying mutual funds would not make an entity a fiduciary for any retirement plan that simply invests in those funds. Under ERISA, however, an entity is a fiduciary if it provides (or is authorized to provide) investment advice \u201cdirect or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A). Thus, to the extent the plaintiffs allege that a given defendant had \u201cthe discretionary authority to add and/or remove investment options under the Plan\u201d (Am. Comply 20), these kinds of investment services would apply to the plan, and not to the underlying mutual funds.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The defendants also are correct that the mere performance of ministerial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>duties on behalf of the plan does not give rise to fiduciary status. <em>See Beddall v. State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>137 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir.1998) (noting that \u201cthe mere exercise of physical control or the performance of mechanical administrative tasks generally is insufficient to confer fiduciary status\u201d); <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2509.75-8 at D-2. Along these lines, the parties contest the significance of signing documents filed with the SEC. As the court stated in <em>In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig., </em>388 F.Supp.2d 1207 (D.Kan.2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">[t]hose who prepare and sign SEC filings do not become ERISA fiduciaries through those acts, and consequently, do not violate ERISA if the filings contain misrepresentations. Those who are ERISA fiduciaries, however, cannot in violation of their fiduciary obligations disseminate false information to plan participants, including false information contained in SEC filings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1226 (quoting <em>In re WorldCom, </em>263 F.Supp.2d at 766).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Finally, to the extent the defendants argue they cannot be deemed fiduciaries because the participants exercised control over their investments, as contemplated by \u00a7 404(c), this argument is essentially an affirmative defense not properly employed at the motion to dismiss stage. <em>See, e.g.; In re AEP, </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 829; <em>In re Enron, </em>284 F.Supp.2d at 578-79; <em>In re Worldcom, </em>263 F.Supp.2d at 764 n. 12.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Turning to the complaint in the <em>Strong </em>case, SCM, as noted above, is a named fiduciary. Strong Financial Corporation also appears to be a named fiduciary, but is not identified in the complaint. As to R. Strong, despite his allegedly major role in the underlying market timing activities, the complaint merely asserts that he \u201cwas a fiduciary of the Plan within the meaning of ERISA in that he exercised discretionary authority with respect to management and administration of the Plan and/or management and disposition of the Plan\u2019s assets.\u201d (Am.ComplJ 21.) Without more, this is not sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">\n<em>Imprudent Investment Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">The core of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of fiduciary duty is that the plan fiduciaries knew or should have known that the mutual funds, and in some instances the company stock, were imprudent investments due to market timing and late trading, and yet they failed to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>to protect the plan participants. Defendants argue that these claims should be dismissed as to the company stock \u2014 if not also as to the mutual funds \u2014 because the plan fiduciaries were entitled to a \u201cpresumption of prudence\u201d in maintaining these investments.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In other words, the defendants urge the court to adopt the reasoning of <em>Moench v. Robertson, </em>62 F.3d 553 (3d Cir.1995), in which the Third Circuit held that a fiduciary \u201cwho invests in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with ERISA by virtue of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568; <em>see also Kuper v. Iovenko, </em>66 F.3d 1447, 1459 (6th Cir.1995).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A plaintiff may overcome that presumption by establishing that the fiduciary abused its discretion in investing in employer securities. <em>Moench, </em>62 F.3d at 568. The defendants further contend that a plaintiff must plead \u201cdire circumstances\u201d or \u201cimpending collapse\u201d of the company to survive a motion to dismiss in the face of the <em>Moench </em>presumption. At least one district court in the Fourth Circuit apparently has adopted this reasoning. <em>See In re Duke Energy ERISA Litig., </em>281 F.Supp.2d 786, 795 (W.D.N.C.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Assuming without deciding that the Fourth Circuit would adopt the <em>Moench </em>presumption, I nonetheless do not find it should be accompanied by a standard of \u201cimpending collapse\u201d or similar circumstances. <em>See In re Sprint, </em>388 F.Supp.2d at 1224-25 (rejecting such a standard, and noting that in <em>Moench, </em>\u201cimpending collapse\u201d referred to the stock and not the company). First, the ERISA statute itself provides that fiduciaries for Eligible Individual Account Plans (EIAPs), and the subset thereof of Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), are exempt from the duty of prudence only as far as it pertains to diversification, and must still act in the best interests of the plan participants in general. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(2); <em>see, e.g., Chao v. Hall Holding Co., Inc., </em>285 F.3d 415, 425 (6th Cir.2002). Second, <em>Moench </em>and <em>Kuper </em>only addressed ESOPs, and not the larger class of EIAPs at issue here. While the Ninth Circuit has suggested that the <em>Moench </em>presumption, to the extent it is valid, would apply to EIAPs as a whole, <em>see Wright v. Oregon Metallurgical Corp., </em>360 F.3d 1090, 1098 n. 3 (9th Cir.2004), it is questionable whether all EIAPs are as strongly tied to the Congressional policy of promoting employee investment as are ESOPs. Finally, other courts have been reluctant to apply the presumption at the motion to dismiss phase, given the complexity and difficulty of balancing the competing concerns at issue. <em>See LaLonde v. Textron, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004) (declining to adopt the proposed test, stating that \u201c[bjecause the important and complex area of law implicated by plaintiffs\u2019 claims is neither mature nor uniform.. .we believe that we would run a very high risk of error were we to lay down a hard-and-fast rule.. .based only on the statute\u2019s text and history, the sparse pleadings, and the few and discordant judicial decisions discussing the issue we face\u201d); <em>In re AEP, </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 829 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">To the extent the defendants suggest that the presumption of prudence should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>be further extended to the plans\u2019 investments in company mutual funds, I decline to adopt an \u201cimpending collapse\u201d standard there for similar reasons, even assuming the <em>Moench </em>presumption applies to these kinds of investments. Accordingly, I will not grant a motion to dismiss in the <em>Strong </em>case based on a failure to plead facts sufficient to rebut that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\n<em>Other Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">As noted, the plaintiffs at oral argument indicated that they have abandoned their claims that the defendants engaged in misrepresentation and/or prohibited transactions. Their claims for a breach of the \u201cduty to monitor\u201d and co-fiduciary liability have transformed somewhat between the complaints and the briefs.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court will postpone any consideration of these claims until after any possible amendments to the complaints.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The motions to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part. The named plaintiff in the <em>Strong </em>subtrack, Brian Flynn, has standing as a \u201cparticipant\u201d under ERISA \u00a7 3(7) and under Article III to bring this action. He has not, however, adequately alleged the fiduciary status of R. Strong (or Strong Financial Corporation), and he is abandoning any claim for misrepresentation or prohibited transaction. Flynn may seek leave to amend his complaint, consistent with this opinion, within 60 days or by another date as set by the court upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">A separate Order follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">For the reasons stated in the accompanying Memorandum, it is hereby ORDERED that:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">1.

Likewise, <em>Rego </em>did not consider the question of whether plaintiffs may bring an action against the plan or the plan administrator under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) to recover the proceeds of any recovery obtained against fiduciaries in a \u00a7 502(a)(2) action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b484-3\">.Significantly, the <em>Rankin </em>court then stated that '\u2018[a]ny other considerations as to the precise form of recovery to the Plan and Rankin is premature.

Nonetheless, given that the plaintiffs will he granted leave to amend their complaints on other grounds, they may wish to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>such issues as: whether the present suits must include a claim for vested benefits, whether all necessary parties have been joined in these suits, and/or the potential source(s) of the court's jurisdiction to order any distribution of eventual recovery that would flow directly to the plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b485-11\">. It appears that from the beginning of the class period in the <em>Strong </em>suit, October 30, 1998, until December 31, 2001, SCM was in fact a named fiduciary for the Strong Plan. As of January 1, 2002, however, SCM ceded its role as Employer and Administrator to Strong Financial Corporation, which is not mentioned in the present complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b487-6\">. The ERISA complaints invoke <em>respondeat superior </em>as a basis for liability on the part of certain defendants, arguing that the misconduct of their employees who were plan fiduciaries can be imputed to them. Except possibly under the narrow circumstances where a principal fiduciary used an agent to perform its own specific fiduciary duties, however, this doctrine would not ordinarily generate liability or give rise to fiduciary status. Under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>a principal may be liable \"for the false statement or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope of his authority.\" <em>Gleason v. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co., </em>278 U.S. 349, 356, 49 S.Ct. 161, 73 L.Ed. 415 (1929). In line with the \"two hats\u201d theory, however, an employee who performs services on behalf of her employer\u2019s benefit plan may serve two masters: the company (as an employee), and the plan (as a fiduciary or agent thereof). When an employee takes actions regarding the plan, he is not \"acting within the scope of his authority\u201d granted by the employer, but rather that granted by the plan or plan fiduciary. <em>See Taylor v. Peoples Natural Gas Co., </em>49 F.3d 982, 988-89 (3d Cir.1995) (finding employee was non-fiduciary agent of plan administrator though employed by plan sponsor). Accordingly, <em>respondeat superior </em>cannot create fiduciary status on behalf of the employer, but could only give rise to liability where the employer is otherwise a plan fiduciary as to the functions performed by its agents. <em>See Crowley v. Corning, Inc., </em>234 F.Supp.2d 222, 228 (W.D.N.Y.2002) (dismissing <em>respondeat superior </em>claim where defendant lacked <em>de facto </em>control of agent regarding fiduciary functions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b487-11\"><em>. </em>The plaintiffs still have the burden of making specific factual allegations to support the conclusion that a given defendant has such authority to add and/or remove investment options for the plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">. Having discussed these specific issues, the court returns to the plaintiffs' argument that the documents they need to establish the exact nature of various defendants' fiduciary status are in the defendants\u2019 control. Defendants reply that the plaintiffs are only entitled to full discovery if the complaints are sufficient. At oral argument, counsel agreed to explore possible resolutions of this impasse. On October 5, 2005, defendants' counsel sent to the court a representative letter received from plaintiffs' counsel. The plaintiffs' letters apparently requested a very broad list of documents, which they claim are \u201crequired under ERISA Section 104(b)(4) to be provided to a plan participant upon request,\u201d to which the defendants object.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Given the holding above that the plaintiffs are \"participants\u201d under ERISA \u00a7 3(7), they are entitled to the information described in \u00a7 104(b)(4). This provision allows participants to obtain the following: \u201ca copy of the latest updated summary plan description, and the latest annual report, any terminal report, the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1024(b)(4). Without making a formal ruling on the issue in the absence of a ripe dispute, the court notes that much of what the plaintiffs request does not clearly fall within this definition. On the other hand, some generosity by the defendants at this point. may obviate the need for additional motions practice or full discovery at a later time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\">. Mr. Flynn does not claim to have held company stock through his retirement plan\u2014 indeed, SCM is privately held \u2014 and thus, his imprudent investment claim is based solely on the mutual funds held through the plan. However, this opinion will discuss the defendants\u2019 argument regarding company stock, given that it is relevant to several other tracks, and because it is a predicate to the defendants\u2019 argument regarding mutual funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b489-11\">. In so holding, the Third Circuit actually reversed a district court's opinion granting summary judgment on behalf of the defendants. 62 F.3d at 556.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\">. In their omnibus opposition brief, plaintiffs also raised the argument that defendants could be liable under a theory of third-party liability. In other words, even if certain defendants are not fiduciaries, they could be liable for breaches of plan fiduciaries in which they knowingly participated. <em>See LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>153 F.3d 134, 153 (4th Cir.1998). As the defendants properly assert, the court need not consider this claim because it does not appear anywhere in the complaints. <em>See, e.g., Freilich v. Bd. of Directors of Upper Chesapeake Health, Inc., </em>142 F.Supp.2d 679, 691 n. 7 (D.Md.2001) (court will not consider new claim raised in response to motion to dismiss in absence of amended complaint), <em>aff'd, </em>313 F.3d 205 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b490-18\">. The court will note, however, that the current complaints do not appear to state a claim for breach of the \u201cduty to monitor\u201d appointee-fiduciaries as recognized by the Fourth Circuit. <em>See Coyne &amp; Delany Co. v. Selman, </em>98 F.3d 1457, 1465-66 n. 10 (4th Cir.1996). Furthermore, a claim for co-fiduciary liability obviously requires, at a bare minimum, that there be more than one defendant fiduciary in any given suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
