Oquendo challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential standard for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Azmat, </em>805 F.3d 1018, 1047 (11th Cir.2015). We ensure that the distinct court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate the guideline range' or to explain the chosen sentence, and then we examine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in the light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The abuse of discretion standard \u201callows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc)). We will not disturb the sentence unless \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">Oquendo\u2019s sentence is proeedurally and substantively reasonable. Oquen-do downloaded to a laptop the credit card data of retail customers that a coconspirator copied onto a skimming device; stored blank credit cards and access device equipment at his home; and was compensated with counterfeit credit cards encoded with stolen identity infoiroation. Oquendo argues that the district court failed to explain its chosen sentence, but the district court explained at sentencing and in its statement of reasons that it imposed the maximum statutory penalty to punish Oquendo\u2019s \u201conerous and terrible crime,\u201d which involved 2,100 victims and losses exceeding $1.2 million, and to deter future \u201caccess fraud and skimming.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court reasonably determined that a variance three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>months above the high end of Oquendo\u2019s guideline range of 70 to 87 months was required to impose adequate punishment, to promote respect for the law, and to protect the public. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258, 1264-65 (11th Cir.2010). The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Oquendo to 90 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We AFFIRM Oquendo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
