Mr. Franco pled guilty to that charge, and the district court accepted the plea. According to the PSI, Mr. Franco was the head of a Colombian group responsible for importing over 1,800 kilograms of cocaine. Because the offense involved over 150 kilograms of cocaine, the PSI calculated a base offense level of 38, in accordance with the then-applicable 1997 Sentencing Guidelines. Taking into account other guideline adjustments, the PSI calculated a total offense level of 42 and criminal history of I, which yielded a sentencing range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court sentenced Mr. Franco to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">In 2015, Mr. Franco filed a motion for sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 782, which retroactively amended the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). In pertinent part, Amendment 782 increased the amount of cocaine necessary to qualify for a base offense level of 38 from at least 150 kilograms to at least 450 kilograms of cocaine. Because 1,800 kilograms \u2014 the amount Mr. Franco was responsible for\u2014 is still more than 450 kilograms, the district court found that Amendment 782 did not change Mr. Franco\u2019s base offense level and denied the motion for reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Mr. Franco, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion. He contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without first considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">A district court must engage in a two-step analysis when considering a motion for reduction of sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must determine the sentence it would have imposed, given the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range and keeping all other guideline findings made at the original sentencing hearing constant. <em>See id. </em>Second, the court must consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and then determine, in its discretion, whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 781. Of course, the district court need not reach the second step of the analysis nor examine the \u00a7 3553(a) factors if, as a threshold matter, the relevant amendment did not lower the. defendant\u2019s sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009). If a defendant\u2019s guideline range would not be lowered by an amendment, the court cannot reduce the sentence. <em>See United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of Mr. Franco\u2019s original sentencing, a drug quantity of 150 kilograms or more of cocaine resulted in a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (1997). As a result of Amendment 782, the guidelines now provide that a drug'quantity of 450 kilograms or more of cocaine triggers a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2014).\u2019 At no point, however, has Mr. Franco disputed that he pled guilty to a conspiracy involving more than 1,800 kilograms of cocaine. Indeed, at the original sentencing hearing, the district court found that Mr. Franco was responsible for \u201cover a thousand kilos of cocaine.\u201d Nevertheless, Mr. Franco argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. That argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The district court properly concluded that Mr. Franco was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782. Because Mr. Franco\u2019s 1,800-kilogram drug quantity still triggers a base offense level of 38, his new guideline calculation yields an identical sentencing range of 360 months to, life imprisonment. A district court is not authorized to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if an amendment to the sentencing guidelines would not lower that defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Once the district court correctly determined that Mr. Franco was ineligible for relief, it was not obligated to continue to the second step in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) analysis and evaluate the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Webb, </em>565 F.3d at 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Because retroactive application of the amended drug quantity table promulgated by Amendment 782 did not affect Mr. Franco\u2019s sentencing guideline range, the district court was not authorized to grant a motion for reduction of sentence. Accordingly, the district court properly denied Mr. Franco\u2019s motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
