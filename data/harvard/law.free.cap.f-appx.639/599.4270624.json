(\u201cAppellee\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, asking the district court to declare that the sinking of Appellee\u2019s yacht due to mechanical failure was not covered by an \u201call-risk\u201d marine insurance policy. After denying summary judgment to Great Lakes, the district court entered judgment in favor of Appellee based upon stipulated facts. The court found that Appellee met its initial burden of proving a fortuitous loss under the policy and that the policy exclusion on which Great Lakes relied to avoid coverage was ambiguous. On appeal, Great Lakes argues that Appellee failed to present evidence showing a fortuitous loss and that the policy exclusion is not ambiguous. After careful review, we affirm the district court as to the former ruling but vacate and remand for further proceedings on the application of the exclusionary provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">On November 5, 2012, the <em>Kan-Do, </em>a 51-foot Bluewater Motor Yacht owned by Appellee, sank in its \u201chome slip\u201d at Port Tarpon Marina in Tarpon Springs, Florida. The <em>Kan-Do </em>sank due to water intrusion after the bilge-pump system failed, preventing the boat from dewatering. The bilge-pump system, in turn, failed because of a blown fuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">No one knows what caused the fuse to blow. As of October 23, 2012, the <em>Kan-Do\u2019s </em>bilge-pump system was in good working order. In general, the <em>Kan-Do </em>was well-maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">When it sank, the <em>Kan-Do </em>was covered by what the parties agree is an \u201call-risk\u201d marine insurance policy issued by Great Lakes to Appellee. The policy provided coverage \u201cfor accidental physical loss of, or accidental physical damage to\u201d the <em>Kan-Do </em>during the policy period (\u201cCoverage A\u201d). The policy does not define \u201caccidental physical loss.\u201d Appellee filed a claim with Great Lakes based on the sinking of the <em>Katv-Do. </em>After investigating the facts and circumstances of the loss, Great Lakes denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Great Lakes then filed this action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, pursuant to the court\u2019s admiralty jurisdiction, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333, seeking a declaration that no coverage arising out of the <em>Kan-Do\u2019s </em>sinking existed under the policy. In pertinent part, Great Lakes disclaimed coverage because it concluded that no \u201caccidental\u201d or \u201cfortuitous\u201d loss had occurred and because an exclusion otherwise barred coverage. Great Lakes relied on Exclusion \u201cr\u201d to Coverage A, which provided that the policy did not cover losses for the following: \u201cDamage to the <em>[Kan-Do\u2019s </em>] engines, mechanical and electrical parts, unless caused by an accidental external event such as collision, impact with a fixed or floating object; grounding, stranding, ingestion of foreign, object, lightning strike or fire.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">The district court denied Great Lakes summary judgment, and the case was submitted to the court on stipulated facts. In finding for Appellee, the court issued two rulings, both of which are challenged by Great Lakes on appeal. First, the court ruled that the blown fuse, which caused the bilge pumps to fail, was an accidental or fortuitous event under the policy. Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>ond, the court found that Great Lakes could not rely on Exclusion r because it was inconsistent with the grant of coverage and created ambiguity in the policy. The court entered judgment in favor of Appellee in the amount of $94,960.12. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of a maritime insurance contract <em>de novo. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Lago Canyon, Inc., </em>561 F.3d 1181, 1189 n. 17 (11th Cir.2009). In general, as a reviewing court, we must interpret an insurance policy so as to give effect to the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations regarding the risks and protections to which they agreed. <em>Morrison Grain Co., Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>632 F.2d 424, 429-30 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Under Coverage A of the insurance policy, Great Lakes agreed to \u201cprovide coverage for accidental physical loss of, or accidental physical damage to\u201d the Kan-Do subject to, among other provisions, any applicable exclusions. The parties have stipulated that this is an \u201call-risk\u201d marine insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">In broad terms, all-risk insurance policies cover all \u201cfortuitous\u201d losses, \u201cunless the policy contains a specific provision expressly excluding the loss from coverage.\u201d <em>Dow Chem. Co. v. Royal Indem. Co., </em>635 F.2d 379, 386 (5th Cir. Jan. 26, 1981); <em>Goodman v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>600 F.2d 1040, 1042 (4th Cir.1979) (\u201c[A]ll risks policies have been construed as covering all losses that are \u2018fortuitous.\u2019 \u201d). \u201cA fortuitous event ... is an event which so far as the parties to the contract are aware, is dependent on chance. It may be beyond the power of any human being to bring the event to pass; it may be within the control of third persons; it may even be a past event, as the loss of a vessel, provided that the fact is unknown to the parties.\u201d <em>Morrison Grain Co., Inc., </em>632 F.2d at 431 (quoting Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 291, cmt. a (1932)). At the very least, fortuity excludes intentional or fraudulent losses and normal wear and tear. <em>City of Burlington v. Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>332 F.3d 38, 47-48 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">In order to recover under an all-risk insurance policy, the insured must first show (1) a fortuitous loss (2) that occurred during the policy period. <em>See Banco Nacional De Nicaragua v. Argonaut Ins. Co., </em>681 F.2d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir.1982); <em>see also Morrison Grain Co., </em>632 F.2d at 429-31. It is undisputed that the loss occurred during the policy period. The insured\u2019s burden of showing a fortuitous loss is \u201cnot a particularly onerous one.\u201d <em>Morrison Grain Co., Inc., </em>632 F.2d at 430. Indeed, we have recognized that \u201call risks insurance arose for the very purpose of protecting the insured in those cases where difficulties of logical explanation or some mystery surround the (loss of or damage to) property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the insured need not prove \u201cthe precise cause of the loss or damage\u201d to demonstrate fortuity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">Once the insured meets the light burden of establishing that a loss occurred due to some fortuitous event or circumstance, the burden shifts to the insurer to show that the loss is excluded by some language set out in the policy. <em>See Banco Nacional De Nicaragua, </em>681 F.2d at 1340; <em>Morrison Grain Co., Inc., </em>632 F.2d at 431; <em>Jewelers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>Mut. Ins, Co. v. Balogh, </em>272 F.2d 889, 892 (5th Cir.1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">A. Appellee\u2019s Burden of Showing Fortuity</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Appellee carried its \u201clight\u201d burden of establishing a fortuitous loss. Appellee established that the <em>Kan-do </em>sank because of water intrusion after the bilge-pump system failed and that the bilge-pump system failed because of a blown fuse. .No one knows what caused the fuse to blow. Appellee also presented evidence that the <em>Kan~Do </em>was well-maintained, and Great Lakes does not assert in this appeal that the losses were caused by wear and tear or lack of maintenance. Under these circumstances, the blown fuse is consistent with an unexplained event that, \u201cso far as the parties are aware, is dependent on chance.\u201d <em>Morrison Grain Co., Inc., </em>632 F.2d at 431 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Great Lakes contends that without any \u201cevidence showing what fortuitous event caused the fuse to fail\u201d or evidence that the bilge-pump system failed prematurely, the insured did not meet its burden- of showing fortuity because a court cannot distinguish whether the loss was caused by a fortuitous event or a non-fortuitous event. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">We have long held that requiring insurance claimants to prove the \u201cprecise cause\u201d of loss or damage in order to recover under an \u201call-risk\u201d insurance policy is \u201cinconsistent with the broad protective purposes of \u2018all risks\u2019 insurance.\u201d <em>Morrison Grain Co., </em>632 F.2d at 430. Under the circumstances here, where Great Lakes does not contend that the losses were caused by wear and tear or lack of maintenance, there was no need for Appel-lee to present evidence on the cause of the fuse\u2019s failure. It was enough to show that the bilge-pump system\u2019s failure was caused by a blown fuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Nor did Appellee have to present evidence indicating that the bilge-pump system failed prematurely. Evidence of a premature mechanical failure may, in some instances, be persuasive to rebut an insurer\u2019s claim that the loss or damage at issue was occasioned by normal wear and tear or the lack of appropriate maintenance rather than by chance. But Great Lakes has withdrawn any reliance on the policy exclusions for wear and tear or lack of maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">In sum, we conclude that the district court properly determined that Appellee met its initial, light burden of establishing a fortuitous loss within the policy period. Consequently, the burden shifted to the insurer, Great Lakes, to show that the loss was otherwise excluded under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">B. Great Lakes\u2019s Burden of Showing an Exclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Great Lakes claims that Exclusion r in the policy applies to preclude coverage. Exclusion r states that the following is not covered under the policy: \u201cDamage to the Scheduled Vessel\u2019s engines, mechanical and electrical parts, <em>unless caused by an accidental external event, </em>such as collision, impact with a fixed or floating object, grounding, stranding, ingestion of a foreign object, 'lightning strike or fire.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">Courts must enforce insurance provisions as written when they are unambiguous and understandable. <em>Parks Real Estate Purchasing Grp. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>472 F.3d 33, 42 (2d Cir.2006) (applying New York insurance law).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Ambiguity exists in an insurance policy when its terms are susceptible to different reasonable interpretations. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Tropical Shipping &amp; Constr. Co., Ltd., </em>254 F.3d 987, 1003 (11th Cir.2001). \u201c[T]o negate coverage by virtue of an exclusion, an insurer must establish that the exclusion is stated in clear and unmistakable language, is subject to no other reasonable interpretation, and applies in the particular case and that its interpretation of the exclusion is the only construction that [could] fairly be placed thereon.\u201d <em>Parks Real Estate Purchasing Grp., </em>472 F.3d at 42. Any ambiguity is resolved in favor of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 42-43; <em>Dow Chemical Co., </em>635 F.2d at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Here, the district court concluded that Exclusion r created ambiguity in the policy because, giving the ordinary meaning to the operative terms in both Coverage A and Exclusion r \u2014 such as \u201cmechanical parts,\u201d \u201cmachinery,\u201d and \u201cequipment\u201d \u2014 \u201cmany of the same parts of the <em>Kan-Do </em>could reasonably fall under either Coverage \u2018A\u2019 or Exclusion \u2018r,\u2019 thus creating ambiguity.\u201d Having found ambiguity, the court construed the contract against Great Lakes and found that Exclusion r did not apply to exclude coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We conclude that the court erred in finding ambiguity based on the fact that the same terms appeared in both Coverage A and Exclusion r. \u201c[S]imply because one provision gives a general grant of coverage and another provision limits this coverage does not mean there is an ambiguity or inconsistency between the two. This is the very nature of an insurance contract; exclusions in coverage are expressly intended to modify coverage clauses and to limit their scope.\u201d <em>Ajax Bldg. Corp. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>358 F.3d 795, 798-99 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also Central Int\u2019l Co. v. Kemper Nat\u2019l Ins. Cos., </em>202 F.3d 372, 374 (1st Cir.2000) (\u201c[U]nder ordinary principles of contract interpretation, there is little doubt that the exclusion is presumptively a qualification on the risk coverage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Under the terms of the policy, there is a general grant of coverage for \u201caccidental physical loss of, or accidental physical damage to the Scheduled Vessel.\u201d The policy defines \u201cScheduled Vessel\u201d as the vessel, including the hull, machinery, electrical equipment, and \u201call other equipment normally required for the operation and maintenance of the vessel.\u201d Coverage A states that coverage is \u201csubject to\u201d certain exclusions, including damage to \u201cengines, mechanical and electrical parts\u201d unless caused by an \u201caccidental external event.\u201d All told, the policy facially provides coverage for \u201caccidental physical damage\u201d to engines and mechanical and electrical parts <em>only if </em>the damage was caused by an \u201caccidental external event.\u201d Put differently, the coverage for engines and mechanical components appears to be narrower than the general all-risk coverage because it requires an external cause. <em>Cf. Morrison Grain Co., Inc., </em>632 F.2d at 430 (stating that the insured was not required \u201cto demonstrate that the loss or damage was occasioned by an external cause\u201d to establish fortuity); <em>City of Burlington, </em>332 F.3d at 48 (noting that many courts have rejected \u201can implicit external-cause requirement in all-risk policies\u201d). As a result, we do not find the policy to be ambiguous for the reason given by the district court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Appellee responds that the policy is ambiguous because \u201caccidental external event\u201d is not defined in the policy, so it is left with little guidance as to what is being excluded. So, for example, Appellee asserts, it is arguable whether water intrusion as a result of the bilge-pump system\u2019s failure qualifies as an \u201cexternal\u201d event. Great Lakes replies that water intrusion was not the relevant \u201ccause,\u201d but rather the blown fuse or the failed bilge-pump system was, neither of which Appellee contends is an \u201cexternal event.\u201d The district court did not address whether \u201caccidental external event\u201d or other specific terms in the exclusion itself were ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Although contractual ambiguity is a question of law that we may resolve in the first instance, we think the better course of action in these circumstances is simply to vacate the district court\u2019s ruling with respect to Exclusion r and remand for further proceedings. <em>See Wilherson v. Grinnell Corp., </em>270 F.3d 1314, 1322 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (11th Cir.2001) (noting our preference for the district court to address issues in the first instance). As we understand the exclusionary provision at issue, and as represented by Great Lakes in its briefing, the scope of the exclusion (the \u201cScheduled Vessel\u2019s engines, mechanical and electrical parts\u201d) is narrower than the extent of the policy\u2019s coverage (the \u201cScheduled Vessel\u201d itself). Additional fact finding therefore may be appropriate to determine the extent of damages. Because further proceedings are required regardless, we leave any arguments respecting additional sources of ambiguity in the policy for the district court to address in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Appellee established a fortuitous loss covered by the all-risk marine insurance policy. However, we vacate the court\u2019s determination that the exclusion on which Great Lakes relied to avoid coverage was ambiguous. We remand for further proceedings with respect to the application of Exclusion r.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">. Kan-Do, Inc., was originally named in the complaint but later changed in district court proceedings to the \"correct\u201d corporate name of Kan-Do Marine Research &amp; Products, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-9\">. Great Lakes initially pled two other grounds for denying coverage: (1) that the loss was due to wear and tear or gradual deterioration and (2) that the vessel was unseaworthy.
