The instant revocation, like the first, was based on Gilchrest\u2019s continued use of illicit drugs, in violation of the standard conditions of his release. On appeal, Gilchrest contends that his above-guidelines sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Because Gilchrest failed to lodge an objection following the imposition of the challenged sentence, we review the district court\u2019s decision for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Gilchrest argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain its decision to impose an above-guidelines sentence. He asserts in particular that the district court failed to address his pleas for a lenient sentence and did not attempt to apply the cited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors of punishment and deterrence to the specific facts of his ease. The sentencing transcript reflects that the district court heard argument from both Gil-chrest and his counsel in favor of a within-guidelines sentence. The court also had before it a significant record evidencing Gilchrest\u2019s ongoing inability to comply with the conditions of his supervised release. Given those facts, its decision to impose an above-guidelines sentence represents an implicit rejection of Gilchrest\u2019s pleas for leniency. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 524-26 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, the district court invoked the sentencing factors of punishment and deterrence in specific reference to Gilchrest\u2019s continued noncompliance with the mandatory conditions of his release, which was the very basis for the revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Although brief, the district court\u2019s stated reasons \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Accordingly, the court below did not commit clear or obvious procedural error with respect to its explanation of Gilchrest\u2019s above-guidelines revocation sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Moreover, even if there were error, Gilchrest fails to show that, \u201cbut for the error, he would have received a lesser sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Hebron, </em>684 F.3d 554, 559 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Gilchrest further contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir.2011), prohibited the district court from considering the need for punishment in imposing a supervised release revocation sentence. <em>Miller\u2019s </em>prohibition on considering punishment, however, does not apply to sentences, like Gilchrest\u2019s, imposed following mandatory revocation under \u00a7 3583(g). <em>See United States v. Illies, </em>805 F.3d 607, 609 (5th Cir.2015) (holding that a district court does not clearly err by considering the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in imposing a revocation sentence under \u00a7 3583(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Finally, Gilchrest asserts that the district court committed substantive error in its balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors by failing to give adequate consideration to the nature and circumstances of his offenses, his personal history and char-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>aeteristics, or the need for the revocation sentence to provide him with needed correctional treatment. As a court of review, we do not second-guess the reasonable findings of the sentencing court, which \u201cis in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Heard, </em>709 F.3d 413, 435 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Nothing in the record compels a finding that the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was unreasonable. Consequently, Gilchrest fails to show the existence of clear or obvious substantive error in that regard. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
