We have reviewed the appellate briefs of the parties and the record on appeal, including the portions under seal and the 23-page opinion of the district court sitting <em>en banc, </em>and we are satisfied that the sanction imposed by the district court is fully justified, irrespective of the fact that it is greater than the sanction imposed by the Louisiana Supreme Court. For essentially the same reasons as carefully explicated by the district court, its imposition of a three-year suspension from the practice of law before that court, effective October 19, 2015, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
