He seeks relief based on Amendment 782 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Hiciano argues that the district court abused its discretion because it denied his motion solely based upon the fact that he had previously received a reduction for substantial assistance and not based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-19\">When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court must first recalculate the guidelines range under the amended guidelines. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). If the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, the district court must next decide \u201cwhether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781. In doing so, the district court should consider the statutory factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) to determine whether the reduction is warranted and the extent of the reduction. <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(i). Although the district court must undertake this analysis, the district court retains its discretion not to reduce the sentence. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). Thus, in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 n. 8 (11th Cir .2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">Here, the district court explained that it had considered Hiciano\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. It stated that it had taken into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but reasoned that it had already \u201creduced the sentence due to the defendant\u2019s cooperation to a much greater extent than that recommended by the Government.\u201d For this reason, the court concluded that, even though the amendment applied, Hiciano\u2019s 180-month sentence was \u201creasonable.\u201d The district court was not required to articulate the applicability of each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Hiciano addressed the factors in his counseled supplemental reply, and the district court specifically acknowledged the responses by the parties before ruling on the motion. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 928 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Thus, the district court\u2019s denial of Hiei-ano\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was not an abuse of discretion because' the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determined that a 180-month sentence was reasonable. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760 (noting that the district court \u201chas the discretion to decide whether to re-apply a downward departure for substantial assistance when considering what sentence the court would have imposed under the amended guideline\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Hiciano\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
