Jamie Ruhl appeals the dismissal of his civil complaint against: (1) Cathi Spear, the mother of his minor child; (2) Alabama state court judges Brent Craig and Charles Langham, who entered orders in Spear\u2019s child custody and child support action; (8) Roy Moore, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama, in his official capacity as the official \u201cvested with presiding over the actions of the judicial branch with the state of Alabama\u201d; and (4) Luther Strange, Alabama Attorney General, in his official capacity \u201cas the state\u2019s chief law enforcement officer required to, among other things, defend the laws of the state of Alabama.\u201d Ruhl\u2019s complaint alleged that Judges Craig and Langham conspired with Spear to violate his constitutional rights in the Alabama child custody and child support proceedings. Ruhl asserted federal civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 and various state tort claims and sought declaratory and injunctive relief and compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">In dismissing Ruhl\u2019s claims \u201cin their entirety,\u201d the district court concluded that: (1) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over certain claims under the <em>Rook-er~Feldman </em>doctrine; (2) Ruhl\u2019s constitutional claims under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 were barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations; (3) the judicial defendants were entitled to judicial immunity; (4) the Alabama Attorney General was entitled to prosecutorial immunity; (5) all of the state defendants sued in. their official capacities for money damages were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity; (6) Ruhl lacked standing to bring claims alleging violations of Alabama criminal law; (7) Ruhl\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim under Alabama law for intentional infliction of emotional distress and unjust enrichment; and (8) Ruhl\u2019s claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress was not cognizable under Alabama law.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">After review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we find no reversible error and affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing all of Ruhl\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
