On appeal, Romeu argues that the district court failed to sufficiently explain its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. He also argues that the record lacked sufficient specificity regarding the drug quantity for which he was held responsible at sentencing. Finally, he argues that the original sentencing court violated the Ex Post Facto Clause by using the guidelines in effect at the time of his sentencing instead of those in effect at the time the offense was committed, He alleges that his base offense level should have been 36 instead of 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-20\">We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding its own authority under the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). The defendant bears the burden of proving that a retroactive amendment would lower his guideline range. <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir.2013). We will liberally construe a defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-21\">A district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently-been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d; and (2) the sentence reduction \u201cis consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 782 reduced by two levels the base offense levels that apply to most drug offenses. <em>See </em>USSG App. C, Amend. 782 (2014). This change is retroactive as a matter of Sentencing Commission policy, but the Sentencing Commission has announced that a sentence reduction is not consistent with its policy if the amendment at issue \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction proceeding is not a <em>de novo </em>sentencing and all the original sentencing determinations made by the district court remain the same, with the exception of the amended guideline range. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1198 (11th Cir.2010). Facts contained in a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) are deemed admitted for sentencing purposes unless a party objects to them clearly and specifically at sentencing. <em>See Davis, </em>587 F.3d at 1303-04. A court deciding a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion may thus rely on the undisputed facts in the PSI that were admitted at the original sentence proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Upon careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. As an initial matter, the district court could not grant Romeu relief on his alleged Ex Post Facto Clause violation. Because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, all original sentencing determinations remain unchanged except for the amended guideline range. <em>See Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1198. The district court did not have the \u201cjurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d such as this claim in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction proceeding. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Romeu bears the burden of establishing that Amendment 782 lowered his guideline range. <em>Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d at 337. He has not offered evidence that the drug quantity attributed to him at his original sentencing would result in a reduced guideline range under Amendment 782. Though his PSI set forth that the offense involved drugs in an amount equal to 767,-773 kilograms of marijuana, Romeu objected at his original sentencing to the drug quantity and suggested he should be held accountable for only an amount equal to 169,878 kilograms of marijuana. It is not clear from, the record which amount the original sentencing court relied on to sentence Romeu. Unfortunately for Romeu, it makes no difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Even if the sentencing court granted Romeu\u2019s objection and held him accountable for 169,878 kilograms of marijuana, that amount is above the 90,000-kilogram threshold necessary to trigger the highest base offense level of 38 under Amendment 782. USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). That means Romeu\u2019s base offense level would not be different even after Amendment 782. The district court thus lacked authority to reduce Romeu\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 IB 1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Romeu\u2019s argument that the district court failed to explain its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors also fails. Where a district court recognizes that it has no authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), it does not need to examine the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Webb, </em>565 F.3d at 793. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Romeu\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
