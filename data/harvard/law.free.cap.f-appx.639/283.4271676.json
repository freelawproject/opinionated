He is serving a sentence for federal drug and firearm offenses. Cook\u2019s petition alleged that he is being unlawfully detained because he has not been given credit for time served while he was in state custody. Also, he moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP),</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Because Cook\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition raised legal claims that were rejected in a prior \u00a7 2241 proceeding, <em>see Cook v. Meeks, </em>Civ. No. 12-179, 2014 WL 2154897 (W.D.Penn. May 22, 2014), the district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed the new \u00a7 2241 petition for abuse of the writ. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a); <em>United States v. Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 177-78 (5th Cir. 1994). We DISMISS Cook\u2019s appeal as frivolous, <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2, and DENY his IFP motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
