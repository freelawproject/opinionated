By moving to proceed IFP, Perez challenges the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. </em>Taylor; 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry is limited to whether Perez has demonstrated good faith by raising any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>nonfrivolous issue. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In 2010, Perez pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the distribution of five kilograms or more of a mixture or* substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine. The district court sentenced Perez to 121 months of imprisonment. Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and in light of Amendment 782 of the Sentencing Guidelines, Perez moved for a reduction of sentence. The district court granted Perez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and reduced his sentence to the statutory minimum sentence of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Perez argues that he is entitled to the full benefit of Amendment 782 and that his sentence should have been reduced to 97 months, the bottom of the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a sentence that was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). Perez\u2019s argument has no merit because the district court lacked authority to reduce his sentence below the 10-year statutory minimum. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 578-81 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Perez fails to demonstrate a nonfrivo-lous issue for appeal. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R, 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
