Patterson contends that he was entitled to a two-level reduction in his offense level based on Amendment 782 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 and that the district court denied his motion without reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-21\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a sentence may be modified if the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment was based on a sentencing range later lowered by the Sentencing Commission and made retroactively available. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 825-26, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court is to conduct a two-step analysis. <em>Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683. The court must first determine whether the defendant is eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>Id. </em>at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683. If he is, the district court must then \u201cconsider any applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion,\u201d a reduction is warranted under the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>This court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence reduction determination under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, its interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In Patterson\u2019s case, our analysis ends with the first step. Contrary to his contention, the district court\u2019s order addressed his eligibility for a sentence reduction, correctly holding that he was not eligible. Amendment 782 provides a base offense level of 38 for a defendant convicted of an offense involving 4.5 kilograms of \u201cIce\u201d methamphetamine \u2014 the same level applied to Patterson. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G., APP. C., AMEND. 782, <em>with </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2005). Thus, the district court was without authority to \u201cmodify [the] term of imprisonment ... imposed\u201d on Patterson. <em>Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 819, 130 S.Ct. 2683. Because Patterson fails the first part of the <em>Dillon </em>analysis, additional discussion is unnecessary. <em>Id. </em>at 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
