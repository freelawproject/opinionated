Vera\u2019s convictions stem from Vera\u2019s involvement in a marijuana-growing operation. On appeal, Vera challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-24\">In determining whether the district court applied correctly an obstruction-of-justice enhancement, we review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings and review <em>de novo </em>the court\u2019s application of the guidelines to those facts. <em>United States v. Bradberry, </em>466 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cUnder the clearly erro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>neous standard, we must affirm the district court unless review of the entire record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In pertinent part, section 3C1.1 provides for a two-level increase to the defendant\u2019s base offense level if \u201c(1) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing\u201d of his offense of conviction, and <em>\u201c(2) </em>the obstructive conduct related to ... the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The Application Notes to section 3C1.1 list examples. of conduct warranting the enhancement, including \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">A defendant\u2019s testimony constitutes perjury when the testimony: (1) is made under oath; (2) is false; (3) is material; and (4) is \u201cgiven with the willful intent to provide false testimony and not a result of mistake, confusion, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 n. 4 (11th Cir.2002). For purposes of section 3C1.1, \u201cmaterial ... means evidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The record supports the district court\u2019s factual determination that Vera committed perjury. At trial, while under oath, Vera denied \u201cabsolutely\u201d that he was involved in marijuana cultivation, after being released from jail in November 2011. Two separate witnesses testified, however, about Vera\u2019s involvement in a marijuana-growing operation in 2012. The testimony of these two witnesses contradicted flatly and was irreconcilable with Vera\u2019s testimony. Viewing the record as a whole, we are not left \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court committed a mistake in determining that Vera testified falsely. <em>See McPhee, </em>336 F.3d at 1275. The district court\u2019s determination is further supported by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, which demonstrates necessarily that the jury credited the testimony of the two witnesses over that of Vera. The district court committed no clear error in determining that Vera perjured himself and, thus, applied properly a two-level enhancement under section 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">We reject Vera\u2019s contention that his trial testimony constituted only a \u201cgeneral denial of guilt\u201d and, thus, was not subject to the obstruction-of-justice enhancement. The guidelines provide expressly that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s denial of guilt <em>(other than a denial of guilt under oath that constitutes perjury), </em>... is not a basis for application of\u2019 an obstruction-of-justice enhancement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.2) (emphasis added). Because Vera\u2019s denial of guilt was <em>both </em>made under oath <em>and </em>constituted perjury, Vera\u2019s argument that his testimony should be exempted from section 3C.1.1 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
