Garza-Medina\u2019s motion sought reopening under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) on the grounds that the controlled substance offense that led to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>removal no longer qualified as an aggravated felony and that he was entitled-to relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The BIA denied the motion as untimely and declined to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen, citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d), which provides that an alien who has departed the United States may not file a motion to reopen and is often referred to as the departure bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We have jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Our jurisdiction is dependent upon the petitioner presenting his claims to the BIA, as this court may not consider claims that have not been exhausted. <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 323-24 (5th Cir.2009). However, constitutional claims need not be presented to the BIA because the BIA lacks the authority to resolve them. <em>Falek v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 285, 291 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Garza-Medina\u2019s arguments that he has a due process right to a hearing on his motion to reopen and that the departure is invalid ai\u2019e foreclosed. <em>Ovalles v. Holder, </em>577 F.3d 288 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Nguyen v. Dist. Dir., Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>400 F.3d 255, 259 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 674-76 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.2002). Although Garza-Medina argues that our decisions on these issues were wrongly decided or are no longer valid in light of intervening Supreme Court decisions, we must follow those decisions \u201cabsent an intervening change in the law, such as by a statutory amendment, or the Supreme Court, or [this] en banc court.\u201d <em>Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008). None of the authorities cited by Garza-Medina effects such a change in the law. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Garza-Medina\u2019s untimely motion to reopen, which only sought relief under \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Garza-Medina did not present his claims regarding equitable tolling and inconsistent application of the departure bar to the BIA. Although Garza-Medina could have argued that he was entitled to equitable tolling in his motion to reopen, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Carias, </em>697 F.3d 257, 260 (5th Cir.2012), he did not. Moreover, we do not recognize effective exhaustion. <em>Omari, </em>562 F.3d at 321-23. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider them. <em>Id. </em>at 323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The petition for review is DENIED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.- R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.-</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
