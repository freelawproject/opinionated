The district court affirmed the denial of benefits and Hurst appealed. We affirm the district court and uphold the denial of benefits as supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-17\">Hurst applied for disability benefits in November 2010, alleging a disability dating back to October 2009 based on lupus, plaque psoriasis, and depression. Her application for benefits stated that she worked as an assistant director and then as a director at a daycare facility but had to stop working due to her symptoms, which included joint pain, swelling, and lesions over much of her body. After her application was denied, she requested and received an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-18\">The administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that Hurst was not disabled for purposes of the Social Security Act; As relevant here, the ALJ found that al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>though Hurst\u2019s obesity and psoriatic arthritis were severe impairments, she did not have an impairment listed in Appendix 1 of the regulations and retained the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work, including her prior position as a daycare director.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agency\u2019s Appeals Council denied review,</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Hurst then filed a complaint in district court. The district court affirmed the agency\u2019s denial of benefits, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and report. That report concluded that the agency\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. It noted that while the ALJ erroneously stated that Hurst failed to argue that her conditions satisfied the requirements of any impairment listed in Appendix 1, that error was harmless. Hurst timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Our review of disability benefit determinations \u201cis limited under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) to two inquiries: (1) whether substantial evidence of record supports the decision; and (2) whether the decision comports with proper legal standards.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cIn applying the \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard, we \u2018may not reweigh the evidence in the record, nor try the issues <em>de novo, </em>nor substitute the Court\u2019s judgment\u2019 \u201d for the judgment of the ALJ.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">The Social Security Act defines disability as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected ... to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By regulation, the Social Security Administration follows a five-step process to determine whether a claimant is disabled.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the first two steps, not at issue here, the claimant must show she is not currently engaged in substantial gainful activity and has a severe impairment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Third, she must show that her impairment \u201cmeets or equals the severity of an impairment listed\u201d in Appendix l.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If she makes such a showing, the inquiry is at an end and the claimant is entitled to benefits;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> otherwise, we proceed to step four, in which she must show her impairment \u201cprevents [her] from doing past relevant work.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If she does so, she is entitled to benefits unless, at step five, the agency shows that the impairment does not prevent her from \u201cmak[ing] an adjustment to other work.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-14\">Hurst first contends that the ALJ applied the incorrect legal standard at step three of the analysis by failing to consider Hurst\u2019s eligibility for benefits under \u00a7 8.05 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>of Appendix 1, which concerns \u201cextensive skin lesions that persist for at least 3 months despite continuing treatment as prescribed.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">As an initial matter, we acknowledge that the ALJ\u2019s statement that Hurst \u201cadvanced no argument that he [sic] has a condition which meets ... the requirements of a listed impairment\u201d was incorrect. Indeed, Hurst\u2019s attorney argued in the pre-hearing brief and at the hearing that Hurst\u2019s impairments met or were equivalent to sections 8.05 (dermatitis) and 14.09 (inflammatory arthritis) of Appendix I. Hurst, citing this court\u2019s decision in <em>Audler v. Astrue,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>argues that the ALJ\u2019s failure to address her section 8.05 claim requires remand because the decision denying benefits amounts to a \u201cbare conclusion ... beyond meaningful judicial review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\"><em>Audler, </em>however, does not stand for the proposition that the ALJ\u2019s failure to address a claimant\u2019s argument always warrants remand. After determining that the ALJ\u2019s conclusory rejection of Audler\u2019s argument was not supported by a reasoned discussion of the issues, this court then inquired whether that error was harmless.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cProcedural perfection in administrative proceedings is not required,\u201d we noted, \u201cas long as the substantial rights of a party have not been affected.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We remanded Audler\u2019s claim for further proceedings only after analyzing the record, which included uncontradicted evidence of severe limitations, and concluding that \u201c[a]bsent some explanation from the ALJ to the contrary, Audler would appear to have met her burden of demonstrating\u201d that her condition met the requirements of a condition listed in Appendix l.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Whether Hurst\u2019s claims require remand depends on whether the ALJ\u2019s error \u201ccast[s] into doubt the existence of substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision,\u201d the question to which we now turn.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-15\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-16\">Hurst claims the administrative decision denying benefits at step three \u201cinclude[d] material misstatements of fact\u201d and \u201cneglected to consider highly relevant evidence.\u201d She seeks, among other things, a remand to determine whether her conditions qualified as an impairment under section 8.05 of Appendix 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">Section 8.05 is the listing for \u201cdermatitis ... with extensive skin lesions that persist for at least 3 months despite continuing treatment as prescribed.\u201d \u201cExtensive skin lesions,\u201d in turn, \u201care those that involve multiple body sites or critical body areas, and result in a very serious limitation.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As examples of conditions that amount to \u201cvery serious limitations\u201d in the context of this section, the regulation cites lesions that \u201cvery seriously limit\u201d the \u201cuse of more than one extremity,\u201d \u201cability to do fine and gross motor movements,\u201d or \u201cability to ambulate.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-18\">Although the ALJ failed to cite section 8.05 in her decision, she did cite considerable evidence that bolstered her conclusion that Hurst \u201cdoes not have an impairment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals the severity\u201d of an impairment listed in Appendix 1. The ALJ\u2019s step-three analysis focuses on the assessment of Dr. Angele Bourg, who asserted that Hurst was disabled because she \u201cwould always have difficulty with ambulation.\u201d Noting that treatment records revealed \u201cno evidence of ineffective ambulation as defined in the listings,\u201d the ALJ gave little weight to Dr. Bourg\u2019s opinion. Elsewhere, in her examination of Hurst\u2019s residual functional capacity for purposes of the step-four analysis, the ALJ discussed a variety of evidence tending to show that Hurst\u2019s statements concerning the \u201cintensity, persistence and limiting effects\u201d of her symptoms were not fully credible. This evidence included a paucity of documented complaints of functional limitations in the medical records and examination findings that revealed no severe limitations. As the magistrate judge noted, the record also includes hearing testimony that Hurst is sometimes able to drive, perform household chores, care for her child, use a computer, and shop. Taken together, this evidence supports a conclusion that Hurst\u2019s lesions do not give rise to a very serious limitation within the meaning of the regulations. We thus conclude that the ALJ\u2019s failure to explicitly consider section 8.05 was harmless error.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Hurst urges us to reach a different conclusion, noting that she has a history of \u201csevere flares of psoriasis,\u201d uses various medications, and is (among other things) \u201cunable to get out of bed some mornings.\u201d As we have noted, Hurst\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to meet her burden of demonstrating entitlement to benefits unless it demonstrates that her condition results in very serious limitations. Labelling a symptom \u201csevere\u201d or noting that it has persisted despite treatment is not enough. Hurst takes issue with the ALJ\u2019s resolution of conflicting medical opinions and alleges that the ALJ \u201cignored highly relevant medical evidence\u201d and mischaracter-ized parts of the medical record, including the frequency of Hurst\u2019s visits to physicians and her use of medications. For the reasons described above, however, we conclude that there is no doubt that \u201ccredible evidentiary choices or medical findings support\u201d the ALJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, Hurst asserts that the district court was \u201cretrying the case\u201d and substituting its judgment for the judgment of the Commissioner, but the court below undertook only the analysis necessary to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s procedural error affected the substantial rights of the claimant. The district court held that it did not, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">Analysis under section 14.09 of Appendix 1, which addresses inflammatory arthritis, yields the same result. Section 14.09 encompasses inflammation \u2014 often accompanied by joint pain, swelling, and tenderness \u2014 \u201cthat results in an \u2018extreme\u2019 (very serious) limitation.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The ALJ explicitly considered Hurst\u2019s eligibility for benefits under this section, and the credibility determinations and analysis of the medical evidence are \u2014 for the reasons discussed above \u2014 supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">To the extent Hurst challenges the ALJ\u2019s conclusion at step four that she retained the functional capacity to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>her prior, work, we find that the ALJ\u2019s determinations in this regard are likewise amply supported by substantial evidence. The evidence discussed above \u2014 including the treatment notes and Hurst\u2019s testimony at her hearing \u2014 are sufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Hurst is able to perform sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">Finally, Hurst faults the ALJ for failing to consider a closed period of disability. Hurst posits that even though her May 2011 visit to a physician \u201cdocument[ed] improvement\u201d in her condition, the ALJ should have considered whether Hurst was disabled for some twelve-month period ending before that time. We disagree. The ALJ considered the entire medical record, including evidence relating to visits within the twelve months following the asserted onset of disability, in reaching her conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1045-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
