AAIC issued an umbrella policy of insurance to Thierry Genoyer as the named insured and seeks a declaration that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Connor Logan, Thierry Genoyer and Luke Genoyer (\u201cDefendants\u201d) in connection with a personal injury action Logan brought against the Genoyers in a Florida state court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Defendants concede that the \u201ccross-liability exclusion\u201d of the AAIC bars coverage for Logan\u2019s claims against the Genoyers, but argue that they are entitled to coverage under the policy based on promissory estoppel. The District Court rejected Defendants\u2019 promissory estoppel argument and granted AAIC summary judgment in an order entered on August 20, 2015. Defendants appeal the judgment. We affirm, concluding for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s order that Defendants failed to establish a case of promissory estoppel as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-27\">. Logan seeks damages for the injuries he sustained when he lost control of a vehicle entrusted to him by Luke Genoyer, with the permission of his father, Thierry Genoyer, and struck a tree.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
