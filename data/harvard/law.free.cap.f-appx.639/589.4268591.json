(Kansas Counselors) in a civil action alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692, <em>et seq. </em>(FDCPA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681, <em>et seq. </em>(FCRA), the Federal Debt Collection Procedure Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001, <em>et seq. </em>(FDCP), the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (FOIA), and the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.72 (FCCPA). Stanley argues the district court erred in the following ways: (1) failing to strike the affidavit of Steve Tomac as hearsay and for lack of personal knowledge; (2) granting summary judgment on Stanley\u2019s \u00a7\u00a7 1692e(2), 1692e(5), and 1692f(l) claims based on the bona fide error defense, which Kansas Counselors had not argued; and (3) failing to require Kansas Counselors to provide an original contract or assignment demonstrating the existence of the debt and Kansas Counselors\u2019 right to collect the debt. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in considering Tomac\u2019s affidavit. The affidavit was based upon Tomac\u2019s personal knowledge and upon his review of Kansas Counselors\u2019 business records. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>affidavit states that Tomac is Director of Compliance at Kansas Counselors and that he personally sought and reviewed Kansas Counselors\u2019 business records pertinent to this action. When Tomac\u2019s affidavit describes the content of a document, the affidavit identifies and attaches the document. <em>See Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Air Exp. Int\u2019l USA, Inc., </em>615 F.3d 1305, 1317 (11th Cir.2010) (finding no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s considering an affidavit that describes and attaches business records); Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). Tomac\u2019s affidavit was based on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and demonstrated Tomac\u2019s competence to testify as to the matters described therein. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(4). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The district court relied upon an erroneous basis in granting summary judgment on Stanley\u2019s \u00a7\u00a7 1692e(2), 1692e(5), and 1692f(1) claims, but summary judgment was nevertheless appropriate. Kansas Counselors did not argue the bona fide error defense in its motion, and the-district court did not provide Stanley with notice of or an opportunity to respond to that basis for summary judgment. The district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment based on bona fide error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). Despite the error, the Court may affirm the judgment on any ground that appears in the record. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007). We affirm based on the absence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence or amount of the debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Stanley argues that Kansas Counselors violated \u00a7\u00a7 1692e(2), 1692e(5), and 1692f(1) by falsely representing the existence and the amount of debt that Stanley owed in order to collect those amounts. Tomac\u2019s affidavit, however, identifies documents supporting the existence of the debts and the amount of indebtedness and avers that Kansas Counselors was never notified that the debts had been paid or extinguished. In her counter-affidavit, Stanley disputes the sufficiency of Tomac\u2019s affidavit, avers that she \u201cis not obligated to pay neither [the original creditors] nor Kansas Counselors and has no business relations with either of the ... entities,\u201d and relies upon a misreading of a document attached to Tomac\u2019s affidavit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Other than Stanley\u2019s own conclusory and self-serving allegations that she did not owe the amount that Kansas Counselors was attempting to collect, there is no evidence that Kansas Counselors used any false, deceptive, or misleading representation about the amount of the debt, threatened to take illegal action, or attempted to collect any amount that was not authorized. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e(2)(A), 1692e(5), 1692(f)(1). Accordingly; summary judgment was proper as to Stanley\u2019s \u00a7\u00a7 1692e(2), 1692e(5), and 1692f(l) claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Finally, the district court did not err by not requiring Kansas Counselors to produce an original contract or assignment. Stanley fails to identify a sound legal basis for her conclusion that a debt collector must verify its or the debtor\u2019s relationship with the underlying creditor in the form of a written original contract or assignment. Tomac\u2019s affidavit and the documents attached thereto sufficiently identify the source of the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>debt \u2014 medical bills incurred \u2014 and of Kansas Counselors\u2019 right to collect the debt \u2014 a referral from Stanley\u2019s original creditors. Therefore, the district court had adequate, uncontradicted summary judgment evidence demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of and Kansas Counselors\u2019 right to collect the underlying debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\">. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings at the summary judgment stage, <em>Wright v. Farouk Systems, Inc., </em>701 F.3d 907, 910 (11th Cir.2012). We review <em>de novo </em>an order granting summary judgment, viewing the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Turnes v. AmSouth Bank, N.A., </em>36 F.3d 1057, 1060 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">. Stanley argues that one of her creditors' statements showing a $0 balance indicates the nonexistence of the debt. This argument fails because the statement also includes two line items showing the existence of the debt (two unpaid deductibles for medical services received) and two line items showing that the creditor internally allocated the debt to \u201cCOLLECTIONS,\u201d thus leaving a $0 balance from the creditor's perspective.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
