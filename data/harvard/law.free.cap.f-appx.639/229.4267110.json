Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001). We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Tran v. Mukasey, </em>515 F.3d 478, 481 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The district court did not err in denying the application. Despite Hook\u2019s protestations to the contrary, the record establishes that he has \u201cfail[ed] or refused] to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to [his] departure,\u201d thus warranting the extending of the generally applicable 90-day removal period. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1), (2). Though Hook purports to be a citizen of the United Kingdom, he has repeatedly rebuffed requests from ICE and U.K. consular officials to provide the specific information and documentation regarding his identity necessary to secure travel documents. The information he has provided has been vague, which is concerning in light of U.K. officials\u2019 credible suspicions about his professed identity. Hook\u2019s failure to cooperate with the efforts to remove him tolled the running of the removal period. <em>Benn v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>82 Fed.Appx. 139, 140 (5th Cir.2003) (alien\u2019s incomplete and conflicting statements to the INS hampered removal efforts and thus extended removal period); <em>Pelich v. INS, </em>329 F.3d 1057, 1060 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[t]he detainee cannot convincingly argue that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future if the detainee controls the clock.\u201d). Accordingly, Hook has failed to show that under the circumstances, his continued detention violates his constitutional rights and that \u201cthere is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Hook also challenges the determination that two exhibits containing foreign documents were self-authenticating under Federal Rule of Evidence 902(3). He contends that they were not public documents subject to the rule and that, in any event, there was no showing of good cause to deem them self-authenticating in the absence of a final certification as required by the rule. Hook did not timely object to the introduction of one of the exhibits, and, as to the other, he did not raise either of the arguments that he now advances, and so our review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evm 103(a)(1); <em>United States v. Seale, </em>600 F.3d 473, 485 (5th Cir.2010). Because Hook has not demonstrated that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the documents been excluded, he has not shown that his substantial rights were affected. <em>See United States v. Cervantes, </em>706 F.3d 603, 616 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
