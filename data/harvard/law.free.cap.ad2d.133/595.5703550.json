Co. v Port of N. Y. Auth., </em>61 AD2d 953, 954). In a case such as this, where an admission of liability by the plaintiff contractor is clearly implicit in the liquidation agreement, suit against the owner may be prosecuted in the contractor\u2019s name, even though no damages have been suffered directly by the contractor <em>(see, Lambert Houses Redevelopment Co. v HRH Equity Corp., supra; Ardsley Constr. Co. v Port of N. Y. Auth., supra; Simmons Co. v United States, </em>304 F2d 886, 890; <em>but cf., Mars Assocs. v New York City Educ. Constr. Fund, </em>126 AD2d 178, 192). Moreover, such a suit can be brought in the plaintiff contractor\u2019s name even though the subcontractor is made primarily responsible for prosecuting this action and bearing the costs of the litigation <em>(see, Lambert Houses Redevelopment Co. v HRH Equity Corp., supra; Ardsley Constr. Co. v Port of N. Y. Auth., supra). </em>Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment dismissing the third cause of action in the complaint was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The defendants concede that the issue of whether they were shielded from liability for delay damages by the exculpatory provisions in the contract with the plaintiff was not raised before the court of first instance and is thus not properly before this court on appeal <em>(see, Lavine v Lavine, </em>127 AD2d 566; <em>Risucci v Homayoon, </em>122 AD2d 260). Lawrence, J. P., Eiber, Spatt and Sullivan, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
