Leff, J.), rendered May 28, 1985, convicting defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third and seventh degrees and sentencing him as a predicate felon to two concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of from 4 Vi to 9 years and one definite term of 6 months, respectively, unanimously modified, on the law, to vacate the conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and to dismiss the underlying charge (count three), and, except as thus modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">As the People concede, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, as charged in this case, is an inclusory concurrent offense of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. (CPL 1.20 [37]; 300.30 [4].) Thus, the conviction of criminal possession of a controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>substance in the seventh degree must be vacated and the underlying charge dismissed. (CPL 300.40 [3] [b]; <em>People v Holman, </em>117 AD2d 534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">We have examined defendant\u2019s other points and find that they are without merit. Concur\u2014Murphy, P.
