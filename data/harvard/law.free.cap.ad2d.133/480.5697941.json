The affidavits before Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Court indicate that the papers were \"secured * * * on the front door\u201d of the attorney\u2019s residence by a process server at about 11:30 p.m. on July 30, 1987 after another process server had failed to serve the attorney\u2019s wife upon attempting service two hours earlier. The failure to deliver process to a person of suitable age and discretion at the dwelling place of the person to be served <em>(see, </em>CPLR 308 [2]), where such service could have been made with due diligence, precludes the later use of \"affix and mail\u201d service under CPLR 308 (4) <em>(see, Rossetti v DeLaGarza, </em>117 AD2d 793; <em>Weinberg v Hillbrae Bldrs., </em>58 AD2d 546; <em>Levin v McGovern, </em>53 AD2d 1042). Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Judgment affirmed, without costs. Kane, J. P., Main, Mikoll, Yesawich, Jr., and Harvey, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
