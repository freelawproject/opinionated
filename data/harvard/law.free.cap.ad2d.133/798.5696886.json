The plaintiff\u2019s fall was purportedly precipitated by a defect in the sidewalk, to wit, one square of concrete was raised above the adjoining square, which caused an \"indentation\u201d in the sidewalk. The defendant Robert Schauder, doing business as Carvel No. 1351 (hereinafter Schauder), was the franchised owner of a Carvel store doing business at the premises. While the owner of a store \"is charged with the duty of providing the public with a reasonably safe premises, including a safe means of ingress and egress\u201d <em>(Gallagher v St. Raymond\u2019s R. C. Church, </em>21 NY2d 554, 557), the plaintiff has failed to set forth any triable issues of fact concerning Schauder\u2019s conduct upon which a breach of this duty could be found <em>(see, Blais v St. Mary\u2019s of Assumption R. C. Church, </em>89 AD2d 653; <em>Sacco v City of Buffalo, </em>78 AD2d 1000). Mangano, J. P., Thompson, Lawrence and Harwood, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
