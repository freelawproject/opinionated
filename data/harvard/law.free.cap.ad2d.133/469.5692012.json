However, although the evidence independent of the accomplice\u2019s testimony might have had neutral explanations, it so harmonized with the accomplice\u2019s narrative as to have a tendency to furnish the necessary connection between this defendant and the crimes, so as to reasonably satisfy the jury that the accomplice was telling the truth <em>(see, People v Dory, </em>59 NY2d 121; <em>People v Glasper, 52 </em>NY2d 970). Hence, there was sufficient corroborating evidence of the accomplice\u2019s testimony, which testimony clearly implicated the defendant in the instant crimes.</p><p id=\"b518-6\">We have reviewed the defendant\u2019s other contentions, including those raised in his <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, and find them to be without merit. Weinstein, J. P., Spatt, Sullivan and Harwood, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
