The judge imposed three-year concurrent sentences on all counts, to be served consecutively to a term of one year for the three firearms specifications, which the judge merged at sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">{\u00b6 3} Whitfield appealed, arguing that the trial court had erred in denying his motions to suppress and for acquittal and that it had \u201ccommitted plain error by convicting and sentencing him on both drug possession and drug trafficking which are allied offense of similar import.\u201d After rejecting his claims on suppression and acquittal, the court of appeals applied our decision in <em>State v. Cabrales, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-1625, 886 N.E.2d 181, paragraph two of the syllabus, and agreed that the trial court had committed plain error by convicting Whitfield of both drug possession and drug trafficking, which are allied offenses of similar import. <em>State v. Whitfield, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90244, 2008-Ohio-3150, 2008 WL 2533062, \u00b6 36-37. There was no error in that portion of the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 4} In reversing, however, the court of appeals stated, \u201cWe therefore sustain [Whitfield\u2019s] third assignment of error, reverse the conviction for drug possession <em>and remand the case to the trial court to vacate the drug possession conviction. </em>See R.C. 2953.08(G)(2); <em>State v. Saxon, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245 [846 N.E.2d 824]; <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 1, 2004-Ohio-6087 [817 N.E.2d 845].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">{\u00b6 5} We accepted discretionary review of the state\u2019s appeal, 120 Ohio St.3d 1486, 2009-Ohio-278, 900 N.E.2d 197. The state asserts that \u201cupon finding one or more counts to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, R.C. 2941.25(A) requires that the convictions are merged for the purposes of sentencing and [that] the defendant [can] be sentenced only on one.\u201d We agree and take this opportunity to provide guidance on the proper manner in which the courts of appeal should remand cases after finding errors committed in sentencing on allied offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 2941.25(A) provides, \u201cWhere the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>{\u00b6 7} At the outset of our analysis, we recognize that the statute incorporates the constitutional protections against double jeopardy. These protections generally forbid successive prosecutions and multiple punishments for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">{\u00b6 8} In the case of multiple punishments, a defendant is protected only from multiple punishments that were not intended by the legislature. Legislatures are empowered to either permit or prohibit multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>State v. Childs </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 558, 561, 728 N.E.2d 379. By its enactment of R.C. 2941.25(A), the General Assembly has clearly expressed its intention to prohibit multiple punishments for allied offenses of similar import. <em>State v. Rance </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 632, 710 N.E.2d 699, paragraph three of the syllabus. See also <em>Maumee v. Geiger </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 238, 242-243, 74 O.O.2d 380, 344 N.E.2d 133 (the statute is designed to prevent \u201cshotgun convictions\u201d and \u201cdouble punishment\u201d for the same offense); <em>State v. Stewart, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1073, 2006-Ohio-3310, 2006 WL 1781412, \u00b6 6, citing <em>Rance, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 635, 710 N.E.2d 699 (\u201cOhio\u2019s General Assembly has indicated its intent to permit or prohibit cumulative punishments for the commission of certain offenses through the multiple-count statute set forth in R.C. 2941.25\u201d). This case involves the latter protection \u2014 the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 9} By contrast, the General Assembly exercised its power to permit multiple punishments by enacting R.C. 2941.25(B). <em>State v. Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, \u00b6 17; <em>Rance, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 635, 710 N.E.2d 699, citing <em>Albernaz v. United States </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 333, 344, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 67 L.Ed.2d 275. Here, however, we are not presented with such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 10} Rather, the parties agree that R.C. 2941.25(A) forbids multiple punishments for drug possession and drug trafficking, which are allied offenses of similar import. <em>Cabrales, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-1625, 886 N.E.2d 181, paragraph two of the syllabus. The court of appeals properly recognized that on the facts of this case, the trial court committed reversible error and that Whitfield\u2019s convictions for the allied possession and trafficking offenses must be merged on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 11} This appeal poses two questions: (1) What exactly does R.C. 2941.25(A) prohibit when it states that a defendant may be \u201cconvicted\u201d of only one of two allied offenses? and (2) When a sentencing court violates this prohibition, what is the proper procedure on remand?</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">{\u00b6 12} We have little trouble with the first question. Our past decisions make clear that for purposes of R.C. 2941.25, a \u201cconviction\u201d consists of a guilty verdict <em>and </em>the imposition of a sentence or penalty. <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 135; <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>390, 399, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (\u201ca conviction consists of a verdict and sentence\u201d). See also <em>State v. Fenwick </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 1252, 1253, 745 N.E.2d 1046 (Cook, J., concurring), citing <em>McGuire </em>(\u201c[f]or purposes of R.C. 2941.25, this court has already determined that a \u2018conviction\u2019 consists of both <em>\u2018verdict and sentence\u2019 \u201d </em>[emphasis sic]); <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 5, 520 N.E.2d 568 (\u201cas there is only one order of execution, there can be only one conviction. See R.C. 2941.25(A) and <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 171, 12 O.O.3d 177, 389 N.E.2d 494, wherein \u2018conviction\u2019 includes <em>both </em>the guilt determination and the penalty imposition\u201d [emphasis sic]).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">{\u00b6 13} We recognize that certain decisions from this court might be read to suggest that a conviction does not necessarily require a sentence. For example, in <em>State v. Cash </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 116, 118, 532 N.E.2d 111, we held that a prior plea of guilty, without a sentence, was a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of Evid.R. 609(A) and could be used for impeachment of a witness. See also <em>State ex rel. Watkins v. Fiorenzo </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 259, 260, 643 N.E.2d 521 (holding for purposes of R.C. 2921.42(C)(1) that a guilty finding alone is sufficient to constitute a conviction). But those decisions are expressly limited to the discrete issues presented in them. See <em>Cash </em>at 118, 532 N.E.2d 111 (acknowledging precedent requiring both a finding of guilt and a sentence and limiting its own holding to impeachment under Evid.R. 609(A)); <em>Watkins </em>at 260, 643 N.E.2d 521 (recognizing that \u201cthe term \u2018conviction\u2019 normally includes both the finding of guilt and the sentence\u201d and justifying its departure from that rule by the language of R.C. 2921.41(C)(1)). Thus, these cases do not conflict with our holding today that for purposes of R.C. 2941.25(A), a conviction is a determination of guilt and the ensuing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 14} We now turn to the second question: When a sentencing court violates R.C. 2941.25(A) by convicting a defendant of two allied offenses and then sentencing the defendant on both, what is the proper procedure on remand?</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 15} The state contends that when a court correctly applies R.C. 2941.25(A) and merges convictions for allied offenses, only the sentences should be merged, i.e., both underlying determinations of guilt should be left intact. The state urges this court to revisit <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 1, 2004-Ohio-6087, 817 N.E.2d 845, in which this court, upon finding that the defendant had been improperly convicted and sentenced for two allied offenses of similar import, merged the convictions and <em>dismissed </em>one of the two counts. Id. at \u00b6 103. The state asks us to clarify the law, contending that confusion has resulted from <em>Yarbrough </em>and our seemingly conflicting subsequent decisions in <em>State v. Winn, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 413, 2009-Ohio-1059, 905 N.E.2d 154, and <em>Cabrales, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-1625, 886 N.E.2d 181. In the latter two cases, we affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>appellate court decisions vacating <em>only the sentence </em>for one of the allied offenses and leaving both convictions intact, without reference to <em>Yarbrough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">{\u00b6 16} Although <em>Yarbrough, Cabrales, </em>and <em>Winn </em>addressed important aspects of allied-offense jurisprudence, none of them address the narrow argument advanced by the state. Rather, in answering the question, we start with our understanding that R.C. 2941.25(A) codifies the judicial doctrine of merger. <em>State v. Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, \u00b6 42; <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 131, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345. That doctrine operates to merge allied offenses of similar import into a single conviction. <em>Brown </em>at \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 17} A defendant may be indicted and tried for allied offenses of similar import, but may be sentenced on only one of the allied offenses. Id., citing <em>Geiger, </em>45 Ohio St.2d at 244, 74 O.O.2d 380, 344 N.E.2d 133. In fact, our precedent, including cumulative-punishment cases that predate the 1972 enactment of R.C. 2941.25(A), makes clear that a defendant may be found guilty of allied offenses but not sentenced on them. See, e.g., <em>State v. Botta </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 196, 203, 56 O.O.2d 119, 271 N.E.2d 776 (\u201cWhere * * * in substance and effect but one offense has been committed, a verdict of guilty by the jury under more than one count does not require a retrial but only requires that <em>the court not impose more than one sentence\u201d </em>[emphasis added]); <em>Weaver v. State </em>(1906), 74 Ohio St. 53, 77 N.E. 273, paragraph one of the syllabus (when there are multiple counts of violating liquor statutes, but only one offense, \u201cit is error for the court, on a verdict of guilty under each count, <em>to inflict the penalties </em>prescribed by each of the said sections\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Woodford v. State </em>(1853), 1 Ohio St. 427, paragraph three of the syllabus (\u201cWhere an offence forms but one transaction, and the indictment containing several counts on which the jury have returned a verdict of guilty, <em>it is error in the court to sentence on each count separately\u201d </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 18} In cases in which the imposition of multiple punishments is at issue, R.C. 2941.25(A)\u2019s mandate that a defendant may be \u201cconvicted\u201d of only one allied offense is a protection against multiple sentences rather than multiple convictions. See, e.g., <em>Ohio v. Johnson </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 493, 498, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 81 L.Ed.2d 425, in which the United States Supreme Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against successive prosecutions and against <em>multiple punishments </em>for the same offense. Thus, to ensure that there are not improper cumulative punishments for allied offenses, courts must be cognizant that R.C. 2941.25(A) requires that \u201cthe trial court effects the merger at sentencing.\u201d <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 135. See also <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 572, 687 N.E.2d 685; <em>Stewart, </em>2006-Ohio-3310, 2006 WL 1781412, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>{\u00b6 19} In this case, the court of appeals properly corrected the trial court\u2019s error in sentencing Whitfield for the allied offenses of drug possession and drug trafficking. But the court of appeals erred in ordering that this case be \u201cremanded to the trial court with instructions <em>to vacate the conviction and sentence for drug possession only.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 20} The General Assembly has made clear that it is the state that chooses which of the allied offenses to pursue at sentencing, and it may choose any of the allied offenses. <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, \u00b6 16 and 43, citing <em>Geiger, </em>45 Ohio St.2d at 244, 74 O.O.2d 380, 344 N.E.2d 133; Legislative Service Commission Summary of Am.Sub.H.B. 511, The New Ohio Criminal Code (June 1973) 69. In conferring that right on the state, the legislature did not specify when the state must make that election. The Legislative Service summary states that \u201cthe prosecution <em>sooner or later </em>must elect as to which offense it wishes to pursue\u201d (emphasis added), id., thereby implying that the state has latitude in determining when to decide which offense to pursue at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 21} In light of the legislative history, we concluded previously that the statute does not require the state to make its election prior to trial. <em>State v. Weind </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 224, 236, 4 O.O.3d 413, 364 N.E.2d 224, vacated on other grounds (1978), 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3137, 57 L.Ed.2d 1156. See also <em>State v. Roberts </em>(June 23, 1988), Auglaize App. No. 2-87-18, 1988 WL 68700 (the state does not lose its right to elect by failing to exercise it before a verdict of guilty has been returned). We see nothing in the language of R.C. 2941.25(A) that would deny the state the same right on remand. The state therefore retains the right to elect which allied offense to pursue on sentencing on a remand to the trial court after an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 22} The court of appeals impermissibly intruded on the state\u2019s right to elect by directing the trial court to vacate the drug-possession conviction. We reverse that portion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision in this case and remand the cause to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing, at which the state must elect the offense for which Whitfield should be punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 23} When confronted with allied offenses, courts must be guided by two principles: that R.C. 2941.25(A) prohibits \u201cconvictions\u201d for allied offenses and that the state controls which of the two allied offenses the defendant will be sentenced on.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 24} When the state elects which of the two allied offenses to seek sentencing for, the court must accept the state\u2019s choice and merge the crimes into a single conviction for sentencing, <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, \u00b6 41, and impose a sentence that is appropriate for the merged offense. Thereafter, a \u201cconviction\u201d consists of a guilty verdict <em>and </em>the imposition of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>sentence or penalty. See, e.g., <em>Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 135; <em>McGuire, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 399, 686 N.E.2d 1112; <em>Fenwick, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 1253, 745 N.E.2d 1046 (Cook, J., concurring). The defendant is not \u201cconvicted\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2941.25(A) until the sentence is imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">{\u00b6 25} If, upon appeal, a court of appeals finds reversible error in the imposition of multiple punishments for allied offenses, the court must reverse the judgment of conviction and remand for a new sentencing hearing at which the state must elect which allied offense it will pursue against the defendant. On remand, trial courts must address any double jeopardy protections that benefit the defendant. However, as this court observed in <em>State v. Calhoun </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 373, 376-377, 18 OBR 429, 481 N.E.2d 624, \u201cAt least in the absence of an acquittal or a termination based on a ruling that the prosecution\u2019s case was legally insufficient, no interest protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a retrial when reversal is predicated on trial error alone. * * * The purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to preserve for the defendant acquittals or favorable factual determinations but not to shield from appellate review erroneous legal conclusions not predicated on any factual determinations.\u201d Thus, the state is not precluded from pursuing any of the allied offenses upon a remand for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 26} On remand, the trial court should fulfill its duty in merging the offenses for purposes of sentencing, but remain cognizant that R.C. 2941.25(A)\u2019s mandate that a \u201cdefendant may be convicted of only one\u201d allied offense is a proscription against sentencing a defendant for more than one allied offense. Nothing in the plain language of the statute or in its legislative history suggests that the General Assembly intended to interfere with a determination by a jury or judge that a defendant is guilty of allied offenses. As the state asserts, by enacting R.C. 2941.25(A), the General Assembly condemned multiple sentences for allied offenses, not the determinations that the defendant was guilty of allied offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 27} Because R.C. 2941.25(A) protects a defendant only from being punished for allied offenses, the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt for committing allied offenses remains intact, both before and after the merger of allied offenses for sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court should not vacate or dismiss the guilt determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">{\u00b6 28} For the reasons set forth herein, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-6\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ArD\">Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-10\">.

In so asserting, the dissent relies on our decision in <em>State v. Saxon, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824, and on two decisions from the Eighth District Court of Appeals, <em>Gates Mills v. Yomtovian, </em>8th Dist. No. 88942, 2007-Ohio-6303, 2007 WL 4200629, and <em>State v. Waters, </em>8th Dist.

Collins </em>(Oct. 18, 2003), Cuyahoga App. No. 79064, 2001 WL 1243943, are also inapposite because they are not allied-offense cases. Rather, in those cases, each judge failed to impose a sentence in cases in which there were multiple counts or specifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b506-7\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0ss\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 29} I respectfully dissent because the majority\u2019s analysis impairs the finality of the judgment and may ultimately lead to a violation of a defendant\u2019s right to be free from double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">{\u00b6 30} The majority states that \u201c[t]his appeal poses two questions: (1) What exactly does R.C. 2941.25(A) prohibit when it states that a defendant may be \u2018convicted\u2019 of only one of two allied offenses? and (2) When a sentencing court violates this prohibition, what is the proper procedure on remand?\u201d The majority concludes that \u201cconviction\u201d includes both the guilt determination and the imposition of a sentence or penalty, citing precedent from mostly death-penalty cases that offer little analysis. Two cases that were decided shortly after the effective date of R.C. 2941.25 offer better insight. In <em>Maumee v. Geiger </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 238, 74 O.O.2d 380, 344 N.E.2d 133, the issue was whether a person who admitted to the theft of property could be convicted of receiving stolen property. There we stated that \u201cthe intent of the General Assembly controls in this case, and that intent is plainly expressed in R.C. 2941.25, supra, and the accompanying committee comment. Although receiving is technically not an included offense of theft, it is, under R.C. 2941.25, an \u2018allied offense of similar import.\u2019 An accused may be tried for both but <em>may be convicted and sentenced for only one. </em>The choice is given to the prosecution to pursue one offense or the other, and it is plainly the intent of the General Assembly that the election may be of either offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 244, 74 O.O.2d 380, 344 N.E.2d 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>{\u00b6 31} In <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 171, 12 O.O.3d 177, 389 N.E.2d 494, we were asked to determine the intent of the General Assembly in enacting the phrase \u201cpreviously been convicted of a theft offense\u201d as used in former R.C. 2913.02(B), which elevated a misdemeanor theft offense to grand theft, a fourth-degree felony. Henderson had been separately indicted on one count of receiving stolen property and one count of grand theft. Although he had pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property, and the court had accepted that plea, he had not yet been sentenced when he was indicted for grand theft. The trial court determined that a plea of guilty was sufficient to satisfy the prior-conviction element. The court of appeals reversed, holding that a judgment entry of conviction was necessary to constitute a \u201cconviction.\u201d In affirming the appellate court, we noted two important considerations: (1) a prior conviction was an integral element of the offense of grand theft, and (2) R.C. 2901.04(A) requires that we construe the meaning of \u201cconvicted\u201d strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the defendant. Id. at 174, 12 O.O.3d 177, 389 N.E.2d 494. This court determined that the statute required \u201ca more final adjudication of the defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d i.e., the pronouncement of a sentence. Id. at 178, 12 O.O.3d 177, 389 N.E.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">{\u00b6 32} In Whitfield\u2019s case, however, defining the term \u201cconvicted\u201d to mean both a finding of guilt and a sentence works to the defendant\u2019s <em>detriment, </em>thereby raising constitutional issues relating to a defendant\u2019s rights. By leaving the separate finding of guilt pending, the majority prevents the defendant from having a final judgment on all charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">{\u00b6 33} Furthermore, the use of the term \u201cconvicted\u201d throughout the Revised Code, while not defined, clearly implies only the finding of guilt. See, e.g., R.C. 2929.01(EE) (\u201c <em>\u2018Sentence\u2019 </em>means the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed by the sentencing court on an offender who is <em>convicted </em>of or pleads guilty to an offense\u201d) (emphasis added); R.C. 2929.19(A) (\u201cThe court shall hold a sentencing hearing before imposing <em>a sentence </em>under this chapter upon an offender who was <em>convicted </em>of or pleaded guilty to a felony * * *\u201d) (emphasis added); R.C. 2929.16(E) (\u201cIf a person who has been <em>convicted </em>of or pleaded guilty to a felony is <em>sentenced </em>to community residential sanction\u201d) (emphasis added); R.C. 2930.19(C) (\u201cThe failure of any person or entity to provide a right, privilege, or notice to a victim under this chapter does not constitute grounds for declaring a mistrial or new trial, for setting aside a <em>conviction, sentence, </em>adjudication, or disposition, or for granting postconviction release to a defendant or alleged juvenile offender\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Henderson, </em>58 Ohio St.2d at 178, 12 O.O.3d 177, 389 N.E.2d 494, a case involving the enhanced-penalty provisions of former R.C. 2913.02(B), we acknowledged that the General Assembly used the term \u201cconviction\u201d to mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>simply the finding of guilt in several statutes, but concluded that \u201cthe distinction between conviction and sentencing in these few provisions exists solely for the purpose of depicting various procedures to be followed during the interval after a defendant\u2019s guilt is legally adjudicated and before an appropriate penalty or treatment is determined. It is unreasonable to assume that the General Assembly intended an intermediate stage in a criminal proceeding, evidenced by the entry of a plea of guilty, to invoke the enhanced penalty provisions of R.C. 2913.02(B).\u201d But for purposes of R.C. 2941.25, it makes sense that the General Assembly intended to confine the term \u201cconvicted\u201d to the finding of guilt, because allied offenses are to be merged <em>before </em>sentencing. See <em>State v. Harris, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 373, 2009-Ohio-3323, 911 N.E.2d 882, \u00b6 23 <em>(\u201cGeiger </em>requires the prosecution to elect which offense it will pursue after a finding of guilt but prior to sentencing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">{\u00b6 35} Even if I were to accept that \u201cconviction\u201d includes sentencing as well as a finding of guilt in this case, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s remedy. In <em>State v. Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, \u00b6 42, this court acknowledged that R.C. 2941.25 is a legislative attempt to codify the judicial doctrine of merger, i.e., the principle that \u201c \u2018a major crime often includes as inherent therein the component elements of other crimes and that these component elements, in legal effect, are merged in the major crime.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Botta </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 196, 201, 56 O.O.2d 119, 271 N.E.2d 776. See also <em>State v. Rice </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 422, 424, 23 O.O.3d 374, 433 N.E.2d 175; <em>State v. Roberts </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 170, 172, 16 O.O.3d 201, 405 N.E.2d 247; <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 131, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345. Although the majority acknowledges the merger doctrine, it inexplicably holds that the separate determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt on each allied offense remains intact, both before and after merged sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 36} This holding contradicts the concept of merger. The allied offenses combine into one pursuant to R.C. 2941.25(A). In essence, the offense that the state elects to pursue absorbs the other offense, and nothing remains of the absorbed offense, including the finding of guilt. See <em>Gates Mills v. Yomtovian, </em>8th Dist. No. 88942, 2007-Ohio-6303, \u00b6 23, 2007 WL 4200629 (\u201c \u2018merge\u2019 in criminal law is defined as, \u2018[t]he absorption of a lesser included offense into a more serious offense when a person is charged with both crimes, so that the person is not subject to double jeopardy.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8 Ed. Rev.2004) 1009\u201d). To say that a determination of guilt on the merged offense survives means it remains pending in limbo and prevents a final judgment from being entered. See <em>State v. Saxon, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824, \u00b6 8 (a trial court must separately assign a particular sentence to each offense); <em>State v. Waters, </em>8th Dist. No. 85691, 2005-Ohio-5137, 2005 WL 2386477 (an order that fails to impose sentence for an offense for which the offender was found guilty not only violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>this rule but renders the resultant order nonfinal and not immediately appeal-able).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AkWr\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Kristen L. Sobieski, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b509-7\">Timothy Young, Ohio Public Defender, and Spencer Cahoon, Assistant Public Defender, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">{\u00b6 37} Once the state elects which allied offense it will pursue, that decision should be final, and the trial court should dismiss the other allied count. If the court of appeals reverses the judgment of conviction, the state should not be given a second chance to convict on the charge merged. By holding that the determination of guilt remains undisturbed after the merger of the allied offenses, the majority focuses on the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense, but ignores the equally important double jeopardy protection against successive prosecutions for the same conduct. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-5\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
