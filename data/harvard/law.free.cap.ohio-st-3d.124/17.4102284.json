We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing the mandamus claim based on mootness. Nevertheless, because the court of appeals erred in dismissing the request for attorney fees on the same basis of mootness, we reverse that portion of the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause for further proceedings on the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">Records Request and Refusal</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">{\u00b6 2} On February 5, 2009, a reporter for relator, the Cincinnati Enquirer, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc., hand-delivered to the Cincinnati Public Schools a written request for documents submitted by candidates for the school district\u2019s superintendent position. The school district refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the Enquirer\u2019s request because it had not yet checked the post office box to which the documents were directed and it would not do so until March 16. The district promised to make all public records in the post office box available for inspection after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Mandamus Claim: Dismissal Based on Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 3} The court of appeals dismissed the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus complaint based on the pleadings. \u201cSua sponte dismissal without notice is warranted when a complaint is frivolous or the claimant obviously cannot prevail on the facts alleged in the complaint.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Scott v. Cleveland, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 324, 2006-Ohio-6573, 859 N.E.2d 923, \u00b6 14; <em>State ex rel. Duran v. Kelsey, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 58, 2005-Ohio-3674, 831 N.E.2d 430, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">{\u00b6 4} The court of appeals properly held that the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus complaint was moot because the school district had produced the requested records after the Enquirer had commenced the underlying suit. See <em>State ex rel. Toledo Blade Co. v. Seneca Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 372, 2008-Ohio-6253, 899 N.E.2d 961, \u00b6 43, in which we held that the newspaper\u2019s claim for records was rendered moot once the board of county commissioners had produced the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">{\u00b6 5} Nor is the Enquirer\u2019s public-records mandamus claim excepted from being moot on the ground that it is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Geer, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 511, 2007-Ohio-4643, 873 N.E.2d 314, \u00b6 10. \u201cThis exception applies only in exceptional circumstances in which the following two factors are both present: (1) the challenged action is too short in duration to be fully litigated before its cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the <em>same complaining party </em>will be subject to the same action again.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Calvary v. Upper Arlington </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 229, 231, 729 N.E.2d 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">{\u00b6 6} The Enquirer did not sufficiently allege any reasonable expectation that it would again be subjected to the same action. In fact, in its appellate argument, the Enquirer appears to acknowledge that it has no current information of prior instances in which the Cincinnati Public Schools had engaged in a continuing pattern and practice to delay production of public records and that it had merely sought to conduct discovery on its general allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">{\u00b6 7} We are cognizant that \u201cOhio generally follows notice, rather than fact, pleading\u201d except in certain special circumstances in which we have modified the standard by requiring the pleading of specific facts. See <em>State ex rel. Williams Ford Sales, Inc. v. Connor </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 111, 113, 647 N.E.2d 804; cf. S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B) (requiring complaints for most original actions filed in this court to contain a \u201cspecific statement of facts upon which the claim for relief is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>based\u201d)- We are also aware that, in general, a plaintiff \u201cis not required to prove his or her case at the pleading stage\u201d because many plaintiffs lack access to relevant evidence, which can be obtained only through discovery from materials in the defendant\u2019s possession. See <em>York v. Ohio State Highway Patrol </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 143, 144-145, 573 N.E.2d 1063; <em>State ex rel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 549, 605 N.E.2d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">{\u00b6 8} These eases are inapposite here, however, because the Enquirer would have had access to relevant evidence showing whether the Cincinnati Public Schools had refused to provide the newspaper with requested records so as to establish a reasonable expectation that \u201cthe same complaining party,\u201d i.e., the Enquirer, would be subject to the same action again.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 9} Therefore, the court of appeals properly dismissed the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus claim based on mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 10} Nevertheless, as we recently held in a different public-records mandamus case instituted by relator, \u201ceven if the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus claim were properly dismissed as moot, a claim for attorney fees in a public-records mandamus action is not rendered moot by the provision of the requested records after the case has been filed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Heath, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 165, 2009-Ohio-590, 902 N.E.2d 976, \u00b6 18. Therefore, although the court of appeals correctly dismissed the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus claim as moot, it erred in dismissing the Enquirer\u2019s request for attorney fees on the basis of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">{\u00b6 11} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus claim based on mootness. However, because the court of appeals erred in dismissing the Enquirer\u2019s request for attorney fees based on mootness, we reverse that portion of the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause for further proceedings solely on that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b199-11\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b199-12\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b199-13\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">{\u00b6 12} I agree with the decision dismissing the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus claim. However, because I believe that the Enquirer\u2019s complaint lacked merit, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>also dismiss the claim for attorney fees. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s remand for further proceedings on the request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 13} The Cincinnati Public Schools directed candidates for the position of superintendent to submit applications to a post office box by March 15, 2009. As in a competitive bidding process, the school district intended to wait until the day after the deadline to review all submissions at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 14} On February 5, 2009, the Cincinnati Enquirer submitted a public records request to the Cincinnati Public Schools for copies of all documents submitted by candidates for the superintendent position. The school district notified the newspaper that it had not opened the post office box and that the contents, if any, had not yet used by the district. The school district agreed to make the documents available for inspection and copying once it had retrieved the contents of the post office box following the March 15, 2009 deadline. Despite this information, the Enquirer proceeded to file a complaint in mandamus for an order requiring the Cincinnati Public Schools to make the records available for inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">{\u00b6 15} The school district opened the post office box and retrieved the contents on March 16, 2009, and promptly produced copies of the requested documents to the Enquirer the following day. The newspaper has not challenged the sufficiency of the records produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">{\u00b6 16} I believe that the requested documents did not constitute public records subject to R.C. 149.43 when the Enquirer made its initial request. On February 5, 2009, the contents of the post office box were not records that the school district had used \u201cto document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.\u201d R.C. 149.011(G). The district was not obligated to produce copies of the documents until it had used them to carry out the school district\u2019s duties and responsibilities, at which point they became public records subject to inspection. <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Whitmore </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 61, 63, 697 N.E.2d 640. Thus, there was no violation of R.C. 149.43, and the Enquirer\u2019s complaint is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">{\u00b6 17} The majority remands for the court to consider the Enquirer\u2019s request for attorney fees on the ground that the dismissal of a complaint as moot does not defeat a claim for attorney fees. However, while I agree that the complaint is moot, I also believe that the Enquirer filed a meritless claim; therefore, there is no reason to remand for consideration of attorney fees. \u201cRelators are not entitled to attorney fees concerning those claims that were meritless.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Mentor </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 440, 448, 732 N.E.2d 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">{\u00b6 18} Furthermore, although mootness may not preclude an award of attorney fees, such an award under R.C. 149.43 is not mandatory. See <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>Calvary v. Upper Arlington </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 229, 234, 729 N.E.2d 1182 (Lundberg Stratton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). \u201cA court may award attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 149.43 where (1) a person makes a proper request for public records pursuant to R.C. 149.43, (2) the custodian of the public records fails to comply with the person\u2019s request, (3) the requesting person files a mandamus action pursuant to R.C. 149.43 to obtain copies of the records, and (4) the person receives the requested public records only after the mandamus action is filed, thereby rendering the claim for a writ of mandamus moot.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pennington v. Gundler </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 171, 661 N.E.2d 1049, syllabus.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5\">Graydon, Head &amp; Ritchey, L.L.P., and John C. Greiner, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b201-8\">Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister, L.L.P., Mark J. Stepaniak, and Ryan M. Martin, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">{\u00b6 19} Even if the claims in the Enquirer\u2019s complaint were only moot, I believe that the claim for attorney fees fails because the Enquirer does not meet the necessary requirements for an award of fees. The Enquirer did not make a proper request, and the school district did not fail to comply. The district promptly responded to the Enquirer\u2019s initial letter and then produced the records in a timely fashion once the district had used the documents and they became records subject to R.C. 149.43. Instead, the Enquirer chose to prematurely file a mandamus claim, knowing that the school district intended to obtain the documents from the post office box on a date certain and had agreed to promptly produce the documents once the post office box was opened. The Enquirer was not entitled to those documents before the school had used them.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">{\u00b6 20} In conclusion, I believe that dismissal was appropriate because these were not public records subject to disclosure at the time of the Enquirer\u2019s request; therefore, the Enquirer\u2019s claim for attorney fees also fails. I concur with the decision affirming part of the judgment of the court of appeals. However, for the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent from the decision to remand the cause for further proceedings on the request for attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b201-6\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
