Because the judge\u2019s action was inconsistent with the court of appeals\u2019 authority to review the January 9 judgment and QDRO, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\n<em>Divorce Decree</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 2} In November 1986, appellee, Daniel J. Sullivan, married Janet M. Sullivan. The parties had one child born during their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 3} In July 1997, the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, entered a final judgment granting the Sullivans a divorce and incorporating their agreement concerning all of the matters in the case, including the division of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 4} More specifically, the court ordered that Daniel \u201cassign and transfer to the Plaintiff, Janet M. Sullivan, through a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, or separate Judgment Entry, whichever is applicable, twenty-five percent (25%) of the accrued monthly benefit that the Defendant, Daniel J. Sullivan, was entitled to receive <em>as of May lk, 1997, </em>from Defendant, Daniel J. Sullivan\u2019s interest in his retirement plan with the Civil Service Retirement System, pursuant to the provision of the Spouse Equity Act of 1984.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) The court further ordered that Janet\u2019s \u201crights to designate a beneficiary, for survivor benefits, or other related rights under the above described plan, * * * be subject to the terms and conditions of the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\n<em>January 2009 Judgment Entry and QDRO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">{\u00b6 5} After the parties divorced, no QDRO or separate judgment was timely entered to implement the court\u2019s division of Daniel\u2019s retirement plan. Daniel, without notice, removed his retirement plan from the Civil Service Retirement System and transferred it to the District of Columbia Police Officers\u2019 and Firefighters\u2019 Retirement Plan. He retired in 2003 and began receiving all of the pension benefits without allocating anything to Janet pursuant to the divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">{\u00b6 6} In July 2006, Janet filed motions for the approval of a QDRO, retroactive benefits, and attorney fees. On January 9, 2009, appellant, Judge Donald L. Ramsey, sitting by assignment in the domestic relations court, granted the motions and held that Janet was entitled to a monthly sum of $1,325.07 from Daniel\u2019s retirement plan, that Janet be awarded $76,185.92 as well as statutory interest for retroactive benefits due her but paid to Daniel, and that she be awarded $24,684 in legal fees and litigation expenses, together with statutory interest. Judge Ramsey held that Daniel\u2019s deliberate actions had denied Janet \u201cthose benefits of the pension rights awax-ded to her pux-suant to the parties\u2019 divorce decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">{\u00b6 7} On that same date, Judge Ramsey issued a QDRO reflecting the parties\u2019 rights to Daniel\u2019s pension benefits. The QDRO px-ovided that \u201c[t]he benefit to be paid from the Plan directly to the alternate payee pursuant to the participant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>assignment of benefits, in compliance with the D.C. Spouse Equity Act of 1988, as amended, shall be * * * ($1,325.07) of the participant\u2019s gross monthly benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 8} The QDRO also provided for later amendment to constitute a proper QDRO according to the plan administrator\u2019s instructions:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe intent of this Order is to provide the alternate payee with a retirement payment that fairly represents the alternate payee\u2019s marital share of the retirement benefits set forth herein. In the event any Order submitted to the Plan Administrator is held not to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order within the meaning of the D.C. Spouse Equity Act of 1988, as amended, the parties shall submit to and request this Court or any other Court of competent jurisdiction to amend or modify the Order, but only for the purpose of establishing or maintaining its qualifications as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order in such a manner that will reflect the parties\u2019 and the Court\u2019s intent as expressed herein, said amendment or modification Order is to be entered Nunc Pro Tunc if appropriate and Jurisdiction is hereby reserved for this purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">\n<em>Appeal and Amended QDRO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">{\u00b6 10} On January 20, 2009, Daniel appealed from the January 9 judgment entry and QDRO to the Court of Appeals for Lucas County.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">{\u00b6 11} On April 7, while the appeal from the January 9 judgment and QDRO was pending, Judge Ramsey issued an amended QDRO, which \u2014 similar to the original QDRO \u2014 provided that \u201c[t]he Alternate Payee shall receive * * * ($1,325.07) of the Participant\u2019s gross monthly benefit, as much [sic, such] amount is adjusted by any cost-of-living adjustments. The Participant shall retain all remaining interest in the Plan.\u201d Judge Ramsey did not issue the amended QDRO as a nunc pro tunc order, as he was authorized to do under the terms of the original QDRO. The amended QDRO also differed in certain respects from the original QDRO. For example, the original QDRO specified that it was \u201cissued pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Sections 3105.171 and 3105.18 which relate to the provision of marital property rights and spousal support payments,\u201d and the amended QDRO generally stated only that the order was issued \u201cpursuant to the domestic relations laws of the State of Ohio.\u201d In addition, the amended QDRO specified that the order was intended to be a QDRO \u201cas that term is used in Section 206(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [\u2018ERISA\u2019],\u201d whereas ERISA was unmentioned in the original QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">\n<em>Prohibition Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">{\u00b6 12} Three weeks after Judge Ramsey issued the amended QDRO, on April 28, Daniel filed a complaint in the court of appeals for a writ of prohibition to vacate the amended QDRO and to prevent the judge from taking any further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>action that interferes with or is inconsistent with the appellate court\u2019s ability to affirm, modify, or reverse the January 9, 2009 judgment entry and QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">{\u00b6 13} On May 7, without waiting for a response from the judge, the court of appeals entered a judgment granting the writ of prohibition ordering Judge Ramsey to refrain from taking any action inconsistent with that court\u2019s ability to affirm, modify, or reverse the January 9, 2009 judgment entry that is the subject of the appeal and vacating the amended QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 14} This cause is now before the court upon the judge\u2019s appeal as of right.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\n<em>Prohibition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 15} To be entitled to the requested writ of prohibition, Daniel was required to establish that (1) Judge Ramsey was about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ will result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Sliwinski v. Burnham Unruh, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 76, 2008-Ohio-1734, 886 N.E.2d 201, \u00b6 7. Judge Ramsey exercised judicial authority by issuing the amended QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 16} For the remaining requirements, \u201c[i]f a lower court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in a cause, prohibition * * * will issue to prevent any future unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction and to correct the results of prior jurisdictionally unauthorized actions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">\n<em>Pending Appeal from Initial QDRO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">{\u00b6 17} The court of appeals based its issuance of the writ on the fact that Daniel\u2019s appeal from the January 9 judgment entry and QDRO was pending when Judge Ramsey issued the amended QDRO. \u201c[W]e have consistently held that once an appeal is perfected, the trial court is divested of jurisdiction over matters that are inconsistent with the reviewing court\u2019s jurisdiction to reverse, modify, or affirm the judgment.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rock v. School Emp. Retirement Bd., </em>96 Ohio St.3d 206, 2002-Ohio-3957, 772 N.E.2d 1197, \u00b6 8; <em>State ex rel. Everhart v. McIntosh, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 195, 2007-Ohio-4798, 874 N.E.2d 516, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">{\u00b6 18} As Judge Ramsey observes, a QDRO is different from the usual court order. A QDRO is an order that \u201ccreates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee\u2019s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan.\u201d Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, Section 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Title 29, U.S.Code, and Section 414(p)(l)(A)(i), Title 26, U.S.Code. \u201cThe QDRO must be drafted to include very specific information with explicit instructions to the plan administrator. It is then the responsibility of the plan administrator to review the order of the trial court and determine whether it constitutes a QDRO pursuant to Section 414(p), Title 26, U.S.Code.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Hoyt v. Hoyt </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 177, 180, 559 N.E.2d 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe QDRO implements a trial court\u2019s decision of how a pension is to be divided incident to divorce or dissolution.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Wilson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 268, 2007-Ohio-6056, 878 N.E.2d 16, \u00b6 7. \u201c[A] divorce decree is a final, appealable order, regardless of whether it calls for a QDRO that has not yet issued; the QDRO merely implements the divorce decree.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15. Consequently, \u201c[a] QDRO is merely an order in aid of execution on the property division <em>ordered </em>in the divorce or dissolution decree. So long as the QDRO is consistent with the decree, it does not constitute a modification, which R.C. 3105.171(1) prohibits, and the court does not lack jurisdiction to issue it.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Bagley v. Bagley, </em>181 Ohio App.3d 141, 2009-Ohio-688, 908 N.E.2d 469, \u00b6 26. Therefore, when a divorce decree is appealed and there is no stay of the judgment pending appeal, the trial court is not divested of jurisdiction to issue a QDRO consistent with the decree, because the order merely executes orders previously specified in the divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 20} Nevertheless, for the following reasons, Daniel\u2019s appeal from the domestic relations court\u2019s actions on January 9, 2009, granting Janet\u2019s postdecree motions and issuing the original QDRO, patently and unambiguously divested Judge Ramsey of jurisdiction to issue the amended QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 21} First, Daniel did not appeal from the divorce decree. Instead, he appealed from Judge Ramsey\u2019s judgment on Janet\u2019s postdecree motions and the associated QDRO. Once the original QDRO was appealed, Judge Ramsey lacked jurisdiction to modify it. See <em>Albertson v. Ryder </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 765, 769-770, 621 N.E.2d 480 (trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify QDRO when appeal from order was pending).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 22} Second, there is no evidence or argument that the condition specified in the original QDRO for amendment or modification of the order \u2014 the parties\u2019 request for it \u2014 -had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 23} Third, by issuing an amended order rather than a nunc pro tunc order, Judge Ramsey effectively acknowledged that the original QDRO was being amended or modified rather than merely corrected to rectify a clerical error. See <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Steiner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 158, 164, 656 N.E.2d 1288 (\u201cnunc pro tunc entries \u2018are limited in proper use to reflecting what the court actually decided, not what the court might or should have decided\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ARxV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Thomas A. Matuszak, L.L.C., and Thomas A. Matuszak; and Law Offices of Stephen D. Long and Stephen D. Long, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b540-10\">Julia R. Bates, Lucas County Prosecuting Attorney, and John A. Borrell, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">{\u00b6 24} Based on the foregoing, Judge Ramsey patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to issue the amended QDRO while the original QDRO was being appealed. \u201cIn cases of a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, the requirement of a lack of an adequate remedy of law need not be proven because the availability of alternate remedies like appeal would be immaterial.\u201d <em>State ex rel. State v. Lewis, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 97, 2003-Ohio-2476, 789 N.E.2d 195, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 25} Because Judge Ramsey\u2019s issuance of an amended QDRO was inconsistent with the court of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction to review the January 9 judgment and QDRO, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals granting the writ of prohibition to prevent the judge from taking any further action inconsistent with that court\u2019s authority to review the judgment being appealed and to vacate the amended QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-13\">.
