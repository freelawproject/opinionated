Underwood, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923, that a sentence in a criminal case is authorized by law if it is within the statutory range of penalties established by the General Assembly. Id. at \u00b6 55 (O\u2019Donnell, J., dissenting). Further, a sentence that is authorized by law, jointly recommended by the parties, and imposed by the court is not subject to review even if it includes convictions for allied offenses of similar import. Id. at \u00b6 64 (O\u2019Donnell, J., dissenting). According to R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), \u201c[a] sentence imposed upon a defendant is not subject to review under this section if the sentence is authorized by law, has been recommended jointly by the defendant and the prosecution in the case, and is imposed by a sentencing judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">{\u00b6 4} In this case, the grand jury indicted Tiffany Sawyer on two counts of felonious assault, second-degree felonies, each of which carries a maximum term of eight years\u2019 incarceration. However, the prosecution and the defense reached an agreement: Sawyer agreed to plead guilty to two different counts of aggravated assault, fourth-degree felonies, and the parties agreed to jointly recommend an aggregate sentence of three years\u2019 incarceration. The trial court accepted the guilty pleas and imposed the jointly recommended sentence of two consecutive 18-month terms, and the court of appeals affirmed that judgment. <em>State v. Sawyer, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 65, 2009-Ohio-3097, 915 N.E.2d 715, \u00b6 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">{\u00b6 5} Notwithstanding Sawyer\u2019s agreement to a three-year sentence as punishment for her conduct, the majority relies on <em>Underwood </em>and reverses on the basis that the trial court\u2019s failure to merge the two counts of aggravated assault as allied offenses is subject to appellate review. Thus, not only does Sawyer receive the benefit of the plea-bargained agreement by avoiding convictions for felonious assault as well as the potential maximum eight-year term of incarceration on each count, but also she receives a sentence of one-half the term she agreed to for her conduct. This result denies the state the benefit of its bargain and the opportunity to convict Sawyer of the felonious-assault charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">{\u00b6 6} The remedy fashioned by the majority in <em>Underwood </em>of merging the sentences for the allied offenses is patently unfair to the state because it fails to address the plea bargain and deals only with the sentence recommended by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>parties and imposed by the court. Because the state is deprived of the sentence to which it agreed, equity would suggest that it have the opportunity to renegotiate the plea agreement with the defendant. Both the plea and the sentence therefore ought to be vacated in fairness to both parties.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Apo\">Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Rachel Lipman Curran, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b729-10\">Timothy Young, Ohio Public Defender, and Claire R. Cahoon, Assistant Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">{\u00b6 7} The legislature never intended the allied-offenses statute, R.C. 2941.25(A), to apply as an exception to R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), which bars the appeal of a sentence that is authorized by law, jointly recommended by the parties, and imposed by the trial court. Nor did it intend a criminal defendant to gain the benefit of a plea-bargained reduction in charges and at the same time avoid the agreed-upon penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">{\u00b6 8} Because the majority has misinterpreted the manifest purpose of the legislature in enacting R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), I urge the General Assembly to clarify its intent, to avoid the forthcoming appeals that will inevitably be generated by the court\u2019s decisions in this case and in <em>Underwood.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b729-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
