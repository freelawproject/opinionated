It based that award solely on the report of a physical therapist. Relator, Cambridge Home Health Care, Inc., has brought this original action, asserting that a loss-of-use award must be based, at least in part, on a licensed physician\u2019s report and that it may never be based solely on a report by a physical therapist. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">{\u00b6 2} Horvat\u2019s 2004 workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed for a right wrist sprain with arthritis. She later moved for scheduled-loss compensation under R.C. 4123.57(B) for the loss of use of her hand. In support, she submitted a functional-capacities evaluation prepared by physical therapist Barbara Hornbeek. The report noted that Horvat\u2019s right hand was incapable of performing maneuvers that required dexterity or repetition. Hornbeek felt that these restrictions were permanent, although she reported that Horvat\u2019s performance was not entirely substantiated by objective findings and that at points, her performance may have been self-limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">{\u00b6 3} The physical therapy report did not comment on the degree of loss or whether Horvat had a total loss of use of her hand. Cambridge Home Health Care had the physical therapy report reviewed by Dr. Scott E. Singer, a licensed physician, who concluded that Horvat\u2019s level of function, as recorded by Hornbeek, did not meet the standard for loss of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">{\u00b6 4} A staff hearing officer awarded Horvat 175 weeks of compensation for total loss of use, relying exclusively on the physical therapy report. Reconsideration was denied, and Cambridge Home Health Care commenced this original action in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>{\u00b6 5} At issue is the hearing officer\u2019s exclusive reliance on a physical therapy report to award 175 weeks of scheduled-loss compensation. Cambridge Home Health Care argues that a loss-of-use award must be supported by a physician\u2019s report and cannot be based solely on a physical therapy report. The commission now agrees that the hearing officer erred and joins Cambridge Home Health Care in asking us to vacate the award. Horvat responds that the hearing officer did not rely simply on the physical therapist\u2019s report and that even if he did, that reliance was not fatal. We agree with the position of Cambridge Home Health Care.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 6} Contrary to Horvat\u2019s representation, the hearing officer did rely exclusively on the physical therapy report. The closing boilerplate language, \u201call proof on file was reviewed and considered,\u201d is not, as Horvat claims, proof that the hearing officer implicitly relied on other evidence in the file. See <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 483-484, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 7} The reliance on a single physical therapy report is an abuse of discretion for several reasons. First, regardless of whether a loss-of-use award is considered an impairment award or a disability award \u2014 it has elements of both \u2014 a physical therapist is prohibited from giving an opinion on either. The General Assembly has prohibited physical therapists from issuing disability conclusions. R.C. 4755.40(A) specifically forbids a physical therapist to make a \u201cmedical diagnosis of a patient\u2019s disability.\u201d And we have restricted impairment determinations to doctors. <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 171, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946 (\u201cimpairment is the amount of a claimant\u2019s anatomical * * * loss of function and is to be determined by the <em>doctors </em>and set forth within the medical reports\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 8} Second, while R.C. 4123.57(B) is silent as to the proof required, review of that statute in its entirety favors Cambridge Home Health Care\u2019s position. R.C. 4123.57 covers both scheduled-loss and smaller permanent partial disability awards. Under the statute, every claimant who applies for permanent partial disability compensation must have an agency medical examination. \u201cMedical examination,\u201d in turn, means a physician\u2019s exam, based on a cumulative reading of R.C. 4123.53 (the Industrial Commission may require any employee claiming compensation to submit to a medical examination) and 4121.38 (the Industrial Commission shall implement impairment-evaluation programs for its physicians, shall designate medical-legal analysts, and may establish a medical section). It defies logic to suggest, for example, that a 2 percent permanent partial disability award must be supported by a physician\u2019s report, but a loss-of-use award generating 175 weeks of benefits does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>{\u00b6 9} A physical therapist, of course, is not a physician. A physician is defined as an individual authorized under R.C. Chapter 4731 to practice medicine, osteopathic medicine, or podiatry. R.C. 4730.01(B). The Ohio Administrative Code defines the term similarly for purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation health partnership program but adds psychologists, dentists, and doctors of chiropractic and mechanotherapy as physicians. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-01(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 10} The Tenth District Court of Appeals has relied on this administrative provision to reject an effort to expand the class of professionals able to certify workers\u2019 compensation disability. In <em>State ex rel. Fries v. Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-721, 2002-Ohio-3252, 2002 WL 1377785, the claimant argued that because both physicians and licensed clinical counselors were defined in Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-01(F) as \u201cpractitioners,\u201d the two had the same rights. Id. at \u00b6 19. The appellate court, in adopting the magistrate\u2019s report, disagreed:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cWhile a <em>physician </em>is a <em>practitioner </em>under the [Health Partnership Program], those terms are obviously not equivalent. In other words, even if Ms. Schwartz, as a licensed professional clinical counselor, can claim \u2018practitioner\u2019 status under the [Health Partnership Program] definition, she clearly is not a physician.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 12} This holding is notable because a physical therapist is also a \u201cpractitioner\u201d under Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-01(F). This implies that a physical therapist, as a nonphysician, is also foreclosed from issuing a disability opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 13} Other jurisdictions have also disqualified physical therapists from offering disability or impairment conclusions. In <em>Bolton v. CNA Ins. Co. </em>(Tenn., 1991), 821 S.W.2d 932, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that a physical therapist\u2019s permanent partial impairment assessment could not be used as evidence in a workers\u2019 compensation case. Id. at 938. Health professionals, the court began, were competent \u201cto testify as an expert only as to matters within the limited scope of his or her expertise and licensure.\u201d Id. at 935. This scope, in turn, was defined by the state\u2019s Occupational and Physical Therapy Practice Act, Tenn.Code Ann. Chapter 13 \u2014 a statute with requirements similar to ones contained in R.C. Chapter 4755.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">{\u00b6 14} Tennessee\u2019s statute permitted physical therapists to evaluate and treat individuals \u201cusing specific means and narrowly defined methods.\u201d Id. at 936. The act specifically prohibited the practice of medicine and, with only a very limited exception, authorized physical therapy only upon referral by a physician.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This referral requirement prompted the court to conclude that physical therapy is a narrow health specialty limited in scope.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Au5B\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Millisor &amp; Nobil Co., L.P.A., and Michael J. Reidy, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b660-3\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[A] physical therapist is not qualified to form and express an expert opinion as to the permanent impairment or permanent physical restrictions of an injured person. * * * [A] physical therapist\u2019s testimony must be limited to objective findings and cannot encompass an opinion on ultimate disability.\u201d Id. at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">{\u00b6 16} Citing <em>Bolton, </em>a United States Court of Appeals reached the same result in an automobile negligence action. <em>Stutzman v. CRST, Inc. </em>(C.A.7, 1993), 997 F.2d 291, held that a physical therapist could not testify that she had a rehabilitation plan that could improve the patient\u2019s strength and coordination enough to permit light work. Id. at 298. The court characterized her statements as \u201ca medical prognosis that a physical therapist was not qualified to render.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 17} Federal regulations have long excluded physical therapists from the list of \u201c[acceptable medical sources\u201d authorized to \u201cprovide evidence to establish an impairment\u201d in social security disability cases. Section 404.1513(a), Title 20, C.F.R. Section 404.1513(d), Title 20, C.F.R. instead includes physical therapists among \u201cother sources\u201d on which the agency may rely to \u201cshow the severity of [an] impairment[ ] and how it affects [an individual\u2019s] ability to work.\u201d Accordingly, physical therapist opinions cannot be used to establish the existence of a disability; they can be considered only in conjunction with a doctor\u2019s report to help determine the disability\u2019s severity. <em>Rigby v. Astrue </em>(Sept. 17, 2009), M.D. Tenn. No. 3:08-CV-519, 2009 WL 3048668, *7-8. They are \u201centitled to consideration as additional evidence, but are not entitled to controlling weight.\u201d <em>Hatton v. Social Sec. Administration </em>(C.A.3, 2005), 131 Fed.Appx. 877, 878, 2005 WL 1220840.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 18} In the case at bar, the staff hearing officer relied solely on a physical therapy report to award 175 weeks of scheduled-loss compensation for an alleged loss of the use of a hand. The commission now concedes that this was an abuse of discretion, and our review supports that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 19} We accordingly issue a limited writ of mandamus that vacates the commission\u2019s order and orders the commission to further consider Horvat\u2019s motion and issue a new order.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Limited writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b660-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AnS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Charissa D.
