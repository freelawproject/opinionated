On February 15, 2008, we suspended respondent\u2019s license to practice on an interim basis pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(4) upon receiving notice that he had been convicted of a felony. See <em>In re Bennett, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1401, 2008-Ohio-594, 881 N.E.2d 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we now suspend respondent from practice for one year and give him credit for the time his license has been under the interim suspension. The board made this recommendation based on findings that respondent had structured financial transactions to avoid federal reporting requirements for transfers in excess of $10,000, the illegal conduct that led to his conviction. We agree that respondent violated ethical standards incumbent upon Ohio attorneys but hold that- an indefinite suspension, with credit for the interim suspension, is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with violating two Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility: DR 1-102(A)(4) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and 1-102(A)(6) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). The parties waived an evidentiary hearing and filed agreed stipulations in which respondent admitted the cited misconduct and the parties proposed that he receive a one-year suspension with credit for the time served since his February 15, 2008 interim suspension. A panel of three board members recommended acceptance of the agreed stipulations and proposed sanction. The board adopted the panel\u2019s report, accepting the stipulations and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ3L\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulated to respondent\u2019s violations of DR 1-102(A)(4) and (6), and to the following underlying facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">{\u00b6 5} 1. \u201cOn September 26, 2007, respondent pled guilty to a one-count Bill of Information alleging a Class C Felony in violation of 31 USC \u00a7 5342(a)(3) and (d)(2) [sic, 5324(a)(3) and (d)(2)] and 18 USC \u00a7 2 for unlawfully structuring financial transactions, Case No. 3:07CR144.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 6} 2. \u201cOn December 28, 2007, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Rose sentenced respondent to 24 months in prison and a $4,000 fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 7} 3. \u201cUnder 31 USC \u00a7 5313, certain federal regulations, namely 31 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 103.11 and 103.22, required domestic financial institutions to prepare and file FINCEN Form 104 whenever they were involved in the payment, receipt, or transfer of U.S. Currency exceeding $10,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 8} 4. \u201cAt all times herein, respondent was aware of such regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 9} 5. \u201cStructuring occurs when a person conducts one or more currency transactions at one or more financial institutions (or different branches of the same financial institution), on one or more days. One does this with the purpose of evading currency transaction reporting requirements. Structuring includes breaking down a single sum of currency over $10,000 into smaller sums or conducting a series of case [sic] transactions all at or below $10,000 with the purpose of evading currency transaction reporting requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 10} 6. \u201cDuring a five-month period, respondent unlawfully structured approximately $124,300 with various financial institutions located around Cincinnati, Ohio for the express purpose of evading the above-mentioned reporting requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">{\u00b6 11} 7. \u201cA majority of $124,300 was currency respondent had obtained from previously cashed paychecks that were issued to respondent by his employer</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">{\u00b6 12} 8. \u201cA certain unspecified portion of the currency transactions identified below originated from income that respondent received, but improperly failed to report and account to the Internal Revenue Service. The following paragraphs illustrate respondent\u2019s criminal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">{\u00b6 13} 9. \u201cOn August 15 and 16, 2002, respondent unlawfully structured $18,000 in U.S. Currency by making the following deposits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">\u201c\u2022 $4,000 at Fifth Third Bank, 916 Main St., Cincinnati</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANrz\">\u201c\u2022 $5,000 at Fifth Third Bank, 201 E.

Citing no aggravating features, the parties stipulated to the mitigating factors that respondent (1) does not have a prior disciplinary record, (2) provided full and free disclosure to the board with a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, and (3) offered positive character evidence. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (d), and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 24} The parties have also stipulated in mitigation that other penalties and sanctions have been imposed for respondent\u2019s illegal conduct \u2014 he was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay a $4,000 fine. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(f). Although this is true, the punishment was for only a portion of the violations committed. As part of a plea agreement with prosecutors, respondent pleaded guilty to structuring $32,000 in transactions from September 23 through 27, 2002, but he admits in the stipulations in this case that he structured other transactions as well. This reduces the weight of that mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 25} We also find a number of aggravating factors applicable to this case that the parties, panel, and board do not mention. First, although respondent\u2019s motive for illegally structuring financial transactions is not clear from the record before us, the bill of information to which he pleaded guilty stated that he structured the $32,000 transaction by making each deposit \u201cinto another individual\u2019s savings account.\u201d Respondent apparently thought it was worth the risk of prosecution for evading the reporting requirements for domestic financial institutions. His criminal conduct thus manifests dishonest and selfish motives, aggravating factors under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b). Respondent also engaged in his illegal activity over a five-month period, making 23 separate deposits at various banks, which constitutes a pattern of misconduct, an aggravating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c). An indefinite suspension is therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">{\u00b6 26} We accept the parties\u2019 proposal to credit respondent for his interim felony suspension. In their stipulations, the parties list the following eases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>which lawyers who were convicted of felonies were given credit for the time their licenses were under interim suspensions:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJ5\">Jonathan E.

Blaszak, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 330, 819 N.E.2d 689, 2004-Ohio-6593, the Supreme Court of Ohio imposed a two-year suspension with credit for time served after the respondent pled guilty to selling witness testimony in a pending case. In <em>Cuyahoga County Bar Assn. v. Garfield, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 103, 846 N.E.2d 45, 2006-Ohio-1935, the Ohio Supreme Court imposed an 18-month suspension with credit for time served after finding that the respondent pled guilty to one count of bank fraud for pledging a company\u2019s certificate of deposit as collateral for a personal loan. Id. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Petroff, 85 </em>Ohio St.3d 396, 709 N.E.2d 111, 1999-Ohio-400, the Ohio Supreme Court suspended Mark Petroff for one year with credit for time served after the respondent pled guilty to attempting to evade federal income taxes. Id. After Attorney William Seall was sentenced to four months in prison and a $7,000 f\u00edne for conspiring to commit tax fraud, the Supreme Court of Ohio suspended Seall for one year with credit for time served under the interim suspension. <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v.
