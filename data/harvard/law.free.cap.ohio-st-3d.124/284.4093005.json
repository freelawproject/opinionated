(\u201cUSP\u201d) appeals from an order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio making Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (\u201cColumbia\u201d) responsible for the repair and replacement of hazardous natural gas service lines. USP alleges that the commission lacked statutory authority to issue the order and that the order lacked record support, substantially impaired the obligations of USP\u2019s contracts, and resulted in an unconstitutional taking of property. None of USP\u2019s arguments has merit, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">{\u00b6 2} A service line is part of the pipeline system used to distribute natural gas. Running roughly from the curb to the meter, it is the last part of the journey natural gas takes from the depths of the earth to the home of the consumer. Unlike every other part of Columbia\u2019s distribution system, the service line is generally owned by the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">{\u00b6 3} Before the order in this case, if a service line leaked \u2014 for example, as a result of corrosion or because struck by the shovel of a backhoe \u2014 the customer was responsible for the costs of repairing or replacing the line. If the leak was hazardous, gas service was terminated until the line was repaired, whether the customer could afford the repair or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">{\u00b6 4} To help customers prepare for such an eventuality, USP offered customers what it called an \u201cexternal gas line warranty.\u201d For a monthly fee, USP would assume responsibility to repair or replace the service line if something went wrong. At the time of the commission order at issue herein, roughly 100,000 of Columbia\u2019s 1.4 million customers had purchased warranties from USP.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">{\u00b6 5} In April 2000, a serious event, termed an \u201cincident\u201d under federal law, occurred at a southwestern Ohio home. See Section 191.3(l)(i) and (ii), Title 49, C.F.R. (defining \u201cincident\u201d to include \u201c[a]n event that involves a release of gas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>from a pipeline * * * and * * * [a] death, or personal injury necessitating inpatient hospitalization; or * * * property damage * * * of $50,000 or more\u201d). The part of the service line that connects to the meter (called the \u201criser\u201d) failed and pulled away from the remainder of the line. Natural gas began blowing out of the disconnected line, apparently filling the basement. Something ignited, and the gas exploded. As a commission staff person testified in this case, \u201cBy the time the company got there, stopped the flow of gas and everything the house was severely damaged, actually ended up being totaled. As we were doing our investigation at the site, we had several homeowners come up to us and say, \u2018That same thing happened to my gas meter. The gas line pulled out and gas was blowing at the foundation of my house\u2019 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">{\u00b6 6} That month, the commission initiated an investigation of the gas company in question. Over the next three .years, while the investigation was underway, at least three more risers failed and caused explosions. In response, in 2005, the commission opened a statewide investigation and charged its staff, with the cooperation of natural gas companies, to report on the condition and performance of risers in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 7} The staff issued its report in November 2006. A few weeks later, the chairman of the commission filed a letter in the investigation docket asking Ohio\u2019s distribution companies to consider \u201cutilities taking over responsibility for the customer owned service lines\u201d versus \u201cthe prudence\u201d of \u201cleaving] responsibility with the homeowner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 8} Apparently Columbia found taking over responsibility from the customer the prudent course, and in April 2007, it submitted an application seeking authority to \u201cassum[e] responsibility for * * * the future maintenance, repair and replacement of customer-owned service lines.\u201d Numerous parties intervened, including two parties that opposed Columbia\u2019s assumption of service-line responsibility. One was a plumbing company that stood to lose both warranty and repair business to Columbia. The other was USP, which asserted that Columbia\u2019s proposal to assume service-line responsibility \u201cwould eradicate the corresponding gas service line warranty component of [its] business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 9} In October 2007, the case went to hearing, and USP actively participated in the hearing. On December 28, 2007, Columbia filed a stipulation signed by the company, staff, Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel, and a consumer group. The stipulation recommended that Columbia \u201cbe permitted to assume responsibility for * * * the future maintenance, repair and replacement of hazardous service lines.\u201d More hearings were held, this time concerning the stipulation. USP again participated and filed a posthearing brief urging the commission to reject the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Nevertheless, the commission approved it. USP sought rehearing but was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 11} The sole issue on appeal is whether the commission reasonably and lawfully made Columbia responsible for the repair and replacement of hazardous service lines. See R.C. 4903.13. USP challenges the order on four grounds, arguing (1) that the commission lacked statutory authority to make Columbia responsible for service lines, (2) that the order was not supported by evidence, (3) that the order was unconstitutional because it substantially impaired the obligations of contracts, and (4) that the order was unconstitutional because it resulted in a taking without just compensation. We find USP\u2019s arguments to lack merit, and we affirm the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 12} USP argues that the commission lacked statutory authority to make Columbia responsible for the repair or replacement of hazardous service lines. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 13} In issuing the order, the commission relied on R.C. 4905.06. That section gives the commission general supervisory authority over utilities; among other things, it provides the commission with the \u201cpower to inspect\u201d public utilities, which \u201cincludes the power to prescribe any rule or order that the commission finds necessary for protection of the public safety.\u201d The fact that only one string is attached to this power \u2014 the commission must find the rule or order necessary \u2014 implies a generous grant of discretion to issue safety-related orders. See <em>Akron v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 347, 359, 37 O.O. 39, 78 N.E.2d 890 (recognizing the commission\u2019s \u201cbroad\u201d authority under various statutes \u201cto protect and safeguard the interests of the public, particularly in respect to health, safety and welfare\u201d). Thus, if the order was related to the \u201cprotection of the public safety,\u201d the commission acted within its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 14} We find that the order was related to the protection of the public safety. The commission expressly acted \u201cto improve the level of public safety,\u201d and the terms of its order were rationally related to that end. Service lines carry natural gas, and natural gas is dangerous unless it is handled properly. It is noxious, flammable, invisible, and naturally odorless. Natural gas is potentially lethal to persons and destructive of property. We have long recognized its dangers. See, e.g., <em>Suiter v. Ohio Valley Gas Co. </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 77, 78, 39 O.O.2d 65, 225 N.E.2d 792 (\u201cIt is a matter of common knowledge that * * * gas is a * * * dangerous commodity with a marked tendency to escape from its proper confines\u201d); <em>Northwestern Ohio Natural Gas Co. v. First Congregational Church of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>Toledo </em>(1933), 126 Ohio St. 140, 184 N.E. 512, paragraph four of the syllabus (recognizing \u201cthe highly dangerous character of gas and its tendency to escape\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">{\u00b6 15} Thus, the order, in seeking to improve the regulation of pipelines that prevent the escape of a dangerous substance, had a clear tie to public safety. And the order gave Columbia responsibility only over \u201chazardous\u201d service lines, eliminating any argument that the commission exceeded the bounds of the safety power. We conclude that the commission acted with statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 16} On this point, USP\u2019s objections boil down to two issues: first, that the commission lacked the power to regulate \u201cpreviously * * * non-jurisdictional property\u201d and, second, that the commission \u201caffect[ed] the contract rights and property of third parties over whom it has no jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 17} It is true that service lines used to be nonjurisdictional in the sense that Columbia\u2019s customers used to be responsible for arranging and paying for service-line repair. But this does not mean that the commission exceeded the bounds of its jurisdiction. The commission merely regulated in a new way a person (Columbia) and a kind of property (segments of the distribution system) already subject to its jurisdiction. See R.C. 4905.03(A)(6), 4905.04, 4905.06, and 4929.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 18} Modifying a regulatory scheme is not problematic in itself. Agencies undoubtedly may change course, provided that the new regulatory course is permissible. See, e.g., <em>Luntz Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 509, 512-513, 684 N.E.2d 43 (\u201cthe commission must, when appropriate, be willing to change its policies\u201d); see also <em>Fed. Communications Comm. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc. </em>(2009), \u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1800, 1811, 173 L.Ed.2d 738 (an agency \u201cneed not demonstrate to a court\u2019s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are <em>better </em>than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency <em>believes </em>it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates\u201d [emphasis sic]). The issue, then, is whether the commission\u2019s new course is permissible under the statute. We find that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">{\u00b6 19} Four catastrophic home explosions provided the commission with striking evidence of what can happen when service lines fail. It investigated the matter, identified a possible safety gap (which was confirmed during the hearings in this case), and acted to close that gap and head off any further incident. The result of the regulatory deliberation and fact-finding at issue here is permissible under R.C. 4905.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">{\u00b6 20} USP\u2019s other argument \u2014 that commission orders simply may not \u201caffect\u201d unregulated parties \u2014 fares no better. USP cites no authority in support of this hopelessly overbroad proposition. If the commission could not issue orders that \u201caffect\u201d unregulated parties, it could not function. It would be a rare order that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>did not affect unregulated persons: an order increasing rates, for instance, has the \u201ceffect\u201d of transferring additional money from unregulated persons to regulated companies; likewise, an order denying a proposed construction project \u201caffects\u201d unregulated suppliers of labor and materials. The mere fact that an order affects unregulated parties is not problematic \u2014 it is inevitable. USP must show that the commission lacked authority to do what it did, and that inquiry is governed by the Revised Code, not the mere presence or absence of effects on third parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 21} In its second proposition of law, USP asserts that the commission lacked support in the record for two determinations it made: (1) that there was a safety problem with service lines that do not have the kind of riser whose failure prompted the commission\u2019s initial investigation and (2) that Columbia should be responsible for the repair and replacement of service lines. We find both determinations, however, amply supported in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 22} Service lines can pose safety hazards. They carry a dangerous substance that has a tendency to escape. The undisputed evidence shows that a series of explosions resulting from service-line failures damaged or destroyed homes from 2000 to 2003. If the explosive destruction of multiple homes does not establish a safety issue, it is unclear what would.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 23} USP concedes that there was evidence of safety issues associated with risers (the above-ground portion of the service line), but it asserts that there was no evidence of safety issues with any other part of the service line. The record, however, shows that the riser <em>is </em>part of the service line, and USP cites no authority limiting the commission\u2019s safety jurisdiction to the narrowest segment manifesting safety issues on a particular line. But even if we accept USP\u2019s conceptual division of the service line, the record contains substantial evidence that service lines in general \u2014 not simply a particular type of failed riser \u2014 also posed safety issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">{\u00b6 24} Indeed, numerous witnesses for both sides agreed that service lines in general can create safety issues. For example, Michael Ramsey (a Columbia manager charged with \u2022 ensuring compliance with pipeline safety regulations) explained that \u201cleaks in steel service lines\u201d can \u201cpresent hazards to life and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>property.\u201d In addition to leaks caused by damage from digging, steel service lines leak when they corrode, and Ramsey testified that \u201ca leaking customer service line,\u201d if not fixed, could \u201cpresent a danger\u201d to both owner and neighbors because \u201cgas can migrate and could migrate to [the neighbor\u2019s] house.\u201d If the \u201cgas migrates into the structure, and if there is a source of ignition, it can cause * * * catastrophic damage to the structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">{\u00b6 25} Witnesses sponsored by USP confirmed the point. For example, USP witness Carter Funk recognized that corrosion causes leaks on underground service lines and acknowledged on cross-examination that \u201c[c]orrosion and bare steel service lines can present a safety hazard.\u201d USP witness Timothy Phipps also recognized that corrosion causes leaks on underground service lines, and he also agreed on cross-examination that \u201cone of the reasons for repairing gas leaks on gas lines is * * * safety.\u201d He knew this because he had \u201cseen the aftermath of more than one\u201d fire at a house from a gas line, which also \u201ccreate[d] a danger to other residences in the immediate vicinity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 26} The record thus supports the commission\u2019s determination that service lines, wherever they run, present safety issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">{\u00b6 27} Likewise, the record supported the commission\u2019s decision to place service-line responsibility in the hands of a single regulated company. Evidence showed that the incomplete, decentralized, and unregulated system for repairing service lines then in existence had significant flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">{\u00b6 28} Testimony showed that there were major gaps in service-line warranty coverage. Roughly 93 percent of Columbia\u2019s 1.4 million customers did not hold service-line warranties with USP. The commission reasonably accorded significance to this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">{\u00b6 29} If a customer without a warranty smelled natural gas outside his home, he might choose not to report it \u2014 especially if he was in financial straits. Reporting a leak would bring a utility truck to the home and perhaps a dilemma to the customer: either arrange for an expensive repair or suffer an indefinite termination of gas service. If a customer did not report the leak, it could delay the time in which it would be detected by Columbia, which under federal law must inspect lines outside business districts only every three to five years. See Section 192.723, Title 49, C.F.R. Given that natural gas leaks are dangerous, it stands to reason that a system containing natural disincentives to report leaks is a hindrance to safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">{\u00b6 30} And even if customers could afford repair, the evidence showed that there were issues in the industry actually doing the repairs. Before the order, if a repair was needed, either the homeowner or warranty company would locate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>and hire a private contractor to fix the line. A number of witnesses for both the commission and Columbia highlighted flaws with this decentralized, unsupervised system, but it is sufficient here to consider what USP\u2019s own witness had to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">{\u00b6 31} Timothy Phipps, owner and operator of a company that did repair work for USP, explained on cross-examination that \u201cthe sort of thing you see that contractors do [is] that they can be taking shortcuts,\u201d which he equated with \u201cdoing a shoddy job.\u201d He also explained that it was hard to determine which contractors were doing \u201ca shoddy job\u201d; as he put it, there are \u201csome bad eggs out there[,] but who knows where they are at. I couldn\u2019t say.\u201d When asked what percentage of contractors took shortcuts, Phipps answered, \u201cI would say probably 20, 30 percent,\u201d and \u201cpossibly\u201d a third.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 32} To be fair, Phipps qualified his testimony by stating that \u201cit\u2019s immaterial whether [private contractors] took a shortcut * * * because the gas company checks everything that they do,\u201d that Columbia\u2019s inspectors \u201care very thorough about their checks,\u201d and that \u201c[Columbia\u2019s] people are trained.\u201d Perhaps it is true that Columbia\u2019s employees would catch shortcuts; but if so, we find this fact at least as favorable to the commission as to USP.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 33} In short, the record supports the commission\u2019s decision to make Columbia responsible for the repair and replacement of hazardous service lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 34} USP cannot establish that the order is not supported by evidence. What USP establishes, at best, either is irrelevant or does not justify reversal. It points out other types of evidence that could have been presented but were not. For example, it states, \u201cThe Staff Report [in the case investigating risers statewide] makes no reference whatsoever to any safety issues associated with metal customer-owned service lines.\u201d But why a report from a different case should have addressed the case below is left unexplained. USP also asserts that \u201cneither Columbia nor the Staff presented any evidence regarding clamor from the public over the safety of customer-owned service lines.\u201d But it should go without saying that no regulatory authority conditions jurisdiction on public clamor. USP also repeatedly points out that risers are more dangerous than underground service lines. But, not surprisingly, no authority limits the commission\u2019s safety authority to the most unsafe pipeline \u2014 or segment of that pipeline.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">{\u00b6 35} Evidence before the commission pointed both ways, and mostly in favor of the commission. USP, in essence, asks us to reweigh the evidence. But that is outside the scope of our function on appeal. <em>Elyria Foundry Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 305, 2007-Ohio-4164, 871 N.E.2d 1176, \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\n<em>c</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 36} In its third proposition of law, USP argues that the commission violated the state and federal constitutional prohibition against the impairment of the obligation of contracts. Section 10, Article I, United States Constitution; Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution. It states that the commission \u201cnullified at least 100,000 of USP\u2019s warranty service contracts\u201d and \u201cdestroy[ed] USP\u2019s contractual relationship with its customers.\u201d Despite USP\u2019s assertions, we do not find that the commission violated the Contract Clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 37} In determining whether the obligations of USP\u2019s then-existing contracts were unconstitutionally impaired, the parties agree that <em>Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1983), 459 U.S. 400, 103 S.Ct. 697, 74 L.Ed.2d 569, applies. That case instructs us to ask \u201c \u2018whether the state law has, in fact, operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 411, 103 S.Ct. 697, 74 L.Ed.2d 569, quoting <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 234, 244, 98 S.Ct. 2716, 57 L.Ed.2d 727. If so, then we determine whether the government has \u201ca significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation.\u201d Id. at 411, 103 S.Ct. 697, 74 L.Ed.2d 569. And if that is the case, we inquire \u201cwhether the adjustment of \u2018the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties [is based] upon reasonable conditions and [is] of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying [the legislation\u2019s] adoption.\u2019 \u201d (Brackets sic.) Id. at 412, 103 S.Ct. 697, 74 L.Ed.2d 569, quoting <em>United States Trust Co. of New York v. New Jersey </em>(1977), 431 U.S. 1, 22, 97 S.Ct. 1505, 52 L.Ed.2d 92. In applying the <em>Energy Reserves </em>test, we conclude that the commission order is valid under the Contract Clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">{\u00b6 38} The first inquiry we make is \u201cwhether the state law has, in fact, operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\u201d <em>Allied Structural Steel Co., </em>438 U.S. at 244, 98 S.Ct. 2716, 57 L.Ed.2d 727. USP has not created a record sufficient to allow this court to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">{\u00b6 39} No contract or detailed description of the terms of any contract has been included in the record. Thus, USP\u2019s assertions that its contracts were \u201cnullified\u201d are merely unsupported legal conclusions. Without evidence of the \u201cobligation of contracts,\u201d it is impossible to determine whether they have been \u201cimpaired.\u201d Cf., e.g., <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis </em>(1987), 480 U.S. 470, 504, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 94 L.Ed.2d 472 (\u201cIn assessing the validity of petitioners\u2019 Contracts Clause claim in this case, we begin by identifying <em>the precise contractual right </em>that has been impaired * * *\u201d [emphasis added]). USP thus has failed to create a record sufficient for us to decide whether any obligation of its contracts has been impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>{\u00b6 40} We may not speculate regarding USP\u2019s contractual obligations. Thus, the lack of this essential evidence is fatal to USP\u2019s impairment-of-contracts claim. See <em>Hughes v. Wendel </em>(1942), 317 U.S. 134, 63 S.Ct. 103, 87 L.Ed. 139 (\u201cAppellant contends that this statute * * * impairs the obligation of her contract contrary to Article I, \u00a7 10 of the Constitution. The record, however, does not set forth appellant\u2019s lease, and the incomplete summary of it contained in her pleading is not adequate to enable us to determine what her rights may be. Accordingly, we must dismiss the appeal\u201d); see also <em>Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy RR. Co. v. Cram </em>(1913), 228 U.S. 70, 85, 33 S.Ct. 437, 57 L.Ed. 734 (\u201cThe contention is made that the statute impairs the obligation of the contracts * * *; but that contention was not made in the court below and cannot therefore be made here. Besides, there is no evidence of the contracts in the record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 41} Even if we assume, however, that USP demonstrated that the obligations of its existing contracts have been substantially impaired by the commission order, the impairing regulation in this case is justified by \u201ca significant and legitimate public purpose.\u201d <em>Energy Reserves, </em>459 U.S. at 411-412, 103 S.Ct. 697, 74 L.Ed.2d 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 42} As <em>Energy Reserves </em>made clear, the Contract Clause\u2019s prohibition \u201cmust be accommodated to the inherent police power of the State \u2018to safeguard the vital interests of its people.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 410, 103 S.Ct. 697, 74 L.Ed.2d 569, quoting <em>Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell </em>(1934), 290 U.S. 398, 434, 54 S.Ct. 231, 78 L.Ed. 413. In that case, the court held that the state was prompted by \u201csignificant and legitimate state interests\u201d in \u201cexercising] its police power to protect consumers from the escalation of natural gas prices caused by deregulation.\u201d Id. at 416-417, 103 S.Ct. 697, 74 L.Ed.2d 569; see also, e.g., <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn., </em>480 U.S. at 503, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 94 L.Ed.2d 472, quoting <em>Manigault v. Springs </em>(1905), 199 U.S. 473, 480, 26 S.Ct. 127, 130, 50 L.Ed. 274 (\u201c \u2018[I]t is to be accepted as a commonplace that the Contract Clause does not operate to obliterate the police power of the States\u2019 \u201d). While it is true that \u201cprivate contracts are not subject to unlimited modification under the police power,\u201d state regulation need only \u201cserve a legitimate public purpose\u201d and \u201ccourts properly defer to legislative judgment as to the necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure.\u201d <em>United States Trust Co., </em>431 U.S. at 22-23, 97 S.Ct. 1505, 52 L.Ed.2d 92 (state action violated the Contract Clause in a case in which a state was a party to the contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 43} This point of law is amplified by numerous cases in which we have affirmed the commission\u2019s police-power orders against Contract Clause challenges. These cases make clear that \u201c \u2018[t]he provisions of the state and federal constitutions, inhibiting laws impairing the obligation of contract, do not affect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>power of the state to protect the public health or the public safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 105, 109, 5 OBR 241, 449 N.E.2d 433, quoting <em>Akron, </em>149 Ohio St. 347, 37 O.O. 39, 78 N.E.2d 890, paragraph four of the syllabus; see also, e.g., <em>Atwood Resources, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 96, 100, 538 N.E.2d 1049 (\u201cbecause the provisions of the state and federal Constitutions, prohibiting laws impairing the obligation of contracts, do not affect the police power, Atwood\u2019s \u2018private endeavors\u2019 are subject to regulation\u201d); <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Power Siting Comm. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 212, 217, 10 O.O.3d 371, 383 N.E.2d 588; <em>Akron, </em>149 Ohio St. at 359, 37 O.O. 39, 78 N.E.2d 890; cf. <em>Steele, Hopkins &amp; Meredith Co. v. Miller </em>(1915), 92 Ohio St. 115, 125, 110 N.E. 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 44} Here, the commission\u2019s order represented an exercise of police power. At a minimum, the police power includes actions taken to protect public safety. See <em>Ohio Edison Co., </em>56 Ohio St.2d at 217, 10 O.O.3d 371, 383 N.E.2d 588 (defining \u201cpolice power legislation\u201d as that \u201cdesigned to protect public health, safety and welfare\u201d); <em>Arnold v. Cleveland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 35, 47, 616 N.E.2d 163 (\u201cLegislative concern for public safety is not only a proper police power objective \u2014 it is a mandate\u201d). The commission expressly stated that its order was \u201can effort to improve the level of public safety,\u201d and the commission reasonably and with ample support in its record determined that making Columbia responsible for service lines would protect the public safety. Thus, even if the obligations of USP\u2019s contracts were impaired, the order was driven by a significant and legitimate public purpose and satisfies the second part of the <em>Energy Reserves </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 45} If USP had shown substantial impairment (which it did not), then only the third inquiry would remain: whether the regulation is based \u201c \u2018upon reasonable conditions and [is] of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying [the legislation\u2019s] adoption.\u2019 \u201d <em>Energy Reserves, </em>459 U.S. at 412, 103 S.Ct. 697, 74 L.Ed.2d 569, quoting <em>United States Trust Co. of New York, </em>431 U.S. at 22, 97 S.Ct. 1505, 52 L.Ed.2d 92. We have held that we will not invalidate an exercise of the police power \u201cunless the * * * determination that the [regulation] bears a real and substantial relationship to public health, safety and welfare appears to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Ohio Edison, </em>56 Ohio St.2d at 218, 10 O.O.3d 371, 383 N.E.2d 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">{\u00b6 46} Here, the evidence showed that the decentralized, unregulated, and incomplete repair regime that had grown up in Ohio did not adequately protect public safety. The order rationally responded to this situation by consolidating a diffuse system and placing repair responsibility into the hands of the party the commission determined to be the best qualified to exercise it: a pervasively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>regulated, thoroughly supervised, pipeline-expert natural gas company. That the order was well tailored to meet its objective is evidenced by the fact that Columbia was authorized to take control only over hazardous lines and would own only those portions of the line that it has actually repaired or replaced. For these reasons, the third part of the <em>Energy Reserves </em>test is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 47} Finding that USP satisfies none of inquiries set forth in <em>Energy Reserves, </em>we must reject its Contract Clause challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>D</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 48} In its fourth proposition of law, USP argues that the order resulted in a \u201ctaking of private property without just compensation.\u201d USP does not argue that its property has been taken, but that the commission \u201ctook property rights from the homeowner.\u201d USP, however, lacks standing to raise the constitutional rights of property owners, so we do not reach the merits of the takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cA party must have standing to be entitled to have a court decide the merits of a dispute.\u201d <em>N. Canton v. Canton, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 253, 2007-Ohio-4005, 871 N.E.2d 586, \u00b6 11. To have standing, the general rule is that \u201ca litigant must assert its own rights, not the claims of third parties.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. There may be, however, \u201ccircumstances where it is necessary to grant a third party standing to assert the rights of another.\u201d <em>Kowalski v. Tesmer </em>(2004), 543 U.S. 125, 129-130, 125 S.Ct. 564, 160 L.Ed.2d 519. Third-party standing is \u201cnot looked favorably upon,\u201d id. at 130, 125 S.Ct. 564, 160 L.Ed.2d 519, but it may be granted \u201cwhen a claimant (i) suffers its own injury in fact, (ii) possesses a sufficiently \u2018 \u201cclose\u201d relationship with the person who possesses the right,\u2019 and (iii) shows some \u2018hindrance\u2019 that stands in the way of the claimant seeking relief.\u201d <em>E. Liverpool v. Columbiana Cty. Budget Comm., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 133, 2007-Ohio-3759, 870 N.E.2d 705, \u00b6 22, quoting <em>Kowalski </em>at 130, 125 S.Ct. 564, 160 L.Ed.2d 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 50} USP has no right to assert this claim on behalf of property owners. Assuming that USP has suffered \u201cits own injury in fact\u201d under the first factor, it fails to establish the second or the third factors: USP\u2019s interests appear opposed to those of property owners, and it has shown no hindrance in the way of property owners who might desire to seek relief on their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">{\u00b6 51} Regarding the second factor, close relationship with the person who possesses the right, nothing knits USP and property owners together besides \u201cthe underlying contract between them,\u201d which we have previously held does not justify third-party standing. <em>N. Canton </em>at \u00b6 16. The interests of USP and property owners are neither \u201cinterdependent,\u201d see id., nor \u201ccommon,\u201d see <em>Powers v. Ohio </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 400, 413, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411. If anything, their interests appear opposed: The Office of the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel\u2014 which represents residential consumers, and thus residential property owners, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>utility <em>matters </em>\u2014 supported the stipulation that USP now attacks. And it appears from the record that Columbia will be able to provide customers the same service as USP for a fraction of the cost per customer. Therefore, USP may not assert these owners\u2019 rights. See, e.g., <em>Singleton v. Wulff </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 106, 113-114, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (\u201ccourts must hesitate before resolving a controversy * * * on the basis of the rights of third persons not parties to the litigation * * * [because] it may be that in fact the holders of those rights * * * do not wish to assert them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">{\u00b6 52} Nor does USP satisfy the final third-party-standing factor; there is no hindrance in the way of property owners who might desire to seek relief. <em>N. Canton, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 253, 2007-Ohio-4005, 871 N.E.2d 586, at \u00b6 14. In <em>N. Canton, </em>we observed that the plaintiff city \u201cfailed to demonstrate that [the third party] was hindered from asserting its own rights in this matter.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17. The third party \u201cdid not choose to file suit, nor has it even attempted to intervene in this case,\u201d and \u201cnothing * * * prohibited] [the third party] from asserting its own claim.\u201d Id. Here, likewise, USP has not shown that any barrier would hinder a property owner from asserting his or her own takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">{\u00b6 53} Even if USP had standing to raise this claim, we find that USP failed to support its takings argument, thus effectively waiving that argument. In the argument in its initial brief, USP cites only a decision of this court from 1902 involving riparian and sewage rights. In light of many developments in takings law since that case was decided (both in Ohio and at the federal level), it is not clear to us that this case controls the outcome here. No argument is supplied regarding whether the relevant case law, applied to the facts of this case, justifies a decision in USP\u2019s favor. USP bears the burden of demonstrating the unlawfulness of the commission\u2019s order, and thus we hold that USP, even if it had standing, failed to support its takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 54} USP\u2019s argument that the commission \u201ceffected a taking of <em>contract rights </em>without just compensation\u201d was raised for the first time on reply, and USP has thus failed to preserve it. See <em>State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041, 896 N.E.2d 979, \u00b6 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 55} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the order of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A_2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., M.
