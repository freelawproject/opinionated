Rust of Toledo, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0000098, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1948. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice for six months, but stay the suspension on conditions, including a two-year monitored probation. The recommendation is based on findings that respondent agreed to file a wrongful-death action at the behest of the decedent\u2019s heir, but then brought the suit on behalf of the administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate, the proper party-plaintiff, without obtaining the administrator\u2019s authority for the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">{\u00b6 2} The board found a single violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.16(a)(1), which requires a lawyer to decline or terminate representation if \u201cthe representation will result in the violation of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.\u201d Respondent objects to this finding, citing precedent that he insists allows a beneficiary to file a wrongful-death claim in the name of the administrator when the administrator has refused to pursue the action. Without deciding the viability of his legal strategy, we find that respondent initiated the wrongful-death action in good faith and that he had an arguable basis in law and fact that was not frivolous for filing the claim. Because lawyers may advance such claims in attempting to extend, modify, or reverse existing law, we hold that respondent committed no ethical impropriety and dismiss the complaint against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Toledo Bar Association, charged respondent in a single count with multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, including Prof. Cond.R. 1.16(a)(1). A panel of three board members heard the case, found the Prof.Cond.R. 1.16(a)(1) violation, and recommended both the dismissal of all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>charges and a one-year suspension of respondent\u2019s license, with the suspension stayed on conditions of (1) participation in the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d), (2) completion of a two-year probation, and (3) no further misconduct. The board adopted the panel\u2019s finding of misconduct, but recommended a six-month suspension, stayed on the listed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Alleged Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 4} In early 2007, Duane Tillimon<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> consulted respondent about bringing a wrongful-death action to recover for his mother\u2019s death on January 20, 2005. Tillimon, the sole beneficiary of his mother\u2019s estate, suspected that her former guardian and the nursing home where she died contributed to the cause of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 5} Tillimon had already filed one wrongful-death complaint against the guardian and the nursing home while being represented by another lawyer. The previous lawyer filed the complaint in mid-January 2006, naming the administrator initially appointed to oversee the decedent\u2019s estate as plaintiff. Later, when that administrator was replaced by a successor due to a conflict, the complaint was amended to name the successor administrator as the plaintiff. But then the guardian\u2019s counsel discovered that the successor administrator had not authorized the filing of the wrongful-death suit. The guardian\u2019s counsel obtained an affidavit from the administrator disavowing the wrongful-death claim and moved to dismiss, asserting that Tillimon had no authority to sue. Tillimon\u2019s previous lawyer responded in April 2006 by voluntarily dismissing the complaint without prejudice, thereby allowing the action to be refiled later.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">{\u00b6 6} When Tillimon retained respondent, the statute of limitations on the wrongful-death action was within a week or ten days of expiring. Respondent concluded from the administrator\u2019s affidavit that the administrator had not and would not authorize the pursuit of a wrongful-death claim against the former guardian and nursing home. Respondent nevertheless refiled the case in late March 2007 in the Lucas County Common Pleas Court. To do so, he used a slightly modified version of the complaint that Tillimon\u2019s former counsel had filed, still naming the successor administrator as plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>{\u00b6 7} The guardian, who had refused service of the complaint, monitored the proceedings from the common pleas court\u2019s online docket. In early April 2007, the guardian\u2019s counsel obtained a second affidavit from the estate\u2019s administrator indicating that the administrator had not authorized a wrongful-death action on behalf of the estate. At the same time, the administrator wrote to respondent and demanded that the suit be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent responded by asking the common pleas court to substitute Tillimon as plaintiff in the case, which the court did. In his motion, respondent alleged that the decedent\u2019s guardian had wrongfully faked to authorize surgery for the decedent; that respondent\u2019s client, the decedent\u2019s sole heir, wanted to pursue a wrongful-death action against the guardian and others; and that the administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate had indicated that he was not interested in pursuing the action. Respondent obtained an affidavit from a physician who had treated the decedent that supported respondent\u2019s theory as to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">{\u00b6 9} The guardian then moved for reconsideration of the substitution order. Respondent, in turn, asked for a stay of the common pleas court proceedings to obtain an order from the probate court substituting his client as administrator of the estate. In July 2007, the common pleas court vacated its substitution order and reinstated the estate administrator as plaintiff, holding that the probate court had exclusive jurisdiction to replace an estate fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 10} The guardian next filed a memorandum opposing the motion to stay and moved for dismissal, arguing again that respondent lacked authority to sue. The court denied the stay. That August, respondent filed a notice, advising the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cSon and sole heir Duane J. Tihmon, by his counsel, advising court of our \u2018followup\u2019 to move probate court to act on Mr. Tillmon\u2019s motion for appointment as executor or special administrator, promptly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">{\u00b6 12} The common pleas court dismissed the wrongful-death action several days later without addressing the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">{\u00b6 13} The board found respondent in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.16(a)(1) because he fked a wrongful-death action that named as plaintiff the administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate, even though respondent knew that the administrator did not want to pursue the action. In objecting to the board\u2019s finding, respondent claims that he had to file the action as he did because (1) his client, the decedent\u2019s only heir, wanted to file the action, but the administrator, the proper party-plaintiff, opposed the action, and (2) the statute of limitations was about to expire. Respondent insists that his filing on behalf of the estate administrator was permissible under <em>Douglas v. Daniels Bros. Coal Co. </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 641, 15 O.O. 12, 22 N.E.2d 195; <em>Burwell v. Maynard </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 108, 50 O.O.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>268, 255 N.E.2d 628; and R.C. 2113.18. Because this precedent and its progeny at least arguably permitted respondent to file the action to avoid the statute of limitations for wrongful-death actions and to then obtain his client\u2019s appointment under the statute as the administrator of his mother\u2019s estate, we sustain the objection and find no misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 2113.18 authorizes a probate court to remove the administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate under circumstances that respondent claims are present here\u2014 when the administrator refuses to bring a wrongful-death action and a prima facie case for wrongful death exists. That statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(B) The probate court may remove any executor or administrator upon motion of the surviving spouse, children, or other next of kin of the deceased person whose estate is administered by the executor or administrator if both of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(1) The executor or administrator refuses to bring an action for wrongful death in the name of the deceased person;</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(2) The court determines that a prima-facie case for a wrongful death action can be made from the information available to the executor or administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">{\u00b6 18} In authorizing wrongful-death actions, R.C. 2125.02(A)(1) provides that in general:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[A] civil action for wrongful death shall be brought <em>in the name </em>of the personal representative of the decedent for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse, the children, and the parents of the decedent, all of whom are rebuttably presumed to have suffered damages by reason of the wrongful death, and for the exclusive benefit of the other next of kin of the decedent.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">{\u00b6 20} Respondent\u2019s defense raises the question whether this statute (1) allows only the personal representative of the estate to file the wrongful-death action or (2) allows, as an initial matter, a beneficiary or other party in interest to initiate the proceeding in the name of the personal representative. Over the years, courts have often followed the latter interpretation and acknowledged that it is not necessarily fatal to the wrongful-death claim for a party other than the fiduciary appointed by the probate court to file the action. Respondent relies on two of these <em>cases </em>\u2014 Douglas <em>v. Daniels Bros. Coal Co., </em>135 Ohio St. 641, 15 O.O. 12, 22 N.E.2d 195, and <em>Burwell v. Maynard, </em>21 Ohio St.2d 108, 50 O.O.2d 268, 255 N.E.2d 628 \u2014 both of which offer the same explanation:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c \u2018The requirement of the wrongful death statute that the prosecution of the action be in the name of the personal representative is no part of the cause of action itself, but relates merely to the right of action or remedy. That requirement was obviously intended for the benefit and protection of the surviving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>spouse, children and next of kin of a decedent, the real parties in interest. The personal representative is only a nominal party. <em>Wolf, Adm\u2019r, v. Lake Erie &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>55 Ohio St. 517, 45 N.E. 708, 36 L.R.A. 812. Nor does the statute require that the personal representative shall bring the action <em>(Wolf, Adm\u2019r., v. Lake Erie &amp; W. Ry. Co., supra), </em>but merely provides that the action, if brought, shall be brought in the name of the personal representative. The only concern defendants have is that the action be brought in the name of the party authorized so that they may not again be haled into court to answer for the same wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burwell </em>at 110, 50 O.O.2d 268, 255 N.E.2d 628, quoting <em>Douglas </em>at 647, 15 O.O. 12, 22 N.E.2d 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">{\u00b6 22} <em>Douglas </em>is most specifically on point. In that case, a widow instituted an action alleging her husband\u2019s wrongful death. <em>Douglas, </em>135 Ohio St. at 641, 15 O.O. 12, 22 N.E.2d 195. Though the widow had not been appointed administrator, she filed the action as the decedent\u2019s personal representative under the mistaken impression that she had been appointed. Id. at 645, 15 O.O. 12, 22 N.E.2d 195. Thus, like respondent, the widow filed the case without the authority of a validly appointed personal representative. She discovered her error after expiration of the applicable statute-of-limitations period and amended her petition to show her later appointment as administrator. Id. Allowing the amendment to relate back and preserve the claim, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cWhere a widow institutes an action, as administratrix, for damages for the wrongful death of her husband, under the mistaken belief that she had been duly appointed and had qualified as such, thereafter discovers her error and amends her petition so as to show that she was appointed administratrix after the expiration of the statute of limitation applicable to such action, the amended petition will relate back to the date of the filing of the petition, and the action will be deemed commenced within the time limited by statute.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 24} Respondent argues that this authority allowed him to bring a wrongful-death action by filing a complaint naming the administrator as plaintiff. In fact, he took this precedent so literally that he represented himself to be the plaintiffs lawyer on the pleading. The board found respondent\u2019s argument \u201ccertainly worthy of consideration\u201d but nevertheless found that the filing of a wrongful-death action required approval of the administrator or executor of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 25} Precedent following <em>Douglas </em>and <em>Burwell, </em>however, suggests otherwise. In <em>Kyes v. Pennsylvania RR. Co. </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 362, 363, 49 O.O. 239, 109 N.E.2d 503, for example, a trial court permitted the substitution of the administrator, who lived in Pennsylvania, as the named plaintiff after the ancillary administrator failed to qualify, even though the two-year statute of limitations for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>a wrongful-death suit had passed. Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the case as time-barred, this court quoted the first syllabus paragraph in <em>Douglas </em>and then noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cIn the opinions in the <em>Wolf </em>and <em>Douglas cases, supra, </em>it is observed that under the provisions of the statute it is not even necessary that the representative <em>bring </em>the action. The requirement is merely that the action be brought in his <em>name.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) <em>Kyes, </em>158 Ohio St. at 365, 49 O.O. 239, 109 N.E.2d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 27} More recently, the rule was discussed in <em>In re Estate of Ross </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 395, 400, 583 N.E.2d 1379:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cR.C. 2125.02(A) provides that a wrongful death action \u2018shall\u2019 be brought in the name of the deceased\u2019s personal representative. This and similar language has been interpreted to mean that only the personal representative has the legal capacity to sue under this statutory cause of action. <em>Moss v. Hirzel Canning Co. </em>(1955), 100 Ohio App. 509, 60 O.O. 397, 137 N.E.2d 440. If the action is brought by the beneficiaries, it must be dismissed or the correct party substituted. <em>Sabol v. Pekoc </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 545, 36 O.O. 182, 76 N.E.2d 84. Usually, the personal representative is the executor or administrator of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cYet it is equally settled that the representative is a nominal party, unless he is also a beneficiary, and that the beneficiaries are the real parties in interest. <em>Kyes v. Pennsylvania Rd. Co. </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 362, 49 O.O. 239, 109 N.E.2d 503; <em>Burwell v. Maynard </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 108, 50 O.O.2d 268, 255 N.E.2d 628. Thus, it has been stated that the statute is satisfied if the action is merely brought in the representative\u2019s name, <em>Kyes, supra, </em>and that the name requirement was designed to avoid multiple actions for the same wrong. <em>Bur-well, supra.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">{\u00b6 30} This court again considered who may file a wrongful-death action under R.C. Chapter 2125 in <em>Ramsey v. Neiman </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 508, 634 N.E.2d 211. There, a decedent\u2019s father who had not been appointed administrator, executor, or other fiduciary of his daughter\u2019s estate argued that he qualified as the decedent\u2019s personal representative and had authority to sue for his daughter\u2019s wrongful death. Id. at 511, 634 N.E.2d 211. We first observed that R.C. 2125.02(A)(1) has \u201cremained virtually unchanged since the date the statute was originally enacted in 1851\u201d and that it was modeled after Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, passed by Parliament in 1846. Id. at 509-510, 634 N.E.2d 211. In creating a cause of action for wrongful death, Lord Campbell\u2019s Act authorized executors and administrators to bring the new action, providing:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c \u2018And be it enacted, That every such Action shall be for the Benefit of the Wife, Husband, Parent, and Child of the Person whose Death shall have been so caused, <em>and shall be brought by and in the Name of the Executor or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>Administrator of the Person deceased </em>* * *.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) 9 &amp; 10 Vict. Ch. 93, 86 Eng. Stat. at Large 531 * * <em>Ramsey, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 510, 634 N.E.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">{\u00b6 32} <em>Ramsey </em>thus held that the reference in R.C. 2125.02(A)(1) to a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d required \u201can executor or administrator, <em>ie., </em>an individual appointed by a court, to bring the cause of action.\u201d Id. at 510, 634 N.E.2d 211. This conclusion is consistent with the language in Lord Campbell\u2019s Act requiring that the wrongful-death action be brought <em>by and in the name </em>of the executor or administrator. But according to the concurring opinion, joined by three other justices, the lead opinion incorrectly construed the statute to \u201cmandate[ ] that the personal representative be appointed before he or she can enter the courthouse to file a wrongful death complaint.\u201d Id. at 513, 634 N.E.2d 211. As the opinion points out, this requirement is not specified anywhere in the statute:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThe language in R.C. 2125.02(A)(2) and 2125.02(C) indicates that the personal representative must be court-appointed after the complaint has been filed, but before any judgment is entered or any settlement is reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cSummary judgment would provide the appropriate mechanism to screen out those plaintiffs who have not received court appointment after filing their complaints. In the present case, the plaintiff was not appointed as the decedents\u2019 personal representative after he filed his complaint.\u201d Id. at 514, 634 N.E.2d 211 (Pfeifer, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 35} The <em>Ramsey </em>court distinguished <em>Douglas </em>and <em>Kyes </em>on the bases that the father in <em>Ramsey </em>had not been appointed administrator and the record did not show \u201cany attempt on his part to become appointed.\u201d 69 Ohio St.3d at 513, 634 N.E.2d 211. But here, respondent pursued the wrongful-death claim in the name of the proper party. The common pleas court initially granted respondent\u2019s motion to substitute his client for the administrator. And when the common pleas court reconsidered its authority to remove a probate-court-appointed fiduciary as the named party and reinstated the administrator as the plaintiff, respondent gave notice that he intended to petition the probate court to have his client appointed as a special administrator.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He did request that his client be named a special administrator, but the probate court denied the request, and as of the panel hearing, that decision was on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">{\u00b6 36} At least one court has even advocated filing a wrongful-death action in the name of the personal representative under the circumstances facing respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>dent and his client. In <em>Gottke v. Diebold, Inc. </em>(Aug. 9, 1990), Licking App. No. CA-3484, 1990 WL 120801, *1, a daughter filed suit against two defendants, alleging the -wrongful death of her mother and that she was the personal representative of her mother\u2019s estate. As in respondent\u2019s case, the probate-court-appointed executor opposed the claim. Id. The court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c[A]n action for wrongful death must be brought in the name of the personal representative of the decedent; Civ.R. 17 [precluding dismissal of actions not filed in the name of the real party in interest without allowing reasonable time after objection to permit ratification by or joinder or substitution of the real party] may not be used to, in effect, extend the applicable statute of limitations; and the doctrine of relation back does not apply where the plaintiff misrepresents his/her capacity, and fails to procure appointment within the time prescribed by the appropriate statute of limitations, or <em>file \u2018in the name of the personal representative. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 38} The court of appeals in <em>Gottke </em>affirmed the dismissal of the daughter\u2019s action as to both defendants because she filed the complaint in her own name and <em>not </em>in the name of the personal representative. Citing <em>Kyes, Wolf, </em>and <em>Douglas, </em>the court faulted the daughter for not taking the very action that respondent took to preserve his client\u2019s claim:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cAppellee correctly argues that rather than mislead the defendants and the court [the daughter] could have brought the action in the name of the actual fiduciary. That would have accomplished the statutory intent of focusing the response of the court and the adverse parties upon the probated estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cUnder the provisions of the statute it is not even necessary that the representative bring the action. The requirement is merely that the action be brought in his name.\u201d Id. at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">{\u00b6 41} In his zeal to file a complaint \u201cin the name\u201d of this decedent\u2019s personal representative, respondent did initially represent himself to be the plaintiff-administrator\u2019s lawyer on the pleading. This discrepancy, however, is not the focus of either relator\u2019s complaint or the board\u2019s report. Moreover, little harm came of his mistake, inasmuch as the client notified the decedent\u2019s guardian the day after the suit was filed that he had retained respondent, and respondent properly identified himself as his client\u2019s lawyer in later filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">{\u00b6 42} In any event, we need not decide here whether respondent correctly interpreted precedent. As stated in Prof.Cond.R. 3.1, lawyers are permitted to advance claims and defenses for which \u201cthere is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d And under DR 7-102(A)(2), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>predecessor to Prof.Cond.R. 3.1, a lawyer could not \u201c[kjnowingly advance a claim or defense that is unwarranted under existing law\u201d; however, the lawyer could \u201cadvance such claim or defense if it can be supported by good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZz0\">Jonathan B. Cherry, Bar Counsel, Yvonne Tertel, and Paul D. Giha, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A-C\">Kerger <em>&amp; </em>Hartman, L.L.C., and Richard M. Kerger, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">. {\u00b6 43} The comment to Prof.Cond.R. 3.1 embellishes these standards:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c[1] The advocate has a duty to use legal procedure for the fullest benefit of the client\u2019s cause, but also a duty not to abuse legal procedure. The law, both procedural and substantive, establishes the limits within which an advocate may proceed. However, the law is not always clear and never is static. Accordingly, in determining the proper scope of advocacy, account must be taken of the law\u2019s ambiguities and potential for change.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c[2] The filing of an action or defense or similar action taken for a client is not frivolous merely because the facts have not first been fully substantiated or because the lawyer expects to develop vital evidence only by discovery. What is required of lawyers, however, is that they inform themselves about the facts of their clients\u2019 cases and the applicable law and determine that they can make good faith arguments in support of their clients\u2019 positions. Such action is not frivolous even though the lawyer believes that the client\u2019s position ultimately will not prevail. The action is frivolous, however, if the lawyer is unable either to make a good faith argument on the merits of the action taken or to support the action taken by a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 46} Respondent\u2019s strategy may have been flawed, but the fact that he had some arguably viable legal support for his actions is enough to avoid disciplinary sanction.
