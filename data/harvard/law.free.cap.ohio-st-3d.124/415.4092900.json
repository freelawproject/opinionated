Kellogg-Martin of Bellefontaine, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0022083, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1984. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline found that respondent had violated the former Code of Professional Responsibility by failing to disclose, and by making false statements about, potentially exculpatory or mitigating evidence during a criminal prosecution. The board recommends that we suspend respondent from practice for one year, but conditionally stay the last six months of the suspension. Respondent objects to the board\u2019s findings and recommendation. Because we find that several objections have merit and that respondent\u2019s acts and omissions did not constitute professional misconduct, we dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The Disciplinary Proceedings against Respondent</p>\n<p id=\"A-nY\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, the Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent in a single-count complaint with violating DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), 7-102(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer, in the representation of a client, from concealing or knowingly failing to disclose that which she is required by law to reveal), and 7-103(B) (requiring a prosecutor to make timely disclosure to defense counsel of the existence of evidence known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigates the degree of the offense, or reduces the punishment). A panel of the board heard the case, including the parties\u2019 stipulations, and found the disciplinary violations alleged in the complaint. The panel recommended a six-month suspension with the entire six months to be stayed. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, but recommended a one-year suspension with six months stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 3} The following facts were established at the disciplinary hearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent was the chief assistant prosecuting attorney of Logan County. In 2002, she was assigned to prosecute criminal charges against Joshua Giles. These charges were based upon a young girl\u2019s allegations that Giles had forced her to have sex on two separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">{\u00b6 5} In June 2002, the victim, then 14 years old, was in counseling for behavioral problems. During a counseling session, she told her therapist that Giles had twice pressured her into sexual intercourse. Her therapist reported the allegation, as is required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">{\u00b6 6} On June 12, 2002, Jo Ann Dorsey, a Logan County Children Services (\u201cLCCS\u201d) social worker, interviewed the victim. Later that day, Dorsey wrote a narrative report of the interview (\u201cthe Dorsey report\u201d). According to the Dorsey report, with respect to the crucial fact of the victim\u2019s age, the victim stated that the first rape had been committed at the home of a friend of the victim in August 2001 and that the second rape had been committed at the residence of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u201cHaddy\u201d in September 2001. The victim\u2019s date of birth was January 21, 1988. Thus, Dorsey\u2019s initial account of the victim\u2019s statements implied that the victim was 13 years old at the time she was raped. On July 19, 2002, however, Dorsey filled out a form called the \u201cFamily Risk Assessment Matrix.\u201d On this form, Dorsey stated that the victim \u201creported she was raped by a 21 year old man when she was 12 years old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">{\u00b6 7} On June 13, 2002, Dorsey faxed a copy of her report to Detective Sergeant Jeff Cooper in the Logan County Sheriffs Office. Cooper interviewed Giles the same day, and Giles admitted having sex with the victim at her friend\u2019s house. Giles said this had happened a \u201cvery long\u201d time ago, around the \u201c[e]nd of 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">{\u00b6 8} Cooper and another officer interviewed the victim on July 3, 2002. According to Cooper\u2019s narrative report (\u201cthe Cooper report\u201d), the victim told the officers that \u201cshe had intercourse with [Giles] on two occasions * * * when she was twelve years old.\u201d The Cooper report also states that the victim \u201cstated that she did not tell [Giles] to stop or try to fight him during the incidents of intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">{\u00b6 9} The discrepancy between Dorsey\u2019s June 12 report that the victim was 13 and the other information that she was 12 prompted respondent to seek further confirmation of the victim\u2019s age before filing criminal charges. Respondent therefore interviewed the victim personally. During the interview, the victim stated that before one of the rapes, she had informed Giles that she was 12. The victim also told respondent that she had been in a snowmobile accident and that the rapes had occurred the summer <em>before </em>that accident. After the interview, respondent checked the victim\u2019s hospital records. These confirmed that the snowmobile accident had taken place in December 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent also interviewed the victim\u2019s mother. From this interview, respondent learned that the victim had told her mother about being raped. The victim\u2019s mother told respondent that the victim had been 12 at the time of that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 11} On August 28, 2002, the victim told her therapist that one of the sexual acts had occurred on a Labor Day weekend \u201cwhen she was 12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">{\u00b6 12} Giles was ultimately indicted on four counts of raping a person under the age of 13, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), and two counts of raping a person under the age of 13 by force or threat of force, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and 2907.02(A)(2). Each of these charges required the prosecution to prove that the victim was younger than 13 at the time of the alleged rapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">{\u00b6 13} After Giles was indicted, his attorney filed a discovery demand requesting, inter alia, \u201call evidence, known or which may become known to the Prosecut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ing Attorney, favorable to defendant, and material either to the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\u201d Respondent did not provide defense counsel with copies of either the Dorsey report regarding the age statement or the Cooper report concerning consent. Respondent later testified that she believed she did not have a duty under Crim.R. 16 or <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, to turn these reports over to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">{\u00b6 14} On September 23, 2002, respondent filed a bill of particulars in the Giles prosecution. The bill contained the following statement: \u201cThe victim was interviewed by Joanie Dorsey of Logan County Children\u2019s Services on June 12, 2002. She reported that the Defendant raped her on two occasions over the summer of 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">{\u00b6 15} On December 18, 2002, Giles entered a plea of guilty to a reduced charge of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, R.C. 2907.04(A). At the hearing, respondent delivered a statement of what \u201c[t]he State\u2019s evidence in this case would show.\u201d During this statement, respondent said: \u201cThe victim was interviewed by Joanie Dorsey of the Logan County Children\u2019s Services on June 12, 2002. She reported what had taken place over the year of 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">{\u00b6 16} The board found that respondent had violated DR 7-103(B) and 7-102(A)(3) by failing to disclose the Dorsey and Cooper reports to the defense before Giles entered his guilty plea. The board further found that respondent\u2019s nondisclosure of the reports was prejudicial to the administration of justice and thus violated DR 1-102(A)(5). Finally, the board found that respondent\u2019s statements in the bill of particulars and the plea hearing were false and therefore violated DR 1-102(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Respondent\u2019s Objections to the Board\u2019s Report</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">{\u00b6 17} Respondent has filed seven objections to the board\u2019s report and recommendations. Her first five objections challenge the board\u2019s findings that she violated DR 7-103(B), 7-102(A)(3), and 1-102(A)(5) by failing to disclose the Dorsey and Cooper reports. Her sixth challenges the board\u2019s finding that she made false statements to the trial court in violation of DR 1~102(A)(4). Her seventh challenges the sanction recommended by the board. We begin our analysis with the issues raised by respondent\u2019s nondisclosure of the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">\n<em>Nondisclosure of the Dorsey and Cooper Reports</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">{\u00b6 18} DR 7-103(B) provides: \u201cA public prosecutor or other government lawyer in criminal litigation shall make timely disclosure to counsel for the defendant, or to the defendant if he has no counsel, of the existence of evidence, known to the prosecutor or other government lawyer, that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or reduce the punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Respondent\u2019s first two objections are related. In her first objection, she argues: \u201cIt cannot be the intent of the Code of Professional Responsibility * * * that a prosecutor\u2019s ethical duties are broader than her legal duties.\u201d Therefore, she contends, a prosecutor cannot violate DR 7-103(B) by failing to disclose evidence unless her failure to disclose also constitutes a violation of Crim.R. 16 or of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>supra. In her second objection, respondent contends that she had no legal duty to disclose the Dorsey and Cooper reports to the defense and hence that she committed no violation of DR 7-103(B) by failing to disclose them.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">{\u00b6 20} Relator, on the other hand, contends that we should read DR 7-103(B) broadly, to require disclosure of evidence irrespective of whether its disclosure is legally required or not. Relator further contends that even if we reject relator\u2019s interpretation of DR 7-103(B), respondent\u2019s failure to disclose the reports did in fact violate <em>Brady </em>and Crim.R. 16 and therefore still constituted a violation of DR 7-103(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">{\u00b6 21} We decline to construe DR 7-103(B) as requiring a greater scope of disclosure than <em>Brady </em>and Crim.R. 16 require. Relator\u2019s broad interpretation of DR 7 \u2014 103(B) would threaten prosecutors with professional discipline for failing to disclose evidence even when the applicable law does <em>not </em>require disclosure. This holding would in effect expand the scope of discovery currently required of prosecutors in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 22} For this reason, we hold that DR 7-103(B) imposes no requirement on a prosecutor to disclose information that he or she is not required to disclose by applicable law, such as <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>or Crim.R. 16. Accordingly, we sustain respondent\u2019s first objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 23} In respondent\u2019s second objection, she contends that she had no duty to disclose the Dorsey and Cooper reports to the defense. Therefore, she contends, her failure to do so did not violate DR 7-103(B). In the circumstances of this case, we agree with respondent\u2019s contention that she had no duty to disclose the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process when the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Likewise, Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) requires that a prosecutor disclose to counsel for the defendant all evidence, known or which may become known to the prosecuting attorney, favorable to the defendant and material either to guilt or punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">{\u00b6 25} However, in <em>United States v. Ruiz </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 622, 633, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>tion does not require the Government to disclose material impeachment evidence prior to entering a plea agreement with a criminal defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">{\u00b6 26} The Dorsey and Cooper reports constituted impeachment evidence. Had the case against Giles gone to trial, the defense could not have introduced the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements to Dorsey and Cooper to prove the truth of the matters asserted in those statements (i.e., that the rapes occurred in 2001 or that the victim did not offer resistance). See generally Evid.R. 801(C) and 802. Thus, the defense could have used the victim\u2019s statements only to impeach her testimony at trial with respect to these matters. See generally Evid.R. 613 (impeachment by self-contradiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 27} Relator\u2019s efforts to distinguish <em>Ruiz </em>are unpersuasive. Relator argues that \u201cthe focus in this case is <em>not </em>on the validity of Giles\u2019 plea agreement, the focus is on evidence withheld by respondent <em>before </em>Giles decided to plead guilty.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Relator\u2019s observation is true, but irrelevant. This case is indeed about the \u201cevidence withheld by respondent.\u201d But the question before us is whether respondent had any obligation to disclose that evidence before Giles entered his guilty plea. <em>Ruiz </em>answers that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6 28} Next, relator points out that Giles, unlike the defendant in <em>Ruiz, </em>\u201cwas not asked to sign any type of waiver of his right to receive \u2018impeachment information relating to any informants or other witnesses\u2019 in exchange for favorable sentencing.\u201d It is true that the defendant in <em>Ruiz </em>was <em>asked </em>to specifically waive the right to receive impeachment information. That is, he was offered a plea bargain whose terms included a specific waiver of the right to receive impeachment information. But relator omits one critical fact: the defendant in <em>Ruiz refused </em>that bargain and later pleaded guilty <em>without </em>making any such specific waiver. 536 U.S. at 625-626, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586. The only waiver the defendant actually made in <em>Ruiz </em>was the same waiver that any criminal defendant \u2014 including <em>Giles </em>\u2014 necessarily makes by pleading guilty: \u201cWhen a defendant pleads guilty he or she, of course, forgoes not only a fair trial, but also other accompanying constitutional guarantees.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>536 U.S. at 628-629, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 29} <em>Ruiz </em>plainly holds that the state is not required to disclose impeachment evidence to a defendant before the defendant pleads guilty. Because Giles entered a guilty plea and never went to trial, respondent had no obligation to disclose the Dorsey and Cooper reports to him. We must therefore sustain respondent\u2019s second objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">{\u00b6 30} As we find that respondent did not violate DR 7-103(B), we need not determine whether, as she contends in her third objection, a finding of willfulness is a prerequisite to a finding of a DR 7-103(B) violation. Respondent\u2019s third objection is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Respondent\u2019s fourth objection challenges the board\u2019s finding that nondisclosure of the reports violated DR 7-102(A)(3). DR 7-102(A)(3) prohibits a lawyer\u2019s failure to disclose information that she is <em>required by law </em>to reveal. Under <em>Ruiz, </em>respondent had no obligation to disclose the Dorsey and Cooper reports to the defense. Accordingly, we sustain respondent\u2019s fourth objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">{\u00b6 32} Respondent\u2019s fifth objection challenges the board\u2019s finding that respondent engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of DR 1-102(A)(5). In finding that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(5), the board relied on the same evidence and analysis that underlay its findings that respondent violated DR 7-103(B) and 7-102(A)(3). Having rejected those findings, we must also reject the finding that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(5). We therefore sustain respondent\u2019s fifth objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">{\u00b6 33} Our decision today should not be construed as an endorsement of respondent\u2019s nondisclosure of the reports. \u201cBecause we are dealing with an inevitably imprecise standard, and because the significance of an item of evidence can seldom be predicted accurately until the entire record is complete, the prudent prosecutor will resolve doubtful questions in favor of disclosure.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 97, 108, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342. Nevertheless, we conclude that nondisclosure of the reports at issue here did not violate any Disciplinary Rule.-</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>The Claim that Respondent Made False Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">{\u00b6 34} In her sixth objection, respondent challenges the board\u2019s conclusion that she violated DR 1-102(A)(4). The board\u2019s conclusion was based on two statements respondent made in connection with the prosecution of Giles. First, the bill of particulars filed by respondent on September 23, 2002 states: \u201cThe victim was interviewed by Joanie Dorsey of Logan County Children\u2019s Services on June 12, 2002. <em>She reported </em>that the Defendant raped her on two occasions <em>over the summer of2000.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">{\u00b6 35} Second, at the plea hearing on December 18, 2002, respondent stated in open court: \u201cThe victim was interviewed by Joanie Dorsey of the Logan County Children\u2019s Services on June 12, 2002. <em>She reported </em>what had taken place <em>over the year of2000.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">{\u00b6 36} Relator contends that both statements were false, in that they misrepresented what the victim actually reported to Dorsey on June 12, 2002. Relator further contends that the alleged falsehoods must have been intentional, inasmuch as respondent was in possession of Dorsey\u2019s June 12, 2002 report stating that the victim had placed the sex acts in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">{\u00b6 37} We find that relator has failed to prove that respondent\u2019s statements in the bill of particulars and at the sentencing hearing were false. It is true that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Dorsey\u2019s narrative report of June 12, 2002, is inconsistent with respondent\u2019s statements. The Dorsey report states that the victim, when asked whether she had been raped \u201clast year,\u201d i.e., in 2001, said yes and that the victim \u201creports the first rape occurred in August 2001.\u201d But respondent\u2019s statements were not representations about what <em>Dorsey\u2019s report </em>said. They were representations about what the <em>victim </em>said to Dorsey on June 12, 2002. And the June 12 Dorsey report is not the only version of what the victim told Dorsey on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">{\u00b6 38} On June 19, 2002, Dorsey completed a \u201cFamily Risk Assessment Matrix\u201d form for the victim. Dorsey wrote on this form that the victim <em>\u201creported </em>she was raped by a 21 year old man <em>when she was 12 years old.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In the absence of any evidence that Dorsey interviewed the victim at any time other than June 12, 2002, we must conclude that the statement on the June 19 risk-assessment form refers to the victim\u2019s statements to Dorsey on June 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">{\u00b6 39} Thus, if Dorsey\u2019s statement on the June 19 risk-assessment form is correct, then so were respondent\u2019s statements about what the victim reported to Dorsey on June 12, 2002. Relator, who has the burden of persuasion, cites no evidence that supports Dorsey\u2019s June 12 version of the victim\u2019s statement as opposed to her June 19 version. Nor does the board\u2019s report cite any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">{\u00b6 40} Indeed, the evidence points the other way. The victim told her mother, her therapist, and Sergeant Cooper that she was 12 at the time of the alleged rapes. Respondent determined that further investigation was needed, so she interviewed the victim herself. Yet again, the victim\u2019s account indicated that she was 12 when Giles raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">{\u00b6 41} Given that <em>all </em>the victim\u2019s other statements were consistent as to when she was raped, we find it more likely than not that the June 19 risk-assessment form, and <em>not </em>the earlier Dorsey report, accurately reflected <em>what the victim told Dorsey </em>on June 12, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">{\u00b6 42} In sum, we find that respondent did not, either in the September 23, 2002 bill of particulars or during the December 18, 2002 plea hearing, engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. We therefore conclude that respondent did not violate DR 1-102(A)(4), and we accordingly sustain respondent\u2019s sixth objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">\n<em>The Proposed Sanction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">{\u00b6 43} Respondent\u2019s seventh objection is to the sanction recommended by the board. However, as relator has failed to prove any misconduct, this objection is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">{\u00b6 44} We find that relator has failed to establish that respondent violated the Disciplinary Rules she was charged with violating. Accordingly, we dismiss relator\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b603-6\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b603-7\">Moyer, C.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b603-8\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Adr\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">{\u00b6 45} I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. I disagree with the proposition that DR 7-103(B) is, or should be, limited by Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) and the corresponding constitutional analysis. The majority opinion disregards the plain language and purposes of the former Code of Professional Responsibility and the Rules of Criminal Procedure. Additionally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s inclination to reweigh the evidence in order to reject the board\u2019s finding of violations of DR 1-102(A)(4). I would adopt the sanction recommended by the board of a 12-month suspension with six months stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">The misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">{\u00b6 46} Respondent prosecuted a rape case in which the severity of the offenses was based upon the age of the victim. In evaluating the case for trial, respondent determined that overwhelming evidence supported her view that the crimes occurred in 2000, when the victim was 12 years old. However, respondent possessed two reports \u2014 one generated by the county\u2019s children services agency and one by the sheriffs office \u2014 both of which indicated that the victim had reported that the crimes occurred in 2001. Respondent, in her professional judgment and based upon her research, viewed the dates in these reports as inaccurate and therefore unreliable and concluded that the crimes had actually occurred in 2000, when the victim was 12 years old. Therefore, respondent elected to pursue charges for rape of a person under 13 years of age against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">{\u00b6 47} The defendant was charged with four counts of rape of a person under the age of 13 in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and two counts of rape of a person under the age of 13 by use of force or threat in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and (A)(2). All of the offenses were first-degree felonies. The R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) charges for rape of a person under 13 years of age carried potential sentences of three to ten years (under former R.C. 2929.14(A)(1)). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and (A)(2) charges for rape of a person under 13 years of age by force or threat carried life sentences (under former R.C. 2907.02(B)). Had the victim been 13 years of age, then the life sentence would not have been an available punishment and the longest sentence that the defendant would have faced would have been ten-year sentences for the remaining first-degree rape charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">{\u00b6 48} Thus, the age of the victim was relevant to the potential length of incarceration, with a maximum life sentence available if the victim was under 13 years of age. Moreover, the timeline of events was important to the state\u2019s case because in order to prove the crimes charged, the state needed to show that the offenses occurred in 2000, when the victim was 12 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">{\u00b6 49} In responding to the defendant\u2019s discovery request, respondent decided to withhold from the defendant the two reports containing the 2001 dates given by the victim. Later, in the bill of particulars, respondent described the two interviews of the victim but stated, without qualification, that the victim reported that she had been raped on two occasions in 2000. By implication, the bill of particulars asserted that the defense would not find any exculpatory material in the reports themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">{\u00b6 50} Respondent completed her gloss on the evidence at the defendant\u2019s plea hearing. During that hearing, respondent stated to the court that the victim had been interviewed by a therapist and by a children\u2019s services employee and that the victim reported that the crimes occurred in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">{\u00b6 51} Thus, the defense did not have these reports to review and could not have noted the inconsistency between the dates in the reports and those inherent in the charges against him. Based on respondent\u2019s statements reported in the bill of particulars and at the plea hearing, the defendant had no reason to know that the reports contained information relating to his guilt on the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The effect of the majority decision</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">{\u00b6 52} Respondent was faced with inconsistent evidence, evidence that the defense could have used at the least to challenge the credibility of the victim and at the most to undermine the assertion regarding the victim\u2019s age in the charges against the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Yet she was obliged to respond to the defendant\u2019s discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>{\u00b6 53} In doing so, respondent chose to withhold the reports and not reveal the inconsistencies contained within them. Respondent did not provide the reports during discovery and misstated the contents of those reports in the bill of particulars and to the court during the plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">{\u00b6 54} Respondent admits that she knew of the inconsistencies in the reported statements of the victim with the timeline asserted by the state but claims that (1) the reports need not have been provided to the defense under the Code of Professional Responsibility because they were not subject to disclosure under Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) and <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, and (2) the statements in the bill of particulars and the statements made during the plea hearing did not constitute breaches of respondent\u2019s professional responsibilities, because she made the statements in good faith and in her professional judgment on the belief that the facts and evidence supported them.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">{\u00b6 55} The effect of the majority opinion is to adopt respondent\u2019s position on the obligations of a prosecutor. Thus, the prosecutor does not violate the Code of Professional Responsibility unless she has violated the defendant\u2019s fair-trial discovery rights under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution and the attendant Rules of Criminal Procedure. And the prosecutor may misrepresent the contents of relevant written reports to the defense and the court, so long as the misrepresentation does not rise to the level of a deprivation of constitutional rights and she misrepresents them in a way that is consistent with her good-faith view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">{\u00b6 56} The majority goes one step further and holds that so long as the case ends with a plea, DR 7-103(B) cannot be violated at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">{\u00b6 57} The board did not, and I too cannot, agree that the rules of professional conduct permit such an outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">DR 7-103(B) requires more of the prosecutor than the related rule of criminal procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">{\u00b6 58} The board found that respondent violated DR 7-103(B), 7-102(A), and 1-102(A)(5) by failing to disclose the two reports. The violations of DR 7-102(A) and 1-102(A)(5) flow from the finding of the board that respondent violated DR 7-103(B). Therefore, I limit my discussion to DR 7-103(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">{\u00b6 59} The majority holds that the disclosure requirements placed upon a prosecutor by DR 7-103(B) are limited in scope to the requirements of Crim.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>16(B)(1)(f). Accordingly, the majority holds that if Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) is not violated, then, a fortiori, DR 7-103(B) is not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">{\u00b6 60} Because the disciplinary rule differs from the related rule of criminal procedure in plain language and purpose, I disagree. I would hold that the disciplinary rule requires more of a prosecuting attorney than does the rule of criminal procedure. Such a holding would not require \u201copen discovery\u201d as the majority fears. Moreover, I find that <em>United States v. Ruiz </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 622, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586, does not control this case. <em>Ruiz </em>concerned the constitutional right to a fair trial and the waiver of that right by a defendant when he executed a plea; this case concerns the rules of conduct governing prosecutors when they possess evidence favorable to the defense. The holding of <em>Ruiz </em>has no bearing on the question of the professional conduct of a prosecuting attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>The plain language of DR 7-103(B) requires disclosure of the reports in this case because the reports are evidence \u201cthat tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or reduce the punishment.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 61} DR 7-103(B) states: \u201cA public prosecutor or other government lawyer in criminal litigation shall make timely disclosure to counsel for the defendant, or to the defendant if he has no counsel, of the existence of evidence, known to the prosecutor or other government lawyer, that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or reduce the punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">{\u00b6 62} Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) states: \u201cUpon motion of the defendant before trial the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to disclose to counsel for the defendant all evidence, known or which may become known to the prosecuting attorney, favorable to the defendant and material either to guilt or punishment.\u201d {\u00b6 63} The chief difference in these two rules is in their descriptions of the evidence subject to disclosure. Under Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f), the prosecuting attorney must disclose all evidence \u201cmaterial\u201d to guilt or punishment, whereas under DR 7-103(B), the prosecuting attorney must disclose all evidence \u201cthat tends to\u201d negate guilt or lessen the criminal consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">{\u00b6 64} Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) is a prophylactic rule, mirroring the rule explained in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>which describes the role of the Due Process Clause in ensuring that a defendant receives a fair trial by receiving all materially exculpatory evidence. 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (\u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">{\u00b6 65} The United States Supreme Court has considered the difference between the disclosure rule of <em>Brady, </em>which, like Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f), requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>disclosure of \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence, and AJBA model rules, which, like DR 7-103(B), require disclosure of evidence that \u201ctends to\u201d negate guilt or lessen the offense. <em>Kyles v. Whitley </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 419, 436-437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490. The court noted that \u201cthe rule in <em>[Brady </em>] requires less of the prosecution than the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, which call generally for prosecutorial disclosures of any evidence tending to exculpate or mitigate.\u201d Id. at 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490. The court also referred to ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8(d) (1984), which contains language similar to Ohio\u2019s current Prof.Cond.R. 3.8(d), the successor to DR 7-103(B). Thus, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that in some cases, rules governing the conduct of prosecuting attorneys may require greater disclosure of evidence favorable to the defense than the defendant would be entitled to under the Constitution alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">{\u00b6 66} By artificially constraining DR 7-103 to the scope of Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f), the majority has improperly added words to the rule. The word \u201cmaterial\u201d does not appear in DR 7-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 67} The question under DR 7-103(B), by its own terms, is whether the evidence is of the type \u201cthat tends to\u201d negate the defendant\u2019s guilt or lessen his offense or punishment. This finding can be made by relating the undisclosed evidence to the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">{\u00b6 68} In this case, the victim\u2019s inconsistent statements amount to evidence that \u201ctends to\u201d negate the guilt or lessen the level of the offense and the punishment under DR-7-103(B). The two undisclosed reports add some conflicting evidence, albeit very little, on the issue of the victim\u2019s age at the time the acts were committed \u2014 an element of the offense charged. According to these reports, the victim stated that the rapes occurred in 2001, which would mean that she was 13 years old and that therefore the defendant could not be convicted for rape of a 12-year-old. The defense should have been informed of the existence of this evidence in order to decide whether to attack the state\u2019s proffered timeline or at least impeach the victim\u2019s credibility. The evidence tended to negate the defendant\u2019s guilt and should have been disclosed under DR 7-103(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\n<em>A broad reading of DR 7-10S(B) will not result in \u201copen discovery.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">{\u00b6 69} The respondent claims that the result of a broad reading of DR 7-103(B) will be \u201copen discovery\u201d in criminal cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A prosecuting attorney must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>disclose all evidence tending to negate the defendant\u2019s guilt or lessen the offense or punishment under DR 7 \u2014 103(B). This has been the rule since this court adopted DR 7-103 almost 40 years ago. Any evidence that does not have such a tendency need not be disclosed. The premise of the rule is that fair trials in our system of criminal justice are more likely to occur when prosecutors do not play \u201chide the ball\u201d with defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 70} To the extent that policy considerations should play any role in our disposition of this case, I prefer the position of the court in <em>Kyles, </em>that disclosure is preferable in close cases, because \u201cit will tend to preserve the criminal trial, as distinct from the prosecutor\u2019s private deliberations, as the chosen forum for ascertaining the truth about criminal accusations.\u201d 514 U.S. at 440, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\n<em>DR 7-103(B) and Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) serve different purposes.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">{\u00b6 71} The purpose of Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) is to ensure that persons charged with a crime will receive a fair trial. <em>State v. Brown, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 55, 2007-Ohio-4837, 873 N.E.2d 858, \u00b6 40. The question for constitutional purposes is \u201cnot whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the [undisclosed] evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490. This fair-trial analysis, centering on the rights of the accused, has a different purpose than a rule of conduct describing professional responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">{\u00b6 72} The constitutional protection inscribed in Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) requires that the defendant is entitled to discovery of any favorable evidence that is \u201cmaterial\u201d to guilt or punishment. Materiality is determined by evaluating whether the evidence that was not disclosed before trial now casts a new light on the case and undermines the confidence in the jury verdict. <em>State v. Brown, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 55, 2007-Ohio-4837, 873 N.E.2d 858, \u00b6 40. This analysis requires a court to review the case against a defendant to determine whether \u201c \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 39, quoting <em>United States v. Bagley </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">{\u00b6 73} Although a materiality requirement may be in keeping with the fair-trial rights afforded to criminal defendants, it does not comport with DR 7-103(B). The word \u201cmaterial\u201d does not appear in DR 7-103(B); instead, the question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>whether the undisclosed evidence, standing alone, tends to negate the guilt of the accused. In view of the plain language of DR 7-103(B), the test announced by the majority, requiring a weighing of the evidence in an underlying criminal trial, is wholly inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">{\u00b6 74} The professional conduct of an attorney should not be based upon the quantum of evidence produced at a criminal trial, or whether a defendant pleads guilty, regardless of the attorney\u2019s conduct. Rather, the conduct of an attorney should be evaluated on the basis of her own actions. The true measure of whether her conduct comports with her professional obligations as an officer of the court is found in the Code of Professional Responsibility. A prosecutor\u2019s professional duty can be greater than simply observing the criminal rules. EC 7-13 extols the role of a prosecutor in these words: \u201cThe responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from that of the usual advocate; his duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">{\u00b6 75} The majority\u2019s observation that \u201c[o]ur decision today should not be construed as an endorsement of respondent\u2019s nondisclosure of the reports\u201d is a poor substitute for DR 7-103(B). Indeed, I fear that attorneys will pay greater heed to the majority\u2019s actual approach \u2014 \u201cno constitutional violation, no misconduct\u201d \u2014 and that will become the new measure of professionalism under DR 7-103 and its successor, Prof.Cond.R. 3.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\n<em>Even if we adopt a materiality requirement for DR 7-108(A), United States v. Ruiz is inapplicable to this case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">{\u00b6 76} Even if we could insert a materiality requirement into DR 7-103(B), the majority vastly overreaches by applying the evolving standards of <em>Brady </em>and Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) in the context of attorney discipline. The criminal rules are demonstrably unsuitable for use as rules governing attorney conduct. The ill fit is manifest in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">{\u00b6 77} Under the materiality standard of Crim.R. 16, evidence that goes to the credibility of the victim must be disclosed by the prosecutor, when the reliability of the victim is likely to be relevant to guilt. See <em>United States v. Ruiz </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 622, 628, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586, citing <em>Giglio v. United States </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104. The majority seems to concede this point. Nevertheless, the majority overlooks respondent\u2019s failure to disclose this evidence in this case, based upon the erroneous notion that <em>Ruiz </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">{\u00b6 78} <em>Ruiz </em>holds that a defendant who enters a guilty plea thereby waives the right to complain of certain constitutional errors. <em>Ruiz, </em>536 U.S. at 630, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586. This waiver includes a waiver of the fair-trial right to obtain material discovery from the prosecution. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>{\u00b6 79} The court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Ruiz </em>bears absolutely no relation to the issue of whether the prosecuting attorney has committed professional misconduct. Extending <em>Ruiz </em>into the area of attorney discipline is unwarranted, even if a materiality requirement is applied to DR 7-103(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">{\u00b6 80} When a defendant submits a discovery request and the prosecutor fails to produce favorable evidence that tends to negate guilt or lessen punishment, it is immaterial whether the defendant ultimately enters a plea agreement. If the prosecutor has committed misconduct along the way, a defendant\u2019s waiver of certain constitutional errors does not mitigate the prosecutor\u2019s professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4) by engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 81} Respondent, in communicating with the court, twice misrepresented the statements of the victim. In the bill of particulars, the respondent stated: \u201cThe victim was interviewed by [the Logan County Children\u2019s Services employee] on June 12, 2002. She reported that the Defendant raped her on two occasions over the summer of 2000.\u201d In fact, the victim reported that she had been raped in 2001, according to the reports. During the plea hearing, respondent stated, \u201cThe victim was interviewed by [the Logan County Children\u2019s Services employee] on June 12, 2002. She reported what had taken place over the year of 2000.\u201d Again, the victim actually reported dates in 2001, according to the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 82} The majority reweighs the evidence of the DR 1-102(A)(4) violations and concludes that the sanctions recommended by the panel and board should not be imposed. The majority determines that the relator has failed to prove that respondent\u2019s statements were false, because it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the interviewer misreported the dates actually communicated by the victim and because respondent was representing to the court what the victim said, not what the report said. None of these matters were considered in the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">{\u00b6 83} I would not reweigh the evidence considered by the board on this issue. While it is possible to construe respondent\u2019s comments as good-faith interpretations of the evidence in her possession, this does not change the fact that her statements appear intended to justify her decision to withhold discoverable evidence from the defendant. Indeed, the board was troubled by this as well. Respondent did not qualify her statements to the court; she simply presented her view of the evidence in the guise of the victim\u2019s own statements. Respondent\u2019s statements to the court served to ensure that the inconsistencies would remain in the prosecutor\u2019s office, and not in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">{\u00b6 84} I agree with the board that respondent\u2019s statements were false. I further agree that when coupled with the failure to disclose the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>reports, respondent\u2019s misrepresentations \u201cstrike at the very heart and soul of a fair trial.\u201d I am mindful of the prosecutor\u2019s high professional responsibilities. \u201cA prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate.\u201d Prof.Cond.R. 3.8, Official Comment 1. Therefore, I would adopt the board\u2019s findings that respondent violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9U\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Lori J.

The majority asserts that the statements were hearsay and could therefore be used by the defendant only to challenge the credibility of the declarant. However, that is not an issue before us. Further, the defense was not given the opportunity to explore the veracity of the statements and was denied the ability to pursue avenues of defense preparation that could have resulted. And the defense was not aware of the potential weaknesses in the state\u2019s case. Thus, it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>completely accurate to say that the only use for the reports of the victim\u2019s inconsistent statements would have been as impeachment evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-9\">.
