We deny the writ because (1) res judicata neither entitles relators to the requested extraordinary relief nor prevents the park district and its board of commissioners from raising defenses that they did not raise in a previous mandamus action involving different relators and (2) the statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.09(E) bars relators\u2019 takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">{\u00b6 2} The historical background of the property involved and the previous litigation regarding the property are essential to understanding the posture of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">\n<em>A. History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-16\">1. The Canal Company and the Railroad Lease</p>\n<p id=\"AoAX\">{\u00b6 3} In 1827, the General Assembly chartered the Milan Canal Company to construct and operate a canal from Milan, Ohio, to the Huron River. The act incorporating the canal company gave it authority \u201cto enter upon, and take possession of any lands, waters and streams necessary to make said canal\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>provided that \u201ca complete title to the premises, to the extent and for the purposes set forth in or contemplated by this act, shall be thereby vested and forever remain in said company, and their successors.\u201d Section 8, Act of January 24, 1827, 25th General Assembly, Ohio Laws 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 4} Noncontiguous tracts of land from Ebeneser Merry and Kneeland Townsend were acquired by the canal company as part of the canal corridor. In 1881, the canal company entered into a 99-year lease with the Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie Railway Company for a 150-foob-wide right-of-way to construct and operate a railroad. The lease was renewed in 1980 for another 99 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 5} The canal company was dissolved in 1904, and its property interests devolved to a testamentary trust and its trustee, Key Trust Company of Ohio. The dissolution order specified that the canal company owned land \u201cwithin the bounds of a strip of land one hundred and fifty feet in width, commencing at the southerly end of the canal basin of said Milan Canal Company * * * and running thence in a northerly direction to the mouth of the Huron River, * * * the east and west lines of said strip of land being one hundred and fifty feet apart and running north parallel with each other and with the central line of said railroad, as surveyed, located and being constructed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 6} Rail traffic on the leased property ceased in the 1980s, and portions of the rail line were paved. In 1995, the railroad company\u2019s successor quitclaimed its interests to respondent Board of Commissioners of Erie MetroParks, a park district created pursuant to R.C. 1545.01 et seq. The board acquired the property to build a recreational trail.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">2. Relators\u2019 Acquisition of Canal Company Property</p>\n<p id=\"AAa\">{\u00b6 7} In February 2000, Key Trust conveyed a portion of the canal company property to relators Richard and Carol Rinella. Key Trust conveyed the remaining property owned by the canal company to Edwin and Lisa Coles and Buffalo Prairie, Ltd., a limited-liability company of which Edwin Coles serves as president. Sections of the canal company property were then conveyed to others, including relators Gerald O.E. Nickoli and Robin L.B. Nickoli; trustee Patricia A. Sipp (f.k.a. Charville), as to an undivided half interest, and successor trustees Patricia A. Sipp, Mark Charville, and David A. Charville, as to an undivided half interest (\u201cCharville trusts\u201d); Douglas Hildebrand; Dale A. Hohler and Ellen H. Hohler; Theresa R. Johnston; cotrustees John F. Landoll and Virginia A. Landoll; Michael P. Meyer and Cheryl Lyons; Donna J. Rasnick; Maria Sperling; Gary R. Steiner and Virginia M. Steiner; and Rita M. Beverick.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">3. Huron River Greenway</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">{\u00b6 8} By the end of 1998, respondent Erie MetroParks had started construction of a recreational trail known as the Huron River Greenway through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>corridor, which is a 66-fooh-wide path. The trail was opened to the public in 2003. The former canal corridor runs through each relator\u2019s property; the recreational trail is thus located within relators\u2019 properties. None of relators\u2019 property, aside from a .9-acre piece of the Charville trusts\u2019 property within the Townsend tract, is within the Merry or Townsend tracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">\n<em>B. Litigation Involving Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 9} In 1999, the Erie MetroParks Board of Commissioners initiated a declaratory-judgment action in the Erie County Court of Common Pleas against Key Trust. In 2000, the board filed an amended complaint for declaratory judgment that added those property owners, including most of the relators in this case, who may have received Key Trust\u2019s interests in the former canal-company property. The common pleas court entered a judgment finding that the property leased by the railroad consisted solely of the Merry and Townsend properties but that the lease was void because it had been breached by a predecessor in interest to the board of park commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 10} On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the common pleas court insofar as it found that the railroad lease was limited to the land obtained by the canal company from Merry and Townsend. <em>Erie Metroparks Bd. of Commrs. v. Key Trust Co. of Ohio, N.A. </em>(2001), 145 Ohio App.3d 782, 787-788, 764 N.E.2d 509. The court of appeals held that the trial court had, however, erred by concluding that the board\u2019s predecessor in interest had breached the railroad lease. Id. at 790, 764 N.E.2d 509. The court of appeals reversed that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment invalidating the lease and remanded the cause for further proceedings. Id. at 791, 764 N.E.2d 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 11} On remand, the common pleas court held that the lessee had not abandoned the leased property, that the lease is in full force and effect, that the board of park commissioners is the current lessee and the holder of the lessee\u2019s rights under the lease, that the board is entitled to the sole occupancy and use of the leased property, that the rights of the defendants \u2014 including most of the relators here \u2014 are subject to the board\u2019s rights under the lease, and that the lease permitted the board to improve and use the leased property as a parkway or recreational trail. The trial court further concluded that the extent of the leased property was limited to the Merry and Townsend tracts conveyed to the canal company.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 12} In an appeal from the common pleas court\u2019s judgment on remand, the defendants, including most of the relators here, asserted that the portion of the judgment describing the leased property differed from a prior description, which had restricted the leased property to the Merry and Townsend parcels. The court of appeals rejected this contention by holding that the judgment on remand did not contradict the finding in the previous judgment entries \u201cthat the leased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>property encompassed only land obtained from Townsend and Merry.\u201d <em>Erie Metroparks Bd. of Commrs. v. Key Trust Co. of Ohio, </em>Erie App. Nos. E-02-009 and E-02-011, 2002-Ohio-4827, 2002 WL 31054032, \u00b6 22. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">1.Federal Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 13} In 2003, the Coleses, Buffalo Prairie, and certain other landowners filed a civil-rights action in federal district court under Sections 1983, 1985(2), and 1985(3), Title 42, U.S.Code, against the board and its director-secretary for violations of their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>Coles v. Granville </em>(Jan. 24, 2005), N.D.Ohio No. 3:03 CV 7595, 2005 WL 139137. They alleged that in developing the recreational trail, the board asserted entitlement to property beyond that found to be covered by the railroad lease in the <em>Key Trust </em>cases. The federal district court dismissed the case and determined that, as a federal court, it was barred from reviewing the state court\u2019s findings. Id. at *4. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action for unconstitutional takings was not ripe for federal review when they had not brought a state action in mandamus to compel appropriation proceedings. <em>Coles v. Granville </em>(C.A.6, 2006), 448 F.3d 853, 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">2.First Mandamus Case</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 14} Shortly after the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Coles, </em>the Coleses, Buffalo Prairie, and certain other property owners who are successors to the canal-company property \u2014 but not including the relators in the present mandamus case \u2014 filed an action in this court for a writ of mandamus to compel the board of park commissioners and its director-secretary to either (1) commence an appropriation proceeding to compensate them for the board\u2019s taking of their property or (2) relinquish the seized property and direct the park district not to file an eminent-domain action to appropriate their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 15} In November 2007, we granted a writ of mandamus to compel the board to commence an appropriation proceeding to compensate the property owners for an involuntary taking of their property. <em>State ex rel. Coles v. Granville, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 231, 2007-Ohio-6057, 877 N.E.2d 968, \u00b6 59. We found that the property owners had \u201cestablished that by employing their private property for public use as a recreational trail, the board of park commissioners has taken their property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">3.Second Mandamus Case</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">{\u00b6 16} In January 2009, relators filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, Erie MetroParks and its board of commissioners, to \u201ciniti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ate, within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the Writ, appropriation proceedings\u201d pursuant to R.C. Chapter 163. After the park district and its board filed an answer and motion for judgment on the pleadings, we granted an alternative writ. Respondents filed an amended answer raising a statute-of-limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">{\u00b6 17} The parties have now filed evidence and briefs. We granted relators the Holders\u2019 application to dismiss their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 18} The parties have also filed motions for leave to supplement their evidence. For the parties\u2019 initial motions, because they are unopposed and neither side claims prejudice from their consideration by the court, we grant the motions. We also grant relators\u2019 July 30 motion for leave to supplement their evidence because we find that the proffered evidence is pertinent to their mandamus claim and relators could not have been submitted it at the time that their evidence was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 19} This case is now before us for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">\n<em>A. Res Judicata</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 20} We must first determine whether \u2014 as relators <em>claim </em>\u2014 Coles and the <em>Key Trust </em>litigation bar the park district and its board from raising these defenses and entitles relators to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">{\u00b6 21} In Ohio, \u201c[t]he doctrine of res judicata encompasses the two related concepts of claim preclusion, also known as res judicata or estoppel by judgment, and issue preclusion, also known as collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>O\u2019Nesti v. DeBartolo Realty Corp., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 59, 2007-Ohio-1102, 862 N.E.2d 803, \u00b6 6. \u201cClaim preclusion prevents subsequent actions, by the same parties or their privies, based upon any claim arising out of a transaction that was the subject matter of a previous action,\u201d whereas issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, \u201cprecludes the relitigation, in a second action, of an issue that had been actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action that was based on a different cause of action.\u201d <em>Ft. Frye Teachers Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 392, 395, 692 N.E.2d 140; see <em>Holzemer v. Urbanski </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 129, 133, 712 N.E.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">{\u00b6 22} For res judicata to apply, \u201cone of the requirements is that the parties to the subsequent action must be identical to or in privity with those in the former action.\u201d <em>Kirkhart v. Keiper, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 377, 2004-Ohio-1496, 805 N.E.2d 1089, \u00b6 8. None of the relators in the <em>Coles </em>case is a party here, so the relators in the case now before us may rely on res judicata only if they are in privity with the <em>Coles </em>relators.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">{\u00b6 23} Relators are not in privity with the relators in <em>Coles. </em>They did not participate in <em>Coles </em>or have any control over that case. Cf. <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>Schachter v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 526, 2009-Ohio-1704, 905 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 36. Nor were Erie MetroParks and its board bound to apply the result in <em>Coles </em>to relators, who own different property from the property at issue in <em>Coles. </em>Id. at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">{\u00b6 24} Privity was not created simply because relators received their properties from the same transferors as the relators in <em>Coles </em>and owned property adjoining the property of the relators in <em>Coles. </em>See, e.g., <em>O\u2019Nesti, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 59, 2007-Ohio-1102, 862 N.E.2d 803, \u00b6 12, in which we held that the \u201crelationship between co-employees subject to the same employment-related contract, without more, does not establish privity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 25} This result comports with our admonition that \u201cthe use of offensive claim preclusion is generally disfavored.\u201d <em>O\u2019Nesti, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 59, 2007-Ohio-1102, 862 N.E.2d 803, \u00b6 17. \u201cOffensive claim preclusion involves a situation in which a plaintiff seeks to bar a defendant from raising any new defenses, while defensive claim preclusion includes any scenario in which a defendant seeks to completely bar relitigation of a claim already determined in a prior lawsuit.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 26} Therefore, because relators are not in privity with the relators in <em>Coles, </em>our judgment in the prior mandamus case does not bar Erie MetroParks and its board of commissioners from raising new defenses or entitle relators to the writ based on res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 27} Nor does the <em>Key Trust </em>litigation prevent the park district and its board from raising new defenses, e.g., the statute of limitations and lack of standing, that were not actually decided in the context of those declaratory-judgment proceedings. \u201cUnlike other judgments, * * * \u2018a declaratory judgment determines only what it actually decides and does not preclude other claims that might have been advanced.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Mora v. Wilkinson, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 272, 2005-Ohio-1509, 824 N.E.2d 1000, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Shemo v. Mayfield Hts. </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 59, 69, 765 N.E.2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\n<em>B. Statute of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 28} Erie MetroParks and its board of commissioners contend that the statute of limitations bars this mandamus action. In their amended answer, respondents raised the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense to relators\u2019 mandamus claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">{\u00b6 29} Under R.C. 2305.09(E),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an action for relief on the grounds of a physical or regulatory taking of real property must generally be brought within four years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>after the cause accrued. Although this provision was enacted after most of the property was acquired by relators, \u201c[a] period of limitations already running may also be shortened by the legislature\u201d as long as \u201ca period sufficiently long to allow a reasonable time to begin suit\u201d is allowed. See generally 1A Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain (3d Ed.2006) 4-74, Section 4.102[3] (recognizing this rule in takings cases); see also <em>Cook v. Matvejs </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 234, 237, 10 O.O.3d 384, 383 N.E.2d 601, and <em>Gregory v. Flowers </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 48, 54, 61 O.O.2d 295, 290 N.E.2d 181, applying this rule in tort and workers\u2019 compensation cases. Respondents claim that relators failed to institute this mandamus action within the applicable four-year period when the taking had occurred at the latest by 2003, the year that the recreational trail was first opened to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">{\u00b6 30} As previously noted, R.C. 2305.09(E) requires that an action \u201c[fjor relief on the grounds of a physical or regulatory taking of real property\u201d shall be brought \u201cwithin four years after the cause of action thereof accrued.\u201d No matter which date is chosen as the date when this cause of action accrued, the four-year statute of limitations had run and was a bar to a lawsuit sounding in eminent domain. In 1995, Erie MetroParks entered into a written agreement to purchase the former railroad-corridor property. In November of that year, Erie Metro-Parks, under its rules and regulations, declared the property to be a \u201cclosed area\u201d open only to park employees and certain other authorized persons and threatened all others with a fine of up to $500 for a violation of its rule. By the end of 1998, according to its executive director, Erie MetroParks \u201coccupied, possessed, used and exercised exclusive dominion and control over the Real Estate.\u201d And in 2003, the Huron River Greenway was opened to the public. Relators did not file their takings claim until January 2009, more than four years after any one of these dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 31} Relators claim that based on the \u201ccontinuous-violation doctrine,\u201d R.C. 2305.09(E) does not bar relators\u2019 mandamus action. In examining the doctrine of continuous violation to determine whether a statute of limitations barred a claim under the Clean Air Act, Section 7401 et seq., Title 42, U.S.Code, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit first observed that \u201c \u2018[cjourts have been extremely reluctant to apply this doctrine outside the context of Title VIL\u2019 \u201d <em>Natl. Parks Conservation Assn., Inc. v. Tennessee Valley Auth. </em>(C.A.6, 2007), 480 F.3d 410, 416, quoting <em>LRL Properties v. Portage Metro Hous. Auth. </em>(C.A.6, 1995), 55 F.3d 1097, 1105, fn. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 32} And in refusing to apply the doctrine in the context of a takings claim, the Sixth Circuit has noted that it distinguished continuing violations from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>continuing effects of prior violations: \u201c \u2018[T]he present effects of past [violations] * * * do not trigger a continuing violations exception.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Midland, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(C.A.6, 2008), 286 Fed.Appx. 905, 912, quoting <em>Tenenbaum v. Caldera </em>(C.A.6, 2002), 45 Fed.Appx. 416, 419. The court explained further that \u201c \u2018[a] continuing violation is occasioned by continual unlawful acts, not continual ill effects from an original violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Broom v. Strickland </em>(C.A.6, 2009), 579 F.3d 553, 555, quoting <em>Ward v. Caulk </em>(C.A.9, 1981), 650 F.2d 1144, 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 33} Even if we accept the idea that a continuous violation may toll the statute in certain takings cases, the evidence here establishes that the claimed interference with relators\u2019 property rights emanates from <em>one event </em>\u2014 Erie MetroParks\u2019 construction of the recreational trail \u2014 which was completed at the latest by 2003, when the trail was officially opened to the public. Every event that has occurred after the trail was opened was merely a continuation of the effects of that solitary event rather than the occurrence of new discrete acts. That is, relators\u2019 property interests were not further materially damaged after 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 34} A \u201ccause of action against the government has \u2018first accrued\u2019 only when all the events which fix the government\u2019s alleged liability have occurred and the plaintiff was or should have been aware of their existence.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>Hopland Band of Pomo Indians v. United States </em>(Fed.Cir.1988), 855 F.2d 1573, 1577; see also <em>United States v. Dickinson </em>(1947), 331 U.S. 745, 749, 67 S.Ct. 1382, 91 L.Ed. 1789 (\u201cwhen the Government chooses not to condemn land but to bring about a taking by a continuing process of physical events, the owner is not required to resort either to piecemeal or to premature litigation to ascertain the just compensation for what is really \u2018taken\u2019 \u201d). Here, the events that constituted the alleged taking of relators\u2019 properties were completed at the latest by 2003, when the recreational trail was opened to the public. Relators either were or should have been aware of this. The taking occurred in 2003, and any further actions by Erie MetroParks in asserting control over the recreational trail afterwards merely continued the effects of that taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 35} The relators\u2019 request, in effect, seeks a ruling that the recreational trail constitutes a continued taking until the respondents\u2019 decision to open the trail to the public is reversed. If we were to adopt this position, we would eviscerate the statute of limitations, which would be an untenable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 36} As the Sixth Circuit noted in rejecting a comparable takings claim, \u201cIf this court were to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 theory that a taking is continuous until it is reversed, then all takings would constitute \u2018continuing violations,\u2019 tolling the statute of limitations. There would effectively be no statute of limitations, and the plaintiffs\u2019 theory could easily be extended to many other violations outside the takings context. This is not the law.\u201d <em>Ohio Midland, </em>286 Fed.Appx. at 913; see also <em>Painesville Mini Storage, Inc. v. Painesville, </em>Lake App. No. 2008-L-092, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>2009-Ohio-3656, 2009 WL 2217553, \u00b6 32 (rejecting application of continuing-violations doctrine to takings claim because \u201cthe extent of the damages stemming from the alleged taking, i.e., the decrease in the value of its real property interests, was complete as soon as the roadway on the tract was no longer accessible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">{\u00b6 37} Therefore, the continuing-violations doctrine does not toll the application of the statute of limitations here, and R.C. 2305.09(E) bars relators\u2019 mandamus claim because it was not brought within four years after the recreational trail was opened to the public in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 38} Res judicata does not entitle relators to the requested relief or prevent the park district and its board of commissioners from raising defenses that they did not raise in the previous mandamus action involving different relators. Moreover, the statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.09(E), which is one of the defenses raised in this case, bars relators\u2019 takings claim. Therefore, we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 39} We need not address the parties\u2019 other claims, e.g., lack of standing, ownership of the property, judicial estoppel, and abandonment by the railway of its right-of-way, which are rendered moot as a result of our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-10\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, Sadler, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b637-11\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b637-12\">Lisa L.

I dissent because there has been a continuous violation, which tolls the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">{\u00b6 42} The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has recognized a continuous-violation doctrine that tolls the running of the statute of limitations. See <em>Hensley v. Columbus </em>(C.A.6, 2009), 557 F.3d 693, 697. The majority opinion correctly notes that \u201ccourts have been extremely reluctant to apply this doctrine outside the context of Title VII,\u201d <em>LRL Properties v. Portage Metro Hous. Auth. </em>(C.A.6, 1995), 55 F.3d 1097, 1105, fn. 3, but without acknowledging that \u201c[n]o opinion has articulated a principled reason why the continuing-violation doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>should be limited to claims for deprivations of civil rights and employment discrimination.\u201d <em>Natl. Parks Conservation Assn., Inc. v. Tennessee Valley Auth. </em>(C.A.6, 2007), 480 F.3d 410, 416-417. I would apply the continuing-violation doctrine in this case. See <em>Kuhnle Bros., Inc. v. Geauga Cty. </em>(C.A.6, 1997), 103 F.3d 516 (discussing continuing-violation doctrine in case involving takings claim and due-process claims for deprivations of liberty and property).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">{\u00b6 43} A \u201c \u2018continuous violation\u2019 exists if: (1) the defendants engage in continuing wrongful conduct; (2) injury to the plaintiffs accrues continuously; and (3) had the defendants at any time ceased their wrongful conduct, further injury would have been avoided.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>557 F.3d at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 44} The evidence establishes that wrongful conduct has continued beyond the 2003 date when the recreational trail was opened to the public. For example, in 2005, Erie MetroParks installed permanent wooden benches on the properties of relators the Charville trusts and the Steiners and constructed a car turnaround on the Charville trusts\u2019 property; since November 2007, the park district has mowed, driven vehicles over, removed debris from, and otherwise exercised dominion and control over the portions of the trail on relators\u2019 properties; the park district installed a bulletin board and a sign on relator Meyer\u2019s property and signs on relators the Steiners\u2019 property; the park district has also applied herbicide on the trail to control weeds, which has harmed relator Hildebrand\u2019s organic produce farm; in 2008, the park district went through relators the Nickolis\u2019 property and removed trees that had fallen across part of the trail; also in 2008, the park district destroyed barricades erected by relator Johnston on her property; and in April 2009, the park district reopened the recreational trail on the Charville trusts\u2019 and Hildebrand\u2019s properties. It is beyond dispute that Erie MetroParks and its board of commissioners continue to exercise dominion and control over the portions of the trail on relators\u2019 private properties and continue to preclude relators from exercising control over those portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">{\u00b6 45} Second, as the previous examples establish, injury to relators continued to accrue after the recreational trail was opened to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 46} Third, if the park district and its board of commissioners ceased exercising control and stopped public use of the portion of the recreational trail on relators\u2019 property, further injury to relators could be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">{\u00b6 47} The majority erroneously relies on <em>Ohio Midland, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(C.A.6, 2008), 286 Fed.Appx. 905, and <em>Broom v. Strickland </em>(C.A.6, 2009), 579 F.3d 553, to hold that the continuing-violation doctrine is inapplicable here. In <em>Midland, </em>286 Fed.Appx. at 912-913, the court emphasized that its refusal to compel the Ohio Department of Transportation to rebuild a bridge ramp was based on the fact that one alleged constitutional violation had occurred rather than \u201ca series of repeated constitutional violations.\u201d In <em>Broom, </em>579 F.3d at 555-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>556, the inmate challenged the state\u2019s adoption of the lethal-injection protocol in death-penalty cases rather than continual unlawful acts. In contrast to these cases, relators have established that the park district and its board of commissioners have engaged in a series of discrete acts that have damaged relators\u2019 property in new and different ways than the opening of the trail to the public in 2003. Despite the various acts of wrongful conduct described above, the majority opinion concludes that \u201cthe claimed interference with relators\u2019 property rights emanate from <em>one event </em>\u2014 Erie MetroParks\u2019 construction of the recreational trail.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) That conclusion is not supported by the record.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3dW\">Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., Bruce L. Ingram, Joseph R. Miller, and Thomas H. Fusonie, for relators.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b639-10\">Porter, Wright, Morris &amp; Arthur, L.L.P., and Thomas A. Young; and Tomino &amp; Latchney, L.L.C., and John D. Latchney, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">{\u00b6 48} We have held that when a trespass is continuing rather than permanent, the expiration of the statute of limitations is tolled. <em>Sexton v. Mason, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 275, 2008-Ohio-858, 883 N.E.2d 1013, \u00b6 45, 54. A defendant\u2019s ongoing conduct or retention of control is dispositive. Id. at \u00b6 45. Here, the park district continues to exercise ongoing control over relators\u2019 property by maintaining the recreational trail, which indicates that the statute of limitations should be tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">{\u00b6 49} Applying a continuing-violations rule to toll the running of the statute of limitations would not render R.C. 2305.09(E) meaningless, as Erie MetroParks argues, because the statute would still apply in certain situations. For example, when a taking is temporary or has been completed, the limitations period of R.C. 2305.09(E) would not be tolled even under the continuing-violations doctrine. See, e.g., <em>Hensley, </em>557 F.3d at 697-698.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">{\u00b6 50} I conclude that R.C. 2305.09(E) does not bar relators\u2019 mandamus action. This court has long acknowledged that property rights \u201care among the most revered in our law and traditions\u201d and \u201cmust be trod upon lightly, no matter how great the weight of other forces.\u201d See <em>Norwood v. Horney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115, \u00b6 34 and 38, and cases cited therein. By ignoring this precedent here, the majority unfairly eviscerates these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">{\u00b6 51} Because relators have established that the board of park commissioners has taken their private property for public use as a recreational trial, they are entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel Erie MetroParks and its board to commence appropriations proceedings to compensate them for the taking. Because the majority does not so hold, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
