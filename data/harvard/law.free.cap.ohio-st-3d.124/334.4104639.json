Goodwin, received temporary total disability compensation from late 2004 through November 9, 2006. Appellant, Industrial Commission of Ohio, later learned that Goodwin worked for approximately one week in mid-June 2005. The commission vacated all 18 months of compensation that followed that employment and declared both fraud and overpayment. That decision is now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">{\u00b6 2} Goodwin strained his lower back in 2001 while working for Manco Real Estate Management, Inc. In April 2005, his workers\u2019 compensation claim was additionally allowed for lumbar stenosis. He requested temporary total disability compensation from November 1, 2004, through June 5, 2005, and submitted a C84 disability form from David Heuser, D.C. Based on the C84 and an independent medical review, Goodwin\u2019s request was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">{\u00b6 3} Throughout the summer, Goodwin participated in physical and vocational rehabilitation. It was not enough to permit a return to his former position of employment, although there is a notation in a June 21, 2005 physical therapy report that Goodwin \u201cworked 1 x at YMCA 6/6 \u2014 6/11/05,\u201d which the parties agree refers to a brief period of employment that is at the heart of this litigation. Goodwin was still physically unable to return to his former job in autumn, and a more comprehensive, year-long rehabilitation plan was proposed that would focus on work-hardening and alternative job-skills development. During this time, Dr. Heuser continued to certify Goodwin as temporarily and totally disabled, and based on these C84s, temporary total disability compensation was eventually paid through November 9, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In 2006, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation learned that Goodwin had been employed for one week at the YMCA in June 2005. Investigation revealed that Goodwin was paid $249.38 for 33 hours of work. According to his YMCA job description, Goodwin had been hired part-time as a weekend building supervisor. This was a light-duty job that primarily entailed opening and closing the building on weekends along with \u201csome light housekeeping or cleaning.\u201d Goodwin claims that he left the job because his injury prevented him from doing all of the required tasks, and the commission does not dispute this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">{\u00b6 5} The bureau\u2019s investigation unit recommended that temporary total disability compensation be declared overpaid from March 28, 2005, through July 5, 2005, and also asked for a finding of fraud. The March date corresponds to the date Goodwin completed the YMCA employment application. The latter date presumably comes from the June 13, 2005 C84 that certified temporary total disability from June 5, 2005, through July 5, 2005, the interval in which the period of employment fell.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 6} A commission district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) declared overpaid all temporary total disability compensation awarded after Goodwin\u2019s first day of YMCA employment \u2014 June 6, 2005, through November 9, 2006. In vacating the entire postemployment award, the hearing officer noted that each C84 submitted in support of temporary total disability compensation listed Goodwin\u2019s last date worked (\u201cLDW\u201d) as August 4, 2004, rather than June 2005. The district hearing officer was not persuaded that this was an inadvertent error but instead believed that it reflected a deliberate attempt to conceal the June 2005 employment. A staff hearing officer affirmed and reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 7} Goodwin filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. The court ruled in Goodwin\u2019s favor and ordered the commission to reinstate the entire award minus the amount Goodwin had received from the YMCA. The court noted that Goodwin did not receive his initial temporary total disability compensation check until after he had stopped working. It also rejected the commission\u2019s reliance on <em>State ex rel. Ellis v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 508, 751 N.E.2d 1015, as authority for vacating the entire award, and found instead that <em>State ex rel. Griffith v. Indus. Comm., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 479, 2006-Ohio-2992, 849 N.E.2d 28, controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 8} The commission now appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 9} Temporary total disability compensation cannot be paid over any period when a claimant has (1) been working, i.e., exchanging labor for pay, <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Ramirez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586, or (2) engaged in activities medically inconsistent with his or her purported inability to return to the former job, even if done for free, <em>State ex rel. Parma Community Gen. Hosp. v. Jankowski, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 340, 2002-Ohio-2336, 767 N.E.2d 1143. Goodwin does not contest his ineligibility for temporary total disability compensation during the week that he worked at the YMCA but disputes the commission\u2019s decision to vacate all temporary total disability compensation paid afterwards. Goodwin argues that he was entitled to that compensation because he was not working and unrefuted medical evidence corroborated his physical inability to return to his former job. The commission asserts that the wrong LDW appeared on every C84 submitted, which left each one irreparably tainted and Goodwin\u2019s temporary total disability compensation request medically unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 10} Two cases dominate discussion. The first is <em>Ellis, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 508, 751 N.E.2d 1015. In July 1997, Ellis requested temporary total disability compensation from January 31, 1997, through December 1, 1997. His C84 contained his doctor\u2019s statement that not only was Ellis unable to return to his former position of employment, he was incapable of all work. The C84 also contained Ellis\u2019s averment that he had not worked during the claimed period of disability. Based on that form and others like it, Ellis eventually received temporary total disability compensation through April 30,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 11} In August 1997, the bureau was tipped that Ellis was working, and an investigation confirmed full-time janitorial employment since January 31, 1997. Ellis resigned on December 1, 1997, after being confronted with the bureau\u2019s evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 12} The commission found fraud and vacated the entire award. Ellis objected, claiming that he should retain compensation from December 1, 1997, through April 30, 1998, because he did not work during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 13} We rejected that argument. We reasoned that regardless of whether Ellis actually worked from December 1, 1997, through April 30, 1998, the C84 that generated temporary total disability compensation was prepared while Ellis was still working. 92 Ohio St.3d at 512, 751 N.E.2d 1015. As a result, two key elements of the C84 were invalid: (1) Ellis\u2019s attestation that he was not, and had not been, working, and (2) his doctor\u2019s certification that he could do no work. Id. Because the commission was entitled to reject the C84 in its entirety, compensation over the postemployment period was medically unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The other case germane to this controversy is <em>Griffith, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 479, 2006-Ohio-2992, 849 N.E.2d 28. Griffith helped renovate a friend\u2019s auto body shop in November or early December 2001. Id. at \u00b6 3. Shortly after that job was done, Griffith was hurt at his regular full-time job. Id. at \u00b6 1. Griffith was medically released to light-duty work, but because his employer had no such work available, he applied for temporary total disability compensation. Id. His motion was granted, with temporary total disability compensation commencing as of December 17, 2001, to continue upon submission of medical proof. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">{\u00b6 15} Griffith\u2019s friend paid him $288 for the earlier renovation work. Id. at \u00b6 2. The friend later paid approximately the same amount for some miscellaneous light-duty errands that Griffith did for him over two weeks in January 2002. Id. When the bureau learned of these two payments, it asked the commission to declare an overpayment and fraud. Id. at \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 16} The commission found that Griffith worked for a portion of this period and retained the ability to continue with such work activity, but rather than vacating only the temporary total disability compensation that corresponded to the brief errand period, the commission vacated all of the temporary total disability compensation that was paid thereafter, even though Griffith had done no work over that time. Id. The commission based this decision on Griffith\u2019s purported \u201cability to continue with such [previous] work activity.\u201d Id. The commission, however, never stated whether that \u201cwork activity\u201d was inconsistent with the medical restrictions that prevented Griffith\u2019s return to his former position of employment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 17} We reversed that decision, stressing that there was no evidence that Griffith had engaged in any activity that was inconsistent with the medical restrictions that prevented him from returning to his former job. Id. at \u00b6 11. Consequently, those activities could not preclude temporary total disability compensation unless he had been paid for them. We concluded that Griffith could not retain temporary total disability compensation over the period that he had been paid, but that he was entitled to the balance of the award. Id. at \u00b6 10, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 18} In each case, there was a concurrent payment of wages and temporary total disability compensation, and at issue in each was the claimant\u2019s ability to retain previously paid temporary total disability compensation for periods after the conflicting employment ended. The commission contends that the salient distinction between <em>Griffith </em>and <em>Ellis </em>is that <em>Ellis </em>involved C84s that contained a material misrepresentation. The commission argues that the C84s in this case also contain a material misrepresentation \u2014 the wrong LDW \u2014 so <em>Ellis </em>should control. Goodwin asserts that his case does not involve the massive fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>perpetrated in <em>Ellis </em>but involves instead an isolated period of minimally remunerated employment similar to <em>Griffith </em>and that therefore <em>Griffith </em>should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 19} Goodwin has the stronger argument for two reasons. First, we are not persuaded that Goodwin\u2019s misrepresentation was \u201cmaterial.\u201d In <em>Ellis, </em>we affirmed that a finding of fraud requires not just a misrepresentation, but a <em>material </em>misrepresentation. \u201cMaterial\u201d facts are those \u201cfacts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 337, 340, 617 N.E.2d 1123. In <em>Ellis, </em>the claimant\u2019s misrepresentation that he was not working was material because the truth (1) would have precluded temporary total disability compensation as a matter of law and (2) discredited every C84 because every C84 indicated that Ellis was incapable of <em>all </em>work.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Ellis, </em>moreover, every misrepresentation was a <em>new </em>misrepresentation, as Ellis asserted with each new C84, <em>and over a changing time frame, </em>that he was not working. In this case, a new misrepresentation was not made on each C84. Instead, the same misrepresentation \u2014 that the LDW was August 2004, not June 2005 \u2014 was repeated on each one, and this is significant, because it raises the question of materiality. This misstatement was material, insofar as temporary total disability compensation was paid in June 2005 when Goodwin worked briefly at the YMCA. After that period, however, the relevance of the wrong LDW increasingly wanes, because a doctor\u2019s certification of temporary total disability derives from the findings elicited from the claimant\u2019s most recent medical examination. It therefore follows that the further removed the claimed disability period was from the week of YMCA employment, the less effect it had on temporary total disability compensation eligibility. Whether Goodwin last worked in 2004 or 2005 should have no bearing, for example, on the findings elicited from a 2006 medical evaluation. This makes it much harder to justify voiding all of the claimant\u2019s C84s.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 21} Second, this case does not involve the massive fraud seen in <em>Ellis. </em>While we do not condone any contemporaneous receipt of wages and temporary total disability compensation, Goodwin worked a total of 33 hours for minimal remuneration and then stopped working because his allowed conditions prevented him from doing the job. Goodwin also immediately reported his attempt at employment to his rehabilitation counselor. Ellis, on the other hand, had worked full-time for nearly a year and stopped only when he was caught. Ellis also lied about his work activities to bureau investigators when confronted.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 22} <em>Griffith </em>more closely resembles the case at bar. Unquestionably, <em>Griffith </em>requires vacation of temporary total disability compensation during the time that Goodwin received wages. After that period, there is no evidence that indicates that Goodwin engaged in any activities incompatible with his medical restrictions. The DHO order refers to an alleged statement from Dr. Heuser in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>which the doctor claimed that had he known Goodwin worked in 2005, he would not have certified temporary total disability. This document is not, however, in the record. Accordingly, there is nothing to support the denial of temporary total disability compensation after Goodwin\u2019s week of YMCA employment ended.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A89j\">Joseph E. Gibson, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b519-9\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Douglas R. Unver, Assistant Attorney General, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">{\u00b6 23} There is one aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 decision that must be corrected. The court of appeals suggested that concurrent payment of wages and temporary total disability compensation was ameliorated by the fact that when Goodwin received his first temporary total disability compensation check, he was no longer working at the YMCA. 2008-Ohio-5971, \u00b6 9. This is incorrect. A claimant cannot receive wages and temporary total disability compensation for the same time period. The relevant issue is not whether a claimant was working when the temporary total disability compensation check was received. The issue is whether the claimant was working over a period for which temporary total disability compensation was paid. The timing of the check\u2019s arrival is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 24} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">. The bureau\u2019s formal motion for overpayment asks that temporary total disability compensation be vacated through July 5, 2006. The latter appears to be a typographical error, as we can find no significance to the July 2006 date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
