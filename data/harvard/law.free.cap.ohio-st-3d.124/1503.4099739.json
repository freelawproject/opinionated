The parties shall file any evidence they intend to present within ten days of the date of this entry; relators shall file a brief within five days of the filing of the evidence; respondent shall file a brief within ten days after the filing of relators\u2019 brief; and relators may file a reply brief within five days after filing of respondent\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-22\">Pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 10.6, the issuance of this alternative writ stays the proceedings that relator seeks to prohibit until there is a final determination by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
