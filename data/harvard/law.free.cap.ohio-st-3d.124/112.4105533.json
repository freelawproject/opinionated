(\u201cFogg\u201d or \u201cowner\u201d), appeals from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) concerning the tax-year-2005 update to the value of Fogg\u2019s property. The BTA rejected Fogg\u2019s challenge to the update and adopted the board of revision\u2019s valuation of the property. Because Fogg has not presented an adequate jurisdictional or evidentiary basis for relief, we affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">{\u00b6 2} On March 30, 2006, Fogg filed a complaint against the tax-year-2005 valuation of a 5.93-acre parcel that Fogg owns in Summit County. The parcel is improved with two 48,000-square-foot warehouse buildings that were constructed in 1989, and the Summit County Fiscal Officer had assigned a true value of $2,934,830 to the property. The complaint states as the sole reason for changing the value that the \u201cCounty Auditor\u2019s valuation exceeds true market value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>{\u00b6 3} At the hearing before the Summit County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d), Fogg presented the testimony of William McVeigh of Midwest Property Tax, who served as property tax manager for Fogg. McVeigh opined that the property had a value of $2,500,000 based upon declining rent rates and increased vacancy as evidenced by rent rolls and a rent summary. McVeigh also testified that the property had been the subject of a complaint for tax year 2003, and the documentary submission indicated that the BOR found a value of $2,499,870 for tax year 2003 that was carried over to tax year 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding a lack of probative evidence to change the value assigned by the fiscal officer, the BOR retained the original valuation. Fogg then appealed to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">{\u00b6 4} The transcript of proceedings at the BTA is sparse. The BTA decision, issued on January 13, 2009, recites that the parties waived the presentation of evidence at a hearing and failed to file briefs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 5} In its decision, the BTA reviewed the evidence that Fogg had presented to the BOR and concluded that it could not \u201crely upon or utilize the information presented by Mr. McVeigh to the board of revision because it is insufficient to support the property owner\u2019s conclusion of value [$2,500,000].\u201d The BTA faulted the lack of an \u201cappraisal report from a qualified appraiser,\u201d noted that the evidence was limited to a \u201cdiscussion of the history of the property and its vacancy rates,\u201d and found that Fogg had failed to \u201csubstantiate the value sought.\u201d Accordingly, the BTA adopted the county\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 6} Fogg appealed to the court on February 11, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 7} On appeal, Fogg does not claim that the BTA erred by rejecting the evidence that it presented to the BOR. Instead, Fogg contests the BTA\u2019s decision on three grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">{\u00b6 8} First, Fogg contends that the \u201ccontinuing complaint\u201d rule at R.C. 5715.19(D) requires that the value for tax year 2005 should be the same as the value that had been determined for the property pursuant to the complaint Fogg filed for tax year 2003. R.C. 5715.19(D) provides that when a board of revision has not rendered its decision within the statutorily prescribed 90 days, \u201cthe complaint and any proceedings in relation thereto shall be continued by the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>as a valid complaint for any ensuing year until such complaint is finally determined by the board or upon any appeal from a decision of the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 9} There is no evidence that the present case involves a continuing complaint. In particular, the record does not show that the proceedings relating to the complaint for tax year 2003 extended into 2005. In plain terms, R.C. 5715.19(D) requires only that a complaint be continued as a valid complaint for an \u201censuing year\u201d up to the time that that complaint has been \u201cfinally determined by the board [of revision] or upon any appeal.\u201d See <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 305, 307-308, 720 N.E.2d 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 10} Moreover, Fogg actually filed a complaint for tax year 2005, thereby initiating the case that is now before us. As Fogg\u2019s counsel explicitly acknowledged at oral argument, we have held that the filing of a \u201cfresh complaint\u201d \u2014 in this case, the filing of the current complaint specifically pertaining to tax year 2005 \u2014 terminates the continuation of an earlier complaint, as long as the new complaint is procedurally valid. Id., citing <em>Cincinnati School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 639, 643, 660 N.E.2d 1179. Thus, the filing of the 2005 complaint \u201chalted the automatic carryover of the value determined\u201d in the 2003 complaint, even if a factual basis otherwise existed for viewing the 2003 complaint as continuing into tax year 2005. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 11} Second, Fogg argues that the updated value for 2005, $2,934,800, exceeds the value determined by the BOR for 2003 and 2004 ($2,499,870) by 17 percent. Fogg acknowledges that the fiscal officer had authority to perform an upward adjustment as part of the triennial update in Summit County. See <em>Cleveland Mun. School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 404, 2005-Ohio-2285, 827 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 2 (explaining that property must be reappraised every six years with an interim update of value three years after each reappraisal). Without offering evidence, Fogg asserts that the fiscal officer generally raised property values by five percent. Based on this bare assertion, Fogg contends that the 17-percent increase in the valuation of its own property violates the uniformity mandated by R.C. 5713.01(B) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 12} This argument fails on both jurisdictional and evidentiary grounds. First, the notice of appeal to this court does not contain any assignment of error that raises the update-percentage issue or the uniformity issue. It follows that we have no jurisdiction to grant Fogg relief on the basis of such an argument. See <em>Newman v. Levin, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 127, 2008-Ohio-5202, 896 N.E.2d 995, \u00b6 28. Second, the record contains no evidence regarding what percentage increase the fiscal officer applied to other properties. Therefore, there is no basis for comparing the increase in value of Fogg\u2019s property with the increase in value of other properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Finally, Fogg faults the BTA for failing to give evidentiary weight to the earlier year\u2019s valuation. Specifically, Fogg asserts that the $2,499,870 valuation determined for tax year 2003 and carried forward to tax year 2004 should have been used to value the property for tax year 2005 as well. This argument fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">{\u00b6 14} First, although the earlier valuation was orally discussed at the BOR hearing, the only direct documentation of that valuation that has evidentiary force is the \u201cValue Change Notice.\u201d That document is not included in the BOR transcript and was presented for the first time as an attachment to Fogg\u2019s post-decision brief at the BTA. It follows that the BTA did not err when it failed to consider the document, because the board did not even have the document before it when it issued its decision on January 13, 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 13, 16-17, 665 N.E.2d 1098 (documents that were \u201cnot part of the original record from the BOR and were submitted after the BTA hearing\u201d had to be \u201cdisregarded by the BTA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 15} But even if the value determined for 2003 and 2004 had properly been documented in the record, Fogg\u2019s argument fails as a matter of law. We have held that when determining the true value of real property for the current tax year, the assessor should not accord presumptive or prima facie validity to an earlier year\u2019s valuation. See <em>Olmsted Falls Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 134, 2009-Ohio-2461, 909 N.E.2d 597, \u00b6 20-21. The reason a prior year\u2019s valuation should not be \u201c \u2018deemed to be correct\u2019 \u201d is that it \u201c \u2018may not be correct.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 21, quoting <em>Freshwater v. Belmont Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 26, 28, 684 N.E.2d 304. A contrary rule would have the effect of carrying forward past errors into the current year\u2019s valuation, thereby impairing the assessor\u2019s ability to determine the correct value for the current tax year. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 16} In considering all of Fogg\u2019s contentions, the dispositive principle is that Fogg, as the appellant before the BTA, bore the burden of proving its proposed value. <em>Colonial Village, Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 268, 2009-Ohio-4975, 915 N.E.2d 1196, \u00b6 23. Fogg apparently believes that it could satisfy its burden of proof at the BTA by relying on evidence to the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>that neither market conditions nor the state of the property had changed since the earlier years, but Fogg is mistaken. Fogg had an affirmative burden to prove a value as of January 1, 2005. Fogg failed to present probative evidence showing that the value of its property should have been set at $2.5 million, or at <em>any </em>amount other than the value determined by the county.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AOf\">Wayne E. Petkovic, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b296-9\">Brindza, McIntyre &amp; Seed, L.L.P., Robert A. Brindza, Daniel McIntyre, David H. Seed, David A. Rose, and Jennifer A. Hoehnen, for appellee Akron City School District Board of Education.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 17} Having found that Fogg failed to satisfy its burden of proof, the BTA properly adopted the county\u2019s valuation of the property. <em>Colonial Village, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 268, 2009-Ohio-4975, 915 N.E.2d 1196, \u00b6 23, 31. We therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">. The school board claims that it had submitted to the BOR an open-end mortgage \u201cdated April 10, 2002, which established a maximum hen on the subject property of $3,600,000.\u201d The BTA makes no mention of such a document, and the document does not appear in the BOR transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\">. Both parties in fact filed briefs, but not in time to be considered by the board. The school board filed a brief immediately before the BTA issued its decision, and the property owner filed a brief immediately after the BTA issued its decision. No motion to reopen or to reconsider was filed by either party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">. At oral argument, Fogg\u2019s counsel suggested that the BTA erred by not ordering the BOR to transmit its valuation of the property for the earlier tax years. See <em>Blatt v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 428, 2009-Ohio-5260, 916 N.E.2d 1065, \u00b6 22, 23. This argument is jurisdietionally barred and has been waived because it appears neither in the notice of appeal nor in Fogg\u2019s merit brief. <em>Newman, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 127, 2008-Ohio-5202, 896 N.E.2d 995, \u00b6 28; <em>E. Liverpool v. Columbiana Cty. Budget Comm., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1201, 2007-Ohio-5505, 876 N.E.2d 575, \u00b6 3. In any event, <em>Blatt </em>affords no ground for relief here. <em>Blatt </em>acknowledges the BTA\u2019s discretionary authority under R.C. 5717.01 to \u201cmake such investigation concerning the appeal as it deems proper.\u201d The record furnishes no basis for finding an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
