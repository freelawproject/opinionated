Schulman, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2006-Ohio-6677, 859 N.E.2d 553, \u00b6 6 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). They serve no useful purpose. <em>Olympic Steel, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1242, 2006-Ohio-4091, 852 N.E.2d 178 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). Dual filing requirements are a trap for attorneys operating outside their normal area of practice. Prosecuting attorneys are not normally expert in the procedures associated with public-utility law. In this case, that lack of experience led to the prosecuting attorney\u2019s failing to deliver a notice of appeal to the Public Utility Commission of Ohio\u2019s docketing division and, ultimately, to a dismissal other than on the merits. In other circumstances, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>might have cast a dissenting vote, but in this case, the prosecuting attorney had an opportunity to cure the filing defect but did not avail himself of it.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3H\">Brent W.
