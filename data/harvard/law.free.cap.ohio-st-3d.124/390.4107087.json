Accordingly, we do not reach the issue regarding the obligation of the board of commissioners to make findings pursuant to R.C. 709.023(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b570-17\">{\u00b6 4} On October 31, 2007, Waterwheel Farms, Inc., filed a petition with the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners to annex 78.489 acres of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>it owned in Butler Township to the city of Union, pursuant to R.C. 709.023. Waterwheel, through its agent, gave the required statutory notice of the filing to Butler Township, the city of Union, and each of the adjacent property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 5} On November 13, 2007, the Union City Council adopted Ordinance 1438, describing the services the city would provide to the proposed annexed property, and expressly providing that the city would maintain the portions of Jackson Road when maintenance issues arose from the annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 6} On November 21, 2007, the Butler Township Board of Trustees adopted a resolution objecting to the annexation and filed it with the board of county commissioners. The township objected on two bases: first, it argued that the property fell within an area covered by a Joint Economic Development District (\u201cJEDD\u201d) contract existing between the township and the city of Dayton, and it contended that R.C. 715.79 places a moratorium on annexation within a JEDD; second, it argued that the annexation would create alternating jurisdictions along portions of Jackson Road, causing road-maintenance problems, and no agreement existed for the city to assume maintenance of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 7} On December 7, 2007, Waterwheel filed an opposition brief in which it admitted that the property is within a JEDD, but pointed out that the three-year moratorium on annexation set forth in R.C. 715.79 applies only when the JEDD contract is approved by the township electorate, and here no contract had been submitted to the electorate for a vote. Waterwheel also argued that R.C. 709.023(E)(7) does not require an agreement between a township and a municipality for road maintenance, but rather requires only that the city agree to maintain the road as a condition of the annexation; because the Union City Council had adopted an ordinance assuming maintenance of Jackson Road, it had satisfied the conditions of the statute as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 8} On December 11, 2007, the board of commissioners adopted a resolution approving Waterwheel\u2019s annexation petition. The resolution stated that six conditions set forth in R.C. 709.023(E) had been met; however, it did not address the seventh condition \u2014 the road-maintenance condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">{\u00b6 9} On January 15, 2008, the township filed a complaint against Waterwheel, the city of Union, and the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the board of commissioners to rescind annexation, a judgment declaring the resolution approving the annexation to be unlawful and void ab initio, and an injunction, if necessary, to prevent the city from taking any action in furtherance of the annexation. The city of Union moved to dismiss the complaint, alleging among other things that the township lacked standing to bring the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court ruled that the township lacked standing to file a claim in mandamus or for declaratory judgment because it did not fit the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201cparty\u201d as that term is used in R.C. 709.023. The court therefore granted the city\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint and denied the township\u2019s request for injunctive relief as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">{\u00b6 11} On appeal, the Second District Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that because a township is not a party to an R.C. 709.023 annexation, it lacks standing to petition for mandamus or seek declaratory relief, rendering moot the basis upon which to seek injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 12} The township appealed to this court, and we agreed to hear two propositions of law: first, whether a township board of trustees that objects to a proposed annexation pursuant to R.C. 709.023(D) is a \u201cparty\u201d as that term is used in R.C. 709.023(G) and thereby has standing to seek a writ of mandamus against the board of commissioners; and second, whether a board of county commissioners reviewing an annexation petition has a clear legal duty to make findings regarding all seven conditions set forth in R.C. 709.023(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 13} Butler Township contends that R.C. 709.023 recognizes a township as a party with an interest in an annexation proceeding because that statute authorizes a township to adopt a resolution supporting or objecting to the proposed annexation. Thus, it urges the court to hold that a township has standing to seek a writ of mandamus in cases where a board of county commissioners fails to follow the law in approving an annexation petition. It further contends that it should be recognized as a party with standing to seek a writ of mandamus because Waterwheel and the city of Union agree to the annexation, and thus the appellate court\u2019s interpretation of the law leaves no party to challenge a board of county commissioners\u2019 approval of a petition that does not meet statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 14} Waterwheel, the city of Union, and the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners argue that R.C. 709.023 does not recognize a township as a party. They point out that while the legislature authorized a township to file a resolution objecting to an annexation proceeding, in R.C. 709.021(D), it defined the term \u201cparty\u201d to include a township, but it did not make that definition applicable to R.C. 709.023.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 15} Thus, this case presents the question whether a township is a party that may seek a writ of mandamus in an R.C. 709.023 special annexation proceeding. This is a matter of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Statutory Annexation</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 16} Prior to March 27, 2002, all annexations in Ohio initiated by private-property owners followed one procedure requiring that a majority of the property owners in a territory to be annexed sign the petition to initiate annexation. See former R.C. 709.02, Am.H.B. No. 732, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3313. There were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>no special procedures to expedite the process, and no special procedures existed to govern situations in which all property owners desired annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 17} As of March 27, 2002, the General Assembly\u2019s amendments to R.C. Chapter 709 and enactments of, inter alia, R.C 709.021, 709.022, 709.023, and 709.024 allow for expedited annexation procedures when all the property owners within a territory to be annexed agree to the annexation and sign an annexation petition. Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5, 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 621, 625-634. R.C. 709.021 sets forth general guidelines for the special procedures for annexation in accordance with R.C. 709.022, 709.023, and 709.024. R.C. 709.022 provides for a special procedure for the annexation of land into a municipal corporation when all property owners, any township a portion of which is included within the territory proposed for annexation, and the municipality each consent to the annexation. R.C. 709.023 provides for a special procedure for the annexation of land into a municipal corporation when the land is not to be excluded from the township. And R.C. 709.024 provides a special procedure for the annexation of land into a municipal corporation for the purpose of undertaking a significant economic development project.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 18} Pertinent to the annexation in this case, R.C. 709.023(D) and (E) provide that the municipality to which annexation is proposed and any township a portion of which is included within the territory proposed for annexation may adopt and file with the board of county commissioners a resolution consenting or objecting to the proposed annexation, and if either the municipality or a township objects to the annexation, the county commissioners must review the annexation petition to determine whether the conditions specified in R.C. 709.023(E) have been met. Pursuant to R.C. 709.023(F), if the board of county commissioners finds that the conditions have been met, it must grant the annexation, but if it instead finds that one or more of the conditions have not been met, it must so specify in a resolution denying the petition. R.C. 709.023(G) provides that there is no appeal in law or equity from the board\u2019s entry of any resolution under R.C. 709.023 but that any party may seek a writ of mandamus to compel the board to perform its duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cStanding\u201d is defined as a \u201c \u2018party\u2019s right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Pyro, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 375, 2007-Ohio-5024, 875 N.E.2d 550, \u00b627, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1442. Thus, whether Butler Township has standing to seek a writ of mandamus in this case depends upon whether the township is a party to an R.C. 709.023 special annexation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 20} In construing statutes, reviewing courts must ascertain the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. See <em>Rosette v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 296, 2005-Ohio-1736, 825 N.E.2d 599, \u00b6 12. To determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>intent, a court looks to the language of the statute. <em>Rice v. CertainTeed Corp. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 417, 419, 704 N.E.2d 1217. Here, the General Assembly expressed its intent regarding whether the township is a party for purposes of R.C. 709.023 by enacting R.C. 709.021(D), wherein it defined the term \u201cparty\u201d as \u201cthe municipal corporation to which annexation is proposed, each township any portion of which is included within the territory proposed for annexation, and the agent for the petitioners.\u201d However, subsection (D) expressly provides that this definition applies to R.C. 709.022 and 709.024, but R.C. 709.023 is not mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c \u2018The canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius tells us that the express inclusion of one thing implies the exclusion of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford-Cole v. Lucas Cty. Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 560, 2009-Ohio-1355, 906 N.E.2d 409, \u00b6 42, quoting <em>Myers v. Toledo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 218, 2006-Ohio-4353, 852 N.E.2d 1176, \u00b6 24. It is well recognized that a court cannot read words into a statute but must give effect to the words used in the statute. See generally <em>State ex rel McDulin v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 390, 392, 732 N.E.2d 367; <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 50, 524 N.E.2d 441, paragraph three of the syllabus, citing <em>Columbus-Suburban Coach Lines v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 125, 127, 49 O.O.2d 445, 254 N.E.2d 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 22} The General Assembly could have applied the R.C. 709.021(D) definition of \u201cparty\u201d to R.C. 709.023 if it had intended to do so. It chose otherwise. Our duty is to construe the statutes as written. In doing so, we conclude that the General Assembly did not intend the definition of \u201cparty\u201d in R.C. 709.021(D) to apply to R.C. 709.023; hence R.C. 709.021 does not confer party status on a township in an R.C. 709.023 special annexation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 23} Based on the foregoing, we conclude that a township that files a resolution objecting to an annexation petition pursuant to R.C. 709.023(D) in an R.C. 709.023 annexation proceeding is not a \u201cparty\u201d as that term is used in R.C. 709.023(G) and therefore lacks standing to seek a writ of mandamus to compel the board of county commissioners to make findings on each of the conditions set forth in R.C. 709.023(E). This conclusion renders Butler Township\u2019s second proposition of law moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b574-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b574-11\">Lundberg Stratton and Cupp, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Cupp, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_Bf\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">{\u00b6 25} I respectfully dissent because I believe that a township that files a resolution objecting to an annexation petition pursuant to R.C. 709.023(D) is a \u201cparty\u201d that has standing to request a writ of mandamus to compel the board of county commissioners to perform its duties pursuant to R.C. 709.023(G). I further conclude that a board of county commissioners reviewing an annexation under R.C. 709.023(F) has a clear legal duty to state in its resolution whether all seven conditions set forth in R.C. 709.023(E) have been met. Accordingly, I would reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 709.023 provides an expedited procedure for annexing land into a municipal corporation. All the property owners within the territory to be annexed must agree to the annexation and sign the annexation petition. Under R.C. 709.023(G), there is no appeal from a board of county commissioners\u2019 entry of a resolution on an annexation petition under that statute, but \u201cany party\u201d may seek a writ of mandamus to compel the board to perform its duties under R.C. 709.023. The majority concludes that a township is not a party for R.C. 709.023(G) purposes, because the definition of \u201cparty\u201d set forth in R.C. 709.021, which includes townships, is not specifically made applicable to R.C. 709.023 annexation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 27} In my view, the fact that R.C. 709.021(D) does not specify that its definition of \u201cparty\u201d or \u201cparties\u201d applies to R.C. 709.023 is not dispositive of the question before us. R.C. 709.023 does not define who is a \u201cparty\u201d who may bring a mandamus action under R.C. 709.023(G). However, R.C. 709.023(D) provides that a township, a portion of which is included in the territory proposed for annexation, may adopt and file with the board of county commissioners a resolution objecting to the proposed annexation on the basis of the proposal\u2019s failure to meet any of the conditions specified in R.C. 709.023(E). If a township objects to the annexation, the board of county commissioners must determine whether the conditions specified in R.C. 709.023(E) have been met. If the board of county commissioners \u201cfinds that each of the conditions specified in division (E) * * * has been met, [the board of commissioners] shall enter upon its journal a resolution granting the annexation.\u201d R.C. 709.023(F). If, however, the board of commissioners finds that \u201cone or more of the conditions specified in division (E) * * * have not been met, it shall enter upon its journal a resolution that states which of those conditions the board finds have not been met and that denies the petition.\u201d R.C. 709.023(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 28} Taken together, the provisions allowing a township to object to a proposed annexation under R.C. 709.023 and requiring the board of county commissioners to determine whether the seven conditions specified in R.C. 709.023(E) for such an annexation have been met show that a township, some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>whose territory is to be annexed, is a \u201cparty\u201d who may file a mandamus action under R.C. 709.023(G). As the township and its amici point out, only the township has an interest in challenging an improperly approved annexation under R.C. 709.023. Surely R.C. 709.023 does not expressly allow affected townships to object to an annexation and to require the board of county commissioners to determine whether all of the statutorily specified conditions for such annexations have been met, only to exclude townships from filing a mandamus action under division (G) to challenge an improperly approved annexation. By contrast, R.C. 709.024(G), pertaining to a different type of expedited annexation proceeding, expressly provides that only \u201c[a]n owner who signed the petition\u201d may appeal from a denial of the annexation petition, that \u201c[n]o other person has standing to appeal the board\u2019s decision in law or in equity,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f the board grants the annexation, there shall be no appeal in law or in equity.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ABB\">Newhouse, Prophater, Letcher &amp; Moots, L.L.C., and Wanda L. Carter, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">{\u00b6 29} In my view, a contested annexation petition under R.C. 709.023 can be approved only if the board of county commissioners finds that all of the seven conditions listed in division (E) of the statute exist. See R.C. 709.023(F). I would hold that a board of commissioners has a clear legal duty to make a finding that all of the seven conditions listed in R.C. 709.023(E) have been met in its resolution approving an annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 30} After declaring that this issue was moot in light of its determination that Butler Township lacked standing to file the mandamus action, the court of appeals opined: \u201cR.C. 709.023(E) and (F) do not require the Board of County Commissioners to make express findings that analyze how all seven conditions in R.C. 709.023(E) have been met. The statute only requires the Commissioners to identify, and not to thoroughly explain and/or discuss, the conditions that have not been met when a petition has been denied.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Butler Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>Montgomery App. No. 22664, 2008-Ohio-6542, 2008 WL 5196445, \u00b6 35. Thus, the court of appeals did not decide whether the board of commissioners complied with its clear legal duty to make findings that sufficiently addressed all of the seven conditions in R.C. 709.023(E) in granting the annexation. Accordingly, I would reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and remand this matter to that court for a determination whether the board of county commissioners\u2019 resolution approving the annexation in this case satisfied the requirement that the board of commissioners find that all of the seven conditions in R.C. 709.023(E) have been met.</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-6\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A5QH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Brahm <em>&amp; </em>Cunningham, L.L.C., Catherine A.
