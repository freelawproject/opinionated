On March 5, 2003, Perez shot Ronald Johnson to death during an aggravated robbery. Perez was convicted of the aggravated murder of Ronald Johnson and was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">I. Background and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">\n<em>A. The Beverage Oasis Robbery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">{\u00b6 2} In 2002, Perez borrowed a double-barreled 12-gauge pump shotgun from George Remmer, telling Remmer he wanted to hunt with it. Perez never returned the gun. On May 29, 2002, Perez\u2019s wife, Debra, bought a 20-gauge shotgun at a store in Springfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">{\u00b6 3} The Beverage Oasis was a drive-through liquor store in Springfield. On June 22, 2002, at approximately 11:00 p.m., two masked men entered the Beverage Oasis while employees were closing up for the night. One of these men was Perez; the other was his friend, Cecil Howard. The manager saw each man raise a gun. The other employees fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">{\u00b6 4} The owner of the Beverage Oasis, Clifford Conley, was in his office, but he could see what was going on in the store via security monitors. Conley watched as the two masked robbers came into the drive-through area of the building. When the employees fled, Perez ran out after them. Conley called 911. On the monitor, Conley saw Howard hitting the cash register with his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">{\u00b6 5} Conley armed himself with a handgun, emerged from the office, and told Howard to \u201chold it.\u201d Howard ignored him and began to flee. Conley then fired two warning shots, but Howard fled the building through the rear drive-through entrance. However, when he encountered a fence that blocked his escape route, Howard turned and raised his shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">{\u00b6 6} Conley fired at Howard. Howard dropped the gun and fell to one knee. Conley then started to walk out of the building toward Howard through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>drive-through entrance, planning to pick up the dropped shotgun and detain Howard.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">{\u00b6 7} At this point, Perez returned. He raised his gun and fired at Conley just as Conley ducked back inside the building. Then Conley and Perez exchanged fire before Conley retreated. Perez\u2019s shots hit the doorjamb beside the entrance. The heaviest concentration of birdshot from Perez\u2019s fire struck the doorjamb about five feet above the ground. Conley is six feet tall.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">{\u00b6 8} Howard limped over to Perez, leaving his shotgun behind. Conley fired four times without carefully aiming, then pushed a button to close the overhead door of the drive-through entrance. Perez helped his wounded partner walk away from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">{\u00b6 9} Meanwhile, a motorist had picked up three of the fleeing employees and had driven them two or three blocks away from the store. Donald Little, a store manager, got out of the vehicle and called the police on his cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">{\u00b6 10} While Little was on the phone, a car heading away from the Beverage Oasis pulled up. A back-seat passenger thrust his head out the window, looked at Little, then dropped back into the car and told the driver to \u201cgo now.\u201d Little could see his face clearly by the streetlight overhead. Little subsequently picked Howard from a photographic array as the person in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">{\u00b6 11} Springfield police investigators found the wounded robber\u2019s shotgun on the ground near the drive-through entrance. That gun turned out to be the one that George Remmer had loaned to Perez. A fingerprint on the shotgun was later identified as that of Cecil Howard. Investigators also found two spent shotgun shells at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">{\u00b6 12} The day after the Beverage Oasis robbery, Perez told his teenage stepson, Robert (\u201cRobby\u201d) Smith, about the incident. Perez stated that he had been shot during the robbery and showed Robby the wounds on his arm. Perez told Robby that he had committed the robbery with Cecil Howard and that Howard had been \u201cshot in the butt and the ankle.\u201d Perez described the shootout: \u201cWhen Cecil got shot, he \u2014 Cecil dropped the gun and he [Perez] went back after him and grabbed him up and he shot back.\u201d When a television broadcast about the robbery showed a shotgun, Perez said, \u201cThere go[es] the one that was dropped at the scene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">\n<em>B. The Do Drop Inn Robbery and the Murder of Ronald Johnson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">{\u00b6 13} On February 11, 2003, Debra Perez bought a Taurus .357 Magnum revolver from a Springfield pawnshop.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">{\u00b6 14} The Do Drop Inn was a bar located at the corner of Tibbetts and Pleasant Streets in Springfield. On March 5, 2003, between 11:30 p.m. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>midnight, two armed men wearing masks and dark clothing kicked in the side door and entered the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">{\u00b6 15} Five people were seated at the bar. The owner, Larry Delawder, was sitting at the end of the bar nearer the side door. Next to him on his left was Ronald Johnson, a customer. Three other customers, including Cindy DePriest, were seated at the bar. The robbers announced that a robbery was in progress and ordered the occupants of the bar not to move.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">{\u00b6 16} Delawder and DePriest testified that when the robbers entered, they ordered the customers to place their hands on the bar. According to DePriest, the robbers also made the customers get down on the floor, get up, get down again, and get back up. They asked DePriest to come around to the other side of the bar and get money from the cash register.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">{\u00b6 17} One of the robbers went behind the bar to get the money. The other one situated himself behind Delawder. The robber demanded money from Delawder, but he protested that all he had was some change. Johnson \u201cturned one way or the other to look,\u201d and the robber shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">{\u00b6 18} Johnson immediately collapsed onto the floor. The shooter asked Johnson, \u201cDid I hit you?\u201d Johnson replied, \u201cYes, you hit me hard.\u201d After the shot, DePriest gave the cash to the other robber. He made her lie on the floor, and the robbers left.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">{\u00b6 19} Delawder and the bar patrons tried to help Johnson, who was bleeding badly. But within a few minutes of the shooting, Johnson was unconscious, had no pulse, and had stopped breathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">{\u00b6 20} An autopsy showed that the bullet had entered Johnson\u2019s back, punctured both his lungs, and severed his spinal column, killing him. The bullet was recovered from Johnson\u2019s chest and examined by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Identification. Its appearance was characteristic of a hollow-point bullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">{\u00b6 21} On the day after the Do Drop Inn murder, Perez told Robby Smith, \u201cI had to mere [i.e., kill] an MFer, last night.\u201d Perez claimed that the victim \u201ccalled him the N word, and that\u2019s what caused him to shoot him. * * * Then [Perez] asked [the victim] * * * if he got hit; and the guy [said] * * * you got me good.\u201d The victim, Perez told Robby, was \u201c[o]n his back gurgling blood, like blood coming out his mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">{\u00b6 22} On March 7, 2003, a local newspaper carried a front-page article about Johnson\u2019s murder. Perez called Debra and Robby into the room, showed them the article, and said, \u201cI made the paper. * * * I made the front page.\u201d Perez also showed Robby the gun he had used, a chrome .357 Magnum revolver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>remarking that it was \u201ca nice gun\u201d with \u201ca lot of power.\u201d Perez stated that he had used hollow-point ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">{\u00b6 23} Later that day, Perez, Debra, and Perez\u2019s daughter, Lindee Alspaugh, were watching a news broadcast about Johnson\u2019s murder. The broadcast stated that the victim had been shot in the back. Perez remarked, \u201c[T]hey make the man look like a coward,\u201d and laughed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">{\u00b6 24} The next day, Perez, Debra, and Robby went to the Caesar\u2019s Creek flea market in Wilmington, where Debra exchanged the .357 Magnum Taurus purchased on February 11, 2003, for two 9 mm Hi-Point handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">{\u00b6 25} In August 2003, Perez was discussing the subject of robbery with John McGhee, an acquaintance. According to McGhee, Perez said \u201che could not be stopped\u201d when committing a robbery and that anyone who resisted \u201cwould have to get dealt with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\n<em>C. The Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">{\u00b6 26} On October 20, 2003, Robby Smith told his guidance counselor about Perez\u2019s admission to the Do Drop Inn murder. The counselor contacted the Springfield police. After Robby told detectives about Perez\u2019s admission, the police questioned Debra. She agreed to cooperate with the investigation. Debra or Robby gave police three masks that were in Perez\u2019s closet or among his belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">{\u00b6 27} On October 24, 2003, Perez was being held in the Clark County jail on a charge unrelated to Johnson\u2019s murder. That day, he received a visit from his wife, Debra. Their conversation was recorded with Debra\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">{\u00b6 28} During the conversation, Debra expressed fear that she might be subject to criminal liability. Perez tried to reassure her: \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones that know.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s only three people that know that. That\u2019s me, you, and Robby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">{\u00b6 29} He urged Debra to remain silent: \u201cIf anybody comes \u2014 you don\u2019t know nothing. * * * How can you know anything? Just stay strong, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">{\u00b6 30} On November 12, 2003, Debra visited Perez again, and again their conversation was recorded with Debra\u2019s consent. During this conversation, Debra again expressed fear of possible exposure to criminal liability. Perez again reassured her: \u201cThey don\u2019t have s* * *.\u201d \u201c[T]here\u2019s no way to prove this * * *. [T]hey can\u2019t do it * * *.\u201d He coached her on what to tell the police: \u201cWell, the reason that you * * * got rid of the [gun] is because it was too big.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">{\u00b6 31} Perez repeatedly expressed his determination never to confess, because he knew he would receive a severe sentence if he did:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>{\u00b6 32} \u201cIf I go ahead and do that [confess], * * * then you know what happens right there. * * * I\u2019m saying it\u2019s over with for me and you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cI ain\u2019t never gonna admit to [anything], * * * In order for me to admit to that, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m gone for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cBut I ain\u2019t trying to go do the * * * rest of my life for something when I ain\u2019t got to either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cYou\u2019re gonna stick there throughout the whole shebang, huh? * * * \u2018Cause we\u2019re talkin\u2019 30-some years probably. * * * If you go the other route. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying you got to be strong, baby. You gonna tell me you can stick around for 20 years?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cI mean what am I supposed to do, go in there and admit to this * * *?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c[A]re you understanding how much time that is? * * * A murder. * * * On top of a robbery. Then they want to know who was involved. * * * I can\u2019t take my dude down with me either. * * * So who do I take down with me, [acquaintance] John McGhee?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">{\u00b6 38} On November 18, 2003, an X-ray taken pursuant to a seai'ch warrant revealed a metal fragment embedded in Cecil Howard\u2019s left hip or buttock area. A radiology physician who examined the X-ray and a photograph of a scar on Howard\u2019s left buttock concluded that both were consistent with a gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">\n<em>D. Perez\u2019s Confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">{\u00b6 39} On the afternoon of November 12, 2003, Detective Daniel DeWine of the Springfield police department received a message stating that Perez wished to speak to detectives. DeWine and Detective Darwin Hicks brought Perez to police headquarters. Perez waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and the detectives proceeded to interrogate him. Perez volunteered that his wife had visited him that morning and had been concerned that she would be arrested because she had owned the Magnum.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">{\u00b6 40} When asked why he and Debra got rid of the Magnum, Perez claimed they did so because \u201cit was * * * too much of a gun for\u201d Debra. Perez claimed they had bought the gun so Debra would have \u201csome protection at home\u201d while Perez was on the road. (Actually, Perez had left his truck-driving job in December 2002, and Debra did not buy the gun until two months later.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">{\u00b6 41} Perez then changed his story, saying that he had loaned the gun to someone and had then gotten rid of it because he feared the borrower might have used it in a crime. He identified the borrower as John McGhee and stated, \u201cI believe it was used in a robbery that * * * went bad at the Do Drop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">{\u00b6 42} Asked why he thought so, Perez alleged that McGhee had said he was going to \u201chit [him] a lick\u201d \u2014 slang for committing a robbery, as Perez explained. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Perez also said that McGhee had brought the gun back too fast, and so Perez had thought that something \u201cwent bad.\u201d Perez claimed that McGhee had previously \u201ctried to get [him] to do some robberies with him\u201d and that McGhee \u201ctold [Perez] he does bars,\u201d a statement that made Perez suspect him because bars were \u201cbeing hit a lot.\u201d Perez continued to implicate McGhee during the detectives\u2019 questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">{\u00b6 43} When the detectives asked Perez to give an alibi for the Do Drop Inn robbery, Perez said, \u201cI drive semis for a living,\u201d and he \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d he was on the road that night. But he later retracted this claim, admitting that he had not driven semis since December 2002 and was not working at the time of the Do Drop Inn robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">{\u00b6 44} After further questioning, Perez admitted his guilt as to the Do Drop Inn robbery and murder. However, he repeatedly denied that he had intended to kill Johnson. Perez gave the following account of the murder:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cApproached the building from the side. * * * [W]alked in the door, told everybody don\u2019t move, everybody get down on the floor. He [Johnson] said I ain\u2019t gotta do a goddamn thing you say, nigger, something to that effect. Told him don\u2019t move, don\u2019t look. He looked and moved and ran his mouth. It cost him his life. Happened that quick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">{\u00b6 46} After shooting Johnson, Perez was \u201cpissed off\u2019 at him for being a \u201cdumb ass.\u201d He walked up to Johnson and asked him, \u201c[W]here you hit?\u201d Johnson said, \u201cOh, you hit me good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">{\u00b6 47} Perez also confessed that he had committed the Beverage Oasis robbery and had shot at Conley. Perez repeatedly denied knowing Howard and adamantly refused to identify his accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">{\u00b6 48} After his confession, Perez made two telephone calls on the detective bureau\u2019s phone. Both calls were recorded. The first was to Debra. Perez informed Debra, \u201cI told \u2019em everything,\u201d but added, \u201cI didn\u2019t give \u2019em nothing\u201d with regard to his \u201cbuddy\u201d whose name had come up \u201ca lot.\u201d He instructed Debra to \u201ccall Cecil and tell him * * * to get * * * gone. Somebody said his name. * * * They said Cecil Howard * * *. They gonna be at him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">{\u00b6 49} During this conversation, Perez acknowledged that Debra had purchased the guns at his behest and said, \u201cWhy should you suffer for s* * * I did, * * * or anybody else? * * * Like they said, there\u2019s a family out there that wants to know why that guy was killed * * *.\u201d Perez also said, \u201c[I]t\u2019s a big weight for real to be lifted off a [person] * * *. I mean I\u2019ve been thinking about this * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">{\u00b6 50} After calling Debra, Perez called Howard. He told Howard that he had confessed to robbery and murder and that the police had him \u201cdead to right[s].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Perez warned Howard that \u201cJohn\u201d had implicated Howard, but he assured Howard, \u201cI told 'em I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">(\u00b6 51} Sherry Alspaugh, the mother of Perez\u2019s daughter, Lindee, visited Perez in jail. On one occasion, Perez told her: \u201cThe man would just not shut up * * * so I shot him.\u201d Perez also wrote Alspaugh a letter from jail on August 23, 2004. In that letter, he wrote: \u201cAbout killing that guy. I felt very bad for that * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\n<em>E. Other Bar Robberies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">{\u00b6 52} Perez also confessed to a series of armed robberies of Springfield bars between May 29, 2002, and September 11, 2002. He robbed the Nite Owl Tavern on May 29, 2002, the 19th Hole on June 7, Sugarbaker\u2019s on June 19, the Lantern Bar on September 2, and the Nite Owl again on September 11. No one was killed during any of these robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\n<em>F. Indictment, Trial, and Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">{\u00b6 53} On December 1, 2003, the grand jury returned a 20-count indictment against Perez. Count One charged Perez with the aggravated murder of Ronald Johnson during an aggravated robbery, R.C. 2903.01(B). Count One carried two death specifications: murder during an aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and course of conduct, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). The indictment also included counts charging Perez with the attempted murder of Clifford Conley and with aggravated robberies at the Do Drop Inn, the Beverage Oasis, the Nite Owl, the Lantern Bar, Sugarbaker\u2019s, and the 19th Hole, among other crimes. However, Counts Two through 20 were eventually severed to be tried without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">{\u00b6 54} Perez was convicted of the aggravated murder of Johnson and of both specifications. After a penalty hearing, the jury recommended a death sentence. The trial court sentenced Perez to death. He appeals his convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">II. Fifth Amendment Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">{\u00b6 55} In his fourth proposition of law, Perez contends that the admission of his statements in the tape-recorded conversation with Debra violated his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He claims that Debra was conducting \u201cthe functional equivalent of an interrogation\u201d and that someone should have given him <em>Miranda </em>warnings before he spoke with Debra. See <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. He also claims that his statements to Debra were coerced, because during his interrogation by police, the detectives told him that they would arrest Debra.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\n<em>A. Miranda Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">{\u00b6 56} Perez\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claim lacks merit. Debra was not a police officer. Although she was cooperating with the police, Perez did not know that. At most, then, she could be categorized as an undercover agent of the police. But \u201c[c]onversations between suspects and undercover agents do not implicate the concerns underlying <em>Miranda.\u201d Illinois v. Perkins </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 292, 296, 110 S.Ct. 2394, 110 L.Ed.2d 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">{\u00b6 57} As <em>Perkins </em>explained, <em>Miranda </em>was concerned with the inherently compelling pressures produced by custodial interrogation in a police-dominated atmosphere. <em>Perkins, </em>496 U.S. at 296, 110 S.Ct. 2394, 110 L.Ed.2d 243. Those particular pressures do not exist when the suspect is conversing with an undercover agent: \u201cQuestioning by captors, who appear to control the suspect\u2019s fate, may create mutually reinforcing pressures that the Court has assumed will weaken the suspect\u2019s will, but where a suspect does not know that he is conversing with a government agent, those pressures do not exist. * * * When the suspect has no reason to think that the listeners have official power over him, it should not be assumed that his words are motivated by the reaction he expects from his listeners.\u201d Id. at 297, 110 S.Ct. 2394, 110 L.Ed.2d 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">{\u00b6 58} Debra was not Perez\u2019s captor. She neither controlled nor appeared to control Perez\u2019s fate. She had no official power over him; more important, Perez had no reason to suppose that she had any such power. Thus, the coercive pressures with which <em>Miranda </em>is concerned were wholly absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">{\u00b6 59} Perez attempts to distinguish <em>Perkins </em>because Debra\u2019s \u201cstatements were specifically designed to elicit incriminating responses from him, making her conversations with him the functional equivalent of an interrogation.\u201d Not only does this argument fail to distinguish <em>Perkins, </em>it altogether misses the point of that case, which did not turn on the presence or absence of \u201cinterrogation\u201d by the undercover agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">{\u00b6 60} Perez also tries to distinguish <em>Perkins </em>on the ground that Debra\u2019s questioning \u201cwas engineered in such a way that it created a coercive environment.\u201d But as <em>Perkins </em>makes clear, <em>Miranda </em>is concerned with only one specific type of coercive environment: that created by custodial interrogation in a police-dominated atmosphere. Other kinds of allegedly coercive environments may raise questions as to whether a given confession was voluntary, but they do not require <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">{\u00b6 61} Thus, Perez\u2019s efforts to distinguish <em>Perkins </em>fail. We reject Perez\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claim as inconsistent with <em>Perkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\n<em>B. Involuntary-Confession Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">{\u00b6 62} In her conversations with Perez on October 24, 2003, and November 12, 2003, Debra told him that she was worried because detectives were asking about her gun transactions and the Do Drop Inn robbery. She said she was afraid of going to jail, as she had never been in trouble before. She worried about losing custody of Perez\u2019s daughter. She repeatedly told Perez that her \u201cnerves [were] shot,\u201d and she \u201ccr[ied] all the time.\u201d She said that if she had to go to jail, she would probably kill herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 63} After the November 12 visit from Debra, Perez asked to speak with detectives and was brought to police headquarters that afternoon. The detectives gave him <em>Miranda </em>warnings and asked what he wanted to speak with them about. Perez explained that Debra had told him \u201cthat detectives had been coming to [their] house questioning her about * * * a firearm that may have been used in a case that\u2019s ongoing.\u201d Perez stated that he was \u201cconcerned,\u201d that Debra had done nothing, and that he was \u201ctrying to figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 64} During the discussion, detectives repeatedly told Perez that Debra could be indicted because she had bought the murder weapon and had gotten rid of it after the murder. Perez claims that these statements constituted coercion that rendered his later confession involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">{\u00b6 65} For instance, Detective Hicks said that he knew Debra \u201cgot rid of the gun, * * * which automatically brings her into it.\u201d \u201c[W]e got a young lady that purchased a gun that was used in a homicide that she properly [sic] sold two days after the homicide.\u201d Hicks said, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have nothing, we wouldn\u2019t be going to your wife with the information we had * * *, information to the Grand Jury to get her indicted.\u201d He said that Debra could be indicted \u201c[b]ecause she bought the gun. When she sold it up (Inaudible) we know she know [sic] what it was used for or she wouldn\u2019t have gotten rid of it.\u201d Perez protested that he had told Debra to get rid of the gun. Hicks replied, \u201cBut that don\u2019t prove she didn\u2019t know what the gun was used for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 66} Hicks returned to the subject of Debra\u2019s possible prosecution: \u201cIt\u2019s sad that a woman may have to go to jail that may have had a very little part to play in this.\u201d When Perez asked, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s she gonna go to jail for?\u201d Hicks replied, \u201cWell, let\u2019s see, complicity to the homicide, tampering with evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">{\u00b6 67} Perez asked, \u201cWhat keeps her from going to jail?\u201d Hicks replied that he intended to present the evidence against Debra to the grand jury, \u201cas long as [the police] think she got a part to play in it * * *. But you the only one knows (Inaudible).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">{\u00b6 68} Sergeant Ronald Flores said: \u201cNow, there\u2019s a way to clean this up a little bit. Let us know how it actually happened. * * * Your wife, she\u2019s brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>into this. She is part of this case. Is there a way to help her? There\u2019s possible ways, but we\u2019ve got to know her involvement. Right now I would have to tell the Grand Jury that she\u2019s involved in this, completely, 110 percent. * * * There\u2019s only one way * * * for me to be convinced different. And that\u2019s for you to tell me what her involvement is. We know you\u2019re involved in this. * * * And you\u2019re the one * * * that can clear us up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">{\u00b6 69} Later, Flores said: \u201cI think * * * the one thing you probably have respect for is your wife. And I don\u2019t know what happened to make you [kill Johnson] * * *, but this is your opportunity to tell us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 70} Flores asked Perez what the most important thing in his life was. Perez replied that it was his wife, daughter, and son. Flores replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing. Now, time to step up and do the right thing.\u201d Shortly after this last exchange, Perez began to confess to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 71} Voluntariness of a confession is determined based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 31, 3 O.O.3d 18, 358 N.E.2d 1051, paragraph two of the syllabus. However, the use of an inherently coercive tactic by police is a prerequisite to a finding of involuntariness. <em>Colorado v. Connelly </em>(1986), 479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473. Hence, we need not assess the totality of the circumstances unless we first find that the detectives used a coercive tactic. <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 472, 739 N.E.2d 749. In this case, Perez claims that the detectives used a coercive tactic when they expressed their intention to seek Debra\u2019s prosecution unless Perez gave them information about his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">{\u00b6 72} \u201c[T]hreats to arrest members of a suspect\u2019s family may cause a confession to be involuntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Finch </em>(C.A.6, 1993), 998 F.2d 349, 356. The issue \u201cturns on * * * whether the threat could have been lawfully executed.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson </em>(C.A.6, 2003), 351 F.3d 254, 263. If the police had probable cause to arrest the person in question, a threat to do so is not coercive and thus does not render a confession involuntary. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cProbable cause exists if the facts and circumstances known to the officer warrant a prudent man in believing that the offense has been committed.\u201d <em>Henry v. United States </em>(1959), 361 U.S. 98, 102, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134. \u201cProbable cause does not require the same type of specific evidence of each element of the offense as would be needed to support a conviction.\u201d <em>Adams v. Williams </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 143, 149, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612. Rather, probable cause is a \u201cpractical, nontechnical conception,\u201d <em>Brinegar v. United States </em>(1949), 338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879, that \u201cturn[s] on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 232, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>{\u00b6 74} The record indicates that the detectives had probable cause to arrest Debra for obstructing justice with regard to Johnson\u2019s murder. They knew that Debra knew about the murder after it happened, because Robby Smith, Debra\u2019s teenage son, had told them about Perez\u2019s remark to Debra that he had \u201cmade the front page.\u201d Robby had also told them that Perez had used a chrome .357 handgun and directed them to the flea market where it had been traded. After visiting the flea market and tracing the .357, they knew that Debra had traded it for two other guns only two days after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 75} They also had probable cause to arrest her for complicity in the Do Drop Inn robbery. They had visited the pawnshop where Debra had bought the .357, and they knew from the firearm-transaction record that Debra had bought it. While there is no direct evidence that she knew he was going to commit robbery with it, the officers knew from talking to Debra that she had treated Perez\u2019s wound from the Beverage Oasis shootout. They also knew from Robby that Perez was willing to talk to Debra about his crimes, at least after the fact. Hence, they could infer that Debra knew that Perez had been committing robberies when she procured the .357 for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 76} Because the officers could have lawfully arrested Debra, threatening to do so was not a coercive tactic. <em>Johnson, </em>351 F.3d at 263. Thus, Perez\u2019s fourth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">III. Sufficiency of Evidence of Course-of-Conduct Specification</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 77} In Parts C and E of his first proposition of law, Perez contends that the state did not introduce sufficient evidence to prove the existence of the course-of-conduct aggravating circumstance. He claims that the murder of Johnson during the Do Drop Inn robbery and the attempt to kill Clifford Conley during the Beverage Oasis robbery do not constitute a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), as interpreted in <em>State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">{\u00b6 78} In <em>Sapp, </em>we held: \u201cThe statutory phrase \u2018course of conduct\u2019 found in R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) requires that the state establish some factual link between the aggravated murder with which the defendant is charged and the other murders or attempted murders that are alleged to make up the course of conduct. In order to find that two offenses constitute a single course of conduct under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), the trier of fact \u2018must * * * discern some connection, common scheme, or some pattern or psychological thread that ties [the offenses] together.\u2019\u201d <em>Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, syllabus, quoting <em>State v. Cummings </em>(1992), 332 N.C. 487, 510, 422 S.E.2d 692. We further held that the required factual link may consist of \u201ca similar pattern of secondary crimes * * * involving each victim.\u201d <em>Sapp, </em>\u00b6 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>{\u00b6 79} As Perez concedes, the murder of Johnson and the attempted murder of Conley were both committed during aggravated robberies, and both were committed with firearms. However, Perez argues, the two crimes were in other respects so dissimilar that they cannot be considered part of the same course of conduct under <em>Sapp. </em>He notes that the crimes took place eight months apart at different locations and that the victims were unrelated. He contrasts the shootout at the Beverage Oasis, where Conley fired first, with the Do Drop Inn murder, where Perez fired the only shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">{\u00b6 80} However, <em>Sapp </em>illustrates that offenses can have significant differences in \u201cfactual circumstances and modi operandi,\u201d 105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 58, and yet constitute a single course of conduct. In <em>Sapp, </em>the state alleged that three murders and one attempted murder constituted a course of conduct. Two of the victims were children; two were adults. Two of the crimes involved accomplices; two did not. Three were committed outdoors, one indoors. The defendant used different weapons and different methods of killing the victims and hiding their bodies. Id. at \u00b6 58. Despite these dissimilarities, we held in <em>Sapp </em>that the aggravated murders were part of a single course of conduct sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). See generally id. at \u00b6 58-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 81} Moreover, the eight-month separation between the attempted murder of Conley and the murder of Johnson is not dispositive. <em>Sapp </em>establishes that \u201cmurders taking place at different times \u2018may satisfy the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) specification so long as the offender\u2019s actions were part of a continuing course of criminal conduct.\u2019 * * * Thus, the length of time between offenses does not necessarily determine whether the offenses form a course of conduct.\u201d <em>Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 55, quoting <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 82} Thus, in <em>Sapp, </em>we held that murders committed over a year apart were part of the same course of conduct, based on common motives and similarity in the modi operandi of the crimes. 105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 59-60. See also <em>State v. Cummings, </em>332 N.C. at 510-511, 422 S.E.2d 692 (two murders 26 months apart constituted a course of conduct); <em>Corwin v. State </em>(Tex.Crim.App.1993), 870 S.W.2d 23, 27-28 (three similar murders and two attempted murders over 13 years constituted a course of conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 83} In this case, the murder and the attempted murder took place in the city of Springfield during aggravated robberies with similar modi operandi. The Do Drop Inn and the Beverage Oasis were similar businesses, in that both specialized in the sale of alcoholic beverages at retail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both robberies were committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>late at night. (The Do Drop Inn was invaded between 11:30 and midnight, and the Beverage Oasis, just before its 11:00 p.m. closing time.) In both cases, Perez fired at an uncooperative victim. Cf. <em>Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 60 (finding evidence of common motive where the murderer perceived each victim as having provoked him, albeit in different ways). Both robberies were committed by two armed, masked perpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">{\u00b6 84} The evidence thus establishes the presence of \u201ca similar pattern of secondary crimes * * * involving each victim.\u201d <em>Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 52. Hence, there is a factual link between the aggravated murder of Johnson and the attempted aggravated murder of Conley sufficient to establish that both crimes are part of the same course of conduct for purposes of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">IV. Evidence of Uncharged Bar Robberies</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 85} In part B of his first proposition of law, and in his second proposition of law, Perez claims that the state violated Evid.R. 404(B) by introducing evidence of five uncharged bar robberies in which no victim was killed. This rule allows the admission of \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes * * * for * * * purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, * * * plan, * * * identity or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">{\u00b6 86} Evidence of the following robberies was introduced:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 87} May 29, 2002: At 2:00 a.m., two masked men with guns entered the back door of the Nite Owl Tavern. One of them grabbed barmaid Rhonda Boyd by the hair and ordered her to remove all the money from the till and place it in bags. After Boyd complied, the gunman made her lie down on the floor. The robbers got away with between $400 and $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">{\u00b6 88} June 7, 2002: At approximately 12:45 a.m., a man entered the 19th Hole wearing black clothing and a ski mask and carrying a pump shotgun. The owner, an employee, and two customers were in the bar. Raising the gun, the robber warned: \u201cThis is no joke.\u201d He told the owner to \u201cget the money\u201d and ordered the others to lie on the floor. The owner emptied the cash register into a bag, which he gave to the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>{\u00b6 89} June 19, 2002: At 12:45 a.m., two masked men with guns walked into Sugarbaker\u2019s. Donald Mercer, the owner, and Ricky Bruce, a friend of Mercer, were at a table. The gunmen ordered them to lie on the floor and produce their wallets. One robber emptied the register. The other went to collect Mercer\u2019s and Bruce\u2019s wallets. The robber placed the muzzle of his shotgun up against Bruce\u2019s neck and commanded him to hurry. The robbers then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">{\u00b6 90} Labor Day, September 2, 2002: At 11:05 p.m., a man wearing a mask and dark clothing entered the Lantern Bar through the back door. He pointed a handgun at bartender Monty Demmy and ordered him to get money from the cash register. He asked Demmy, \u201cIs this all you got?\u201d Demmy replied that business was slow due to the holiday.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">{\u00b6 91} The robber forced Demmy to open the safe, but it was empty. The robber went back to the bar, ordered the customers to place their hands on the counter, and then robbed them. When owner Rosemary Demmy pushed a \u201cpanic button,\u201d the robber fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 92} September 11, 2002: While walking to the Nite Owl Tavern, Gina Smith noticed a red Camaro with black T-tops parked on the street. (Perez owned such a car.) She saw someone inside the car donning black gloves. Between approximately 1:30 and 2:00 a.m., a masked man with a handgun came in through the back door of the Nite Owl. He told everyone in the place to \u201cget down\u201d on the floor and ordered the barmaid to give him all the money from the register. According to Smith, the gunman appeared to be the same person she had seen in the Camaro. He got away with between $300 and $400.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 93} Just before the state began its presentation of evidence on these robberies, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence was being \u201creceived only for a limited purpose\u201d and could be considered \u201conly for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the Defendant\u2019s plan to commit the offenses charged at this trial.\u201d The jury was told: \u201cYou may not use these uncharged acts for any other purpose.\u201d The court specifically instructed the jury: \u201c[Y]ou may not consider it to prove the character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character.\u201d Finally, the court instructed that Perez \u201cis on trial only for the offense of aggravated murder in this case and may not be held responsible in this case [for] any other acts.\u201d During the guilt-phase jury charge, the trial court repeated these instruction, adding that the jury could consider the other-acts evidence to prove \u201cmotive, intent, purpose or plan to commit the offense charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">{\u00b6 94} In his second proposition of law, Perez contends that evidence of the nonfatal robberies was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">{\u00b6 95} The state argues that the nonfatal robberies were relevant to show that Perez intended to kill Johnson, thus refuting Perez\u2019s claim that he did not intend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>to kill Johnson. According to the state, the nonfatal robberies show that when Perez committed robberies, he was in control of himself and did not harm compliant victims. The only two robberies in the series during which Perez fired his weapon were the Beverage Oasis and Do Drop Inn robberies, and those are also the only two during which Perez faced a victim\u2019s noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">(\u00b6 96} The admission of other-acts evidence under Evid.R. 404(B) \u201clies within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court should not disturb evidentiary decisions in the absence of an abuse of discretion that has created material prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. Diar, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, \u00b6 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">{\u00b6 97} The argument that the nonfatal bar robberies are relevant to motive and intent is a reasonable one. The trial court\u2019s decision to admit them for those purposes was not \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144. Admitting the evidence was therefore not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">{\u00b6 98} Perez further contends that the nonfatal robberies do not establish his identity as Johnson\u2019s killer, because they do not show a unique \u201cbehavioral fingerprint\u201d that could be used to identify him. But Perez\u2019s argument that the nonfatal robberies could not be considered to show identity is misdirected, because the jury was never instructed that it could consider those robberies for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">{\u00b6 99} Just before the state began its presentation of evidence on the nonfatal robberies, the trial court instructed the jury: \u201cYou are about to hear some evidence from a series of witnesses about the crimes or acts other than the evidence [sic] for which the Defendant is charged in this trial. That evidence is being received only for a limited purpose. It was not \u2014 it will not be received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cIf you find that the evidence of other crimes or acts is true and that the Defendant committed them, then you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the Defendant\u2019s plan to commit the offenses charged in this trial. You may not use these uncharged acts for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">(\u00b6 101} \u201cYour responsibility is to decide whether the Prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt only the acts charged in this case. The Defendant is on trial only for the offense of aggravated murder in this case and may not be held responsible in this case from [sic] any other acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">{\u00b6 102} The trial court essentially repeated this instruction during the guilt-phase jury charge, except for stating that the jury could consider the other-acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>evidence to prove \u201cmotive, intent, purpose or plan to commit the offense charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">{\u00b6 103} It is true that the trial court, in ruling on a defense motion <em>outside </em>the presence of the jury, indicated that the robberies shared a common modus operandi and could be introduced, among other purposes, to show the perpetrator\u2019s identity. But no such theory of relevance was ever presented to the jury. To the contrary, the jury was instructed not to use the nonfatal robberies \u201cfor any other purpose\u201d than to show motive, intent, purpose, or plan. The jury is presumed to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions. <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 75, 641 N.E.2d 1082. We overrule Perez\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">{\u00b6 104} In part B of his first proposition of law, Perez contends that the nonfatal bar robberies are not relevant to the existence of the course-of-conduct specification. R.C. 2929.04(A) provides: \u201cImposition of the death penalty for <em>aggravated murder </em>is precluded unless one or more of the following is specified in the indictment * * * and proved beyond a reasonable doubt: * * (5) * * * the offense at bar [i.e., the charged aggravated murder] was part of a course of conduct involving the <em>pwposeful killing of or attempt to kill </em>two or more persons by the offender.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 105} Thus, the \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d to be proven by the state consists of \u201cthe offense at bar\u201d \u2014 i.e., the aggravated murder to which the specification attaches\u2014 plus one or more other \u201cpurposeful killing[s] * * * or attempts] to Mil.\u201d Therefore, Perez argues, robberies in which no purposeful Mlling or attempted Mlling took place are not part of a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">{\u00b6 106} However, as the state points out, the trial court specifically refused to instruct that the nonfatal robberies were relevant to prove the course-of-conduct specification. Indeed, the trial court instructed the jury not to use the nonfatal robberies \u201cfor any other purpose\u201d than to show motive, intent, purpose, or plan. Because the trial court did not instruct the jury to consider the nonfatal robberies as course-of-conduct evidence, Perez\u2019s argument that the jury could consider them for that purpose is again misdirected. We therefore reject Part B of Perez\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">V. Admission of Spousal Communications</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">{\u00b6 107} In his third proposition of law, Perez contends that the admission at trial of his taped conversations with his wife, Debra Perez, was improper. He contends both that it violated the marital-communications privilege embodied in R.C. 2945.42 and that it denied him due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">{\u00b6 108} After police investigators learned from Robby Smith that Perez had committed the Do Drop Inn murder, they spoke with Perez\u2019s wife, Debra. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>then went to the Caesar\u2019s Creek flea market and traced the .357 Magnum used in the murder. They also went to the pawnshop where Debra had bought it and obtained the transaction record. After that, the detectives told Debra what they had and asked her to visit Perez in jail and \u201cdo some taped conversations.\u201d Debra agreed to allow her conversations with Perez to be recorded. The police recorded jailhouse conversations between Perez and Debra on October 24 and November 12, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">{\u00b6 109} Before trial, Perez filed a motion to suppress the October 24 and November 12 conversations. After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion, stating: \u201c[Wjhere the testimony of Mrs. Perez is not needed to authenticate the tapes, neither the concept of privilege nor competency apply, because the issue is not the admissibility of the testimony of Mrs. Perez regarding the statements made by the defendant to her, but of the audio tape recording of that conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>A. Applicability of the Statutory Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 110} R.C. 2945.42 provides: \u201cHusband or wife shall not testify concerning a communication made by one to the other, or act done by either in the presence of the other, during coverture, unless the communication was made or act done in the known presence or hearing of a third person competent to be a witness<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">{\u00b6 111} When Debra testified at trial, the prosecution did not ask her to repeat any statement by Perez (except one made in the presence of Robby Smith). The prosecutor disclaimed any intention to question her about the October 24 and November 11 conversations, precisely \u201cbecause * * * the statute says that she can\u2019t testify as to these communications.\u201d Thus, Perez\u2019s jailhouse conversations with Debra were introduced only through the tape recordings. That circumstance requires us to answer the following question: Does R.C. 2945.42 bar only a spouse\u2019s <em>testimony </em>concerning marital communications, or does it also bar the introduction of <em>tape recordings </em>of such communications, even where the spouse does not testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">{\u00b6 112} The R.C. 2945.42 privilege belongs to the nontestifying spouse. <em>State v. Savage </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 1, 2, 30 OBR 11, 506 N.E.2d 196. Thus, \u201c[s]pousal privilege cannot be waived unilaterally and allows a defendant to prevent his or her spouse from testifying [as to a privileged communication] unless one of the statute\u2019s exceptions applies.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 55, 2007-Ohio-4837, 873 N.E.2d 858, \u00b6 55, fn. 3. Perez contends that admitting the taped conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>tions was the \u201cequivalent\u201d of allowing Debra to testify to the content of the conversations and was thus equally impermissible under R.C. 2945.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">{\u00b6 113} But R.C. 2945.42 specifies that a \u201c[hjusband or wife shall not <em>testify </em>concerning a communication made by one to the other * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, on its face, the statute does no more than preclude a spouse from <em>testifying </em>to the other spouse\u2019s statements. The state, focusing on the actual language of R.C. 2945.42, contends that the admission of Perez\u2019s tape-recorded statements to Debra did not violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 114} In <em>People v. Fisher </em>(1993), 442 Mich. 560, 503 N.W.2d 50, the court construed Michigan\u2019s privilege statute, which provided that one spouse could not, without the other\u2019s consent, \u201c \u2018be <em>examined </em>as to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 568, 503 N.W.2d 50, quoting Michigan Codified Laws 600.2162. The court concluded that the statute did not apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">{\u00b6 115} \u201cThe statute provides that neither spouse may \u2018be examined\u2019 with respect to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage. This phrase, \u2018be examined,\u2019 connotes a narrow testimonial privilege only \u2014 a spouse\u2019s privilege against being questioned as a sworn witness about the described communications. In other words, the spouse must testify for the privilege to apply. The introduction of the marital communication through other means is not precluded.\u201d Id. at 575, 503 N.W.2d 50. Accord <em>Shults v. State </em>(1980), 96 Nev. 742, 746-747, 616 P.2d 388 (because appellant\u2019s wife was not a witness at trial, she was not \u201cexamined\u201d within contemplation of marital-communications-privilege statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">{\u00b6 116} <em>Fisher </em>noted that \u201c[t]he undisputed modern trend is toward a restrictive, rather than expansive, interpretation of the privilege.\u201d <em>Fisher </em>at 573-574, 503 N.W.2d 50. The court explained that privileges should be narrowly construed, as they conflict with the court\u2019s truth-finding function. Id. at 574-575, 503 N.W.2d 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">{\u00b6 117} Similarly, in <em>State v. Clark, </em>1997 ND 199, 570 N.W.2d 195, a state rule of evidence provided: \u201cAn accused in a criminal proceeding has a privilege to prevent <em>his spouse </em>from <em>testifying </em>as to any confidential communication between the accused and the spouse.\u201d (Emphasis added.) N.D.Evid.R. 504(b). The court held that the rule \u201cspecifically allows only the exclusion of testimony by an accused\u2019s spouse\u201d and \u201cdoes not give an accused the privilege to exclude the testimony of other witnesses about a confidential communication between the accused and his spouse.\u201d <em>Clark </em>at \u00b6 21. Accord <em>Kidd v. State </em>(1997), 330 Ark. 479, 487, 955 S.W.2d 505 (same result applying identically worded rule of evidence). See also <em>State v. Schifsky </em>(1955), 243 Minn. 533, 539-540, 69 N.W.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>89 (marital-communications-privilege statute related only to testimony by spouse as a witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 118} Other courts have found it inconsistent with the marital-communications privilege to permit marital communications to come into evidence through a third party who obtained them from, or with the help of, the recipient spouse. See <em>United States v. Neal </em>(D.Colo.1982), 532 F.Supp. 942, 949; <em>People v. Gardner </em>(1982), 105 Ill.App.3d 103, 115-116, 60 Ill.Dec. 951, 433 N.E.2d 1318; <em>Bayse v. State </em>(Miss.1982), 420 So.2d 1050, 1053-1054. \u201cJust as that spouse would not be permitted, against the will of the communicating spouse, to betray the confidence by testifying in court to the message, so he or she may not effectively destroy the privilege by out-of-court betrayal.\u201d 1 McCormick on Evidence (6th Ed.2006) 377, Section 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 119} Applying this principle, some courts have held that marital confidences surreptitiously recorded by, or with the help of, the recipient-spouse should be excluded. See <em>Hicks v. Hicks </em>(1967), 271 N.C. 204, 206-207, 155 S.E.2d 799; <em>People v. Dubanowski </em>(1979), 75 Ill.App.3d 809, 812, 31 Ill.Dec. 403, 394 N.E.2d 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 120} We agree with the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Fisher. </em>\u201cIn construing a statute, we may not add or delete words.\u201d <em>State v. Hughes </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 424, 427, 715 N.E.2d 540. R.C. 2945.42 states that a \u201c[hjusband or wife shall not testify concerning a communication made by one to the other * * Like the phrase \u201cbe examined\u201d in Michigan\u2019s statute, the word \u201ctestify\u201d in R.C. 2945.42 clearly precludes the spouse\u2019s testimony. Just as clearly, it does not preclude \u201cintroduction of the marital communication through other means.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>442 Mich, at 575, 503 N.W.2d 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">{\u00b6 121} Our holding also accords with the fundamental principle of construing privileges narrowly. Privileges are to be construed narrowly because they impede the search for truth and contravene the principle that the public has a right to everyone\u2019s evidence. See, e.g., <em>Trammel v. United States </em>(1980), 445 U.S. 40, 50, 100 S.Ct. 906, 63 L.Ed.2d 186; <em>Pierce Cty., Washington v. Guillen </em>(2003), 537 U.S. 129, 144-145, 123 S.Ct. 720, 154 L.Ed.2d 610; Am. <em>Indep. Redistricting Comm. v. Fields </em>(Ct.App.2003), 206 Ariz. 130, 75 P.3d 1088, \u00b6 14; <em>Shanabarger v. State </em>(Ind.App.2003), 798 N.E.2d 210, 215; <em>Mullins v. Commonwealth </em>(Ky.1997), 956 S.W.2d 210, 212; <em>Ballensky v. Flattum-Riemers, </em>2006 N.D. 127, 716 N.W.2d 110, \u00b6 26; <em>Guillen v. Pierce Cty. </em>(2001), 144 Wash.2d 696, 716, 31 P.3d 628, fn. 1, reversed on other grounds, <em>Pierce Cty., Washington v. Guillen, </em>537 U.S. 129, 123 S.Ct. 720, 154 L.Ed.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 122} Because the jailhouse conversations were not introduced by way of Debra\u2019s testimony, we hold that their admission did not violate R.C. 2945.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\n<em>B. Due Process Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">{\u00b6 123} Perez also argues that admitting the taped conversations denied him due process of law because it gave the prosecution \u201can unfair advantage.\u201d He makes no effort to explain <em>how </em>admitting the conversations rendered his trial unfair. Moreover, the marital-communications privilege does not derive from the United States Constitution. See <em>United States v. Doe </em>(C.A.1, 1973), 478 F.2d 194, 195; <em>Port v. Heard </em>(C.A.5, 1985), 764 F.2d 423, 430; <em>Byrd v. Armontrout </em>(C.A.8, 1989), 880 F.2d 1, 9-10; <em>United States v. Lefkowitz </em>(C.A.9, 1980), 618 F.2d 1313, 1319; <em>Rankin v. Roberts </em>(D.Kan.1992), 788 F.Supp. 521, 523, affirmed (C.A.10, 1993), 9 F.3d 117. We therefore reject Perez\u2019s due process claim and overrule his third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">VI. Confrontation Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 124} In his fifth proposition of law, Perez contends that the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right to confront Debra pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 125} The taped conversations between Perez and Debra were played during the testimony of Detective DeWine. Debra testified after DeWine, but the tapes were not played during her testimony. The defense objected to this procedure, arguing that the hearsay rule required that Debra herself be on the witness stand when the tapes were played. The trial court overruled this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 126} Perez now contends that by letting the tapes be played during DeWine\u2019s testimony and not requiring that they be played during Debra\u2019s testimony, the trial court somehow deprived him of the right to cross-examine Debra with respect to statements made by her during the taped conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 127} Perez\u2019s confrontation claim lacks merit. \u201c[W]hen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements. * * * The Clause does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 59, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, fn. 9, citing <em>California v. Green </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 149, 162, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489. See also <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 110. Perez cites no authority for his contention that the Confrontation Clause requires such a statement to be introduced <em>during </em>the testimony of the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">{\u00b6 128} Moreover, nothing would have prevented Perez from cross-examining Debra about her statements on the tapes had he chosen to do so. Under Evid.R. 611(B), cross-examination is not limited to the scope of direct examination, but may cover \u201call relevant matters.\u201d Thus, Perez could have asked Debra about the taped conversations on cross-examination, notwithstanding that they were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>introduced during her direct examination. Perez\u2019s fifth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">YII. Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 129} In his eighth proposition of law, Perez contends that the trial court made two errors in the guilt-phase instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\n<em>A. Accomplice Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">{\u00b6 130} First, Perez contends that Debra was an accomplice to his crimes and that therefore, the court should have instructed the jury accordingly. Perez concedes that Debra was not charged with complicity in his crimes, but he argues that there was sufficient evidence to charge her with aiding and abetting Perez, because she obtained and disposed of guns on his behalf and, according to Perez, knew that he was committing robberies. Therefore, he claims, the trial court should have instructed the jury that her testimony was \u201csubject to grave suspicion\u201d and must \u201cbe weighed with great caution,\u201d as required by R.C. 2923.03(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">{\u00b6 131} As Perez did not request such an instruction at trial, this issue is waived absent plain error. <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 1, 2004-Ohio-6087, 817 N.E.2d 845, \u00b6 77. We find no plain error here. In <em>State v. Wickline </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 552 N.E.2d 913, we construed former R.C. 2923.03(D), which provided: \u201cNo person shall be convicted of complicity under this section solely upon the testimony of an accomplice * * 134 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1866, 1961. We determined that \u201cat the very least, an \u2018accomplice\u2019 must be a person indicted for the crime of complicity.\u201d Id. at 118, 552 N.E.2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">{\u00b6 132} Although R.C. 2923.03(D) has been amended \u2014 it now requires only that the jury be instructed on how to evaluate accomplice testimony \u2014 there is no evidence that the General Assembly intended to change the meaning of the term \u201caccomplice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">{\u00b6 133} In any event, Debra\u2019s testimony was not important to the state\u2019s case. She identified firearm-transaction records that documented her gun purchases, admitted selling the .357 Magnum after the murder, recounted how she had helped Perez treat his wounded arm in June 2002, acknowledged that she and Perez had owned a red Camaro, and repeated Perez\u2019s boast (also testified to by Robby Smith) that he had \u201cmade the front page\u201d after Johnson\u2019s murder. Her testimony was relevant to corroborate peripheral details of the state\u2019s case, but its significance pales in comparison to Perez\u2019s tape-recorded jail conversations and his detailed confession of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">{\u00b6 134} For the foregoing reasons, the trial court did not commit plain error by failing to give an accomplice-testimony instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\n<em>B. Other-Acts Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">{\u00b6 135} Perez also contends that the trial court\u2019s other-acts instruction was insufficient. We have stated that when other-acts evidence is admitted for a limited purpose, \u201cthe jury should be instructed that such evidence must not be considered by them as any proof whatsoever that the accused did any act alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>State v. Flonnory </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St.2d 124, 129, 60 O.O.2d 95, 285 N.E.2d 726. The trial court did not give that instruction. But at trial, Perez neither objected to the other-acts instruction given nor requested a <em>Flonnory </em>instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">{\u00b6 136} Perez\u2019s failure to request an instruction waives this issue for appeal. See <em>State v. Davis </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 326, 339, 581 N.E.2d 1362. When the defense fails to request a limiting instruction on other-acts evidence, the trial court\u2019s failure to give such an instruction is not plain error when \u201c[njothing suggests that the jury used \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence to convict [the defendant] because she was a bad person.\u201d <em>State v. Diar, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, \u00b6 91, citing <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 472, 620 N.E.2d 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">{\u00b6 137} In this case, the trial judge specifically warned the jury <em>not </em>to use the other-acts evidence \u201cto prove [Perez\u2019s] character * * * in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character.\u201d In fact, the judge told the jury not to use it for any purpose but to determine the existence of \u201cmotive, intent, purpose, or plan to commit the offense charged.\u201d Thus, no plain error occurred, and Perez\u2019s objection is waived. His eighth proposition of law is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">VIII. Challenge for Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">{\u00b6 138} In his seventh proposition of law, Perez contends that the trial court incorrectly overruled his challenge for cause to a prospective juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">{\u00b6 139} During voir dire, Perez challenged Juror 1830 on the ground that he would automatically vote for a death sentence. A defendant has a constitutional right to exclude for cause any prospective juror who will automatically vote for the death penalty. <em>Morgan v. Illinois </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">{\u00b6 140} On a challenge for cause, \u201c[t]he ultimate question is whether the \u2018juror sw[ore] that he could set aside any opinion he might hold and decide the case on the evidence, and [whether] the juror\u2019s protestation of impartiality [should be] believed.\u2019 \u201d <em>White v. Mitchell </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 431 F.3d 517, 538, quoting <em>Patton v. Yount </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 1025, 1036, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847. A trial court\u2019s resolution of a challenge for cause will be upheld on appeal unless it is unsupport<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ed by substantial testimony, so as to constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 31, 553 N.E.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">{\u00b6 141} On voir dire, the prosecutor informed Juror 1830, \u201c[T]he judge is gonna give you the instructions of law as to what factors you\u2019re to consider in favor of the death penalty and what factors you are to consider not in favor of the death penalty * * The prosecutor asked whether Juror 1830 could set aside his personal opinions: \u201c[W]ill you be able to * * * follow the instructions of law and weigh the factors that the Judge gives you and follow the instructions on how you\u2019re supposed to weigh that.\u201d The juror said he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 142} The prosecutor then asked: \u201c[I]f the facts and the law justify a recommendation of something other than death, do you believe that you could put your name on a verdict form recommending something other than death?\u201d The juror answered: \u201cYes, I think I could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">{\u00b6 143} During voir dire, the defense asked Juror 1830 to explain his responses to two questions on the jury questionnaire. Question 64 asked: \u201cDo you agree or disagree with the proposition that if someone purposefully murders someone during the commission of another serious crime, like robbery, that offender should automatically, upon conviction, be sentenced to death[?]\u201d Juror 1830 checked \u201cDisagree.\u201d In the space below, asking the juror to \u201cexplain why you feel that way,\u201d Juror 1830 wrote: \u201cI do not know why I feel that way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">{\u00b6 144} Question 67 dealt with a juror\u2019s attitude toward capital punishment in general: \u201cIf you are in favor of the death penalty, please explain why.\u201d Juror 1830 wrote: \u201cIf a person is found guilty of a crime that has the death penalty, They have taken others [sic] life and they should pay with theirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">{\u00b6 145} When defense counsel asked Juror 1830 to elaborate on Question 67, he replied: \u201cWell, if they\u2019re found guilty within a reasonable doubt, you know, there\u2019s no doubt about it. * * * That\u2019s pretty much how I feel that * * * there\u2019s no, I want to say, possibility that anybody else * * * did it.\u201d This exchange followed:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">{\u00b6 146} \u201cQ. So you\u2019re convinced nobody else did it, * * * would that end the inquiry?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">{\u00b6 147} \u201cA. <em>No, </em>it all depends, like I said, what the Judge \u2014 .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">{\u00b6 148} At this point, defense counsel interrupted the juror to ask him about Question 64, where the juror had indicated that the death penalty should <em>not </em>be automatic for a purposeful killing during a felony. The juror said: \u201cYeah, <em>they shouldn\u2019t automatically </em>[be sentenced to death]. All depends on circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel then asked the juror whether he would \u201cvote for death just because they proved an aggravated murder with an aggravating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>circumstance.\u201d The juror replied: \u201cWell, it all depends on we would deliberate [sic] * * * if it was proven \u2014 I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019ve never been in that situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">{\u00b6 149} Defense counsel then asked Juror 1830 whether, once convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt, he would want to know anything else before deciding on a penalty. The juror replied: \u201cWell, if it\u2019s proven, I mean, beyond a shadow of a doubt that they\u2019re guilty and the sentence would be death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">{\u00b6 150} Almost immediately, however, the juror backtracked. Defense counsel queried:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 151} \u201cQ. * * * [A]re you telling me that if you\u2019re convinced there\u2019s no doubt about it, then the appropriate sentence would be death no matter what else that you might hear?</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 152} \u201cA. Oh, no, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. It all depends on everything else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">{\u00b6 153} Asked \u201cwhat else [he] would like to hear\u201d before voting on a sentence, Juror 1830 said: \u201cWell, I guess really it\u2019s the circumstances and why * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">{\u00b6 154} \u201cQ. Okay. What if it\u2019s been proven * * * that it\u2019s a purposeful shooting with a gun during a robbery? * * * Anything else you want to know?</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">{\u00b6 155} \u201cA. No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">{\u00b6 156} Asked whether he would consider the defendant\u2019s background, Juror 1830 said: \u201c[S]ometimes it has something to do with it,\u201d but he also said: \u201cNo. Background of the person should not. * * * If they committed [the crime] you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">{\u00b6 157} Asked whether remorse would matter, the juror initially said, \u201cNo,\u201d but then added, \u201cIt would matter, but I don\u2019t know whether it would change my verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">{\u00b6 158} Finally, defense counsel asked: \u201cI think your inclination is * * * once you get to the purposeful killing, that pretty much ends the inquiry for you?\u201d The juror replied, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">{\u00b6 159} When the judge asked Juror 1830 whether he could \u201cfollow the court\u2019s instructions and fairly consider <em>and weigh </em>both <em>the mitigating factors </em>and the aggravating circumstances in this case,\u201d the juror replied, \u201cYes, I think I can.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">{\u00b6 160} The prosecutor and the juror then had the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">{\u00b6 161} \u201cQ. * * * [I]t'all comes back to * * * what we were talking about before, personal opinion versus whether you were able to follow the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">{\u00b6 162} \u201cA. Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>{\u00b6 163} \u201cQ. When you were talking to [defense counsel], you were expressing a personal opinion. Is that a fair characterization?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">{\u00b6 164} \u201cA. I mean I can follow the instructions, I do have personal opinions about.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 165} \u201cQ. But as you\u2019re sitting here today you\u2019re telling both sides, when the Court instructs you as to the law in this case <em>and the factors to consider, </em>that you can fairly consider <em>those factors </em>as the Judge instructs you.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 166} \u201cA. Right.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">{\u00b6 167} Defense counsel challenged Juror 1830 for cause under <em>Morgan, </em>arguing: \u201cHe may have said the right words; but if you listen to what he really said, I think it\u2019s pretty clear that he will not follow the Court\u2019s instructions. He\u2019s made up his mind as to what the proper sentence should be.\u201d The trial court overruled the challenge, finding that Juror 1830\u2019s answers did not \u201cshow that he has an inability or an unwillingness to follow the Court\u2019s instructions.\u201d Instead, the trial court found that Juror 1830 \u201cwould consider circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">{\u00b6 168} Juror 1830 gave contradictory answers in his questionnaire and on voir dire. Some of his answers stated that the death penalty for robbery-murder should not be automatic and that \u201ccircumstances,\u201d such as why the defendant committed the crime, should be considered. Other answers indicated that death should be automatic if the defendant was found guilty. At still other times, Juror 1830 indicated that he did not know what he would do.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">{\u00b6 169} The record supports the trial court\u2019s ruling on the challenge for cause. It is not clear whether Juror 1830 personally favored an automatic death sentence for felony-murder, because he gave contradictory answers on this point. Nevertheless, he clearly stated that he could set his personal opinions aside, follow whatever instructions the trial court would give, and weigh the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">{\u00b6 170} Perez argues that Juror 1830\u2019s answers to \u201cgeneral questions of fairness and impartiality,\u201d <em>Morgan, </em>504 U.S. at 735, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492, cannot negate his responses indicating that he would automatically vote for death. <em>Morgan </em>cautions that \u201cautomatic death\u201d jurors, when asked \u201cgeneral questions of fairness and impartiality,\u201d may honestly believe they can uphold the law, \u201cpersonally confident that such dogmatic views are fair and impartial,\u201d and not realizing that refusal to consider mitigation is inconsistent with law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">{\u00b6 171} But here, the juror was not merely making a general promise to be fair or to uphold the law. Rather, he specifically agreed that he could follow the trial court\u2019s instructions \u201cas to the factors to consider,\u201d that he could fairly consider, <em>and weigh, </em>both the aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors as the judge instructed, and that he could set aside his personal opinions in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>{\u00b6 172} Even defense counsel granted that the juror \u201cmay have said the right words.\u201d Here, then, was a question of fact for the trial court to resolve: whether the juror meant what he said. <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 339, 744 N.E.2d 1163. As the trier of fact, the trial judge was entitled to accept Juror 1830\u2019s specific assurances that he would consider the mitigating factors in accordance with the trial court\u2019s instructions. Cf. <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 38 (trial judge entitled to accept juror\u2019s assurance that she would decide case based on the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">{\u00b6 173} The trial court\u2019s findings were supported by substantial testimony and therefore did not constitute an abuse of its discretion. <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 203, 211, 58 O.O.2d 409, 280 N.E.2d 915. Based on the totality of the voir dire, the trial court could properly conclude that regardless of his personal views, Juror 1830 would consider mitigating factors in accordance with the instructions and thus would not automatically vote for death. Hence we overrule Perez\u2019s seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">IX. Penalty-Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\n<em>A. Merger of Death Specifications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 174} In his ninth proposition of law, Perez contends that the trial court should have merged the two death specifications and thus permitted the jury to weigh only the course-of-conduct specification in the penalty phase. See generally <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph five of the syllabus (two or more aggravating circumstances will be merged where they arise from same act or indivisible course of conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">{\u00b6 175} Perez\u2019s claim is meritless. We have repeatedly held that \u201cspecifications for multiple-murder and for felony-murder represent distinct and separate aggravating circumstances\u201d are not duplicative and do not merge. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 116, 684 N.E.2d 668. See also <em>State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, \u00b6 70; <em>State v. Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, \u00b6 51-52. We overrule Perez\u2019s ninth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">\n<em>B. Scope of Proportionality Revieiv</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">{\u00b6 176} In his 11th proposition of law, Perez argues that his death sentence is disproportionate because neither Cecil Howard (who participated in the Beverage Oasis robbery) nor Debra Perez (who purchased the gun Perez used to kill Johnson) was sentenced to death. But neither Howard nor Debra Perez was charged with or convicted of aggravated murder. Their cases are not \u201csimilar cases\u201d for proportionality-review purposes. See <em>State v. Hutton, </em>100 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>176, 2003-Ohio-5607, 797 N.E.2d 948, \u00b6 94. We overrule Perez\u2019s 11th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">X. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 177} In his tenth proposition of law, Perez contends that his conviction and/or death sentence should be reversed because of prosecutorial misconduct in both the guilt and penalty phases.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 178} <em>Alleged vouching: </em>Perez contends that the prosecutor, in his guilt-phase closing argument, made two statements that improperly vouched for the police investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">{\u00b6 179} The prosecutor explained, \u201cWe go through a number of items with him [Sergeant Haytas, a police witness who secured evidence at the Beverage Oasis], things that they did not recover. Why are we doing that? We did that because * * * all you folks watch CSI. Everybody expects that our technicians are going to be able to find everything that they do on your weekly television show.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">{\u00b6 180} \u201cWhen I put evidence in before you as to what we didn\u2019t find, that\u2019s why, to let you know that we tried, that <em>those officers are doing their job as well as they can possibly do it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The defense did not object to this remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">{\u00b6 181} Because Perez failed to object at trial, this claim is waived unless the statement was plain error. An alleged error is plain error only if the error is \u201cobvious,\u201d <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240, and \u201cbut for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">{\u00b6 182} No plain error existed here. First, it is far from obvious that the prosecutor\u2019s statements constituted improper vouching. \u201cVouching occurs when the prosecutor implies knowledge of facts outside the record or places his or her personal credibility in issue.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 232. The prosecutor\u2019s statement that police were \u201cdoing their job as well as they can\u201d in investigating this case does not appear to fit this definition. The remark addressed not the credibility of the witnesses, but the thoroughness of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">{\u00b6 183} Moreover, the statement was based on the evidence at trial, not on outside-the-record evidence or the prosecutor\u2019s experience or personal opinion. \u201cThe state was entitled to present evidence regarding its methods of investigation * * * and to refer to that evidence in opening statement.\u201d <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215. \u00b6 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>{\u00b6 184} Second, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not \u201cclearly outcome-determinative.\u201d <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 268, 750 N.E.2d 90. The evidence of Perez\u2019s guilt, including his confession, was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">{\u00b6 185} A second instance of alleged vouching came when the prosecutor, discussing Perez\u2019s taped conversations with Debra, said: \u201c[T]he police had a wonderful plan because they\u2019ve brought evidence in to you that\u2019s as powerful as it comes.\u201d Again, the defense did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 186} And again, the comment was not plain error. First, the statement was not obviously erroneous. On its face, it was a comment on the strength of the state\u2019s evidence (\u201cas powerful as it comes\u201d). The comment that the police had a \u201cwonderful plan\u201d was specifically linked to the evidence (the plan was \u201cwonderful\u201d <em>because </em>it obtained \u201cpowerful\u201d evidence), did not imply knowledge of facts outside the record, and did not place the prosecutor\u2019s personal credibility in issue. Nor was it clearly outcome-determinative in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 187} <em>\u201cOther Acts\u201d Evidence: </em>Perez contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by introducing evidence of the nonfatal bar robberies. We disagree. We have already rejected Perez\u2019s claim that this evidence was erroneously admitted. Moreover, even had its admission been erroneous, it is not prosecutorial misconduct to introduce evidence that the trial court has determined to be admissible. Cf. <em>State v. Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 163 (it was not misconduct \u201cfor the prosecutor to engage in conduct that the trial court had discretion to allow and did allow\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 188} Perez also argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by presenting evidence regarding only Howard in the Beverage Oasis robbery. Perez argues that this evidence was irrelevant. We disagree. Perez was charged with attempting to kill Conley during the Beverage Oasis robbery. In his confession, Perez stated that an accomplice had participated in that robbery and was wounded during the shootout with Conley. Hence, evidence of Howard\u2019s guilt, and especially of his wounding, corroborated Perez\u2019s confession. This information was relevant to proving Perez guilty of attempted murder (and thus of the course-of-conduct specification).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">{\u00b6 189} <em>\u201cCourse of Conduct\u201d Argument: </em>In his closing argument, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">{\u00b6 190} \u201cMost of you are employed or work. I mean your job is your course of conduct. If you\u2019re a mailman, you get up, you get your bag, and you put mail in the prescribed addresses\u2019 [sic] mailbox. That is a course of conduct. That\u2019s what you do. If you\u2019re a truck driver, you take a load from one place to another, you drop it off. That is your course of conduct. You do this on a regular basis. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>is how you support yourself. It\u2019s a course of conduct. And that\u2019s what this Defendant does. He robs. That\u2019s his course of conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">{\u00b6 191} The prosecutor appeared to be arguing that the series of aggravated robberies itself constituted the \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d with which Perez was charged in this case. Perez contends that this argument misstated the law. Again, however, Perez did not object to it at trial. Thus, his claim is waived unless the prosecutor\u2019s argument was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 192} The trial judge correctly instructed the jury regarding what constitutes a \u201ccourse of conduct.\u201d He instructed that the jury \u201cmust find * * * that the aggravated murder was part of a course of conduct <em>involving a purposeful killing of or an attempt to kill two or more persons.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) He continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">{\u00b6 193} \u201cIn order to find that two or more offenses constitutes [sic] a single course of conduct, you * * * must discern some connection, common scheme, or some pattern or psychological thread that ties the offenses together. Thus, for instance, the factual link might be one of time, location, <em>murder weapon, or cause of death. </em>It might involve the <em>killing </em>of victims who are close in age or who are related. It might involve a similar motivation on the <em>killer\u2019s </em>part for his crimes, a common getaway car, or perhaps a similar pattern of secondary crimes <em>involving each victim.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 194} The emphasized language in this instruction made it clear to the jury that a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d for purposes of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) specification is not simply any regular pattern of activity, such as robbery, but must involve the purposeful killing or attempted killing of two or more persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">(\u00b6 195} Moreover, the evidence of guilt was overwhelming as to the course-of-conduct specification. There was no question that Perez murdered Johnson and tried to Mil Conley. Given the surrounding circumstances, the murder of Johnson and attempted murder of Conley clearly constituted \u201ca course of conduct involving the purposeful MUing of or attempt to Mil two * * * persons.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). (See our discussion of Perez\u2019s second proposition of law.) Thus the prosecutor\u2019s argument was not plain error, because it was not clearly outcome-determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">{\u00b6 196} <em>Intent Argument: </em>Perez also argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing that \u201cintent was demonstrated by Perez\u2019s statements made after the crime which demonstrated lack of remorse.\u201d The prosecutor quoted Robby Smith\u2019s testimony that Perez had told him Johnson \u201cwas gurgling\u201d after being shot. The prosecutor argued \u201cthat somebody doesn\u2019t make that kind of comment to their stepson * * * unless they\u2019re proud of what they did. It\u2019s another statement of intent.\u201d Perez did not object at trial, so this issue is waived absent plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>{\u00b6 197} We find no plain error. Both prosecutors and defense counsel are entitled to \u201cwide latitude in summation as to what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State v. Stephens </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 76, 82, 53 O.O.2d 182, 263 N.E.2d 773. The prosecutor\u2019s inference here was not unreasonable. Indeed, we think it quite logical to suppose that a person who had killed someone unintentionally would regret it \u2014 or at any rate would not boast or speak flippantly about it. Perez also argues that by making the above argument, the prosecutor \u201cpurposefully misstated the evidence.\u201d Here, Perez is simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">{\u00b6 198} <em>Penalty-phase arguments: </em>Perez claims that the prosecutor committed three acts of misconduct in the state\u2019s penalty-phase closing argument. Perez did not object to any of these arguments at trial and thus cannot prevail unless one of them constituted plain error. We find no plain error in the cited remarks. Hence, Perez\u2019s claim is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 199} Perez\u2019s tenth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">XL Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 200} In his sixth proposition of law, Perez claims that he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. To establish ineffective assistance, Perez must show (1) deficient performance by counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 201} Perez divides his ineffective-assistance claims into four categories: voir dire, guilt phase, penalty phase, and failures to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">{\u00b6 202} <em>Voir Dire: </em>Perez contends that his counsel performed deficiently by failing to question the jurors about racial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">{\u00b6 203} At trial, Perez\u2019s stepson testified that Perez had told him that he had shot Ronald Johnson because Johnson \u201ccalled him the N word.\u201d Perez made a similar claim in his confession to police. On the other hand, three witnesses to the murder testified at trial, and none of them mentioned any such slur. They did, however, describe the assailants as having covered themselves in black, including toboggan masks and gloves. In closing argument, the state briefly mentioned the alleged racial slur while discussing Perez\u2019s motives for shooting Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">{\u00b6 204} Perez claims his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to ask prospective jurors whether they would harbor any bias against Perez because his victim, Johnson, was white. (Perez\u2019s race is not clear from the record.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>According to Perez, the existence of a racial issue made it \u201cessential\u201d that defense counsel question the venire on racial prejudice. Cf. <em>Turner v. Murray </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 28, 36-37, 106 S.Ct. 1683, 90 L.Ed.2d 27 (capital defendant accused of interracial crime is entitled, upon request, to have prospective jurors informed of the victim\u2019s race and questioned on racial bias).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">{\u00b6 205} Perez cites <em>Turner </em>as a case vacating a death sentence because of a \u201crisk\u201d that racial prejudice may have affected the sentencing. But his reliance on <em>Turner </em>is misplaced. <em>\u201cTurner </em>held only that the defense was <em>entitled </em>to engage in racial-bias inquiry, not that defense counsel <em>must </em>do so in order to effectively assist their client.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 206} Instead of automatically finding ineffective assistance because defense counsel did not conduct voir dire on possible racial bias, we must apply the usual <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffective assistance. In doing so, we are mindful that \u201c[cjounsel\u2019s actions during <em>voir dire </em>are presumed to be matters of trial strategy.\u201d <em>Miller v. Francis </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 269 F.3d 609, 615. Thus, we have recognized that \u201cthe actual decision to voir dire on racial prejudice is a choice best left to a capital defendant\u2019s counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 323, 327, 731 N.E.2d 645, citing <em>Turner, </em>476 U.S. at 37, 106 S.Ct. 1683, 90 L.Ed.2d 27, and fn. 10. \u201cIn these situations, we normally defer to counsel\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Smith </em>at 328, 731 N.E.2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6207} In this case, it was neither deficient nor prejudicial for counsel to decline to ask racial-bias questions. To begin with, defense counsel had to weigh the risks inherent in interrogating prospective jurors on the sensitive question of racial prejudice. See <em>Smith, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 328, 731 N.E.2d 645; <em>Commonwealth v. Henry </em>(1997), 550 Pa. 346, 368, 706 A.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">{\u00b6 208} Here, there was little reason for defense counsel to run these risks, because racial issues were not central to this case. There were only three direct references at trial to Perez\u2019s racial-slur allegation; each reference was brief, and none of them came from the eyewitness testimony. Because racial issues were peripheral to the trial of this case, defense counsel could quite reasonably determine that the potential costs of conducting voir dire on racial prejudice outweighed any possible benefit from such a course. Accordingly, we find no deficient performance, and we reject this ineffective-assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">{\u00b6 209} <em>Guilt Phase-. </em>During his opening statement, Perez\u2019s counsel stated that Perez had confessed \u201cbecause he knew that there\u2019s no dispute about what happened. There is no serious dispute about what happened or who did it. Mr. Perez knows that in all probability, you 12 jurors will reach the second phase of this trial and you will deliberate on whether to put him to death or not.\u201d Perez contends that it was ineffective assistance to concede guilt, particularly since he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>claims there were \u201cvalid issues concerning the validity of the course of conduct charge\u201d that defense counsel should have argued to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">{\u00b6210} \u201cConceding guilt in a capital case does not necessarily constitute deficient performance.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 210, 2006-Ohio-6404, 858 N.E.2d 1144, \u00b6 134, citing <em>Florida v. Nixon </em>(2004), 543 U.S. 175, 190-191, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565. \u201cAttorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendant\u2019s guilt is often clear. * * * In such cases, \u2018avoiding execution [may be] the best and only realistic result possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nixon, </em>543 U.S. at 191, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565, quoting ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, Section 10.9.1, Commentary (Rev.Ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L.Rev. (2003) 913, 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">{\u00b6 211} In this case, Perez\u2019s guilt was clear. In his videotaped confession to police, he admitted that he killed Johnson during the Do Drop Inn robbery and fired at Conley during the Beverage Oasis robbery. This confession was supplemented by his admissions to his wife (which defense counsel unsuccessfully sought to exclude), daughter, and stepson.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 212} Other evidence strongly corroborated Perez\u2019s guilt. Eyewitness accounts of the robberies were basically consistent with Perez\u2019s admissions. George Remmer\u2019s shotgun, which Perez had borrowed, was found at the Beverage Oasis. A month before the Do Drop Inn robbery, Perez\u2019s wife had bought a .357 Magnum \u2014 the same kind of gun Perez admitted using to kill Johnson. Two days after that robbery, she got rid of the Magnum. Perez said that Cecil Howard had been \u201cshot in the butt\u201d in the Beverage Oasis shootout; Howard indeed carried a bullet in his body in the same general area that Perez had mentioned. Robby Smith testified that Perez kept masks in his closet and that he had seen Perez with a mask. Given this evidence, it was rational for defense counsel to concede that Perez had committed the acts in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6 213} But Perez argues that his attorneys should have at least contested the course-of-conduct specification, rather than conceding that the jury would probably \u201creach the second phase of [the] trial.\u201d However, the evidence clearly established the existence of a course of conduct involving two intentional killings or attempts to kill. (See the discussion of Perez\u2019s first proposition of law.) Moreover, Perez ignores the fact that he was charged with <em>two </em>death specifications, and the felony-murder specification was also supported by overwhelming evidence. Thus, even had counsel elected to challenge the course-of-conduct specification, they could still rationally concede that \u201cin all probability,\u201d the trial would reach the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 214} Confession: Next, Perez argues that his attorneys erred when they \u201cemphasized\u201d his taped confession in their opening and closing statements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>because the confession was \u201cdamaging evidence.\u201d However, the defense strategy was to concede that Perez had killed Johnson, to try the guilt phase on the issue of intent to kill, and simultaneously to stress possible mitigating factors, such as remorse, in anticipation of the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 215} Defense counsel\u2019s references to the confession were consistent with that strategy. Counsel argued that the confession showed Perez\u2019s remorse, which is a mitigating factor, and that the confession indicated a lack of intent on his part to kill Johnson. Defense counsel could not prevent the jury from considering that confession. They had tried, and failed, to get it suppressed. Hence, it was reasonable, and not deficient performance, to stress any favorable facts or inferences that might be strained from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 216} <em>Cross-examination: </em>Perez claims that his counsel did not adequately cross-examine Debra. Perez notes that Debra was not charged with any crimes even though she had bought guns for him, treated his wound after the Beverage Oasis shootout, and disposed of the murder weapon. Thus, Perez argues that his counsel, when cross-examining Debra, should have focused on whether the state had promised her immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">{\u00b6 217} Perez fails to show prejudice on this issue. Nothing in the record justifies an inference that the state promised Debra immunity. Thus, Perez can only speculate on what Debra\u2019s response to such questions would have been. Such speculation is insufficient to establish ineffective assistance. <em>State v. Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 219. See also <em>State v. Elmore, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, 857 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 121 (failure to call witness was not ineffective assistance when it was totally speculative whether witness could have given favorable testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 218} Perez also argues that his counsel should have cross-examined Debra regarding the taped conversations between her and Perez. But he never says what he thinks they should have asked her. Presumably, Perez means to argue that his counsel should have cross-examined Debra about statements she made during those conversations. (See the discussion of Perez\u2019s fifth proposition of law.) But if that is Perez\u2019s intended argument, he fails to support it by pointing to any particular statements that counsel should have cross-examined Debra about. Perez\u2019s vague claim gives us no basis on which we can either evaluate counsel\u2019s performance or address the question of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">{\u00b6 219} Finally, Perez claims that his counsel should have requested an accomplice-testimony instruction as to Debra. But as we explained in discussing Perez\u2019s eighth proposition of law, Perez was not entitled to such an instruction. See <em>State v. Wickline </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 118, 552 N.E.2d 913 (\u201cat the very least, an \u2018accomplice\u2019 must be a person indicted for the crime of complicity\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Hence, this claim fails to establish either deficient performance or prejudice under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 220} <em>Penalty Phase-. </em>An attorney who fails to conduct a reasonable investigation into the defendant\u2019s history and background provides ineffective assistance. Perez contends that his trial counsel presented inadequate mitigating evidence as a result of their inadequate investigation of his history and background. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 328, 2004-Ohio-1585, 805 N.E.2d 1042, \u00b6 60, citing <em>Wiggins v. Smith </em>(2003), 539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471, and <em>Williams v. Taylor </em>(2000), 529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 221} Defense counsel called only one witness in the penalty phase: Ray J. Paris, Perez\u2019s stepfather, whose testimony on direct examination occupies only about four pages of transcript. Paris testified that Perez\u2019s parents were not around much during his childhood and that Perez\u2019s late mother had been a prostitute. He also begged the jury to spare Perez\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 222} Perez contends that defense counsel should have presented \u201cinformation to assist [the jury] in understanding the dynamic within the family or the family history of dysfunction.\u201d Perez further contends that counsel should have investigated his possible \u201cmental health issues\u201d on the basis of Perez\u2019s recorded statements. In a taped conversation with Debra, Perez mentioned that he had been found competent to stand trial on the unrelated case in which he was being held. In his confession, he told detectives that he had \u201cmajor mental issues\u201d and took \u201ceight pills every night\u201d for \u201c[b]ipolar, mental psychosis.\u201d But he also said that he had not been on any medication and was not having any \u201cissues\u201d on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">{\u00b6 223} Perez has the burden of demonstrating that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Gondor, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">{\u00b6 224} Perez cites nothing in the record to show that his counsel conducted a less than adequate investigation. The record shows that the court granted Perez\u2019s motion to hire a defense investigator, a psychologist, and a mitigation specialist. Beyond that, the record does not show the extent of counsel\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">{\u00b6 225} We also note that Perez underwent a competency evaluation in this case. The resulting psychiatric report states that Perez was raised in group homes and juvenile facilities and that he reported a childhood history of physical abuse and marijuana use. Perez also reported hallucinations and suicidal and paranoid ideation. The report also cites indications of malingering and concludes that Perez had no serious psychiatric disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>{\u00b6 226} While this report shows some possible mitigating factors, the record does not show that Perez\u2019s counsel failed to investigate those factors. We \u201ccannot infer a defense failure to investigate from a silent record.\u201d <em>State v. Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6244. Thus, the record fails to support Perez\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 227} Perez also claims that his counsel\u2019s penalty-phase argument discounted the importance of what mitigating evidence did exist concerning his childhood and mental health. Defense counsel stated: \u201cWe told you when we started this case his [Johnson\u2019s] death was senseless, and we offer no excuses. It\u2019s not anybody else\u2019s fault but Kerry Perez. We told you that when we started. I tell you that again today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 228} \u201c[H]is mom was a prostitute; that\u2019s not an excuse. We wanted you to know some of the things about his childhood, but that\u2019s not an excuse. That didn\u2019t cause him to do what he did, and so I make no excuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 229} This line of argument appears to reflect a decision to downplay Perez\u2019s background as a mitigating factor while emphasizing other factors, such as Perez\u2019s cooperation with the police and his loyalty to his wife. By doing so, defense counsel was able to project an image of candor, reason, and acceptance of responsibility, without making any really damaging concession. This decision was not professionally unreasonable. Moreover, Perez fails to show prejudice, as it cannot be said that there was a reasonable likelihood of a different outcome in the penalty phase had defense counsel eschewed the \u201cno excuses\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">{\u00b6 230} <em>Failure to object and failure to request </em>instructions: Perez claims that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct in both phases of trial, as discussed in regard to his eighth and tenth propositions of law. However, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object does not necessarily constitute ineffective assistance, and we have found no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">{\u00b6 231} Perez contends that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to allegedly improper jury instructions on other-acts evidence was ineffective assistance. But for the reasons stated previously, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">{\u00b6 232} In sum, Perez fails to demonstrate ineffective assistance. His sixth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">XII. Settled Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">{\u00b6 233} In part D of his first proposition, Perez claims that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) course-of-conduct specification is unconstitutionally vague. We summarily reject this claim. See <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>{\u00b6 234} In his 12th proposition, Perez attacks the trial court\u2019s reasonable-doubt instructions, which the court gave in accordance with R.C. 2901.05. We have repeatedly rejected such arguments. See <em>State v. Diar, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, \u00b6 122. See also <em>Buell v. Mitchell </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 274 F.3d 337, 366. Perez\u2019s 12th proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 235} In his 13th proposition, Perez attacks the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. We have repeatedly rejected these claims. See <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Mapes </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 108, 116-117, 19 OBR 318, 484 N.E.2d 140; <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 137-138, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 125, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383; <em>State v. Durr </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 97, 568 N.E.2d 674; <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 374-376, 582 N.E.2d 972; <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 426, 613 N.E.2d 212; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 101, 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643. They are summarily overruled. See <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus; <em>State v. Spisak </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 80, 82, 521 N.E.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">XIII. Independent Sentence Review</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">{\u00b6 236} Under R.C. 2929.05, we must independently review Perez\u2019s death sentence. The court must determine whether the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances, whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors, and whether the death sentence is proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">\n<em>A. Aggravating Circumstance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">{\u00b6 237} Perez was convicted of two aggravating circumstances: course of conduct, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and felony-murder, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The evidence supports Perez\u2019s convictions of both specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">\n<em>B. Mitigating Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">{\u00b6 238} In the penalty phase, Perez waived his right to make an unsworn statement and called only one witness: his stepfather, Ray J. Paris. Paris has known Perez since Perez was four years old, when Paris married Perez\u2019s mother, Mary Lee. Although Paris and Mary Lee \u201csplit up after two years,\u201d Perez continued to live with Paris until age 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">{\u00b6 239} Paris testified that Perez\u2019s father \u201cwas never around him that much.\u201d Perez\u2019s mother also \u201cwasn\u2019t around him.\u201d She was engaged in prostitution and was arrested for that offense in Springfield and in Columbus, Kentucky. She had been dead for about 20 years at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>{\u00b6 240} Paris testified that he had provided a \u201cvery good home\u201d for Perez until Perez was 12, that he \u201cwatched out for\u201d Perez \u201cquite a bit\u201d even after Perez no longer lived with him, and that he had been a mentor for Perez and had always remained available for Perez to talk to, even up to the present day. On cross-examination, Paris testified that he had also mentored other youths and had raised several of his own children, who had all turned out \u201creal well.\u201d Paris further testified that he had set an example for Perez by working, serving in the Army, and being involved in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">{\u00b6 241} Finally, Paris begged the jury to spare Perez\u2019s life. He testified that he had come to the trial, even though it was physically difficult for him: \u201cIt\u2019s very important that I be here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 242} At the request of the defense, the trial judge instructed on the following factors as mitigating: \u201cThe nature and circumstance of the offense; the history, character, and background of the Defendant; and his remorse; his willingness to step forward and take responsibility for his actions without any offer of leniency by the State; his assistance to and cooperation with the police; his probability of no release from prison; his family history and background; his poor family environment.\u201d In closing argument, defense counsel stressed Perez\u2019s loyalty to his wife in confessing so that she would not be arrested and also mentioned his loyalty to Cecil Howard, his crime partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\n<em>C. Weighing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">{\u00b6 243} No mitigating factors appear in the nature and circumstances of the offense. Perez shot Johnson during an armed robbery. Even had Johnson forcibly resisted the robbery, that fact would not be mitigating. See <em>State v. Clark </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 252, 263, 527 N.E.2d 844. But Johnson did not resist. Discounting Perez\u2019s uncorroborated and self-serving claim about the racial slur, Perez admitted that he shot Johnson simply because \u201c[h]e looked and [he] moved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 244} Perez\u2019s difficult childhood \u2014 a broken home, absent parents \u2014 is a mitigating factor. See, e.g., <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 456, 709 N.E.2d 140. It is true that Perez was somewhat luckier than others in similar circumstances, in that he apparently had a decent and caring stepfather to help raise him. However, he lived with his stepfather only until he was 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">{\u00b6 245} Nevertheless, we \u201chave seldom given decisive weight to\u201d a defendant\u2019s unstable or troubled childhood. <em>State v. Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 265. We note that Perez was 37 years old when he killed Johnson. In other words, \u201c[h]e had reached \u2018an age when * * * maturity could have intervened,\u2019 and [Perez] \u2018had clearly made life choices as an adult before committing [this] murder.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 53, 765 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>N.E.2d 334, quoting <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 588, 605 N.E.2d 884 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">{\u00b6 246} Perez had the love and support of his stepfather. A capital defendant\u2019s sharing a loving, caring relationship with a close family member may be a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) (other factors relevant to the issue). See <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">{\u00b6 247} \u201cA defendant\u2019s confession and cooperation with law enforcement are mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6 191. However, we assign little weight in mitigation to Perez\u2019s confession. Perez initially lied to police, denying his own guilt and trying to blame John McGhee. Cf. <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 195, 631 N.E.2d 124 (defendant confessed only after initially denying involvement; confession entitled to no weight); <em>State v. Hoffner, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-3430, 811 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 119 (defendant confessed, but had previously misled police as to his involvement). He did not confess until the investigating officers convinced him that they could prove his guilt. Id. (defendant confessed only after being implicated in the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">{\u00b6 248} Perez\u2019s loyalty to his wife \u2014 his willingness to ultimately confess in order to save her from trouble he helped get her into \u2014 may arguably be entitled to some weight under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). It indicates, at least, some sense of responsibility for someone other than himself. On the other hand, his initial lying diminishes the weight of this factor. On balance, this factor is not impressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">{\u00b6 249} The record contains some evidence of remorse. In his confession, Perez expressed a \u201cwhole bunch\u201d of \u201cregrets.\u201d He said he \u201cthought about this * * * every night\u201d: \u201cKick myself * * * every night.\u201d He wished the murder had not taken place or that he could \u201ctake it back.\u201d He said he felt better for having confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">{\u00b6 250} Similarly, in his tape-recorded phone conversation with Debra after his confession, Perez said that he had been \u201cthinking about this,\u201d and confessing had \u201clifted off\u2019 a \u201cbig weight.\u201d He remarked that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s a family out there that wants to know why that guy was killed * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">{\u00b6 251} In his August 23, 2004 letter to Sherry Alspaugh, Perez wrote: \u201cAbout killing that guy. I feel very bad for that, that\u2019s something that I never wish to have taken place. But I also know there isn\u2019t anything I can do about it. How would you feel about me if all I did was cry &amp; cry some more about everything I ever did? That just isn\u2019t me!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">{\u00b6 252} The sincerity and depth of Perez\u2019s remorse is questionable. His tardy, half-hearted, and self-serving expressions of remorse are belied by his callous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>flippant attitude just after the murder. Remorse deserves very slight weight in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\">\n<em>D. Proportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">{\u00b6 253} Finally, under our duty to independently consider whether the sentence imposed herein is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,\u201d R.C. 2929.05, we find that Perez\u2019s death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate. We have upheld death sentences in several cases combining a course-of-conduct specification with a robbery-murder specification. See <em>State v. Beuke </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 29, 45, 526 N.E.2d 274 (course of conduct involved one murder and two attempted murders); <em>State v. Hicks </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 72, 81, 538 N.E.2d 1030; <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 419, 575 N.E.2d 167; <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 339, 351, 612 N.E.2d 1227; <em>State v. Otte </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 555, 568-569, 660 N.E.2d 711; <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 577, 687 N.E.2d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 254} Indeed, we have approved death sentences in cases involving only a robbery-murder specification. See, e.g., <em>State v. Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 278; <em>State v. Lindsey </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 479, 492, 721 N.E.2d 995; <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 395, 513 N.E.2d 754, fn. 10. We have also approved death sentences in cases involving a course-of-conduct specification when, as here, the defendant committed one murder and one attempted murder. See <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 210, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264; <em>State v. Sowell </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 322, 337, 530 N.E.2d 1294; <em>State v. Dennis </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 421, 437, 683 N.E.2d 1096; <em>State v. Filiaggi </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 230, 253, 714 N.E.2d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 255} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b340-9\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\">. Perez argues that the two were \u201cdifferent types of businesses\u201d because the Beverage Oasis was a drive-through store instead of a bar. We think otherwise. The Beverage Oasis name, along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>its numerous signs advertising beer, wine, and Zima (thoroughly documented by crime-scene photographs in the record), shows that it was engaged in the business of selling liquor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-11\">. At trial, the state argued that the murder of Johnson and the attempted murder of Conley are also linked as part of Perez\u2019s broader pattern of committing robberies, including the nonfatal robberies. However, the state has abandoned that theory in this appeal. As the state\u2019s brief points out, the trial court excluded that theory from the case by refusing the prosecution\u2019s request to instruct the jury on it. We need not, therefore, determine whether such a link could be relevant to the existence of a course of conduct under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\">. For some reason, Perez cites R.C. 2317.02(D) instead of R.C. 2945.42, which specifically applies to criminal prosecutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b340-10\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AkI\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">{\u00b6 256} I concur in judgment. I write separately to emphasize aspects of the majority opinion that I find troubling.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">{\u00b6 257} I continue to be concerned about how prosecutors employ and this court addresses course-of-conduct death specifications. In this case, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder occurred during an aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). This death specification was sufficient to procure a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>death sentence, rendering it unnecessary for the prosecutor to charge Perez with an attenuated course-of-conduct death specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). See <em>State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, at \u00b6 130 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting); <em>State v. Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, at \u00b6 111-116 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">{\u00b6 258} If this court continues to treat course-of-conduct specifications as expansively as it has, no jeopardy is likely to befall the prosecutors bringing them. Nevertheless, charging a course-of-conduct death specification when another specification is chargeable and relatively easy to prove is unnecessary to effect justice, uneconomical as to prosecutorial and judicial resources, and unlikely to benefit the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">{\u00b6 259} In <em>Scott, </em>\u201c[t]he two murders were unrelated, occurred 19 days apart, and involved two people that had no relation to each other. The two murders were not committed in a similar way, were not committed in the same transaction, and were not committed for a common reason. In short, the only thing the two murders had in common was the murderer.\u201d Id., 101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, at \u00b6 113 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). In <em>Sapp, </em>\u201c[t]he murder of Anderson occurred over a year after and was not related in any way to the murders of Morrow and Leach.\u201d Id., 105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, at \u00b6 130 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). In this case, the murder of Ronald Johnson occurred several months after the shooting at the Beverage Oasis. Although both incidents involved a robbery and the use of masks and guns to effect the robbery, little else binds them. One establishment was a retail store, the other a bar; one shooting was at an owner, the other of a customer; one involved Perez chasing employees, the other did not; one involved an armed victim who shot first, the other did not; even the guns used in the two crimes were different. Although both crimes were committed at night, one was as employees were closing, and the other involved an open-for-business bar. In short, there are no particularized facts that suggest that the first and second incidents were part of a course of conduct, especially when the eight-month gap is considered. There is no factual link \u201c \u2018of time, location, murder weapon, or cause of death.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 161, quoting <em>Sapp </em>at \u00b6 52. The course-of-conduct death specification in this case should not have been charged, should not have been presented to the jury, and should not be affirmed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6260} Equally troubling is that the trial court allowed the prosecution to present evidence of several robberies that did not involve murder or attempted murder to help prove the course-of-conduct death specification. The prosecutor had an extremely strong case on the aggravated-robbery specification. Why would he put this case at risk by presenting such potentially prejudicial \u201cother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>acts\u201d evidence? Why introduce evidence of crimes that did not involve a murder or attempted murder to prove a \u201ccourse of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons\u201d? R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). And most important of all, why would this court stamp its imprimatur on this unnecessary and improper use of other-acts evidence?</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AH82\">Stephen A. Schumaker, Clark County Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b342-8\">Timothy Young, Ohio Public Defender, Pamela J. Prude-Smithers, Supervisor, Death Penalty Division, and Brie A. Friedman and Robert K. Lowe, Assistant Public Defenders, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 261} Finally, I am baffled by the treatment of the marital-communications privilege contained in R.C. 2945.42, which allows a defendant to prevent the testimony of his or her spouse \u201cconcerning a communication made by one to the other, or act done by either in the presence of the other, during coverture.\u201d According to the majority opinion, although the privilege prohibits testimony about a spousal conversation, it does not prohibit the introduction of a tape recording of the actual conversation. What an insidious distinction! It eviscerates the intent behind the privilege and is in some ways worse than the admission of testimony. If a spouse testifies, the defendant at least has a right to cross-examine. Although I believe that the use of the tape recording was improper, I would deem the use of it to be harmless error given Perez\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 262} I concur in the judgment affirming the death sentence for the aggravated-robbery death specification. I dissent as to the imposition of the death sentence for the course-of-conduct death specification.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
