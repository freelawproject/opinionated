The recommendation is based on the board\u2019s findings that respondent had commingled her funds with her clients\u2019 funds and that she had failed to notify clients that she had no malpractice insurance. We accept the findings that respondent violated ethical standards incumbent on Ohio lawyers and that a one-year suspension stayed on conditions, including two years of probation, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Allen County Bar Association, charged respondent with professional misconduct, including failure to comply with requirements for safekeeping client funds held in trust, which prior to February 1, 2007, were set forth in DR 9-102 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and now appear in Prof.Cond.R. 1.15. (See Appendix.) The parties stipulated that respondent violated DR 9-102 and Prof.Cond.R. 1.15 and also DR 1-104 and Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(c), both requiring that lawyers notify clients that they do not maintain malpractice insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>{\u00b6 4} A panel of three board members heard the case and accepted respondent\u2019s admission to violations of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15 and 1.4(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The panel recommended that respondent be suspended from practice for one year, all stayed on the conditions that she (1) commit no further misconduct during the stayed suspension, (2) complete six hours of continuing legal education (\u201cCLE\u201d) in law-practice management and proper use of a client trust account, (3) conform her office and accounting procedures to professional standards acceptable to relator, (4) submit for relator\u2019s review a certified public accountant\u2019s independent audit of her client trust account, (5) provide proof to relator that she has filed all delinquent tax returns, and (6) complete a two-year probation under the oversight of a monitor appointed by relator. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">{\u00b6 5} The parties do not object to the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\u25a0Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">{\u00b6 6} The board adopted this summary of the parties\u2019 factual stipulations as to DR 9-102 and Prof.Cond.R. 1.15:</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cRespondent filed a lawsuit in the Allen County Common Pleas Court alleging that she purchased numerous vehicles, made payments, but had not received the vehicles\u2019 titles. Respondent attached copies of checks to the complaint. The checks were from both her IOLTA [Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust Accounts] account and her office operating account. These checks were issued in September, October, and November of 2003. The lawsuit was filed in April, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe parties stipulated that the respondent used accumulated earned fees still deposited in her IOLTA account and not client funds to purchase several vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cRespondent does not maintain appropriate record keeping for her IOLTA account. There are no specific records for each client other than cancelled checks and monthly bank statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">{\u00b6 10} More specifically, respondent acknowledged that she had violated DR 9-102 and Prof.Cond.R. 1.15 by \u201c(1) failing to promptly withdraw earned fees from her IOLTA account (commingling personal funds with those of clients), (2) failing to maintain client ledgers and other records showing ongoing client and collective IOLTA account balances, (3) failing to maintain complete records and perform monthly reconciliation of the IOLTA account, and (4) using her IOLTA account to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>pay non-legal related expenses (including expenses related to a restaurant she co-owned and operated).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">{\u00b6 11} The board further found that prior to the disciplinary proceedings, respondent' had never maintained professional-liability insurance, nor had she ever notified her clients of that fact, as required by DR 1-104 and Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(c). The board noted, however, that as of May 11, 2009, respondent had obtained a professional-liability insurance policy affording more coverage than specified in the rules. Respondent acknowledged that prior to May 11, 2009, she had violated DR 1-104 and Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">{\u00b6 12} We accept respondent\u2019s admission to conduct that constitutes continuing violations of DR 9-102 and Prof.Cond.R. 1.15 and DR 1-104 and Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">{\u00b6 13} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and sanctions imposed in similar eases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d) 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">{\u00b6 14} In reviewing sanctions imposed in similar cases, the board cited <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Halliburton-Cohen </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 217, 761 N.E.2d 1040, and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Croushore, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 156, 2006-Ohio-412, 841 N.E.2d 781. In <em>Halliburton-Cohen, </em>we ordered a lawyer\u2019s suspension from practice for one year, but stayed the suspension on the conditions that the lawyer submit to monitored probation and that she \u201cconform her office and accounting procedures to professional standards acceptable to relator.\u201d In <em>Croushore, </em>we ordered a lawyer\u2019s suspension from practice for one year, but stayed the suspension on the condition that he submit to two years of monitored probation, including monitoring of his IOLTA account records.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">{\u00b6 15} Like respondent, the lawyers in both of these cases failed for years to properly account for and maintain client funds entrusted to them for safekeeping. But also like respondent, they did so out of ignorance of professional bookkeeping responsibilities, not dishonesty. Unlike the lawyers in those cases, however, respondent also failed in her duty to notify clients that she lacked malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>insurance, and evidence adduced at the hearing established a further failure to file various tax returns for the past several years. In mitigation, however, neither respondent nor the lawyers in <em>Halliburton-Cohen </em>and <em>Croushore </em>had prior disciplinary records, and all cooperated appropriately during the disciplinary proceedings. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">{\u00b6 16} We find the dispositions in <em>Halliburton-Cohen </em>and <em>Croushore </em>instructive. Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year; however, the suspension is stayed on the conditions that during the stay, respondent (1) commit no further misconduct, (2) complete, in addition to the requirements of Gov.Bar R. X, six hours of CLE in law-practice management and the proper use of a client trust account, (3) conform her office and accounting procedures to professional standards acceptable to relator, (4) submit for relator\u2019s review a certified public accountant\u2019s independent audit of her client trust account, (5) provide proof to relator that she has filed all delinquent tax returns, and (6) complete under the oversight of a monitor appointed by relator a two-year probation pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(9). If respondent fails to comply with the conditions of the stay and probation, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the one-year suspension from practice. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-6\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">{\u00b6 17} Prof.Cond.R. 1.15 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property.

Except as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client or a third person, confirmed in writing, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive.
