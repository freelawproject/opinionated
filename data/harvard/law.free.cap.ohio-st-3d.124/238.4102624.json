Barb is not entitled to the requested records because he did not comply with R.C. 149.43(B)(8), which requires a finding by Barb\u2019s sentencing judge or the judge\u2019s successor that the requested information is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim. <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Thornton, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 409, 2006-Ohio-5858, 856 N.E.2d 966, \u00b6 16. Although we acknowledge that a person\u2019s status as a designee and the person\u2019s purpose in obtaining records are not normally issues in public-records cases, see <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 427, 639 N.E.2d 83, R.C. 149.43(B)(8) provides an exception in which incarcerated persons and the purpose for which they seek records relating to a criminal investigation or prosecution are dispositive. <em>Steckman </em>is further inapposite here because Barb\u2019s purported designee did not institute the mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-12\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
