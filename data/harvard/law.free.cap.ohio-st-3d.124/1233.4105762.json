In his response to that order, the appellant points to the statement in his notice of appeal that the BTA denied relief to the appellant by \u201cimproperly interpreting every instance of fact laid out\u201d by the appellant in his notice of appeal to the BTA. We hold that that statement fails to set forth errors of the BTA as required by R.C. 5717.04, and we therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">{\u00b6 2} An \u201cassignment of error in a notice of appeal does not confer jurisdiction if \u2018the errors set out are such as might be advanced in nearly any case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Levin, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-Ohio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 18, quoting <em>Queen City Valves, Inc. v. Peck, </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 579, 583, 53 O.O. 430, 120 N.E.2d 310; see also <em>Richter Transfer Co. v. Bowers </em>(1962), 174 Ohio St. 113, 21 O.O.2d 369, 186 N.E.2d 832 (appeal dismissed when the notice did not specify the errors complained of); <em>Lawson Milk Co. v. Bowers </em>(1961), 171 Ohio St. 418, 14 O.O.2d 217, 171 N.E.2d 495. The notice of appeal in this case falls squarely within this doctrine: the claim that a tribunal has misinterpreted a pleading, without more particularity, is too vague and general to give notice of what the appellant intends to argue. Moreover, the notice of appeal in no way gives notice of the particular legal arguments raised in the appellant\u2019s briefs and thereby fails to furnish a jurisdictional basis for the court to consider those arguments. <em>Brown, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Newman v.
