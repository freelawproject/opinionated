This court further ordered that Bikkani was prohibited from continuing or instituting legal proceedings in this court without first obtaining leave. On March 2, 2010, attorney Kevin Breen, on behalf of Prasad Bikkani, submitted an application for leave to file a notice of appeal in the Ohio Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>It is ordered by the court that Breen\u2019s application for leave to appeal is granted. The order declaring Prasad Bikkani to be a vexatious litigator does not apply to counsel representing Bikkani.
