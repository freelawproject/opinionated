The BTA determined that Vistula \u201cdid not identify itself as a representative of the owner, but identified itself as an independent complainant.\u201d Because, apart from its relationship to the property owner, Vistula could not demonstrate any statutory authority to file the complaint, the BTA ordered that the case be remanded to the Lucas County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) with instructions that the valuation complaint be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On appeal, Vistula asserts as its primary argument that it did act in the capacity of representing the owner when it filed the complaint, inasmuch as Vistula identified itself as a \u201cmanagement company\u201d on the face of the complaint. Additionally, Vistula relies on the management agreement it submitted to the BTA to establish its status as designated agent of the owner for purposes of filing property-tax valuation appeals. Because we agree that Vistula manifestly acted as a representative and agent of the owner, and because the complaint was duly prepared and filed by an attorney, we reverse the decision of the BTA and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 3} On March 25, 2008, Vistula filed a complaint against the valuation of the property at issue, which is a subsidized apartment complex encompassing ten acres. The complaint identified Michaelmas as the owner and named \u201cVistula Management Company\u201d on line two as \u201cComplainant if not owner.\u201d The line indicating \u201cComplainant\u2019s agent\u201d identified Douglas A. Wilkins as the agent for Vistula. Finally, on line five, Vistula wrote \u201cManagement company\u201d as \u201cComplainant\u2019s relationship to the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 4} In response to the filing of the complaint, the Toledo Public Schools Board of Education (\u201cschool board\u201d) filed a countercomplaint that sought to retain the auditor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b6 5} The auditor had valued the site at $3,415,300, and apparently because of the appraisal submitted by Vistula, the BOR lowered the valuation to $2,740,000. The school board appealed to the BTA, where it moved for a remand with instructions to dismiss. The school board argued that because Vistula had named itself as \u201ccomplainant if not owner\u201d rather than as an agent of the owner, and because Vistula had no standing apart from its status as agent, the complaint should be dismissed. See <em>Toledo Public Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(June 22, 2007), BTA No. 2006-M-1707, 2007 WL 1946467.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">{\u00b6 6} Vistula opposed the motion and submitted a copy of the management agreement between Michaelmas and Vistula as an attachment to its memorandum. Notably, that agreement confers \u201ccomplete authority and responsibility\u201d on Vistula to pay taxes for the property and to file \u201creal estate valuation tax appeals when appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">{\u00b6 7} On April 14, 2009, the BTA issued its decision. The BTA concluded that Vistula\u2019s arguments in support of jurisdiction lacked merit because the present case was not one \u201cwhere a representative of the property owner\u201d had \u201cprepared and filed a complaint in a representative capacity.\u201d Unlike the situation presented in other eases, Vistula \u201cdid not identify itself as a representative of the owner, but identified itself as an independent complainant, different from the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">{\u00b6 8} The BTA held that because Vistula had identified itself as a nonowner complainant, it had the burden to show \u201cindependent statutory authority to file a complaint.\u201d Since Vistula did not itself own any property in the county, the BTA ruled that the BOR had erred by exercising jurisdiction to determine the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">{\u00b6 9} The BTA ordered the case remanded with instructions that the BOR dismiss the underlying complaint. Vistula has appealed that decision to this court, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"AZMi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">{\u00b6 10} It is now well settled that the language of R.C. 5715.19(A) establishes the jurisdictional gateway to obtaining review by the boards of revision: it authorizes complaints from particular actions of the county auditor, and it then specifies what persons or entities \u201cmay file such a complaint.\u201d The list of who may complain includes \u201c[a]ny person owning taxable real property in the county or in a taxing district with territory in the county,\u201d and the statute specifies persons who may file on behalf of an owner. Additionally, the statute authorizes certain local officials or boards to file (most prominently a board of education with territory in the county). A complaint filed by a person who is not identified by the statute as one who may file a complaint does not vest jurisdiction in the board of revision to review the auditor\u2019s valuation. The classification is important because R.C. 5715.13 directs that a board of revision not \u201cdecrease any valuation\u201d unless a party who is authorized by R.C. 5715.19(A) to do so files the complaint. See <em>Middleton v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 226, 227-228, 658 N.E.2d 267; <em>Buckeye Foods v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 459, 461, 678 N.E.2d 917; <em>Soc. Natl. Bank v. Wood Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 401, 403, 692 N.E.2d 148; <em>Victoria Plaza Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 712 N.E.2d 751; <em>Village Condominiums Owners Assn. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 223, 2005-Ohio-4631, 833 N.E.2d 1230, \u00b6 6, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 11} Vistula claims that it may assert Michaelmas\u2019s right as owner to file the complaint because as property manager under an extensive and detailed management agreement, it acts on behalf of and for the benefit of Michaelmas in filing the complaint. Although Vistula identified itself as the \u201cComplainant if not owner\u201d on the complaint, Vistula also set forth its relationship to the property as \u201cmanagement company.\u201d Vistula argues that this disclosure plainly indicated that it was acting on behalf of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 12} At the outset, we agree with the BTA and the school board that Vistula had no standing to file independently of its relationship to the property owner. Accordingly, if the complaint failed to assert Vistula\u2019s representative capacity, the case law would require that the complaint be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 13} We consider Vistula\u2019s argument in two steps. First, we review the BTA\u2019s determination that Vistula did not file the complaint in a representative capacity. If that determination is correct, then the BTA\u2019s decision should be affirmed. If the BTA\u2019s determination is not correct, we must then consider whether a property manager, acting through its lawyer, can legally serve as the owner\u2019s representative for purposes of filing a valuation complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\n<em>By identifying itself on the complaint as property manager, Vistula indicated that it was filing the valuation complaint on behalf of the owner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">{\u00b6 14} The BTA predicated its decision on the fact that Vistula had identified itself as the \u201cComplainant if not owner\u201d on line two of the valuation complaint form. The BTA construed this formality as Vistula\u2019s statement that it did not act as a representative of the owner, but rather \u201cas an independent complainant different from the owner.\u201d To be sure, Vistula\u2019s entry on line two appears to be a mistake if Vistula intended to act as the owner\u2019s representative, because writing a name other than the owner\u2019s on line two clearly implies that the owner itself should not be viewed as the complainant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The BTA ruled that this mistake was jurisdictionally fatal, and Vistula disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 15} We have held that errors in filling out the complaint form do not necessarily bar the exercise of jurisdiction by a board of revision. See <em>Knickerbocker Properties, Inc. XLII v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 233, 2008-Ohio-3192, 893 N.E.2d 457, \u00b6 10. In <em>Knickerbocker, </em>we rejected the contention that a school board\u2019s complaint was jurisdictionally defective because it set forth the wrong address for the owner. Id. at \u00b6 11. Similarly, we hold that the entry of Vistula\u2019s name as \u201cComplainant if not owner\u201d does not defeat jurisdiction if the complaint indicates on its face that Vistula is acting on behalf of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 16} Because the error in filling out the valuation complaint is not jurisdictionally dispositive, we consider whether Vistula indicated its representative capacity by identifying its relationship to the property as being the \u201cmanagement company.\u201d We hold that Vistula did indicate its representative capacity on the complaint form. While the placement of its own name on the line for \u201cComplainant if not owner\u201d implies that Vistula is filing as an independent claimant, its declared status as \u201cmanagement company\u201d points in the opposite direction \u2014 i.e., that it is acting as an agent of the owner. That inference arises because a property manager or management company furnishes management services to the owner for a fee, and it performs those services on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the owner. See Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate (13th Ed.2008) at 486 (discussing management-service fees as a variable expense in computing the value of income-producing properties).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 17} Therefore, a valuation complaint that is filed by a property manager who identifies the owner and then identifies its own capacity as property manager clearly signals that the owner is acting through the property manager as its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>agent. We hold that by sending the clear message that it was acting on behalf of the owner, Vistula\u2019s complaint was jurisdictionally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">{\u00b6 18} Our inference that a management company is acting as an agent for the owner does not contravene our decision in <em>Village Condominiums, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 223, 2005-Ohio-4631, 833 N.E.2d 1230. The inference of agency raised here, when a management company acts on behalf of an owner, was not present in <em>Village Condominiums. </em>In that case, the developer, Sonnenburg Construction Company, was named as the \u201cowner\u201d on the valuation complaint, and the condominium owners\u2019 association identified itself as \u201cComplainant if not owner.\u201d <em>Village Condominiums Owners\u2019 Assn. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Aug. 1, 2003), BTA No. 2002-N-1607, 2003 WL 21792279, at * 1. To be sure, it might be reasonable to presume that a \u201ccondominium owners\u2019 association\u201d could act as the agent of the owners of individual condominium units, but that logic does not raise the inference that the association is acting on behalf <em>of the developer. </em>See R.C. 5311.01(CC) and (S) (defining \u201c[u]nit owner\u201d as \u201ca person who owns a condominium ownership interest in a unit,\u201d as opposed to a \u201c[d]eveloper,\u201d who \u201csells or offers for sale condominium ownership interests in a condominium development\u201d); R.C. 5311.08(C)(1) (specifying that association membership extends to and is limited to all owners of condominium units and providing that a developer acts in place of the association until the association is formed). In <em>Village Condominiums, </em>the association was required to shoulder the burden to establish standing separate and apart from the standing of the owner to contest the valuation of the property, and it failed to do so. That is not the situation in this case, and accordingly, <em>Village Condominiums </em>is not apposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 19} We note that although our reading of the complaint conflicts with the BTA\u2019s decision in another case styled <em>Toledo Public Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 2006-M-1707, 2007 WL 1946467, our reading in this case does accord with the approach that the BTA has taken in certain other cases. In <em>Sylvania City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Apr. 22, 2008), BTA No. 2007-M-1771, 2008 WL 1914712, the board addressed a complaint that identified a certain individual as the owner and set forth the name of the attorney as \u201ccomplainant.\u201d Id. at *1. The complaint stated the relationship of complainant to the property owner as \u201cattorney.\u201d Id. at <em>*2. </em>Characterizing the insertion of the attorney\u2019s name as \u201ccomplainant if not owner\u201d as a \u201cministerial error,\u201d the board concluded that \u201cthe relationship between the property owner and his attorney is clear.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the BTA denied the motion, thereby declining to order that the complaint be dismissed. Id. When the same situation presented itself in <em>Washington Local Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Aug. 19, 2008), BTA Nos. 2007-N-1722, 2007-N-1723, and 2007-N-1727, 2008 WL 3905916, the board relied on its earlier analysis in <em>Sylvania </em>and declined to order dismissal. Id. at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>{\u00b6 20} We endorse the reasoning of the BTA in <em>Sylvania City </em>and <em>Washington Local </em>and adopt it here. Because Vistula identified its relationship to the property as \u201cmanagement company,\u201d it raised the inference that it was acting on behalf of the owner, which it had identified on line one. Accordingly, the BTA should have denied the school board\u2019s motion rather than granting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">\n<em>Vistula\u2019s contractual status permitted it to file the valuation complaint on behalf of the owner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">{\u00b6 21} We turn now to the question whether Vistula, acting through its attorney, could validly file the valuation complaint as the agent of the property owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">{\u00b6 22} Significantly, one issue that has arisen in many cases is not present here: the issue of the unauthorized practice of law. The complaint in this case on its face indicates that it was prepared and filed by an attorney who acted on behalf of Vistula. Therefore, the issue of the unauthorized practice of law does not arise, and we do not review this case through the prism of <em>Sharon Village Ltd. v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 479, 678 N.E.2d 932, and its progeny.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">{\u00b6 23} Under these circumstances, the authority for who may act as the owner\u2019s agent is our decision in <em>Jemo Assoc., Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 365, 18 O.O.3d 518, 415 N.E.2d 292. In <em>Jemo, </em>an accountant submitted a notice of appeal to the BTA from a final determination of the Tax Commissioner. Id. R.C. 5717.02, the relevant statute, provided that such appeals \u201cmay be taken to the board of tax appeals by the taxpayer.\u201d The statute articulated no further restriction, but an administrative rule promulgated by the BTA had specified that a notice of appeal filed on behalf of a corporation \u201cshall be executed by an officer thereof or an attorney at law.\u201d <em>Jemo </em>at 366, 18 O.O.3d 518, 415 N.E.2d 292. In the ease, an accountant had signed the notice on behalf of a corporate appellant. Id. The BTA determined that the rule limited who could act on behalf of the taxpayer and dismissed. Id. We reversed, noting that \u201cunder agency law, the authority of any purported agent to act on behalf of a principal is ordinarily a question of fact.\u201d Id. at 367, 18 O.O.3d 518, 415 N.E.2d 292. Accordingly, we held that there was \u201cno merit to an interpretation of R.C. 5717.02 which, for jurisdictional purposes, conclusively presumes that a corporate officer or an attorney is always competent to sign a corporation\u2019s notice of appeal but that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>other corporate agent is never competent.\u201d Id. at 368, 18 O.O.3d 518, 415 N.E.2d 292.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 24} Under <em>Jemo, </em>the question of agency is determined by reference to whether the person filing the appeal was in fact authorized by its principal to file it. In the present case, Vistula\u2019s complaint implies its status as agent, and Vistula subsequently proved its authorization when it produced the management agreement. Therefore, its valuation complaint should not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\n<em>R.C. 5715.19(A) does not prohibit Vistula\u2019s filing a valuation complaint as an agent for the oumer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">{\u00b625} The school board argues that R.C. 5715.19(A), as amended effective 1999, precludes Vistula from acting on behalf of the owner because the 1999 amendment sets forth a list of persons who may file complaints on behalf of an owner. 1998 Sub.H.B. No. 694, 147 Ohio Laws, Part III, 5373-5374, effective March 30, 1999. The school board urges that this list is intended to be exhaustive and thereby forecloses Vistula\u2019s appeal because management companies are not on the statutory list. Put in different terms, the school board argues that the principle established by <em>Jemo </em>has been limited by H.B. 694 with respect to the filing of a valuation complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 26} We disagree with the school board\u2019s reading of the statutory amendment. What the school board overlooks is that the General Assembly had a very precise purpose in enacting H.B. 694. That amendment was enacted in response to our decision in <em>Sharon Village Ltd., 78 </em>Ohio St.3d 479, 678 N.E.2d 932, and the bill reflected a legislative intent to \u201cundo the impact of that decision and thereby widen the pool of persons who may file a property-valuation complaint on behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>of a property owner.\u201d <em>Dayton Supply &amp; Tool Co., Inc., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 367, 2006-Ohio-5852, 856 N.E.2d 926, \u00b6 42 (Resnick, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 27} This intent stands revealed on the face of the session law: H.B. 694 not only enacted the list of persons who may file complaints on behalf of an owner, it also added division (3) to R.C. 5715.19(A). 147 Ohio Laws, Part III, at 5374-5375. That division specifically addresses complaints that have been dismissed by reason of the unauthorized practice of law: when such a dismissal has occurred, division (3) overrides the usual prohibition against contesting the valuation of a parcel more than once during a three-year interim period. The inclusion of this provision in H.B. 694 ties the other enacted provisions of that bill to the fundamental legislative intent: to resolve certain issues relating to the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">{\u00b628} It follows that the list of persons delineated by H.B. 694 does not override the agency principle of <em>Jemo. </em>When, as in the present case, an attorney has prepared and filed the valuation complaint, the list of persons added to R.C. 5715.19(A) by H.B. 694 is not relevant to determining whether a particular entity may act as the owner\u2019s agent. That is so because in such cases, the issue of the unauthorized practice of law does not arise in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">{\u00b6 29} The foregoing conclusion receives support not only from the context and the language of the provisions that the General Assembly <em>enacted, </em>but also from what the General Assembly <em>omitted. </em>Conspicuously absent from the list of persons added by H.B. 694 is any reference to the owner\u2019s own attorney. Yet the legislature certainly did not intend to preclude a filing by the owner\u2019s attorney. What the legislature did intend was to furnish a list of persons who may file on behalf of an owner <em>when no attorney has performed the act of preparing and filing the complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">{\u00b6 30} We hold that H.B. 694\u2019s list of persons is not intended as a restriction of those who may file a valuation complaint on behalf of an owner. Instead, it is intended only to widen the pool by specifying that certain nonlawyers may file on behalf of an owner in spite of considerations relating to the unauthorized practice of law. Whenever a nonlawyer files on behalf of an owner, the question of the unauthorized practice of law arises and will have to be resolved in light of the statute and court precedent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But when, as in the present case, a lawyer has prepared and filed the complaint, the list of persons who may file on behalf of the owner in R.C. 5715.19(A) is not relevant. It follows that R.C. 5715.19(A) did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>preclude Vistula as the management company from filing a valuation complaint on behalf of Michaelmas Manor, the owner.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AEP\">Spengler Nathanson, P.L.L., Michael W. Bragg, and Teresa L. Grigsby, for appellee Toledo Public Schools Board of Education.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b678-9\">Douglas A. Wilkins, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 31} We hold that because Vistula\u2019s complaint clearly implies Vistula\u2019s status as agent of the owner, and because the complaint was prepared and filed by a lawyer for Vistula, the complaint is jurisdictionally sufficient. Moreover, because the statutes do not prohibit a property manager from filing a complaint on behalf of an owner, the BTA erred by concluding that the complaint should be dismissed. We therefore reverse the decision of the BTA and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Decision reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b678-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-11\">.

The issue before us is the jurisdictional sufficiency of the complaint. That is a question of law that we determine de novo. <em>Toledo v.

Vistula places heavy reliance on the analysis in <em>Dayton Supply &amp; Tool Co., Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 367, 2006-Ohio-5852, 856 N.E.2d 926. But that case addressed the unauthorized practice of law and is therefore not apposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\">. <em>Jemo </em>did not consider the question whether the accountant\u2019s signing of the notice of appeal on behalf of the corporate client constituted the unauthorized practice of law.

The footnote illustrates the court\u2019s narrow focus on the question of an accountant\u2019s actual authority as an agent: the court stated that R.C. 4705.01 was irrelevant because it had \u201cno bearing upon whether any particular attorney has the authority to represent any particular corporate taxpayer.\u201d Id. When the court subsequently began to address the issue of the unauthorized practice of law in the context of valuation complaints, the court noted that the <em>Jemo </em>decision regarded the question whether \u201cthe agent who had signed the notice had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law\u201d as being \u201cirrelevant to the issue before the court.\u201d <em>Sharon Village Ltd,, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 483, 678 N.E.2d 932.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b676-10\">.
