Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 622, 2009-Ohio-2058, 906 N.E.2d 1125 <em>(\u201cMedcorp I </em>\u201d). We reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and held that in order to satisfy the \u201cgrounds of the party\u2019s appeal\u201d requirement in R.C. 119.12, parties appealing under that statute must identify specific legal or factual errors in their notices of appeal. Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee filed a motion for reconsideration, urging that the court vacate its decision and instead adopt the position of the dissenting opinions or, in the alternative, modify the decision so as to restrict its effect to matters for which appeals have been filed after the date of the decision. We ordered the parties to brief whether the decision in <em>Medcorp I </em>should be applied prospectively only and, if so, to what cases it should be applied. 122 Ohio St.3d 1488, 2009-Ohio-3830, 910 N.E.2d 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">{\u00b6 3} The United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>Great N. Ry. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co. </em>(1932), 287 U.S. 358, 53 S.Ct. 145, 77 L.Ed. 360, that state courts have broad authority to determine whether their decisions should operate prospectively only. We have applied the <em>Sunburst </em>Doctrine to limit a decision to prospective application only as a means of avoiding injustice in cases dealing with questions having widespread ramifications for persons not parties to the action. See, e.g., <em>OAMCO v. Lindley </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 1, 29 OBR 122, 503 N.E.2d 1388; <em>Minster Farmers Coop. Exchange Co., Inc. v. Meyer, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 459, 2008-Ohio-1259, 884 N.E.2d 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">{\u00b6 4} Upon consideration of the briefs filed pursuant to the court\u2019s request, we conclude that application of the <em>Sunburst </em>Doctrine is appropriate in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>Accordingly, the motion for reconsideration is granted to the following extent: The holding in <em>Medcorp I </em>shall apply only to cases filed on and after June 15, 2009, the date on which the opinion in <em>Medcorp I </em>was published in the Ohio Official Reports advance sheets. Moreover, the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Medcorp I </em>is modified to the following extent: The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aps\">Chester, Willcox &amp; Saxbe, L.L.C., Geoffrey E.

Instead, the court has created a new standard that confuses a settled area of law affecting thousands of litigants. However, given the court\u2019s reluctance to reverse its prior holding, I reluctantly concur in the decision to have it apply prospectively. As I noted in my dissenting opinion, I strongly urge the General Assembly to clarify its intent with respect to this important matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
