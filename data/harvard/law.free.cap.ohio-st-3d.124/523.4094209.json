On August 3, 2006, we suspended respondent\u2019s license to practice law on an interim basis, pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(4), after receiving notice of his felony conviction. <em>In re Andrews, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1445, 2006-Ohio-3936, 852 N.E.2d 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we indefinitely suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice, with no credit for time served under his interim suspension, based on findings that he failed to perform his duties as counsel for the board of trustees of a church in a civil action, including failing to respond to filings in that case, and that he was convicted of a felony and a misdemeanor in a criminal case. We accept the board\u2019s findings of professional misconduct and the recommendation for the indefinite suspension of respondent\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with violations of several Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility. In its original complaint, relator charged respondent with two counts of misconduct, the first related to his representation of the church board of trustees in a civil case and the second concerning an indictment that charged him with several criminal offenses. Relator then granted respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for a stay of disciplinary proceedings until the criminal case was resolved. Following respondent\u2019s convictions in the criminal ease, relator amended its complaint to reflect the convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulated to the facts, misconduct, and mitigating factors and jointly recommended that the board impose the sanction of an indefinite suspension, with no credit for time served under the interim suspension. A three-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>member panel of the board heard the case and recommended that the board adopt the parties\u2019 stipulated facts, misconduct, and recommendation. The board adopted the findings of misconduct and recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 5} The parties have not objected to the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\"><em>Count I </em>\u2014 Representing <em>the Church Board of Trustees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 6} The parties stipulated that in September 2002, the board of trustees of a church initiated a civil action in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas. After being served with the defendants\u2019 discovery requests, the board retained respondent to represent it in the matter and paid him $2,500. Despite respondent\u2019s assurance to the board that he would respond to the discovery requests, he never answered defendants\u2019 interrogatories and requests for production of documents or requests for admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent entered an appearance in the case, and he engaged in settlement discussions with the defendants\u2019 counsel. But he did not reply to the defendants\u2019 request for a reply to their requests for discovery and to depose the board\u2019s expert. Nor did he respond to the defendants\u2019 motions to compel discovery and for summary judgment or inform the board about them. The court scheduled a July 29, 2003 hearing on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">{\u00b6 8} Near this time, the defendants made a written settlement offer, which respondent advised the board to accept. After board members accused him of being on the defendants\u2019 side, respondent informed several board members that he intended to file a motion to withdraw as the board\u2019s counsel in the case. Respondent then filed the motion to withdraw, and the board requested that he provide a full accounting of the retainer and return the case file. Respondent did not reply to the board\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">{\u00b6 9} On July 29, 2003, the court held its scheduled hearing on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and respondent\u2019s motion to withdraw. The court granted respondent\u2019s motion to withdraw as the board\u2019s counsel, but denied his motion for a continuance to allow the board to retain new counsel. The court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and ordered the board to pay the defendants $9,208. The board first learned of this motion and the court\u2019s decision when it received notice of the court\u2019s judgment. The defendants subsequently initiated an action against the board members to recover the judgment and obtained liens on the members\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">{\u00b6 10} Shortly after the entry of summary judgment, the board\u2019s new attorney filed a motion to set aside the judgment because of respondent\u2019s failure to notify the board of the hearing. The court held a hearing on the board\u2019s motion, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>declined to enter a judgment at that time. Pursuant to a subpoena served on respondent by the board\u2019s new attorney, respondent appeared at the hearing with his case file. The board\u2019s counsel did not accept respondent\u2019s file when he offered to provide it, and later, respondent did not reply to the board\u2019s motions to compel him to produce the file. A legal-malpractice action brought by the board against respondent and his former law firm was later dismissed by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">{\u00b6 11} We accept respondent\u2019s admission that in representing the church\u2019s board of trustees, he -violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), 2-110(A)(2) (prohibiting a lawyer from improperly withdrawing from employment), 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting an entrusted legal matter), 7-101(A)(l) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally failing to seek the lawful objectives of the lawyer\u2019s client), 7-101(A)(2) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally failing to carry out a contract of professional employment), and 9-102(B)(4) (requiring a lawyer to promptly deliver property in the lawyer\u2019s possession that the client is entitled to receive).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\"><em>Count II </em>\u2014 Criminal <em>Convictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 12} The parties stipulated that on December 15, 2004, the Hamilton County Grand Jury returned a five-count indictment charging respondent with various criminal offenses. The indictment arose from two online conversations respondent had with an adult posing as a 13-year-old girl in which he solicited sexual activity. In April 2006, respondent entered a no-eontest plea and was found guilty of attempted tampering with evidence in violation of R.C. 2921.12, a felony of the fourth degree, and attempted importuning in violation of R.C. 2923.02, a misdemeanor of the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 13} The common pleas court sentenced respondent to three years of community control and 500 hours of community service and ordered him to pay a $5,000 fine and to register as a sexually oriented offender. On appeal, respondent\u2019s convictions and sentence were affirmed. <em>State v. Andrews, </em>171 Ohio App.3d 332, 2007-Ohio-2013, 870 N.E.2d 775, appeal not accepted for review, 115 Ohio St.3d 1412, 2007-Ohio-4884, 873 N.E.2d 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 14} We accept respondent\u2019s admission that his criminal conduct violated DR 1-102(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude) and 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct adversely reflecting on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">{\u00b6 15} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10(B)(1) and (2) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Cleveland Metro. Bar Assn. v. Kaplan, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 278, 2010-Ohio-167, 921 N.E.2d 645, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9Yh\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Stacy Solochek Beckman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b706-11\">John Robert Andrews, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">{\u00b6 16} The board did not cite any aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 17} In mitigation, the board found, as the parties had stipulated, that respondent had no prior disciplinary record and had provided full and free disclosure to the board and cooperated in the disciplinary proceedings. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">{\u00b6 18} Although respondent\u2019s conduct violated multiple Disciplinary Rules, we are persuaded that the lack of any aggravating factors as well as his lack of a prior disciplinary record and his cooperation in the disciplinary process warrant the recommended sanction of an indefinite suspension with no credit for the time served during his interim suspension. Cf. <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Winkfield, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 360, 2006-Ohio-6, 839 N.E.2d 924 (court indefinitely suspended attorney from the practice of law for misconduct that included violations of DR 1-102(A)(3), (5), and (6), 2-110(A)(2), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l) and (2), and 9-102(B)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">{\u00b6 19} Therefore, we adopt the recommendation of the board. Respondent is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law with no credit for time served under his interim suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b706-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
