R.C. 519.02 allows township trustees to create, by resolution, zoning regulations to cover the unincorporated portions of townships. The statute requires such zoning resolutions to be \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d This case presents the question of whether the comprehensive plan required by the statute must be a plan developed by the township itself or whether the township may rely on a comprehensive plan created at the county level. We hold that a countywide comprehensive plan can fulfill the \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d requirement of R.C. 519.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">{\u00b6 2} This case arises out of the attempt of appellees, B.J. Alan Company, Phantom of West Salem, Inc., and Zoldan Family Ohio Limited Partnership (collectively referred to as \u201cPhantom\u201d), to construct and operate a state-licensed fireworks store at the intersection of Interstate 71 and State Route 539 in Congress Township in Wayne County. At the administrative level, Congress Township zoning regulations thwarted Phantom in its attempt to build the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">\n<em>Congress Township Zoning Resolution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">{\u00b6 3} Congress Township has an area of approximately 43 square miles and a population of about 4,400. http://www.city-data.com/township/Congress-WayneOH.html. Three incorporated villages lie within the township: West Salem, Congress, and Burbank; collectively they account for less than two square miles of land area and less than half of the total township population. (Area and population data for the three towns is found at http://www.city-data.com/city/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Burbank-Ohio.html, http://www.city-data.eom/city/W est-Salem-Ohio.html, and http://ohio.hometownlocator.com/oh/wayne/congress.cfm.) The bulk of the residents of Congress Township reside in the 41 square miles of unincorporated areas of the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">{\u00b6 4} In 1992, Congress Township established the Congress Township Rural Zoning Commission to create a zoning resolution that would cover the unincorporated areas of the township. The commission\u2019s chairman at the time, William Cletzer, testified that the commission had relied upon the Wayne County Comprehensive Plan in drafting the zoning resolution: \u201cWe actually, we used the Wayne County comprehensive plan as our comprehensive plan, to follow suit in their planning of an agricultural county for agricultural use.\u201d Township electors approved the zoning resolution in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 5} The zoning resolution contains two zoning districts: A-Agricultural and B-Business/Industry. The zoning district map, incorporated into the zoning resolution, designates all land in the unincorporated areas of the township as A-Agricultural; no land is mapped B-Business/Industry. This meant that although the zoning resolution allowed B-Business/Industry development, no landowner could simply obtain a zoning certificate for such development from the zoning inspector. Instead, a landowner seeking to undertake business or industrial development would have to either apply to the zoning commission for a change of district boundaries on the zoning map or seek from the board of zoning appeals a variation from the zoning resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\n<em>Fireworks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 6} When Phantom purchased the property in question, it knew that the land was zoned A-Agricultural. Still, Phantom applied for a zoning certificate for its fireworks store. The zoning inspector denied that application, and Phantom subsequently filed an appeal and request for a use variance with the Congress Township Board of Zoning Appeals (\u201cBZA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">{\u00b6 7} The BZA held an evidentiary hearing on November 20, 2006. At the hearing, Phantom urged the board either to overrule the zoning inspector\u2019s decision to deny a zoning certificate or to grant Phantom a use variance. Phantom also argued that Congress Township\u2019s zoning resolution violated R.C. 519.02 because it was not In accordance with a comprehensive plan, both because Congress Township did not have its own comprehensive plan and because the resolution contained only one zoning district and was therefore \u201cby definition * * * not zoning in accordance with the comprehensive plan.\u201d Following the hearing, the BZA affirmed the zoning inspector\u2019s decision denying the zoning certificate and denied Phantom\u2019s request for a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506, Phantom appealed that decision to the Wayne County Court of Common Pleas. On June 15, 2007, the trial court affirmed the decision of the BZA. Phantom appealed that decision, and the court of appeals reversed the trial court. <em>B.J. Alan Co. v. Congress Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA0051, 2007-Ohio-7023, 2007 WL 4554187. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in affirming the BZA\u2019s opinion \u201cbecause the township\u2019s zoning resolution is an invalid exercise of the township\u2019s authority under R.C. 519.02.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11. The court based its decision on its finding that Congress Township lacked a comprehensive plan: \u201cIn the absence of a comprehensive plan, a township zoning resolution is an invalid exercise of the township\u2019s authority under R.C. 519.02.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12. The court pointed to Cletzer\u2019s BZA hearing testimony that the township did not have its own comprehensive plan but that the commission \u201clooked to the Wayne County comprehensive plan and \u2018molded or formed\u2019 the township resolution \u2018based on that plan.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. The court found that the county plan that Congress Township had relied upon did not set forth goals or recommendations specific to Congress Township: \u201cThe Wayne County comprehensive plan reports submitted as part of the record are from 1977 and note that Congress Township is one of nine townships in the county which were merely requesting rural zoning at that time. The county comprehensive plan does not set forth goals or recommendations specific to Congress Township.\u201d Id. The court concluded: \u201cBecause the zoning resolution does not regulate the use of unincorporated township land in accordance with a comprehensive plan, the resolution is invalid. * * * The trial court ignored the requirement of R.C. 519.02 that the township resolution be adopted \u2018in accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u2019 The failure of the township to have a comprehensive plan renders the zoning resolution invalid.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 9} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">{\u00b6 10} First, we consider whether a township must develop its own comprehensive plan in order to conform to the dictates of R.C. 519.02, or whether the township may rely on the comprehensive plan developed by its county. Second, we determine whether the Wayne County Comprehensive Plan constitutes a comprehensive plan for purposes of R.C. 519.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>The Comprehensive-Plan Requirement of R.C. 519.02</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 519.02 allows for zoning in unincorporated areas of townships. It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(A) * * * Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the interest of the public convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare, the board [of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>township trustees] by resolution, in accordance with a comprehensive plan, may regulate the location of, set back lines for, and the uses of buildings and other structures, * * * and the uses of land for trade, industry, residence, recreation, or other purposes in the unincorporated territory of the township, and may establish reasonable landscaping standards and architectural standards excluding exterior building materials in the unincorporated territory of the township.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 519.02 requires a township\u2019s zoning resolution regarding unincorporated areas of the township to be \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d The parties agree that Congress Township did not have its own comprehensive plan in place at the time it created its zoning resolution. But this is not a significant fact under R.C. 519.02, despite the appellate court\u2019s contrary determination. R.C. 519.02 does not require that a township create its own comprehensive plan \u2014 it requires only that a zoning resolution be \u201cin accordance with <em>a </em>comprehensive plan.\u201d (Emphasis added.) To require each township to create its own comprehensive plan is to read additional language into R.C. 519.02. We cannot do that: \u201cIn matters of construction, it is the duty of this court to give effect to the words used, not to delete words used or to insert words not used.\u201d <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 50, 524 N.E.2d 441, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 14} Congress Township asserts that it did follow a comprehensive plan: that created by Wayne County. But the appellate court found that the countywide plan did not set forth goals or recommendations specific to Congress Township, and held that it thus could not function as a comprehensive plan that would meet the requirements of R.C. 519.02. We find that the court erred in making that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 15} Countywide planning is encouraged by law in Ohio. Counties are equipped for developing broad, big-picture plans encompassing all the communities within their jurisdictions. R.C. 713.22 allows for the creation of county planning commissions; R.C. 713.23 sets forth their powers and duties:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(B) The duties of the planning commission include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(1) Preparing the plans, including studies, maps, recommendations, and reports on:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(a) Regional goals, objectives, opportunities, and needs, and standards, priorities, and policies to realize such goals and objectives;</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(c) The general pattern and intensity of land use and open space;</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(d) The general land, water, and air transportation systems, and utility and communication systems;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>{\u00b6 22} \u201c(e) General locations and extent of public and private works, facilities, and services;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(f) General locations and extent of areas for conservation and development of natural resources and the control of the environment;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(2) Promoting understanding of and recommending administrative and regulatory measures to implement the plans of the region;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(4) Contracting with and providing planning assistance to other units of local government, councils of governments, planning commissions, and joint planning councils; coordinating the planning with neighboring planning areas; cooperating with the state and federal governments in coordinating planning activities and programs in the region;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(5) Reviewing, evaluating, and making comments and recommendations on proposed and amended comprehensive land use, open space, transportation, and public facilities plans, projects, and implementing measures of local units of government; and making recommendations to achieve compatibility in the region;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(6) Reviewing, evaluating, and making comments and recommendations on the planning, programming, location, financing, and scheduling of public facility projects within the region and affecting the development of the area;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(7) Undertaking other studies, planning, programming, conducting experimental or demonstration projects found necessary in the development of plans for the region or county, and coordinating work and exercising all other powers necessary and proper for discharging its duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">{\u00b6 31} County planning commissions are charged with creating a framework for development within a county. A county or regional comprehensive plan can address zoning goals like conservation and controlling sprawl that townships within the region share but cannot achieve alone. The countywide view accounts for the interrelationship of communities and marshals resources and expertise. We thus conclude that a county comprehensive plan that sets forth county land-use goals and recommendations can constitute a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d for purposes of R.C. 519.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">\n<em>Wayne County Comprehensive Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">{\u00b6 32} The next question is whether the Wayne County plan is a comprehensive plan and whether its breadth includes Congress Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">{\u00b6 33} The Wayne County Regional Planning Commission created the Wayne County Comprehensive Plan in 1977. At the time of the development of the plan, the county estimated its population at 102,051; its 2008 estimated population is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>113,812. http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/39/39169.html. Less than 2 percent of the 555 square miles in Wayne County consists of urban areas. Ohio Historical Society, http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry,php?rec=2032.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">{\u00b6 34} The over-200-page plan makes numerous recommendations for all of Wayne County, including Congress Township. In developing the plan, the commission prepared separate reports titled \u201cCommunity Facilities and Land Use,\u201d \u201cLand Use Plan,\u201d \u201cRegional Housing,\u201d and \u201cLand Use and Housing Implementation.\u201d The plan highlights the importance of regional planning:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe purpose of a regional comprehensive development plan is to provide a blueprint for the region\u2019s urban and rural development. It must be comprehensive in three ways: (1) Areawide \u2014 it must cover the entire region, (2) time wise \u2014 it must cover the short and long term future, and (3) subject wise \u2014 it must cover urban, rural, agricultural and natural resource aspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c * * * This plan is general in nature and yet it recommends specific direction and magnitude to urban growth and retention of rural lands. * * * This will provide an equitable basis for staff recommendations and Commission decisions on public and private investment policies. It also provides a basis for zoning and subdivision decisions which are not possible without an adopted plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThis adopted plan is a guide for the next several decades of development in Wayne County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">{\u00b6 39} The overriding goal of the plan is to retain the rural character of the county. The plan\u2019s proposed regional land-use and development goals include the retention of \u201cthe better agricultural areas, as exclusively as possible, for food and fiber production,\u201d the direction of additional urban growth \u201cin and around existing centers to provide economies of scale to benefit present and future residents,\u201d including \u201ceconomies in land use, utilities, investments and services,\u201d and the improvement of the quality of the environment \u201cthrough reasonable water, air and solid waste solutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">{\u00b6 40} The plan states that in conjunction with the comprehensive plan, the regional planning commission has drafted a model zoning text for the townships in Wayne County to use, which included recommended districts, lot dimensions, and administration procedures. The plan also sets forth a zoning-adoption procedure for townships.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">{\u00b6 41} The plan includes numerous references to Congress Township. It introduces Wayne County Planning Areas, \u201cdiscrete units which will be used throughout this study for the purpose of detailed population and housing analyses of the Wayne County region.\u201d The plan notes that \u201c[t]he Areas were aggregated based upon economic, social, and physical similarities among the political units <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>within each; they have been used for discussion of local planning and zoning issues.\u201d Id. Congress Township is in the Northwest Planning Area, an area described as one of the \u201ckey sectors\u201d the plan recommends for distribution of federal low- and moderate-income housing-assistance funds. Congress Township is included in the comprehensive-development-plan maps and regional strategy map for housing. The plan also discusses the effect of Interstate 71 on Congress Township.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ag\">Roetzel &amp; Andress, L.P.A., Stephen W. Funk, and Paul W.

Further, it demonstrates an intent to include Congress Township within its purview. Therefore, we conclude that the Wayne County Comprehensive Plan constitutes a comprehensive plan for purposes of R.C. 519.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 43} Our decision today is limited. We have determined that a countywide comprehensive plan can meet the comprehensive-plan requirement of R.C. 519.02 and that pursuant to that statute the Wayne County Comprehensive Plan qualifies as a comprehensive plan encompassing Congress Township. Among the issues we have not determined today is whether the Congress Township zoning ordinance is indeed \u201cin accordance\u201d with the Wayne County Comprehensive Plan.
