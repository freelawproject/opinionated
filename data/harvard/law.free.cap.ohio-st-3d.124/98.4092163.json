Cargile, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 343, 2009-Ohio-4939, 916 N.E.2d 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">{\u00b6 2} There is no indication in the court of appeals\u2019 opinion below whether the defendant was warned that bringing contraband into the detention facility would result in additional charges or whether the defendant affirmatively denied possessing any such material. However, whether a warning by an officer and a denial of possession of contraband by the defendant are required prior to a conviction for illegal conveyance was not a consideration before this court in <em>State v. Cargile. </em>Accordingly, in order to give the parties the opportunity to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>these factors, case No. 2009-0030 is remanded to the court of appeals for consideration of <em>State v. Cargile </em>and consideration of whether the absence of both an officer\u2019s warning and the defendant\u2019s denial of possession of contraband, if applicable, would alter the result below.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AM\">William D.
