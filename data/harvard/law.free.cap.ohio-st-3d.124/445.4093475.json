We conclude that it is not and therefore affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">{\u00b6 2} This case arises from a delinquency complaint filed in the juvenile court alleging that a 15-year-old child murdered her mother. The state filed with the juvenile court a motion for a discretionary bindover to transfer jurisdiction of the case to the common pleas court to prosecute the child as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">{\u00b6 3} After holding a preliminary hearing on the state\u2019s motion, the juvenile court found that there was probable cause to believe that the child had committed the act charged. Thereafter, a full investigation took place, and the court found after an amenability hearing that the child was amenable to care and rehabilitation in the juvenile system. The court denied the state\u2019s discretionary-bindover motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">{\u00b6 4} The state sought leave to appeal the juvenile court\u2019s denial of its discretionary-bindover request pursuant to App.R. 5(C). The appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>denied the state\u2019s request for leave to appeal. <em>In re M.P. </em>(June 25, 2009), Hardin App. No. 6-08-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">{\u00b6 5} The state appealed to this court, and we accepted review under our discretionary jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 120 Ohio St.3d 1452, 2008-Ohio-6813, 898 N.E.2d 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 6} After the state filed its jurisdictional request in this case, but before we accepted jurisdiction, we decided <em>In re A.J.S., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 185, 2008-Ohio-5307, 897 N.E.2d 629. In <em>A.J.S., </em>we held at the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe order of a juvenile court denying a motion for mandatory bindover bars the state from prosecuting a juvenile offender as an adult for a criminal offense. It is therefore the functional equivalent of a dismissal of a criminal indictment and constitutes a final order from which the state may appeal as a matter of right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">{\u00b6 8} In reaching this conclusion, we relied on the statute that specifically governs appeals by the state in criminal and juvenile delinquency proceedings. Id. at \u00b6 30, 33. This statutory provision is R.C. 2945.67(A), which provides: {\u00b6 9} \u201cA prosecuting attorney * * * may appeal as a matter of right * * * any decision of a juvenile court in a delinquency case, which decision grants a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment, * * * and may appeal by leave of the court to which the appeal is taken any other decision, except the final verdict, * * * of the juvenile court in a delinquency case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 10} The state urges this court to apply the rationale used in <em>A.J.S. </em>to allow appeals as a matter of right by the state from juvenile court decisions in which discretionary-bindover requests are denied because the court concludes that the child is amenable to care and rehabilitation in the juvenile system, even though the court also finds probable cause to believe that the child committed the act charged. Because of the important difference between mandatory-bindover and discretionary-bindover proceedings, we decline the state\u2019s invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">{\u00b6 11} Juvenile courts possess exclusive jurisdiction over children alleged to be delinquent for committing acts that would constitute a crime if committed by an adult. R.C. 2151.23(A). Under certain circumstances, however, the juvenile court has the duty to transfer a case, or bind a juvenile over, to the adult criminal system. R.C. 2152.10 and 2152.12. When the state requests a mandatory bindover, the juvenile court determines whether the child is eligible for mandatory bindover according to the child\u2019s age, the nature of the act, and other circumstances, and whether probable cause exists to believe that the juvenile committed the act charged. R.C. 2152.10(A) and 2152.12(A)(1); Juv.R. 30(A). If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the child is eligible for mandatory bindover and if probable cause exists to believe that the juvenile did commit the acts charged, the only procedural step remaining is for the court to enter the order of transfer. Juv.R. 30(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 12} When the state requests a discretionary bindover, the juvenile court is also to determine the age of the child and whether probable cause exists to believe that the juvenile committed the act charged. R.C. 2152.10(B) and 2152.12(B)(1) and (2). However, if probable cause exists and the child is eligible by age, the juvenile court must then continue the proceeding for a full investigation. R.C. 2152.12(C) and Juv.R. 30(C). This investigation includes a mental examination of the child, a hearing to determine whether the child is \u201camenable to care or rehabilitation within the juvenile system\u201d or whether \u201cthe safety of the community may require that the child be subject to adult sanctions,\u201d and the consideration of 17 other statutory criteria to determine whether a transfer is appropriate. Juv.R. 30(C); R.C. 2152.12(B), (C), (D), and (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 13} In a mandatory-bindover proceeding, when a juvenile court determines that no probable cause exists to believe that the juvenile committed the act charged, the court\u2019s finding is the \u201cfunctional equivalent of a dismissal of a criminal indictment and constitutes a final order from which the state may appeal as a matter of right\u201d under R.C. 2945.67(A). <em>In re A.J.S., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 185, 2008-Ohio-5307, 897 N.E.2d 629, syllabus. Because the issue whether the state presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed the act charged is a question of law, an appellate court applies a de novo review. Id. at \u00b6 47, 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 14} The issue whether the same rule obtains in a discretionary-bindover proceeding when the juvenile court determines that no probable cause exists is not presented in this case. Here, the court determined that probable cause did exist to believe that the child committed the act charged, and the question presented is the appealability of the court\u2019s order that nevertheless denied the state\u2019s requested discretionary bindover because the court concluded that the child was amenable to care or rehabilitation in the juvenile system. In contrast to the probable-cause inquiry, an amenability hearing is a broad assessment of individual circumstances and is inherently individualized and fact-based. Thus, a juvenile court\u2019s determination regarding a child\u2019s amenability to rehabilitation in the juvenile system is reviewed by an appellate court under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Id. at \u00b6 39, 40; see also <em>State v. Golphin </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 543, 546, 692 N.E.2d 608; <em>State v. Watson </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 93, 95, 547 N.E.2d 1181; <em>State v. Douglas </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 34, 36-37, 20 OBR 282, 485 N.E.2d 711; <em>State v. Carmichael </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St.2d 1, 64 O.O.2d 1, 298 N.E.2d 568, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AWf0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Bradford W. Bailey, Hardin County Prosecuting Attorney, and Colleen P. Limerick, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant, state of Ohio.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b628-10\">Timothy Young, Ohio Public Defender, and Elizabeth R. Miller, Assistant Public Defender, for appellee, M.P.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b628-3\">{\u00b6 15} Based on the foregoing, it is apparent that under the statute, juvenile court decisions regarding a child\u2019s amenability to care or rehabilitation within the juvenile system are different from probable-cause determinations. The legal effects of such determinations are also different. In contrast to a probable-cause determination, a denial of a discretionary-bindover request on the basis of amenability does not necessitate dismissal of any of the charges in the complaint. Rather, the juvenile court retains jurisdiction of the case, the complaint continues as it was filed, and if appropriate, the child is prosecuted as a serious youthful offender under R.C. 2152.11. If the child is adjudicated a serious youthful offender, the child may receive both a disposition as a child, to be served while the child is under 21 years of age, and a suspended adult sentence, to be served after the child attains the age of 21 years and only if the child violates set conditions or institutional rules in such a way as to impede rehabilitation. R.C. 2152.13 and 2152.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">{\u00b6 16} Accordingly, the rationale of <em>A.J.S. </em>does not apply to control the outcome of a case in which the juvenile court found that there is probable cause to believe that the child committed the act charged but also determined that the child is amenable to care or rehabilitation in the juvenile system. When a discretionary-bindover request is denied in these circumstances, there is no \u201cfunctional equivalent of a dismissal of a criminal indictment\u201d and there is no authority under R.C. 2945.67(A) for the state to appeal as a matter of right. R.C. 2945.67(A). Therefore, any appeal must be by leave of the court. App.R. 5(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 17} For the foregoing reasons, we hold that an order of a juvenile court denying a motion for a discretionary juvenile bindover in a delinquency proceeding because the court finds that the child is amenable to care or rehabilitation within the juvenile system is not a final order from which the state may appeal as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 18} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b628-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AJ7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Ron O\u2019Brien, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney, and Barbara A.
