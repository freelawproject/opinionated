This cause is pending before the court as a discretionary appeal and claimed appeal of right. Preliminary to a decision as to whether to accept the discretionary appeals and cross-appeal in this ease, the court requests that the parties brief the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">1. Does the Attorney General have standing to appeal a judgment against the state of Ohio if that appeal is contrary to the directive of the Governor, and the Attorney General is not representing an administrative agency?</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">2. If the answer to the first question is \u201cYes,\u201d is the record in this matter sufficient for this court to resolve the appeals and cross-appeal, if they are accepted, even though the state of Ohio\u2019s assignments of error and briefs were stricken by the court of appeals?</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Appellani/eross-appellee state of Ohio\u2019s brief shall be filed within 16 days from the date of this order; all other parties may file briefs within 15 days after the state of Ohio\u2019s brief has been filed; and the state of Ohio may file a reply within five days thereafter. No extensions of time shall be permitted. The clerk shall refuse to file any requests for extension of time.</p>\n<judges id=\"b815-12\">Moyer, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
