Patterson of Willoughby, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0015280, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice for 18 months, staying the last six months on condition of no further misconduct. The recommendation is based on findings that respondent mishandled a decedent\u2019s estate and committed other misconduct by disregarding his duty to exercise independent professional judgment on behalf of clients who were facing foreclosure. We agree that respondent violated ethical duties incumbent on Ohio lawyers and that an 18-month suspension of his license with a conditional six-month stay is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Geauga County Bar Association, charged respondent with three counts, alleging violations of the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility and the Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board considered the case on a consent-to-discipline agreement, filed pursuant to BCGD Proc.Reg. Section 11, in which the parties stipulated to facts and misconduct and proposed the 18-month license suspension and six-month conditional stay. The board accepted the agreement and recommends the jointly proposed sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\"><em>Count One\u25a0 </em>\u2014 The <em>Mishandled Estate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulated that respondent prepared for a client in early 2004 a durable power of attorney, a trust, and a will. Respondent and a friend of the client, another woman whom respondent also represented, were appointed cotrustees of the trust, and the will named respondent executor of the client\u2019s estate. The client died in June 2004, and that July, the Geauga County Probate Court appointed respondent as executor of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">{\u00b6 5} In November 2005, the probate court removed respondent as the estate\u2019s executor, citing pending and anticipated legal action against his cotrustee, who had apparently misappropriated assets belonging to the estate, and the resulting conflict of interest for respondent. In August 2006, the court followed up by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>finding that respondent had \u201cneglected to secure estate assets and allowed [his cotrustee] to exercise dominion and control over estate assets to the detriment of the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 6} According to the court\u2019s order, respondent had allowed his cotrustee to \u201ctransfer an automobile owned by the decedent to his wife.\u201d He had also \u201cpermitted [the cotrustee] to pay him $2,500.00 out of estate assets for a debt allegedly owed him by the decedent\u201d without timely submitting the claim to and obtaining the approval of the probate court as required by law. Finally, the order noted that respondent had been cited once for failing to file a certificate of service of notice of probate of the will and twice for failing to timely file the inventory for the estate. The court ordered him to reimburse the estate $1,795.40 in fiduciary fees for his neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 7} We accept respondent\u2019s admission that he mishandled this decedent\u2019s estate and thereby violated DR 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting an entrusted legal matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\"><em>Count Two </em>\u2014 Lapses <em>in Representing Clients in Foreclosure During 2007</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">{\u00b6 8} The parties stipulated to the facts underlying Count Two as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cRespondent entered into an agreement in June of 2007 to represent customers of Foreclosure Solutions, LLC, a company located in Ohio which purported to serve property owners threatened with foreclosure by helping them to cause their home loan to be re-instated and avoid foreclosure. Pursuant to this agreement, Respondent collected a flat fee of $200.00 for each client in exchange for his representation of them in foreclosure proceedings filed in the Common Pleas Courts of Northeast Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe client had no choice in the Respondent\u2019s selection when the Respondent was hired by Foreclosure Solution\u2019s Agents. Respondent did not meet with clients of Foreclosure Solutions to determine their objectives or complete financial situation or discover the facts that could be defenses to foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cRespondent did not determine what legal action should be taken in the client\u2019s best interest},] leaving that up to [the] judgment of Foreclosure Solutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cRespondent accepted a portion of the compensation paid to Foreclosure Solutions for their services.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cRespondent\u2019s misconduct consisted of his failure to meet directly with the client, the sharing of legal fees with non-lawyers and aiding in the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">{\u00b6 14} We accept respondent\u2019s admissions that in representing clients facing foreclosure during 2007, he violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u2022 1.2(a) (requiring a lawyer to \u201cabide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and, as required by Rule 1.4, [to] consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued\u201d);</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">{\u00b6 16} \u2022 1.4(a) (requiring a lawyer to (1) promptly inform clients as to matters needing informed consent, (2) reasonably consult with clients about the means to accomplish clients\u2019 objectives, (3) keep clients reasonably informed about the status of a matter, (4) comply as soon as practicable with clients\u2019 reasonable requests for information, and (5) consult with clients about any relevant limitation on the lawyer\u2019s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by law);</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u2022 1.4(b) (requiring a lawyer to explain matters to clients to the extent reasonably necessary for clients to make informed decisions regarding the representation);</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u2022 5.4(a) (with exceptions not relevant here, prohibiting a lawyer from sharing legal fees with a nonlawyer); and</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u2022 5.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from permitting a person who recommends, employs, or pays the lawyer to render legal services for another to direct or regulate the lawyer\u2019s professional judgment in rendering those legal services).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\"><em>Count Three </em>\u2014 Lapses <em>in Representing a Client in Foreclosure During 2006</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 20} The parties stipulated to the facts underlying Count Three as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cRespondent accepted a referral from Foreclosure Alternatives on June 7, 2006 to represent [a client] in a foreclosure matter pending before the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas * * *. Foreclosure Alternatives is a company which purported to serve property owners threatened with foreclosure by helping them cause their home loan to be re-instated and avoid foreclosure. Respondent collected a flat fee from Foreclosure Alternatives in exchange for his representation of [the client] in the Common Pleas Court of Clermont County.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c[The client] had no choice in the Respondent\u2019s selection, when he was hired by Foreclosure Alternative\u2019s Agents. Respondent did not meet with [the client] to determine his objectives or complete financial situation or discover the facts that could be defenses to the foreclosure. As a matter of fact, [the client] did not learn Respondent\u2019s identity until more than six (6) months after Respondent filed an Answer to the Complaint for Foreclosure in the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cRespondent did nothing to determine what legal action should be taken in [the client\u2019s] best interest^] leaving it up to Foreclosure Alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c[The client] filed a Voluntary Petition for Bankruptcy in March of 2007 * * * and eventually lost his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>{\u00b6 25} \u201cRespondent accepted a portion of compensation paid to Foreclosure Alternatives for their services as his fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cRespondent\u2019s misconduct consisted of his failure to meet directly with the client, the sharing of legal fees with non-lawyers and aiding in the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">{\u00b627} We accept respondent\u2019s admissions that in representing this client during 2006, he violated the following Disciplinary Rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u2022 2-103(C) (with exceptions not relevant here, prohibiting a lawyer from requesting a person or organization to recommend or promote the use of the lawyer\u2019s services as a private practitioner);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 29} \u2022 3-101(A) (prohibiting a lawyer from aiding a nonlawyer in the unauthorized practice of law);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">{\u00b6 30} \u2022 3-102(A) (with exceptions not relevant here, prohibiting a lawyer from sharing legal fees with a nonlawyer);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">{\u00b6 31} \u2022 6-101(A)(2) (prohibiting a lawyer from handling legal representation without adequate preparation under the circumstances); and</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">{\u00b6 32} \u2022 7-101(A)(l) (with exceptions not relevant here, requiring a lawyer to seek the lawful objectives of clients).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">{\u00b6 33} In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Willard, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 15, 2009-Ohio-3629, 913 N.E.2d 960, we considered another lawyer who partnered with a nonattorney organization to represent clients in mortgage-foreclosure proceedings. That association presented the same ills as have respondent\u2019s alliances \u2014 insufficient attorney-client communication and case preparation, nonattorney promotion of the lawyer\u2019s legal services, the aiding of the unauthorized practice of law, and the sharing of legal fees. Together, these failings signal the surrender of an attorney\u2019s ability to exercise independent professional judgment on a client\u2019s behalf and manifest an overarching breach of the lawyer\u2019s duty of loyalty to the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">{\u00b6 34} We ordered the actual suspension of Willard\u2019s license for his infractions, suspending him from practice for one year, but staying the last six months on remedial conditions. Id. at 31, 913 N.E.2d 960. The parties in this case, however, have agreed that a longer suspension period is warranted because respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary record weighs against him. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a). Respondent received public reprimands for ethical lapses in <em>Lake Cty. Bar Assn. v. Patterson </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 163, 18 O.O.3d 382, 413 N.E.2d 840, and <em>Geauga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Patterson, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 228, 2006-Ohio-5488, 855 N.E.2d 871.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ATS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Joseph H. Weiss Jr. and Edward T.

Penvose, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b278-3\">{\u00b6 35} We agree that the recommended sanction is appropriate based on the combination of misconduct in this case and respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary record. We therefore suspend respondent from the practice of law in Ohio for 18 months; however, the last six months of the suspension are stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further misconduct. If respondent violates the condition of the stay, the stay will be lifted, and he will serve the full suspension period. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-5\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-14\">.
