See <em>State ex rel. Nickoli v. Erie MetroParks, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 449, 2010-Ohio-606, 923 N.E.2d 588, \u00b6 30; see also <em>State ex rel. R.T.G., Inc. v. State, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-6716, 780 N.E.2d 998, \u00b6 30-31 (a case decided prior to the enactment of R.C. 2305.09(E) in which the court held that the six-year limitation period of R.C. 2305.07 was appropriate for mandamus actions brought to compel appropriation proceedings). Appellant did not raise its takings claim in the underlying mandamus action until June 2008, more than six years after September 2000, when the city issued to J.B.H. Properties, Inc., the building permit that appellant claims constituted a taking of its private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">{\u00b6 3} Finally, the continuous-violation doctrine did not toll the statute of limitations, because the city did not perform any additional challenged actions after it issued the permit. Every event that occurred thereafter \u201cwas merely a continuation of the effects of that solitary event rather than the occurrence of new discrete acts.\u201d <em>Nickoli </em>at \u00b6 33; see also <em>Ohio Midland, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(C.A.6, 2008), 286 Fed.Appx. 905, 912, 2008 WL 2622665, quoting <em>Tenenbaum v. Caldera </em>(C.A.6, 2002), 45 Fed.Appx. 416, 419, 2002 WL 2026347 (\u201c \u2018the present effects of past [violations] * * * do not trigger a continuing violations exception\u2019 \u201d to the statute of limitations).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Paul V.
