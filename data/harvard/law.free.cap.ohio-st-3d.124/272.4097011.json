(\u2018Solomon\u2019) retained the services of Karen Comisar Prescott (\u2018Prescott\u2019), an Ohio attorney located in Hamilton County, to assist him in the collection of a delinquent account in the principal amount of $2,411.82 owed by one of Solomon\u2019s patients, Gina Baer (\u2018Baer\u2019); and</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cF. WHEREAS, after Prescott contacted Baer in an attempt to collect the debt, Baer engaged the services of the Respondents and asked them to respond to Prescott\u2019s communication; and</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201cG.

WHEREAS, on February 1, 2005 Jansen sent a letter to Prescott, a copy of which is attached to the Complaint as Exhibit B, in which he offered on behalf of Baer to settle Solomon\u2019s $2,411.82 claim for a lump sum payment, in cash, of $1,300 based on: (1) Baer\u2019s apparent dissatisfaction with the professional services rendered by Solomon; (2) allegedly false statements made by Solomon\u2019s office personnel concerning the availability to Baer of insurance coverage for the services rendered; and (3) Baer\u2019s distressed financial condition; and {\u00b6 10} \u201cI. WHEREAS, since February 1, 2005 Jansen, on behalf of other clients of the Respondents, also has sent to other creditors or their representatives at least seven similar letters in which Jansen raised possible defenses or mitigation to the validity or the amount, or both, of the creditor\u2019s claim and, on that basis, has offered on behalf of the Respondents\u2019 client to settle the claim for less than the full amount; and</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cJ.

WHEREAS, in order to eliminate the need for contentious, costly and time-consuming litigation of their dispute, the outcome of which is uncertain, and to amicably settle their disagreements and differences, the Relator and the Respondents have agreed to enter into this Stipulation and Agreed Order; and {\u00b6 13} \u201cL. WHEREAS, Relator and Respondents hereby waive notice of and a hearing before the Board of Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cNOW, THEREFORE, it hereby is agreed, decreed and ordered that:</p>\n<p id=\"A6P\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c1. The Respondents permanently shall cease and desist from sending on behalf of any client of the Respondents located in the State of Ohio any correspondence, email message, memorandum or any other written or oral communication to any creditor of such client which communication disputes or otherwise calls into question the validity or amount of the creditor\u2019s claim against such client (except only to the extent any such creditor has or may have incorrectly computed the amount of its claim then due).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c2.

The Relator hereby withdraws its demand for civil penalties against the Respondents for the reasons that: the Respondents have fully cooperated with the Relator with respect to its investigation; the number of occasions on which the Relator claims the Respondents engaged in the unauthorized practice of law is small (eight); the violations were not flagrant; and it does not appear that any thrid [sic, third] parties suffered significant harm as the result of the Respondents\u2019 activities. The Relator also shall not seek reimbursement from the Respondents for the Relator\u2019s legal fees or expenses incurred in connection with this proceeding, provided the Respondents comply and remain in compliance with the terms hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 18} <em>\u201c4. </em>The Relator expressly reserves all of its rights and remedies in connection with any violation hereof by the Respondents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 19} Costs are taxed to respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
