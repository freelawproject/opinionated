In modifying the commissioner\u2019s valuation, the BTA relied on a theory of error that was not specified in Ohio Bell\u2019s notice of appeal to the BTA. Therefore, we agree that the BTA lacked jurisdiction, and we reverse the decision of the BTA and reinstate the determination of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 2} Pursuant to statute, public utilities must pay property tax. The property tax is an ad valorem tax; the tax rate is applied to the taxable percentage of the true value of the utility\u2019s personal property. R.C. 5727.06, 5727.10, 5727.11, and 5727.111. To impose the tax, the commissioner must first determine the value of the utility\u2019s property. R.C. 5727.10. That value forms the base for the ultimate determination of the amount of the tax.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> R.C. 5727.111. This case involves a dispute over true value.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 3} In the spring of 2003, Ohio Bell submitted its annual public-utility property report for the 2003 tax year. That fall, the commissioner issued his preliminary assessment. Using the method required by R.C. 5727.11(A), which takes historical cost as the starting point and then subtracts industry-specific depreciation allowances developed by the commissioner, the commissioner determined that the true value of Ohio Bell\u2019s property was $2,466,085,652.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 4} Believing that this valuation was too high, Ohio Bell filed a petition for reassessment under R.C. 5727.47. The petition contained two objections, but only one is pertinent here:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination of the true value of all taxable property of [Ohio Bell] does not reflect its true value in money as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Ohio law. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination is erroneous, unjust and unreasonable because, <em>inter alia, </em>it overstates both costs and service lives and utilizes a method that does not reasonably reflect true value. Correction of the Tax Commissioner\u2019s errors results in a total reduction in true value of $919,726,091 and a reduction in taxable value of $351,611,285.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">{\u00b6 6} In support of its petition for reassessment, Ohio Bell submitted a \u201cDepreciated Replacement Cost Study.\u201d This study \u2014 consistent with Ohio Bell\u2019s objection that the commissioner had \u201coverstate[d] both costs and service lives\u201d\u2014 sought to establish a new cost figure (using \u201creplacement cost new\u201d) and new depreciation figures (using service lives that \u201cbetter reflect[ ] the true loss of service value in the company\u2019s assets\u201d). The commissioner denied the petition, finding that Ohio Bell had not established \u201ca more accurate gauge of the true value of [its] property than the assessed value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 7} Ohio Bell filed a notice of appeal with the BTA. The notice, like the petition, contained two specifications of error, but only the second is pertinent here:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c[T]he cost less depreciation method utilized by the Tax Commissioner does not reflect the true value in money of [Ohio Bell\u2019s] taxable property as required by Ohio law. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination is erroneous, unjust and unreasonable because, <em>inter alia, </em>it overstates both costs and service lives and utilizes a method that does not reasonably reflect true value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 9} In support, Ohio Bell submitted the same valuation study it had presented to the commissioner. After Ohio Bell filed its notice of appeal but before its BTA hearing, the BTA decided another case involving a different telephone company (Cincinnati Bell), in which it rejected a valuation study similar to the one Ohio Bell had prepared in its case. See <em>Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. v. Zaino </em>(June 10, 2005), BTA Nos. 2003-K-765 and 2003-K-1612. In that decision, the BTA observed that the valuation study was not an acceptable alternative valuation method within the meaning of R.C. 5727.11(A), which permits the use of \u201canother method of valuation\u201d if the statutory method \u201cwill not result in the determination of true value.\u201d The BTA concluded that the valuation study was not acceptable, because it was not in fact a valuation. The BTA contrasted Cincinnati Bell\u2019s study with the unit appraisal presented in <em>Texas E. Transm. Corp. v. Tracy </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 83, 676 N.E.2d 523. In a unit appraisal, a professional appraiser determines the \u201cunit\u201d to be appraised (such as the public utility\u2019s operating properties), estimates the market value of that unit, and allocates an appropriate portion of the unit to the taxing jurisdiction. See id. at 83-84, 676 N.E.2d 523. Because Cincinnati Bell had not presented an acceptable alternative valuation method, the BTA proceeded to address whether Cincinnati Bell had demonstrated \u201cthrough competent and probative evidence [that] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>application of the commissioner\u2019s prescribed rates creates an unjust or unreasonable result, [and that] reliance upon the statutory method is inappropriate.\u201d Concluding that Cincinnati Bell had failed to make such a showing, the BTA affirmed the final determination of the Tax Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">{\u00b6 10} After the BTA rejected Cincinnati Bell\u2019s valuation study, Ohio Bell abandoned its own. Instead of presenting the replacement-cost and service-life studies that Ohio Bell had presented to the commissioner, it filed a motion for a continuance. The motion itself is not contained in the record, but according to a BTA interim order, Ohio Bell \u201cindicated that in light of [the BTA\u2019s] decision in <em>Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. v. Zaino </em>* * *, which rejected a valuation study similar to that upon which [Ohio Bell] apparently * * * intended to rely,\u201d the company had engaged an appraiser \u201cto prepare an appraisal of its public utility personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 11} The commissioner filed a motion to exclude the proposed appraisal, arguing that the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction extended only to \u201cmatters decided by the Commissioner that have been specified as error by the taxpayer\u201d and that neither condition was satisfied by Ohio Bell. The BTA denied the motion and allowed the testimony. It held that Ohio Bell\u2019s petition for reassessment and notice of appeal contained an adequate specification of error, as \u201cthe commissioner and this board were clearly put on notice that appellant was objecting to the application of the cost less depreciation method typically employed by the commissioner in valuing its public utility property.\u201d The notice pleadings, according to the BTA, are required to provide notice of claimed error, but did not need to provide \u201call of the evidence\u201d in support of that claim. (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 12} Accordingly, at the BTA hearing, Ohio Bell presented the unit appraisal and the testimony of the appraiser who had prepared it. In his report, the appraiser explained that he had employed \u201cthree indicators or approaches to value\u201d \u2014 based on cost, income, and comparable sales \u2014 to \u201cmake a judgment determination of the market value\u201d of Ohio Bell\u2019s public-utility property. Giving the most weight and emphasis to the income approach, the appraiser concluded that the true value of Ohio Bell\u2019s property was $1,672,518,399, over $790 million less than the commissioner\u2019s original valuation of $2,466,085,652.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 13} The BTA agreed with the appraiser. After making adjustments to reflect Ohio Bell\u2019s eventual abandonment of a separate issue, the BTA set the true value of Ohio Bell\u2019s public-utility property at $1,702,157,675, over $760 million less than the commissioner\u2019s original valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 14} The commissioner appealed, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 15} The commissioner raises a number of arguments assailing the BTA\u2019s decision; among them, he asserts that \u201cOhio Bell failed to confer jurisdiction on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the BTA to consider its appraisal-based challenge because Ohio Bell\u2019s notice of appeal failed to specify any error in the Commissioner\u2019s final determination relating to that appraisal challenge.\u201d We agree. Because of our disposition of this issue, it is unnecessary to address the commissioner\u2019s other challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 16} For an appeal to the BTA from a final determination of the tax commissioner, R.C. 5717.02 requires the notice of appeal to \u201cspecify the errors therein complained of.\u201d This requirement is jurisdictional. E.g., <em>Newman v. Levin, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 127, 2008-Ohio-5202, 896 N.E.2d 995, \u00b6 27 (the notice of appeal \u201cnever identified the issue * * * in his specifications of error to the BTA, and therefore the BTA lacked jurisdiction to consider that issue. As a result, we are without jurisdiction to consider it\u201d). The specificity requirement is also \u201cstringent.\u201d <em>Brown v. Levin, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-Ohio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 18. Thus, a notice of appeal \u201c \u2018must explicitly and precisely recite the errors contained in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newman </em>at \u00b6 26, quoting <em>Cousino Constr. Co. v. Wilkins, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 90, 2006-Ohio-162, 840 N.E.2d 1065, \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 17} We have made clear that a specification of error must not be so generic that it fails to set the case apart from any other case involving the same tax. <em>Broum </em>at \u00b6 22 (holding that the notice was fatally defective when the claimed error \u201cmight * * * have been raised in any <em>income tax </em>case in Ohio\u201d (emphasis sic)); <em>Castle Aviation, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 290, 2006-Ohio-2420, 847 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 41 (\u201cThe wording of Castle\u2019s constitutional claim is so general that it could be used in almost every use tax case\u201d); <em>Queen City Valves, Inc. v. Peck </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 579, 583, 53 O.O. 430, 120 N.E.2d 310 (an assertion that \u201cmight be advanced in nearly any case\u201d is not specific under R.C. 5717.02).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 18} Applying these standards, the BTA lacked jurisdiction to modify the commissioner\u2019s valuation of Ohio Bell\u2019s property on the basis of a unit appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 19} As pointed out earlier, Ohio Bell\u2019s notice of appeal to the BTA contained one specification of error pertinent here:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[T]he cost less depreciation method utilized by the Tax Commissioner does not reflect the true value in money of [Ohio Bell\u2019s] taxable property as required by Ohio law. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination is erroneous, unjust and unreasonable because, <em>inter alia, </em>it overstates both costs and service lives and utilizes a method that does not reasonably reflect true value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>{\u00b6 21} This paragraph could be read as stating two errors: one is that the determination \u201coverstates both costs and service lives\u201d; the other is that the \u201cmethod\u201d used by the commissioner did \u201cnot reasonably reflect true value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 22} The statement that the commissioner\u2019s determination \u201coverstates both costs and service lives\u201d did not preserve the theory that a unit appraisal establishes true value, and Ohio Bell does not contend otherwise. This statement basically describes the theory that Ohio Bell presented to the commissioner but not to the BTA: namely, the theory that certain variables in the statutory method (that is, cost and service lives) had been set too high. This language would have put the commissioner on notice that Ohio Bell intended to present the same theory to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 23} But this language gave no hint that the commissioner erred by not using a unit appraisal to establish true value. Nor did this language mention any of the concepts on which the appraisal\u2019s reduction in value was premised: the appraiser\u2019s judgment determination of the market value of the property or the income produced by the property. Notably, the appraiser considered but did not place much weight on the \u201ccost approach\u201d \u2014 the one valuation method arguably foreshadowed in the notice of appeal to the BTA \u2014 but \u201cgave most weight, by far, to the income approach.\u201d This shows the fundamental dissimilarity between the valuation theory presented to the commissioner (which was focused on revising the cost and depreciation variables) and the one presented to the BTA (which was focused on an expert appraiser\u2019s professional opinion of the <em>market </em>value of Ohio Bell\u2019s operating properties). See <em>Texas E. Transm. Corp., </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 86-87, 676 N.E.2d 523 (upholding the BTA\u2019s acceptance of a \u201cunit appraisal\u201d as an alternate valuation method to the cost-based statutory method of valuation).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 24} In short, the assertion that the commissioner \u201coverstated] both costs and service lives\u201d did not cover the unit-appraisal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 25} This leaves only the assertions that the method used by the commissioner \u201cdoes not reflect the true value in money of [Ohio Bell\u2019s] taxable property\u201d and \u201cdoes not reasonably reflect true value.\u201d Whereas the previous statement was too narrow to specify the need for a unit appraisal, these assertions are too broad, and they do not specify any error for purposes of R.C. 5717.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 26} It must be kept in mind that the standard against which valuation decisions are measured is \u201ctrue value.\u201d The statute under which this case was litigated requires the commissioner to find \u201cthe true value of all taxable property.\u201d R.C. 5727.11(A). We have observed that the \u201cultimate goal\u201d in a case of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>sort is \u201ctrue value.\u201d See <em>Texas E. Transm. Corp., </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 85, 676 N.E.2d 523 (public-utility property-tax case). Accordingly, in making his final determination, the commissioner attempted to establish \u201cthe true value\u201d of Ohio Bell\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">{\u00b6 27} Thus, when Ohio Bell stated in its notice of appeal that the commissioner\u2019s method did \u201cnot reasonably reflect true value,\u201d it essentially claimed that the commissioner\u2019s valuation failed to meet the standard without specifying how it fell short. Indeed, Ohio Bell simply restated the ultimate standard and added the word \u201cnot.\u201d Such a \u201cspecification\u201d is so broad that it specifies nothing at all. Innumerable alternate theories of \u201ctrue value\u201d could have been presented, just as innumerable claims of error could have been raised against the commissioner\u2019s determination. While Ohio Bell\u2019s specification is broad enough to <em>encompass </em>any one of these theories or faults (including the theory actually presented to the BTA), it did not <em>narrow </em>the issues in this case in any way. These statements simply register Ohio Bell\u2019s general disagreement with the final determination of value \u2014 which is little more than what is already evidenced by the existence of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 28} This is not enough to meet the requirements of the statute. Specifications of error must be explicit and precise, <em>Newman, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 127, 2008-Ohio-5202, 896 N.E.2d 995, \u00b6 26, but the wording of error in this notice is so general that it \u201cmight indeed have been raised in any [property] tax case,\u201d (emphasis omitted) <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-Ohio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 22. These statements in no way \u201ctie the facts of the case\u201d to the alleged error by explaining \u201chow\u201d the commissioner erred in valuing its property. See <em>Castle Aviation, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 290, 2006-Ohio-2420, 847 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 41. And we have rejected notices that did no more than state that some general standard was violated or not satisfied. See id. (notice of appeal that merely stated that the imposition of a tax \u201cviolates the Equal Protection Clause\u201d failed the specificity requirement); <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-Ohio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 21-22 (notice of appeal that merely stated that \u201cthe assessment is not supported by a proper application\u201d of the general income-tax statute failed specificity requirement). That is all this portion of Ohio Bell\u2019s notice of appeal does; for purposes of R.C. 5717.02, then, it specifies no error at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b629} Ohio Bell\u2019s only argument in response is that a taxpayer need not provide notice of \u201cthe <em>evidence </em>used by the taxpayer in support of [its] claim\u201d (emphasis sic), and according to Ohio Bell, that claim was that the statutory method failed to result in true value.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>{\u00b6 30} While it is true that an appellant need not specify the evidence on which it intends to rely, that is irrelevant here \u2014 the dispositive issue is whether the error charged to the commissioner and argued before the BTA was specified in the notice of appeal. As discussed above, it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 31} Because no statement in the notice of appeal can be reasonably construed as specifying the error on which the BTA relied in modifying the value of Ohio Bell\u2019s property, the BTA lacked jurisdiction to do so. Because the unit appraisal constituted the only factual basis presented to the BTA (Ohio Bell abandoned its earlier valuation study), we reverse the decision of the BTA that it had jurisdiction to consider the unit-appraisal issue. As stated, our disposition of this issue makes it unnecessary to reach the commissioner\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 32} While we have focused on the failings of Ohio Bell\u2019s notice of appeal to the BTA, we would briefly note that the flaws in that notice are not merely technical. Ohio Bell\u2019s notice did not mention any appraisal-related error, because Ohio Bell had not devised any appraisal-related theory at the time it drafted its notice. The jurisdictional issue here, then, stems from Ohio Bell\u2019s failure to present a case based on a unit appraisal to the commissioner, not from an unfortunate choice of words.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 33} Our cases suggest that such a failure to <em>present </em>an issue to the commissioner precludes the BTA from taking jurisdiction over that issue \u2014 even if the issue is <em>specified </em>in the notice of appeal. See, e.g., <em>CNG Dev. Co. v. Limbach </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 28, 32, 584 N.E.2d 1180; see also <em>DeWeese v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 324, 2003-Ohio-6502, 800 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 19-22. We need not decide, however, whether Ohio Bell could have presented a unit-appraisal theory to the BTA if it had specified that theory in all applicable notice pleadings but had not presented a unit appraisal to the commissioner. The notice of appeal, as discussed, did not specify that particular error, and that ground alone requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">{\u00b6 34} For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the BTA and reinstate the determination of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-12\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AKZ\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Azq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Calfee, Halter &amp; Griswold, L.L.P., James F.

After the determination of true value, which is usually the critical issue in property-tax cases, the assessment also computes the taxable portion of true value using percentages supplied by R.C. 5727.111. Then, under R.C. 5727.15, the taxable value is apportioned to those taxing districts in which the utility\u2019s property is located.
