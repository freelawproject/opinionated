The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we now suspend his license to practice law for six months, but stay the suspension on conditions, including monitored probation. The board\u2019s recommendation is based on findings that respondent committed professional misconduct, in that he failed to comply with discovery requests, to oppose a motion for summary judgment, to respond to a motion to deem admitted the statements propounded in requests for admissions, and to timely file a notice of appeal. We accept the board\u2019s findings that respondent violated ethical standards incumbent on Ohio lawyers. However, for the reasons that follow, we reject the board\u2019s recommended sanction and instead impose a six-month actual suspension from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association, charged respondent in a two-count complaint with violations of the Disciplinary Rules of the former Code of Professional Responsibility, including DR 1-104(A) (requiring a lawyer to advise a client that he lacks professional-liability insurance), 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), and 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting an entrusted legal matter). A three-member panel of the board heard the case, accepted respondent\u2019s stipulations to having committed the stated misconduct, made findings of fact and conclusions of law, and recommended the six-month suspension and conditional stay. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">{\u00b6 3} The parties have not objected to the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><em>Count I </em>\u2014 The <em>DR 1-10I(A) and 6-101(A)(3) Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">{\u00b6 4} Upon graduating from law school in 2000, respondent accepted employment with a large law firm in its litigation department. In 2002, however, he entered solo practice. Thereafter, he agreed to take over a number of cases from an attorney who was facing disciplinary proceedings for professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">{\u00b6 5} In one of those cases, respondent agreed to defend two clients in a pending age-discrimination lawsuit. Respondent, however, never provided his clients with the required notice that he did not carry professional-liability insurance. He entered his appearance as defense counsel in August 2002, and at a final pretrial conference the following month, requested a continuance of the trial date and an extension of time to complete discovery. The court continued the trial date until late January 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent then neglected the case. Thinking that he would be able to resolve the discovery issues and settle the case, respondent failed to respond to the plaintiffs November 2002 motion for partial summary judgment, and, as a result, the court granted the unopposed motion for partial summary judgment. Also in that case, respondent failed to reply to the plaintiffs motion to deem as admitted the statements in the plaintiffs requests for admissions. The court also granted this unopposed motion. Thereafter, the trial court overruled respondent\u2019s motion to reconsider the order granting partial summary judgment, noting respondent\u2019s failure to timely respond to the requests for admissions and to the motion seeking to deem as admitted the statements in the requests for admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">{\u00b6 7} Because respondent failed to respond to the plaintiffs requests for discovery, the court canceled the scheduled trial and held a hearing on a pending motion for default. The court granted a default judgment in March 2003, awarding the plaintiff damages of $184,675 \u2014 $130,900 in compensatory damages, $50,000 in punitive damages, and $3,775 in attorney fees. Respondent further failed to timely appeal that default judgment. The parties later settled the case for $27,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">{\u00b6 8} Because of respondent\u2019s failings, the board found the evidence clear and convincing that respondent had violated DR 1-104(A) and 6 \u2014 101 (A)(3). We accept these findings of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\"><em>Count II </em>\u2014 The <em>DR 1-102(A)(6) Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">{\u00b6 9} In early January 2004, the clients involved in Count I sued respondent for legal malpractice. In early November of that year, respondent and his former clients agreed to a settlement, which was reduced to judgment, requiring respondent to pay the former clients $17,000 if he paid on time and $22,000 if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>defaulted. Respondent agreed to pay in installments \u2014 $5,000 by November 15, 2004, $6,000 by May 15, 2005, and $6,000 by November 15, 2005. However, respondent defaulted after paying only one installment. He then agreed to make monthly payments of $500 commencing on August 1, 2005, to satisfy his outstanding obligation, but made only one payment under that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">{\u00b6 10} By mid-September 2005 respondent\u2019s financial situation had worsened. Facing foreclosure on three rental properties and a significantly reduced income due to a decrease in public-defender appointments, respondent filed for Chapter 7 voluntary bankruptcy and discharged his former clients\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">{\u00b6 11} The board found that respondent had entered into the settlements with his former clients in good faith and without any intent to avoid the obligation through bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the board found clear and convincing evidence that respondent\u2019s failure to satisfy the judgment adversely reflected on his fitness to practice law and violated DR 1-102(A)(6). We accept this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">{\u00b6 12} In recommending a sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, the board weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors of his case. The board cited respondent\u2019s suspension from practice in December 2005 for failing to comply with attorney-registration requirements as an aggravating factor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In mitigation, the board found that respondent has no prior disciplinary record, did not act with any selfish or dishonest motive, made free and full disclosure to relator, and cooperated throughout these proceedings. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (b), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">{\u00b6 13} The parties proposed as the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct a six-month suspension of his license to practice law with the entire period stayed on the conditions that he (1) commit no further violations of the applicable ethical standards, (2) complete six hours of continuing legal education in time management or law-office management as approved by relator, and (3) successfully complete a one-year monitored probation under the auspices of an attorney appointed by relator. The panel and board accepted that proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">{\u00b6 14} In adopting the panel\u2019s report, the board compared this sanction to the sanction imposed in <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Hales, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 340, 2008-Ohio-6201, 899 N.E.2d 130. The board determined that respondent\u2019s conduct warranted a sanction less severe than the sanction this court ordered in <em>Hales, </em>explaining:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201cHales was sanctioned because he (1) mishandled and lost his client\u2019s medical malpractice ease due to his inexperience; (2) failed to notify his insurance carrier of the client\u2019s legal malpractice claim, thus causing the insurer to deny coverage; and (3) [by declaring bankruptcy], prevented his client from collecting on a $280,000.00 default judgment she obtained [against him for legal malpractice] * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cHales filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition for discharge of his personal debts in February 2005. The Bankruptcy Court treated his filing as a \u2018no-asset case,\u2019 and as such, the failure to list the potential judgment did not prevent discharge of the debt. In mid-May 2005, the Bankruptcy Court discharged all of Hales\u2019s indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cHales\u2019s client sued him for malpractice in June of 2005. Respondent Hales did not file an answer in the legal-malpractice case and the Court awarded his client $280,000.00 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cAt some point, Hales also filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition listing the malpractice claim. The end result was Hales\u2019s client was unable to recover anything from him because of the discharge in bankruptcy and his failure to notify his liability insurer of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cHales was given a two-year suspension from the practice of law with 18 months stayed. Citing <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Gay </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 404, [763 N.E.2d 585], the Supreme Court did not order Hales to make restitution for the debt discharged in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe instant case differs from <em>Hales </em>in that [respondent\u2019s] clients did not suffer as much harm and Respondent in this case entered into the settlement with his clients in good faith and did not intend to discharge the obligation in bankruptcy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">{\u00b6 21} While we agree with the board\u2019s determination that respondent\u2019s conduct warrants a sanction less severe than that imposed in <em>Hales, </em>we note that the sanction imposed in <em>Hales </em>was more than a six-month suspension. It was a two-year suspension, with 18 months stayed upon conditions. Id., 120 Ohio St.3d 340, 2008-Ohio-6201, 899 N.E.2d 130, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Butler Cty. Bar Assn. v. Schoonover, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 472, 2005-Ohio-2816, 828 N.E.2d 1007, we imposed a six-month suspension stayed upon conditions for violations of the same disciplinary rules that respondent has been found to have violated. In <em>Schoonover, </em>the attorney accepted $350 from a couple to establish a guardianship for the husband\u2019s uncle but did not initiate the proceedings before the uncle\u2019s death several months later. Id. at \u00b6 3-7. Despite the clients\u2019 request for a refund, the attorney waited more than one and a half years to return their money. Id. at \u00b6 8. As in this case, the relator\u2019s investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>revealed that the attorney did not have malpractice insurance and that he had failed to advise his clients of that fact. Id. at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ay\">Reminger Co., L.P.A., Alan B. Parker, and Gary H. Goldwasser; and K. Ann Zimmerman, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b206-10\">Bricker &amp; Eckler, L.L.P., and Alvin E. Mathews Jr., for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Schoonover, </em>there were no aggravating factors. Id. at \u00b6 12. However, there were mitigating factors, including the death of the attorney\u2019s mother and his subsequent medical treatment for anxiety. Id. at \u00b6 11. Moreover, the board and this court noted that the attorney did not financially harm his clients and made restitution. Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 24} In contrast, respondent\u2019s neglect here resulted in a $184,675 judgment against his clients, who were able to later settle that obligation for $27,000. Although respondent agreed to pay his former clients $22,000, he paid them a total of only $5,500 before he defaulted on his obligation, and he subsequently discharged the remainder of that obligation in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 25} We acknowledge that respondent did not act with any selfish or dishonest motive, but we conclude that his conduct warrants a more severe sanction than that recommended by the board. Accordingly, respondent is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">. See <em>In re Atty. Registration Suspension, Dawson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 1431, 2005-Ohio-6408, 838 N.E.2d 671. The board also noted that respondent has been issued monetary sanctions for failing to comply with continuing-legal-education requirements; however, Gov.Bar R. X(5)(C) prohibits consideration of such sanctions in disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
