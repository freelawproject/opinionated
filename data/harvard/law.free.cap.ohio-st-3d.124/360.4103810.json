DiMartino of Youngstown, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0039270, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1987. In December 1994, we suspended respondent\u2019s license to practice for six months, staying the suspension on conditions, because he failed to timely respond to a client\u2019s inquiries about her case, to provide that client with a settlement statement, and to promptly forward the client her portion of settlement proceeds. <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. DiMartino </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 95, 642 N.E.2d 342. On July 18, 2007, because respondent failed in his duty to diligently represent a client for whom he had promised to seek postconviction relief, we imposed a one-year suspension of his license, staying the suspension on condition of monitored probation and no further misconduct. <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. DiMartino, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 174, 2007-Ohio-3605, 870 N.E.2d 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline now recommends that we suspend respondent\u2019s license for six months, but stay the last three months of the suspension, again on conditions that he complete one year of monitored probation and commit no further misconduct. The recommendation is based on the board\u2019s findings that respondent committed bigamy in North Carolina, a felony in that state, and thereby violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving fraud, deceit, or dishonesty). We agree that respondent violated this rule of professional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 3} Although the sanction recommended by the board is in response solely to the misconduct committed in this case, our disposition must also reflect that respondent engaged in this misconduct during the one-year stayed suspension imposed on July 18, 2007. Because respondent violated the terms of that stay, we lift the stay, reinstate that suspension, and as a sanction for the impropriety in this case, order a six-month suspension to run concurrently with the one-year reinstated suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">{\u00b6 4} Relator, Mahoning County Bar Association, charged respondent with one count of misconduct, alleging among other ethical breaches a violation of Prof. Cond.R. 8.4(c). A panel of three board members heard the case, including the parties\u2019 stipulations to the cited misconduct, and made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation for a license suspension of six months with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the last three months stayed on conditions. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">{\u00b6 5} The parties have not objected to the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent, a seasoned criminal defense attorney, married his longtime girlfriend in early August 2001. The couple eventually separated when respondent\u2019s wife asked him to move out, and in September 2005, they sought the dissolution of their marriage in the Portage County Common Pleas Court. That court dismissed the dissolution proceeding when respondent\u2019s wife failed in January 2006 to appear at a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">(\u00b6 7} In April 2007, respondent filed in the same court an action for divorce. He had become involved with another woman in the time since he separated from his wife and had arranged to be remarried in North Carolina on July 7, 2007. Respondent expected his divorce to be finalized by that time; however, negotiations to terminate the marriage broke down, and the divorce did not become final by respondent\u2019s new wedding date.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent nevertheless married again. Beforehand, respondent signed a marriage-license application in which he falsely represented that it was his first marriage. Respondent did not disclose to his new wife that he was not yet divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent\u2019s first wife alerted North Carolina authorities of his remarriage, and he was investigated for the crime of bigamy, a felony in North Carolina. She also caused a grievance to be filed with relator, alleging that respondent\u2019s failure to terminate one marriage before entering another constituted unethical conduct. Prosecutors in North Carolina ultimately opted not to prosecute. Respondent\u2019s divorce became final in August 2007, and he then legally married his second wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent admitted that his conduct constituted a violation of Prof. Cond.R. 8.4(c). The board accepted this admission, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">{\u00b6 11} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">{\u00b6 12} Instances of bigamy involving Ohio lawyers are rare. In <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Muttalib </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 529, 740 N.E.2d 246, however, we indefinitely suspended a lawyer from practice because he failed to act on behalf of three clients, failed to return fees paid by those clients, and had also married without first terminating a prior marriage. That lawyer had also abandoned his first wife and four children. He then ignored the disciplinary process, making it necessary for a disposition by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent\u2019s situation is different. Although his disciplinary record, which includes several instances of client neglect, is an aggravating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a), respondent was, unlike the attorney in <em>Muttalib, </em>in the process of ending his first marriage. Upon learning of respondent\u2019s impending nuptials, his wife had rejected a final settlement at the last minute and asked for more money. Though he knew of this development, respondent admittedly exercised poor judgment by deciding to go ahead with the wedding. Within days after his illegal marriage, however, respondent notified the wedding official and encouraged the official to cooperate with law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 14} Also unlike the lawyer in <em>Muttalib, </em>respondent cooperated in the disciplinary process, a mitigating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). He has expressed great remorse and embarrassment over his wrongdoing, which did not compromise any client\u2019s interest. Testimony from his character witness and many reference letters as to his professional competence and commitment to clients weigh heavily in his favor. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(e). Respondent\u2019s commitment to community service is also evident from the record. <em>Muttalib </em>does not apply here in light of all the mitigating factors and the circumstances of respondent\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 15} We accept the board\u2019s recommendation insofar as it recommends imposition of a six-month suspension for the act of bigamy. But respondent violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) while he was subject to a stayed one-year license suspension, with the stay conditioned upon his committing no further misconduct. <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. DiMartino, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 174, 2007-Ohio-3605, 870 N.E.2d 1166. This violation of the terms of the stay requires his suspension from practice for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 16} We therefore lift the stay and reinstate the one-year suspension from practicing law in Ohio as ordered in <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. DiMartino, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 174, 2007-Ohio-3605, 870 N.E.2d 1166. As a sanction for the impropriety committed in this case, respondent\u2019s license to practice law in Ohio is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>suspended for six months, with the suspension to run concurrently with the reinstated suspension.
