This defence is not now open to him in this court. The Court of Common Pleas found as a fact that the prosecutor requested the services of the defendant as a physician and employed him to attend his father. Upon the contract thus arising a recovery was had. We cannot look into the testimony to see whether we would have come .to the same conclusion. The case has been tried, and the record before us discloses no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Let the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
