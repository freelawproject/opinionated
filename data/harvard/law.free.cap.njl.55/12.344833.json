The reference to him as \u201cthe justice of the Supreme Court holding the Circuit Court in and for said county,\u201d is a mere <em>designatio 'personae. </em>The expression evidently confers upon the official no authority, \u25a0except such as is expressly prescribed, which is that he shall \u25a0entertain the complaint in the capacity of a commissioner \u2022acting under and absolutely by the force of a statutory authorization. He is to determine the matter and make an order \u2022dismissing the petition or setting aside the election, and which \u2022order is to be filed with the clerk of the county. This is the \u2022entire scope and extent of the power expressly conferred, and it would not seem that, in such an affair, a justice of the \u2022Supreme Court has inherent in his office any ability that would materially subserve this statutory endowment. It is \u25a0true that, as such justice, he is possessed of the statutory \u25a0authority to take voluntary oaths and affidavits, but he could &lt;not compel the attendance of witnesses, nor could he punish \u25a0their recusancy if they should refuse to be sworn. In the \u00a1present inquiry it is not pertinent to consider the serious question whether this entire provision relating to this method of \u2022determining the legality of these elections, is not so imperfect and incomplete with respect to the power conferred upon the judicial officer who is to decide the controversy, as to render the provision itself wholly nugatory, all our immediate concern being to emphasize the fact that such justice in executing \u25a0the function in question does not sit <em>in curia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">This being the <em>status </em>of the litigation the question necessarily is presented, How can this court take cognizance of it in that form of proceeding? The justice having the case \u25a0under the statute before him has sent it to us for our advisory opinion. Whence does the Supreme Court obtain jurisdiction in such an inquiry ? Most plainly it cannot be claimed that \u25a0it is possessed of it by virtue of the two hundred and forty-seventh section of the Practice act, for that provision relates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>exclusively to cases pending in the county Circuit Courts; nor is there the faintest trace of such a power to be discovered in any of the prerogatives of the court regarded as' a common law tribunal. If the present procedure can be certified to this court for its advisory opinion, so can any of the numerous procedures required by various statutes to be transacted by the respective members of this court. But such certification is not only unknown to the law, but it is, from its intrinsic nature, highly objectionable. When a case is certified from the Circuit to this court by force of the Practice act, the formal advice of this court has the force of a judgment in its conclusiveness; the circuit judge is required to enforce it and error may be assigned upon it; but if, in such instances as the present, this court should render the advice sought for, its conclusions would be devoid of all peremptory authority, for it would be entirely competent for the officer to whom they were sent to disregard them, and in despite of them to carry his own convictions into effect. It is deemed that it would not comport with the dignity of this high tribunal t,o pronounce decisions, in solemn form and after full consideration, that would be entitled to no force beyond that of argument or persuasion. And, in addition <em>to </em>this objection, there is another which, perhaps, is equally serious. By the constitution of this state a justice of this court who has expressed an opinion on any subject in litigation cannot sit in the Court of Errors when such subject is there on review. So that the consequence would be, if we comply with the present solicitation, that each member of this court participating in the transaction, would abdicate measureably that appellate power which, on considerations of the public interest, has been vested in him. The consequence is that the court must decline to render the assistance that has been requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">It is proper to remark that, at the last term of this court, an advisory opinion was given in one of these cases by one of the justices of this court, but the question of jurisdiction was not mooted nor considered on that occasion, so that this court does not feel itself bound by such judicial action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
