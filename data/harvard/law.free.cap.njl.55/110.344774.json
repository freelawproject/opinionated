According to section 5 of our Tax act of April 11th, 1866 <em>(Rev., p. </em>1150), the prosecutor\u2019s stock in that company was therefore exempt from taxation. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ramsey, Collector, </em>25 <em>Vroom </em>546.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The federal statutes for the organization of banking associations permits shares in them to be taxed under authority of the state within which the bank is located, and expressly provides that shares owned by non-residents of the state may be taxed in the city or town where the bank is located, and not elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">This statute-by. fair construction excludes all state taxation \u25a0of the shares of stock except such as it expressly permits, and this exclusion is constitutional and valid. <em>Van Allen </em>v. <em>The Assessors, </em>3 <em>Wall. </em>573; <em>North Ward National Bank </em>v. <em>City of Newark, </em>10 <em>Vroom </em>380. Consequently shares of stock in a national banking association cannot be taxed by any state except that within which the bank is <em>located; </em>they are withdrawn from taxation under the authority of other states. <em>Tappan v. Merchants National Bank, </em>19 <em>Wall. </em>490.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">The taxes complained of must be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
