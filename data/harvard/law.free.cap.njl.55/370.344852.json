A defendant sued for false imprisonment pleaded that he made com plaint under oath, setting forth certain facts, and that thereupon the justice issued his warrant, &amp;c. In his replication the plaintiff averred that the defendant, when he made such oath, knew that the facts stated did not constitute a nuisance or other indictable offence. <em>Held, </em>such replication was demurrable, it being the duty of the justice to construe, in point of law, the facts.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Action for false imprisonment. On demurrer to plea.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\">Argued at February Term, 1893, before Beasley, Chief Justice, and Justices Dixon, Reed and Magie.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-7\">For the plaintiff, <em>Bedle, Muirheid &amp; McGee.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-8\">For the defendants, <em>Henry S.

The plea then averred that thereupon a warrant was issued by him, under which the plaintiff was arrested, &amp;c., and which are the supposed trespasses complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">To this plea a demurrer has been interposed, raising the first of the issues to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">The argument in support of this demurrer is, in effect, that the justice was without jurisdiction in the affair in question, inasmuch as the affidavit on which he founded his judicial action \u201c did not disclose any crime or indictable offence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the part of Booth.\u201d It is urged that a private and not a public nuisance was thus exhibited, and that, therefore, the issuance of the warrant was unjustifiable. Granting this position, the argument is .without any legal force. It is obvious that the principle on which it can alone be rested is, that the justice is liable to a suit in every case in which he mistakes the law with regard to his duty either in granting or refusing a warrant when a criminal complaint is before him. If this justice be suable in this instance, it is not easy to imagine any legal error committed by him in a proceeding of this character for which he would not be suable. This officer had jurisdiction over the class of offences in which he deemed the case before him was comprehended; he erred in failing to perceive the distinction between a tortious act that affected the defendant Kurrus and <em>\u201c </em>many other persons,\u201d but not the public, generally. The distinction is a technical one, and the contention that this defendant is answerable to the party injured by reason of his inability or failure to nicely discriminate, is without support, either in reason or legal science. Such a rule would render actionable every mistake of every court or judge in ordering bail when it should finally appear that such order had been rested on an illegal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">This demurrer must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The second and third problems to be solved proceed from two demurrers put in by Adolph Kurrus, who was the prosecutor in the complaint before the justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">This defendant had, in a plea, set forth the facts, showing that he had made the complaint which has already been .stated in considering the demurrer just disposed of; and to this plea the plaintiff filed ten replications, the sixth and seventh of which are those demurred to. These several replications are, in substance, to this effect, viz., the sixth alleges that the action ought not to be barred, because \u201c the complaint therein alleged does not constitute a sufficient defence \u201d as pleaded; and the seventh, because \u201c the complaint in manner and form as \u201d in the plea \u201c set forth is untrue and known to said defendant to be untrue, in.that the said fence was not a nuisance; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>and was not an indictable offence or one for which a citizen could be criminally held \u201d in manner and form as pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The former of these replications, it is plain, has the effect of a demurrer and nothing beyond. It does not deny a single fact stated, but admitting the facts, avers that the complaint <em>\u201c </em>does not constitute a sufficient defence.\u201d The issue thus presented is purely one of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The second replication is also devoid of all legal force. Its entire averment is, not that the defendant knew that any of the facts stated in his complaint were untrue, but that he knew that such facts did not constitute a nuisance or other indictable offence. But if this defendant stated the facts truly, ho had a right to submit them to the judgment of the justice, no matter what his notion was as to their legal value.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Both of these demurrers should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The legal principles above applied will be found sanctioned and exemplified in the opinion read in the Court of Errors and Appeals in the case of <em>Grove </em>v. <em>Van Duyn, </em>15 <em>Vroom </em>654.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
