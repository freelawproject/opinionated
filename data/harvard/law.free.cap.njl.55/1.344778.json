To this end it, in the first place, empowers the mayor of each of such cities to appoint five persons, who are constituted a board of public works, having exclusive control over the sewers, water works and streets; and it then proceeds to direct that by the same authority shall be appointed a city clerk, city comptroller, city counsel, receiver of taxes and inspector of buildings in lieu of all other officers in such departments theretofore existing.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">The cities affected by this legislation have been classified on the basis of population, and it is contended that such basis jhas no causal relation to the system established 'by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">But this, we think, is a plain fallacy. Almost all offices \u2022.affecting the interests of a great number of persons are of a \u00bfhighly important character, while those that touch the affairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>only of a few persons are usually insignificant. It. seems undeniable that the clerkship of a large city is of much greater public concern than the clerkship, of a small one. If, \u25a0then, the importance of the office is to be measured by the \u25a0largeness of the population in which it operates, it would .\u2022seem to follow, as a direct consequence, that the method of Ailing such office has the same affiliation with population. It is not apprehended that any one will deny that offices of \u25a0this kind increase in rank in proportion to the growth in uumber of those persons whose interests they promote, and \u25a0that in the same ratio the question how such offices are to be \u25a0supplied with incumbents rises in importance. It may well be \u25a0that no evils will be perceived when such officers as a city clerk \u2022or that of tax collector are chosen in a small city by a common \u25a0council composed of few persons, while the opposite may result \u25a0when such election is made in a l\u00e1rge city by a council having, it is most probable, many members. Experience both in state and in municipal affairs has shown that a numerous body cannot be converted into an eligible appointive power, as is illustrated in the frame of our state constitution, which transferred\u2019 the prerogative of official appointment from the joint meeting to the governor. Where such power shall reside in our municipal constitutions is, therefore, a subject for legislative \u2022determination, depending on the magnitude of the.given office, .and which magnitude, as we have seen, is to be tested by \u00a1population. A classification by population, in this respect, is, \u2022consequently, entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In leaving the subject it may be well to remark, that the argument for the relator in this case, if it should have prevailed, would have established the doctrine- that the appointive \u2022power in every city of the state, from the smallest to the highest, must be identical, a doctrine in diametrical opposition to 'the decision of this court in the case of <em>Haynes, Mayor of Newark, </em>reported in 25 <em>Vroom </em>6.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The decisions cited by the counsel of the relator in support \u2022of their views, such as those of <em>Hightstown </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>18 <em>Vroom </em>105, and <em>Helfer </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>24 <em>Id. </em>550, are not authorities ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>plicabl\u00e9' on the present occasion. They rest upon the ground that the statutes to which they respectively relate were illusory, a quality that cannot be ascribed to the act which we have been considering. In the act before us the method for the appointment of a city clerk is a'consistent part of a general system, and, as it harmonizes with such system, it presents not the faintest indication of an attempt to evade the prohibitions of the fundamental law; whereas, as in the case of Heifer <em>v. </em>Simon, just cited, a single officer, of minor importance, was directed to be appointed in cities of the second class in a way that was altogether unique, so that it was out of unison with all the other parts of the scheme of government into which it was intruded, the consequence being that it was properly thought to be elusive as a provision contrived for some private purpose. There is a plain line of distinction between such a case and the present one.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The respondent is entitled to judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
