Article 827, C. C. P., provides as 'follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">An appeal is taken by giving notice thereof'..in open court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>at the term of court at which conviction is had, and having the same entered of record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In the present instance, we find in the transcript immediately following the \u201cOrder Overruling Motion for New Trial\u201d a notation by the County Clerk to the effect that:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u201cThe above instrument is not of record in the Criminal minutes but is a filed paper only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Under the terms of the article mentioned, this is not a sufficient notice of appeal.. Consequently this court is without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. See Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C., sec. 588, and cases cited; also cases cited under Art. 827, Vernon\u2019s Ann. Texas C. C.
