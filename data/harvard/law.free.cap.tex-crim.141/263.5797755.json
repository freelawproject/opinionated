We are unable to find any harmful result to appellant by the exhibition of the gin as described in the bill of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">The proceedings seem to be regular in every way; the evidence justifies the verdict of the jury and, consequently, there is nothing for this court to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
