After an appeal to the county court, and, upon a trial de novo, judgment was entered assessing a fine of $10.00 against the appellant. Article 58, C. C. P., reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-18\">\u201cThe Court of Criminal Appeals shall have appellate jurisdiction coextensive with the limits of the State in all criminal cases. This article shall not be so construed as to embrace any case which has been appealed from any inferior court to the county court or county court at law, in which the fine imposed by the county court or county court at law shall not exceed one hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-19\">Under the terms of the statute this court has no jurisdiction of the appeal.

We adhere to our holding that we have no jurisdiction to decide any matter presented, and the motion for rehearing is. denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
