The Sheriff of Scurry County testified that, operating under a search warrant, he searched appellant\u2019s residence in Scurry County on the 29th of June, 1940, and found in the possession of appellant twenty-five 12-ounce cans of beer and some bottles containing whisky. Some of the beer was in the ice box and was cold. Several cans of beer were hidden under \u2022 a mattress. The witness testified further that he found a great number of \u201cbeer can-openers\u201d and two small glasses \u201cof the size used to pour in a drink of whisky.\u201d Appellant testified that he and A. D. Davis possessed the liquor. He said that one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the bottles of whisky found by the sheriff belonged to him and the other to A. D. Davis. It was appellant\u2019s further version that none of the liquor was possessed for the purpose of sale. Davis testified that he had procured a bottle of whisky under a prescription given him by a physician. He testified that he did not remember the name of the physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\">No bills of exception are brought forward.
