It is also shown that the relator has already had the benefit of one writ of habeas corpus, at which hearing bail herein was reduced from $1500.00 to $750.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The mere fact that a person approached, and requested to go on a bond, thinks that the bond is set too high, would not be a moving reason for this court to also say that such bond was set at too great a figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">There is no reason shown herein why this bond is too onerous or excessive. We are offered no more cogent reason why this court should reduce this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
