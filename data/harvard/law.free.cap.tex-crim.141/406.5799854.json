This was granted, and four gallons of mescal were found in the northeast corner of her bedroom under a trap door in the floor. The trap door was hidden by a trunk. Later they found a gallon jug with some mescal in it in another room. The officers had a search warrant, but, having secured the permission of appellant to search her house, they did not present their search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The evidence details fully the finding of the mescal in containers named, but there is no evidence found in the record which states, or even indicates, that there was no stamp showing the payment of taxes due the State of Texas or evidence thereof, as charged in the complaint and information. The State has wholly failed to offer proof upon which the jury would be warranted in returning a verdict of guilty under the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Other questions raised in the appeal will not likely occur upon another trial. The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded. The State\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
