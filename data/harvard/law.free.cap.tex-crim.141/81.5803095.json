We are of .the opinion that he was entitled to such an instruction because the testimony shows that if appellant transported any whisky he did so in Fannin County near the line between Fannin and Delta Counties. The trial court no doubt realized that the evidence failed to show that appellant ever entered Delta County while engaged in the transportation of whisky at the time in question, because he instructed the jury that if they believed from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, in Delta County, or within four hundred yards of the boundary line of said county, transported whisky, to find him guilty. The court evidently was of the opinion that Art. 190, C. C. P. applied to cases of this nature and that is why he gave said article in his charge to the jury. The article mentioned is merely a venue statute and cannot transform a legal act into an illegal one. It is obvious that the sale or transportation of intoxicating liquor in a wet area, although within four hundred years of a dry area, would not constitute an offense. Since the sale or transportation of the whisky was presumptively legal, the evidence was insufficient to authorize a conviction, and the charge of the court was also erroneous. See Owens v. State, 138 Texas Crim. Rep., 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">For the reasons indicated, the judgment of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
