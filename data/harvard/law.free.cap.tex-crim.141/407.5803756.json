It has been held repeatedly and consistently that a docket entry does not comply with the requirement of Art. 827, C. C. P. See authorities cited under said article in Vernon\u2019s Ann. Texas C. C. P., Vol. 3; Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C., p. 302, sec. 588; 4 Tex. Jur., secs. 77 and 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">In the face of consistent holdings that, in order to give this court jurisdiction, the notice of appeal must be entered in the minutes of the court, it is surprising how many cases still reach us in which the record either shows no notice of appeal at all or a docket entry only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
