Hence nothing is presented for review other than the sufficiency of the complaint and information, which seem to be in due form.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">We find in the record a motion for a continuance but there is nothing to show that the motion was ever presented to the court or that the court acted thereon or that any exception was reserved to any action of the court relative thereto.
