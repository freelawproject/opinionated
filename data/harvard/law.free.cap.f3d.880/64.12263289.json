NASDAQ encountered a variety of technical difficulties in executing the IPO that resulted in trades not being performed properly. Retail investors sued NASDAQ, and those claims were eventually settled for $26,5 .million.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">NASDAQ maintained both errors and omissions (\u201cE <em>&amp; </em>0\u201d) and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 (\u201cD &amp; 0\u201d) insurance policies. Appellant Beazley Insurance Company was the second-level E &amp; 0 carrier; appellees ACE American Insurance Company and Illinois National Insurance Company were the first and second level D <em>&amp; </em>0 carriers, respectively. ACE and Illinois National disclaimed coverage under the D &amp; 0 policies, Beazley paid out its policy limit of $15 million in E <em>&amp; </em>0 coverage subject to an agreement with NASDAQ in which NASDAQ assigned Beazley its contractual rights against ACE and National; Beazley then sued \u00c1CE and National for coverage under D &amp; 0 policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Rakoff, /.) ultimately granted ACE and Illinois National summary judgment. <em>Beazley Ins. Co. Inc. v. ACE Am. Ins. Co., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178787\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/616/\">197 F.Supp.3d 616</extracted-citation> (S.D.N.Y. 2016). The district court found that (1) retail investors in Facebook were unambiguously \u201ccustomers\u201d of NASDAQ; (2) the underlying securities claims against NASDAQ arose out of NASDAQ\u2019s provision of professional services; and (3) thus, the claims were excluded from coverage pursuant to the D &amp; 0 policy\u2019s professional services exclusion. We agree with the district court that federal securities law makes clear that retail investors in company stock are \u201ccustomers\u201d of NASDAQ within the meaning of the insurance' policies at issue. We also agree that the claims in the underlying complaint arose out of the provision of \u201cprofessional services,\u201d as plaintiffs could not prevail without demonstrating that their losses flowed from NASDAQ\u2019s failure to properly process'their trades. We , thus affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the issue of indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">NASDAQ is a public stock exchange that provides an electronic trading platform on which its members, registered broker-dealers, execute securities transactions. <em>See NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. v. UBS Sec. LLC, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267889\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/1010/#p1013\">770 F.3d 1010</extracted-citation>, 1013-14 (2d Cir. 2014). Members trade on NASDAQ both on their own behalf, and on behalf of retail investors. <em>See <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267889\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/1010/#p1013\">id.</extracted-citation></em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">As relevant here, NASDAQ maintained two stacks, or towers, of insurance coverage. NASDAQ purchased a tower of E &amp; O coverage from Chartis Specialty Insurance Company, Beazley and ACE. Chartis provided primary coverage of $15 million, above a $1 million self-insured retention, for all \u201c[djamages resulting from any Claim ... for any Wrongful Act of the Insured\u201d that \u201coccur[ed] ... solely in rendering or failing to render Professional Services.\u201d App\u2019x at 204. The Beazley E &amp; O policy provided excess coverage with another $15 million in coverage, and \u201cfollow[ed] form\u201d to Chartis\u2019 policy, that is, provided coverage on the same, terms. App\u2019x at 192. ACE\u2019s policy provided second level excess insurance, with a $15 million limit after the Chartis and Beazley policies were exhausted. [App\u2019x 177] Altogether, NASDAQ purchased $50 million in E &amp; O coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">NASDAQ also purchased a tower of D <em>&amp; </em>O coverage from ACE and Illinois National. The ACE D &amp; O policy was primary and provided $15 million in coverage after a $2 million self-insurance retention for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>liability incurred by certain officers and directors for any \u201c[wrongful [a]cts.\u201d App\u2019x at 1624. The ACE D &amp; 0 also provided coverage to NASDAQ for any losses NASDAQ became obligated to pay \u201cby reason of a Securities Claim ... for any Wrongful Acts.\u201d App\u2019x at 1624.' The ACE D &amp; 0 policy also contained a \u201cprofessional services exclusion\u201d that provided that ACE \u201cshall not be liable for Loss on account of any Claim ... by or on behalf of a customer or client of the Company, alleging, based upon, arising out of,' or attributable to the rendering or failure to render professional services.\u201d App\u2019x at 1628,. 1658. Illinois National issued an excess policy for an additional $15 million in coverage that follows form with the ACE D <em>&amp; </em>0 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">NASDAQ carried Facebook\u2019s initial public offering \u00f3n May 18, 2012. It did not go smoothly\u2014NASDAQ\u2019s trading platform suffered a series of technical failures, resulting in the improper processing of orders to buy and sell stock. Retail investors in Facebook sued NASDAQ, alleging that they suffered losses as a result of NASDAQ\u2019s technical failures. In all, more than 40 lawsuits related to the Facebook IPO were brought against NASDAQ across the country, and were eventually consolidated in the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">After consolidation, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint (the \u201cCAC\u201d) against NASDAQ and two NASDAQ officers: Robert Greifeld, then-president and chief executive officer; and Anna Ewing, then-chief information officer (collectively, \u201cNASDAQ\u201d). The CAC, filed in April 2013, was brought on behalf of a putative class of all persons who entered orders to buy or sell Facebook\u2019s common stock on May 18, 2012 and lost money as a result of NASDAQ\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. The CAC asserted securities fraud claims pursuant to sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), as well as state law negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">NASDAQ provided notice of the CAC to each insurer. Chartis accepted potential coverage under its E <em>&amp; </em>O policy subject to a reservation of rights, as'did Beazley and ACE. However, both ACE and Illinois National disclaimed coverage under the D &amp; O policies, relying on the \u201cprofessional services\u201d exclusion in the ACE policy. Neither NASDAQ nor -its broker challenged the disclaimer. NASDAQ renewed the D <em>&amp; </em>O policy twice without ever raising the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">NASDAQ agreed to settle the CAC in April 2015 for $26.5 million, and sought coverage under its E &amp; O tower to pay for both the settlement and \u2018 NASDAQ\u2019s defense costs. Chartis paid'out its $15 million, and ACE paid out $4.9 million under its third-level E <em>&amp; </em>O policy. Because Char-tis and ACE were responsible for the cost of defending the lawsuits, the claim cost them more than the $26,5 million settlement figure. Beazley also paid out its full $15 million pursuant to= an agreement in which NASDAQ \u201cassign[ed] to Beazley any and all contractual rights or extra-contractual rights they have or that they may acquire ... .against ACE and/or Illinois National in connection with the [CAC] up-to the amount of [$15 million].\u201d App\u2019x at 4101. The agreement also provided that NASDAQ would not .take \u201cany formal position with regard to the availability of 'Coverage under the ACE D <em>&amp; </em>O Policy and/or the [Illinois National policy] for the claims asserted in the\u201d CAC, and that NASDAQ would \u201cnot voluntarily provide any testimony or declaration in connection with any proceeding between Beazley on the one hand and ACE and/or Illinois National on the other arising out of or related to the\u201d CAC. App\u2019x at 4128.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Beazley then attempted to get ACE to reconsider its denial of coverage, and when those efforts were unsuccessful, sued for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>coverage under the D <em>&amp; </em>0 policies in June 2015. In July 2015, Beazley moved for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that ACE had an obligation to provide a defense. The district court granted the motion, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">On balance, the Court is in agreement with Beazley that interpreting \u201ccustomer [s] or client[s]\u201d to exclude retail investors in a public company listed on NASDAQ is at least one reasonable interpretation of the ACE D &amp; 0 Policy. As a consequence, ACE has failed to satisfy its \u201cheavy burden of demonstrating that ... the [Professional Services] exclusion is subject to no other reasonable interpretation\u201d than the one it has proffered to disclaim coverage, and ACE was therefore obligated to provide NASDAQ with defense costs coverage in connection with NASDAQ\u2019s defense of the CAC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\n<em>Beazley Ins.

However, the district court cabined its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">To be clear, the Court is not interpreting \u201ccustomer[s] or clientfs]\u201d to exclude retail investors as a matter of law, as that is not the relevant question for purposes of plaintiffs motion. Defendants are free, with the benefit of discovery, to renew their arguments as to the meaning of \u201ccustomers or clients\u201d on summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\n<em>Id. </em>at n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Following discovery, in January 2016 Beazley moved for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that ACE had a duty to indemnify in connection with the CAC settlement. ACE and Illinois National cross-moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims. The district court denied Beazley\u2019s motion, granted ACE and Illinois National\u2019s motion and also found ACE liable for unreimbursed attorneys\u2019 fees and costs reasonably incurred by NASDAQ in excess of the policy\u2019s $2 million retention. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\u201cWe review orders granting summary judgment de novo.\u201d <em>Hizam v.

The parties are in agreement that New York law applies to their dispute. ACE based its disclaimer on the D &amp; O policy\u2019s professional services exclusion, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-12\">The Insurer shall not be liable for Loss on account of any Claim ... by or on behalf of a customer or client of the Company [i.e., NASDAQ], alleging, based upon, arising out of, or attributable to the rendering or failure to render professional services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">App\u2019x at 1628, 1653. The D &amp; O policy defines neither \u201ccustomer or client\u201d nor \u201cprofessional services.\u201d Beazley argues that the district court erred in enforcing the exclusion because (1) the retail investors who sued and settled the CAC are not customers or clients within the meaning of the D <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">&amp; </em>O policy, and (2) the claims settled in the CAC are not \u201calleging, based upon, arising out of, or attributable to the rendering or failure to render professional services.\u201d The burden of proving the exclusion applies rests with the insurer. <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">Pioneer Tower Owners Ass\u2019n v.

It appears most federal courts take the meaning of \u201ccustomer\u201d in this context \u201cas a given.\u201d <em>Hugo Boss, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087931\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/608/#p617\">252 F.3d at 619</extracted-citation>. .</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\">Be\u00e1zley argues that the district. court erred in turning to federal law to provide a definition for \u201ccustomer,\u201d primarily because (1) industry usage should be considered before federal case law; (2) the professional services exclusion was standard language, thus its terms cannot be defined in the context of a specific industry; and (3) other evidence in the record indicates that NASDAQ considered broker-dealers, not retail investors, to be NASDAQ\u2019s customers. We find these arguments unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">First, in this context, there is little distinction between looking to \u201cindustry .usage\u201d and federal case law to define a term. Federal case law is , simply another way of determining whether the parties shared a common language that would lead them to a mutual, unambiguous understanding, of the meaning of an undefined term. Second, the fact that the professional services exclusion is a standard clause does not alter the analysis here. The parties are not required to tailor language for every policy in order for terms to have industry-specific meanings. Who counts as a customer of a particular.insured within the meaning of the generic exclusion will often depend on the nature- of the industry in which the insured does business. What is relevant here is that-the insurer sold the policy to its insured, a stock exchange, against the backdrop of well-established federal securities law that unambiguously considers retail investors to be customers of the exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Third, a 2012 rule change NASDAQ submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot bear the weight Beaz-ley assigns it. There, NASDAQ sought to provide accommodation payments to members who could demonstrate losses stemming from the ill-fated Facebook IPO that the members, in turn, could use to pay-claims from retail investors. The rule change would make $62 million available to pay claims from retail investors, rather than the $600,000 then available to each member. In submitting the rule change, NASDAQ stated that \u201c[NASDAQ\u2019s] b\u00fasiness and legal relationships are with its members, not its members\u2019 customers. [NASDAQ] has no contractual or oth.er relationships with its members\u2019 customers, and generally does not possess information about interactions between a member and its customer that may underlie members\u2019 trading activity.\u201d App\u2019x at 2678.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Beazley argues this language, at a minimum, raises a question of material fact as to whether NASDAQ considered retail investors its customers. However, as the district court correctly concluded, the fact that retail investors are customers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>NASDAQ\u2019s member broker-dealers does not mean that retail investors were not also NASDAQ\u2019s customers. Broker-dealers are simply agents of the retail investors, performing \u201cthe narrow task of consummating the transaction requested.\u201d <em>Press v. Chem. Inv. Servs. Corp., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397093\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/529/#p536\">166 F.3d 529</extracted-citation>, 536 (2d Cir. 1999). Retail investors may be customers both of NASDAQ and of NASDAQ\u2019s members.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We agree with the district court that when considered against the background of the \u201cthe customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business,\u201d the term \u201ccustomers\u201d of NASDAQ unambiguously includes retail investors. <em>Morgan Stanley Grp.

We need not reach the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the import of extrinsic evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">II. Professional services</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">To successfully invoke the exclusion, ACE also must demonstrate that the claims arose out of the \u201crendering of or failure to render professional services.\u201d Under New York law, a court makes such a determination by examining whether the asserted claim could succeed but for the excluded conduct. <em>See Mount Vernon Fire Ins.

Again, as below, the parties do not dispute that the negligence claims.arose out of NASDAQ\u2019s alleged failure to properly render professional.services, such that the exclusion applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Beazley, however,. argues that the dis-' trict court erred in finding that the CAC\u2019s federal, securities claims were \u201calleging, based upon, arising out of, or attributable to the rendering or failure to render professional services.\u201d Beazley argues that the CAC allegations accusing NASDAQ of misstatements and omissions in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>federal securities law are advertisements for NASDAQ\u2019s services, and thus do not fall under the professional services exclusion. Beazley notes that the CAC pleads that \u201cNASDAQ and its executives ... undertook an aggressive marketing and commercial campaign to persuade Facebook to list its securities on the NASDAQ Stock Market.\u201d App\u2019x at 472 \u00b6 17. \u201cIn doing do, Defendants Greifeld and Ewing caused NASDAQ to promote the reliability and capability of its technology and electronic trading platform ... in the months leading up to the Facebook IPO.\u201d <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178787\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/616/\">Id.</extracted-citation> </em>Beazley argues that these representations were made with the intent of promoting NASDAQ as the best exchange for the Facebook IPO. As advertising, Beazley argues, the statements \u201care not actions that are based upon, arise out of, or that are attributable to the rendering of or failure to render professional services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Beazley relies on <em>Rob Levine &amp; Assocs.

In <em>Rob Levine, </em>the complaint alleged that the defendant law firm engaged in false advertising that gave \u201cthe false impression to future clients that [they] have special expertise in personal injury cases and disability cases and will recover more money than other Rhode Island lawyers.\u201d <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066074\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/994/228/\">Id. </extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066074\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/994/228/\">at 232</extracted-citation>.

Other courts also hold that advertising is not a professional service. <em>See, e.g., Standard Mut. Ins. Co. v.

The materialization of these risks occurred during the Class Period when NASDAQ\u2019s systems failed to: (i) properly execute Class Members\u2019 buy and sell pre-market Cross orders and aftermarket orders in Facebook\u2019s IPO; and (ii) failed to timely deliver confirmations of Class Members^] pre-market Cross orders, causing Class Members substantial damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiY7\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>App\u2019x at 123-24 \u00b6 238. The CAC thus attributes plaintiffs\u2019 losses to NASDAQ\u2019s failure to \u201cproperly execute\u201d the purchase and sale orders and deliver timely confirmations, not to NASDAQ\u2019s marketing of itself to Facebook as the best exchange to handle the IPO. Failures to properly execute orders and deliver timely order confirmations go to the heart of NASDAQ\u2019s provision of professional services. The district court correctly determined that the professional services exclusion applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We have considered the remainder of Beazley\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons given above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. As the Illinois National policy follows the ACE D &amp; 0 policy, we need not reach the alternate grounds for affir-mance proffered by Illinois National.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
