When Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) task force members executed a search warrant at the Tiganos\u2019 residence on the morning of the arrest, they discovered over 1,400 marijuana plants. On October 2, 2008, Tigano and his father were each indicted on six counts. Four of the counts charged drug offenses related to the alleged marijuana growing operation; the remaining two counts charged weapons offenses stemming from firearms found at the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">Nearly'five years later, on November 25, 2013, Tigano\u2019s father pled guilty to one count of manufacturing 50 or more marijuana plants. Tigano refused to accept a plea and proceeded to trial\u2014nearly seven years after his arrest\u2014on May 4, 2015. He was convicted by a jury on May 8, 2015 on five of the six counts in the indictment. Tigano was imprisoned during the entirety of the nearly seven years of pretrial proceedings. On appeal, Tigano argues that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated by an oppressive period of pretrial incarceration. On November 15, 2017, this Court filed an Order that reversed the judgment of the district court and dismissed with prejudice the underlying indictment. We remanded the case for the limited purpose of releasing Tigano from detention and indicated that an opinion would follow. Tigano was released pursuant to that Order on November 15,2017.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">Tigano\u2019s facts are exceptional in nearly every meaningful respect within the context of a Sixth Amendment speedy trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>analysis. Accordingly, we begin by detailing the circumstances that resulted in Ti-gano\u2019s nearly seven years of pretrial detention. We then offer some historical context for our analysis of this constitutional right in order to better situate Ti-gano\u2019s exceptional facts. Finally, we assess Tigano\u2019s delay under the legal framework provided by the Supreme Court in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">407 U.S. 514</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">33 L.Ed.2d 101</extracted-citation> (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The pretrial detention experienced by Joseph Tigano, III appears to be the longest ever experienced by a defendant in a speedy trial case in the Second Circuit. Tigano\u2019s experience is an extreme outlier even among the severe examples found within Sixth Amendment case law. Yet no single, extraordinary factor caused the cumulative seven years of pretrial delay. Instead, the outcome was the result of countless small choices and neglects, none of which was individually responsible for the injustice suffered by Tigano, but which together created this extreme instance of a Sixth Amendment violation. A review of the procedural history reveals that Tigano was the victim of poor trial management and general indifference at every level toward this low-priority defendant in a straightforward case.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">I.July 8, 2008\u2014April 8, 2009: Arrest, Arraignment, and Hunger Strike</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">On July 8, 2008, Joseph Tigano, III and his father were arrested. On October 20, 2008, Tigano was arraigned and entered a not guilty plea before Magistrate Judge Hugh Scott. At his arraignment, Tigano (through his then-attorney Thomas Farley) conveyed to the court that he would not accept a plea and wished to preserve his speedy trial rights. The next court meeting on this case was initially scheduled for March 19, 2009, but was rescheduled \u25a0 on motion of Tigano\u2019s father, who requested a delay. Tigano\u2019s attorney failed to ever convey this change in date to Tigano. When the date of the scheduled conference arrived and no one explained to Tigano why he was not being transported to court, Tigano stopped eating. He later explained to the court that the hunger strike was his response to being left in his jail cell \u00f3n a scheduled court date with no explanation from his attorney or the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">II. April 9, 2009\u2014August 11, 2009: First Competency Exam</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">On April 9, 2009, the parties convened for the delayed status conference. This status conference would result in the first of what would eventually be three court-ordered competency exams, each of which would confirm that Tigano was competent to stand trial. At this juncture in'Tigano\u2019s pretrial detention, Farley requested a competency evaluation, which was ordered by Magistrate Judge Scott. The transcript of the proceeding makes clear that the driving motivation for the decision to order a competency exam was Tigano\u2019s repeated demand for his speedy trial. Tigano\u2019s prioritization of a speedy trial appears to have been his primary point of disagreement with Farley and Magistrate Judge Scott explicitly cited Tigano\u2019s repeated insistence on a speedy trial as he ordered the competency evaluation. Indeed, Tigano raised his speedy trial rights no fewer than ten times in this single status conference. It was no mystery to any party that Tiga-no\u2019s top priority was moving quickly to trial. Instead, Magistrate Judge Scott ordered a competency exam and, as a result, the next two status conferences were 'postponed while the court awaited the results of the competency exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">III. August 12, 2009\u2014January 20, 2010: Unresolved Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">\u2022 The parties were finally able to convene for a status conference on August 12, 2009 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>after Tigano had returned from his competency evaluation. The exam determined that \u201che did not suffer from any \u2018major mental illness,\u2019 he had a \u2018good understanding of his current legal circumstances\u2019 and he was able to \u2018assist properly in his defense.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. Tigano asked the court for permission to proceed pro se, in large part because of conflicts with Farley regarding Tigano\u2019s desire to proceed straight to trial as quickly as possible. The court then engaged Tigano in an extended colloquy, and required the government to recite the possible sentence faced by Tiga-no if he were convicted. At this first hearing after the competency exam, Magistrate Judge Scott told Tigano that he was making a \u201chuge mistake\u201d and that his answers\u2014specifically, his pleas to represent himself so as to proceed quickly to trial\u2014 \u201care tending to make me believe he needs to be evaluated again.\u201d App\u2019x at 129. Magistrate Judge Scott declined to decide on the request to proceed pro se, appointed standby counsel to Tigano to explain the risks to him, and scheduled another status conference for two days later. The second status conference was largely a replay of the first: Tigano\u2019s standby counsel again confirmed that Tigano appeared to understand the charges, the government recited the charges Tigano was facing, and Magistrate Judge Scott expressed his skepticism and reserved decision. Nearly one month later, Magistrate Judge Scott granted Ti-gano\u2019s request to proceed pro se. There followed a series of short status conferences, one of which appears to have been scheduled only because Farley failed to appear as directed to hand over files to Tigano at the previous status conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">It is during this phase of the proceedings that Tigano\u2019s statements in court became increasingly desperate and plaintive as he pleaded for the case to move toward resolution. He .continued to repeatedly raise his right to a speedy trial and to plead for severance from his father. As Tigano explained to the court, \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is he\u2019s a free man. I\u2019m incarcerated. I\u2019m in jail. And my father and his lawyer can actually keep putting motions in to delay, this further. I\u2019d like to severance. ..\u201d App\u2019x at 142. Tigano\u2019s father repeatedly moved to delay proceedings. Even so, the court told Tigano that his father had \u201ccaused no delay in your case whatsoever.\u201d' App\u2019x at 142,</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">IV. January 21, 2010\u2014May 16, 2010: Second Competency Exam</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">When oral argument was eventually held on January 21, 2010, Tigano appeared with his standby counsel, Cheryl Meyers Buth, who would remain his attorney\u2014either stand-by or appointed\u2014for most of the remaining five-plus years of pretrial detention. The scheduled trial date was postponed at the requests of both the father\u2019s attorney and the Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d), both of whom had other cases on their calendars. When Tiga-no\u2019s attorney addressed the court in this hearing, she first reiterated Tigano\u2019s desire for severance and a,speedy trial. She next advised the court that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">despite the fact that there\u2019s been a forensic exam finding that Mr. Tigano is competent to proceed, I h\u00e1ve serious reservations about his ability to understand the charges and the procedures\u25a0 and represent himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">App\u2019x at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">This advisement from Tigano\u2019s attorney prompted Magistrate Judge Scott to order the second competency exam of Tigano and led Tigano to ask, \u201cAnother one, sir?\u201d App\u2019x at 229. To be clear, there was no allegation that the .first competency exam was defective in any way, nor was there any allegation that there had been a change in Tigano^s behavior. Instead, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>this second exam and the first exam 281 days earlier appear to have been prompted largely by Tigano\u2019s repeated invocation of his speedy trial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">At a hearing on March 31, 2010\u2014which Tigano did not attend because he had still not returned from his competency evaluation\u2014the AUSA prosecuting the case acknowledged that Tigano\u2019s desire for a speedy trial was part of the rationale for the second competency exam, remarking that \u201cMr. Tigano III had been sort of demanding his speedy trial, which is part of the prompting for the Court sending him out for this evaluation.\u201d App\u2019x at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The report for the second competency exam was received by the court on April 14, 2010\u201483 days after the hearing at which it was ordered\u2014and acknowledged by Magistrate Judge Scott at an April 16, 2010 suppression hearing. Again, the report indicated that Tigano was competent to stand trial. Again, a hearing was delayed at the request of counsel, this time at the requests of counsel for both Tigano and Tigano\u2019s father. Again, Magistrate Judge Scott asked the government to submit an order excluding time under the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">V. May 17, 2010\u2014April 4, 2012: Confusion Regarding Multiple Magistrate Judges, Repeated Extensions of Time by Tigano\u2019s Father Joined by Tigano\u2019s Attorney, and Court Reporter Delays</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Over the course of the next nearly two years, Tigano experienced multiple delays stemming primarily from confusion among judges regarding overlapping motions and an erroneous referral order from Judge Skretny. Most significantly, two separate magistrate judges held in abeyance two separate sets of evidentiary motions until Judge Skretny decided appeals regarding portions of the suppression motion initially decided by Magistrate Judge Scott. That decision was finally issued by Judge Skret-ny on January 19, 2011 as a three-sentence text order nearly six months after the motions were originally decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Additional delays during this period resulted from a variety of small neglects. The long-postponed hearing before Magistrate Judge McCarthy was delayed for an additional 40 days because the government failed to produce discovery in a timely manner. The court reporter submitted the transcript of the one-day suppression hearing 117 days after it was held, delaying the progress of the case by nearly four months. Magistrate Judge Scott issued his report and recommendation on December 15, 2011, nearly seven months after the hearing and more than a year and a half after Tigano had filed his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">VI. April 5, 2012\u2014January 9, 2014: Plea Negotiations, Crowded Court Docket, Father\u2019s Competency Issues, and Adjournments by Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">On April 5, 2012, Judge Skretny accepted the reports and recommendations issued by the magistrate judges and advised attorneys that they should submit motions to sever. Tigano\u2019s attorney entered no such motion and instead joined the father\u2019s request for an adjournment to delay the scheduled status conference. At this point, Tigano entered a new phase of delay caused largely by unsuccessful plea negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Between the July 10, 2012 status conference\u2014at which Tigano\u2019s attorney and the government informed the court that they were involved in plea negotiations \u2014and the father\u2019s entry of a plea on November 25, 2013, the court held six status conferences that were each adjourned for one reason or another, each of which reported that Tigano was involved in plea negotia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tions with the government. A large part of the reason for this period of delay was that the government waited nearly a year to present Tigano a written plea offer. The transcript from the May 28, 2013 status conference indicates that AUSA Thomas S. Duszkiewicz was involved in a major criminal trial and Tigano\u2019s case had taken a definitive back seat within the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office. Indeed, an AUSA stepped in for Duszkiewicz at the May 28, 2013 status conference, and conceded when questioned about the delay, \u201c[t]his is definitely not the defense\u2019s issue,\u201d citing Duszkiewicz\u2019s lengthy trial and gaps in information within the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office as reasons for the delay in the presentation of a written plea. App\u2019x at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">When Tigano\u2019s attorney finally received the written offer, it was sent to her the day before a scheduled status conference, which resulted in yet another adjournment because she had not yet had an opportunity to present the plea to Tigano. At this status conference, as with several prior conferences, AUSA Duszkiewicz reiterated his view that the plea agreement was a \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d offer, meaning both defendants had to plead for either of them to receive the deal. App\u2019x at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The August 1, 2013 status conference resulted in yet another adjournment, in part so that Tigano\u2019s attorney could try to convince him to accept the plea he consistently rejected and \u201cin part ... because of [the court\u2019s] trial calendar right now.\u201d App\u2019x at 680. When it came time to set trial dates at the September 20, 2013 conference both the government and the court raised scheduling challenges due to congested calendars. On December 16, 2013, the parties met for the final pretrial conference before the trial scheduled for the following day. Yet again, the court delayed the trial, in part to give Tigano time to consider a plea, observing \u201cYou spent some time in jail. I don\u2019t think waiting until January is going to really materially affect anything.\u201d App\u2019x at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">VII. January 10, 2014\u2014September 2, 2014: Third Competency Exam</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">On January 10, 2014, Tigano\u2019s attorney filed under seal a motion for another competency evaluation of Tigano. This sealed motion included an affidavit from Meyers Buth attesting to her belief that \u201cin refusing to plead guilty and insisting on his right to a trial, Tigano was acting \u2018imprudent[ly]\u2019 and \u2018not in his best interest.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 26 (quoting affidavit). Meyers Buth also attached a letter from a private psychologist she retained to evaluate Tigano who also concluded that Tigano was competent to stand trial and explicitly concurred with the two previous competency evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">On January 15, 2014, the parties reconvened for a status conference that would result in Tigano\u2019s third court-ordered competency exam. The government supported Meyers Buth\u2019s motion at the status conference. The AUSA indicated that he had been prepared at the last status conference \u201cto suggest that we obviate the need for a hearing and that we send Mr. Tigano out for another examination.\u201d App\u2019x at 766. AUSA Duszkiewicz\u2019s rationale for the need for a third court-ordered competency exam was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">not necessarily the competency question, but whether there is some other psychological problem that\u2019s going to prevent him from understanding the difference between what he potentially looks at as far as a conviction as well as what\u2019s being offered by way of this plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">App\u2019x at 767. In other words, the basis for the competency exam was Tigano\u2019s refusal to accept a plea. Judge Skretny referred the matter back to Magistrate Judge Scott <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>while opining that \u201cwhatever time it takes, it takes.\u201d App\u2019x at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">As of the March 4,2014 scheduled status conference\u201448 days after Judge Skretny referred the matter to Magistrate Judge Scott\u2014the U.S. Marshals Service (\u201cUSMS\u201d) still had not transported Tigano to his competency evaluation. Magistrate Judge Scott approved a 16-day extension for the competency exam at the request of the warden of the Metropolitan Correction Center (\u201cMCC\u201d) in New York City, where Tigano was undergoing the evaluation. The warden reported that the MCC was experiencing a \u201chigh volume of cases\u201d and would not be able to complete the evaluation in time. App\u2019x at 776, 778. The competency evaluation was filed under seal on April 15, 2014. Tigano was briefly under medical hold for some medical issues that arose at MCC, but was released from medical hold on May 2,2014. The USMS seems to have lost track of Tigano while he was at MCC,&gt; such that two pretrial conferences were held without any movement on the case- and another was adjourned because Tigano was absent and the date of his-return remained uncertain. On July 30, 2014, Tigano finally appeared with Meyers Buth before Magistrate Judge Scott, who accepted the competency determination of this third .court-ordered psychological exam. The.third competency evaluation established nothing new.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">During this period of limbo' for Tigano at MCC,- he filed a pro se motion- styled as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. That motion was received by the court of the Western District of New York on May 12, 2014 and denied by Judge Skretny 15 weeks later, because Judge Skretny- refused to consider a pro se motion filed by a represented defendant. The Niagara County jail destroyed all of Tigano\u2019s trial-related papers while he was away at MCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">VIII. September 3, 2014\u2014May 3, 2015: Scheduling Delays for Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">On September 3, 2014, the parties convened for a pretrial conference and prepared to go to trial with Tigano representing himself and Meyers Buth appearing as standby counsel, given her discomfort with Tigano\u2019s preferred trial strategy. At the October 23, 2014 status conference, it was determined that Meyers Buth would indeed represent Tigano at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">In anticipation of his March 8, 2015 retirement, Judge Skretny reassigned Tiga-no\u2019s case to Judge Elizabeth Wolford on January 27, 2015. Tigano filed a motion for bail on February 25, 2015, which was denied without prejudice on March 5, 2015. Tigano\u2019s jury trial began on May 4, 2\u00d315, 6 years, 9 months, and 26 days after his arrest. On May 8, 2015, he was convicted on five drug-related charges and one weapons charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">I. History of the Speedy Trial Right</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Recognition of the critical need for criminal defendants to proceed to trial in a timely manner has a long\u2019 and auspicious history in American law and English common law. The Supreme Court detailed much of this history in its 1967 speedy trial case, <em>Klopfer v. North Carolina, </em>which held that the right-applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170322\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/213/#p222\">386 U.S. 213</extracted-citation>, 222-23, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170322\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/213/#p222\">87 S.Ct. 988</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170322\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/213/#p222\">18 L.Ed.2d 1</extracted-citation>. The <em>Klopfer </em>Court cited a twelfth-century case from the Assize of Clarendon instructing sheriffs to bring defendants to the traveling justices when the judges \u201care not about to come speedily enough into the country where they have been taken\u201d in order to ensure a prompt trial for the criminal defendants. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170322\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/213/#p222\">Id. </extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170322\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/213/#p222\">at 223, n.9</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170322\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/213/#p222\">87 S.Ct. 988</extracted-citation> (quoting 2 <em>English </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>\n<em>Historical Documents </em>408 (David C.

In 1776, both Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights and Virginia\u2019s Bill of Rights included a right to \u201ca speedy trial by an impartial jury.\u201d Francis H. Heller, <em>The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States: A Study in Constitutional Development </em>22-23 (1969). Delaware, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania also included the clause in their original state constitutions.

Barker, the defendant-appellant before the Supreme Co.urt, was imprisoned for ten months before being released on bond while awaiting trial. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">Id. </extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">at 517</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>. The Supreme Court observed that Barker appeared to , be \u201cgambling\u201d on the acquittal of his co-defendant, hoping that an acquittal for the co-defendant would make it harder to prosecute him. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">Id. </extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">at 535-36</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>.

Specifically, the- Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>preme Court identified four key factors: \u201c[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">Id. </extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">at 530</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>. In establishing this balancing test, the <em>Barker </em>Court emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4p\">We regard none of the four factors identified above as either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial. Rather, they are related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant. In sum, these factors have no talismanic qualities; courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process. But, because we are dealing with a fundamental right of the accused, this process must be carried out with full recognition that the accused\u2019s interest in a speedy trial is specifically affirmed in the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">\n<em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">Id. </extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">at 533</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Consequently, we turn now to an analysis of these four factors with an understanding that no single factor is dispositive and that each serves to guarantee a fundamental, enumerated right of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">A. Length of Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">\u201cThe length of the delay is to some extent a triggering mechanism,\u201d because until' there exists \u201csome delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance.\u201d <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">Id. </extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">at 530</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>.

Indeed, the government concedes that the length of delay cuts in favor of Tigano. This Court recently affirmed a district court dismissal\u2014also originating in the Western District of New York\u2014on Sixth Amendment speedy trial grounds. <em>United States v. Pennick, </em>No. 16-3069-cr, \u2014 Fed. Appx. -, <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204994465\">2017 WL 4994465</extracted-citation> (2d Cir.

The defendant in <em>Pennick </em>had been subjected to \u201cfifty-four months in pretrial detention and twenty-five months on electronically-monitored home incarceration,\u201d which we deemed \u201cextraordinary.\u201d <em><extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204994465\">Id.</extracted-citation> </em>at- -, <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204994465\">2017 WL 4994465</extracted-citation>, at *l-*2. Tigano\u2019s extreme facts thus force the government to account for its delay and \u201cprove that the delay was justified and that [Tigano\u2019s] speedy trial rights were not violated.\u201d <em>Buffalo Amusement, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1453267\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/600/368/#p377\">600 F.2d at 377</extracted-citation>. The extreme length of delay thus weighs heavily against the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">B. Reasons for Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">The <em>Barker </em>Court instructed that \u201cdifferent weights should be assigned to different reasons.\u201d <em>Barker, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">407 U.S. at 531</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>. <em>Barker </em>established a spectrum of weights, in which \u201cdeliberate\u201d attempts to delay trial weighed most heavily against the government, \u201cvalid\u201d reasons for delay such as missing witnesses are taken off the scale entirely, and reasons of \u201cnegligence or overcrowded dockets\u201d are weighted somewhere in the middle, because \u201cthe ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the government rather than with the defendant.\u201d <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">Id.</extracted-citation> </em>This factor must take into account the affirmative duty of the district court and the government to monitor the progress of a criminal case toward disposition and to take steps to avoid unnecessary delay where possible. \u201cWe have repeatedly emphasized that affirmative action by the government in bringing cases to trial is mandated and that it cannot escape this duty on the ground that the delay is for institutional reasons.\u201d <em>United States v. Vispi, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1014818\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/545/328/#p334\">545 F.2d 328</extracted-citation>, 334 (2d Cir. 1976) (citation omitted). Incredibly, the government contends that \u201cnone of the delay is attributable to the government.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appel-lee\u2019s Br. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The reasons for the delay in this case were largely due to: 1) the needlessly repetitive and dilatory competency examinations, all of which found Tigano competent; 2) administrative delays, including the delay in conducting the third court-ordered competency hearing (itself unnecessary in light of the two prior court-ordered exams and hearings) because the USMS failed to provide timely transportation; 3) the government\u2019s failure for months to produce a written plea offer, despite the age of the case, and its insistence on consolidating the case and plea bargaining with Tigano\u2019s father; 4) the district court\u2019s congested docket and failure to give this case priority; 5) the use of multiple magistrate judges resulting in confusion regarding responsibility and one judge having to await rulings by another; and 6) defense counsel\u2019s desire to delay the trial in hopes of a favorable plea, notwithstanding Tigano\u2019s express desire to proceed quickly to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">1. Competency Evaluations</p>\n<p id=\"AsC\">We first turn to the most complex set of facts for the delay, namely, the three separate competency exams ordered by the magistrate judge. Each of these exams\u2014 and an additional exam conducted by a private psychologist retained by Tigano\u2019s attorney\u2014concluded that Tigano was fully competent to stand trial. There is no evidence in the record\u2014either in open court or in documents filed under seal\u2014that any party or officer of the court had any concerns about the quality or legitimacy of any one of these exams, And while the exams suggest that Tigano may have an eccentric personality, they each clearly state that he understood the charges against him and was capable of aiding in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Indeed, the examinations are strikingly consistent with one another in their assessment that Tigano clearly understood what was happening and was capable of assisting in his own defense. Yet all parties involved\u2014the court, the government, and Tigano\u2019s own attorney\u2014participated in steering him through three court-ordered exams. The details of each of those decisions have already been recounted, but it is worth reiterating the truly remarkable fact that for both the second and third court-ordered exams, the government acknowledged in open court that at least part of the motivation for the exam was Tiga-no\u2019s assertion of his speedy trial right and his refusal to accept a plea, respectively. No party argued that there was new information or a change in circumstances to justify yet another exam and attendant delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Motions for mental competency determinations are made pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4241(a), which permits defense or government attorneys to move for a hearing on competency which \u201c[t]he court shall grant ... if there is reasonable cause to believe that \"the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental' disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\u201d Court-ordered psychological exams for the purposes of determining competency prior to the hearing are permitted under 18 U.S.C. 4241(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">It was error for the district court to send Tigano out for evaluation by a third court-appointed psychologist simply because he refused to accept \u00e1 plea, when that was the only evidence of \u201cincompetency\u201d before the district court. and three separate, psychologists (two who were court-ordered and one who was privately retained) had already attested to his -competency to stand, trial and assist in his own defense,. as acknowledged by the magistrate judge who issued the order. We thus count these delays against the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">2. Administrative Delays</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Tigano\u2019s trial date was also delayed by the USMS and the court reporters in the Western District of New York. Tiga-no\u2019s third, court-ordered competency evaluation resulted in a seven-month delay (January 2014-July 2014)\u2014double the combined, length of the first two court-ordered competency evaluations. This delay appears to have been due to the USMS\u2019s failure to provide timely transportation to and from the site of the examination. Both the court and the government should- have monitored the situation and prevented the delay. <em>See United States v. Carini, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"885934\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/562/144/#p149\">562 F.2d 144</extracted-citation>, 149-50 (2d Cir. 1977) (\u201cWhile it is .... true that \u2018institutional\u2019 delays are not counted as heavily against the government as are delays caused or encouraged by the prosecution for tactical reasons,\u201d delays \u201coccasioned by ... unexplained inaction of the District Court, caused, no doubt, by an .overloaded docket ... are properly chargeable against the government under prevailing case law.\u201d) (collecting cases).' Specifically, when the court granted the request for the third competency evaluation, it should have issued a time limit and instructed the parties to be ready for trial when Tigano was found competent yet again.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Tigano\u2019s trial was also delayed by the - court reporters of1 the Western District of New York. At one point, both defendants were forced to wait 117 days for a transcript of a one-day suppression motion because they were ordered to file their submissions within 30 days of receiving that transcript. At many points along the way, transcripts arrived only after long delays.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Administrative delays are counted against the government, since it is not the defendant\u2019s responsibility to monitor the speed at which court reporters produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>transcripts or at which USMS provides court-ordered transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">3. Plea Negotiations</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Initial plea negotiations consumed approximately one year, which we have held is time that must be counted against the government. <em>See, e.g., Buffalo Amusement, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1453267\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/600/368/#p377\">600 F.2d at 378</extracted-citation> (\u201cGood faith plea negotiations by a defendant should not be equated to a waiver of speedy trial rights, and, under the circumstances, the government must assume responsibility for the risk of institutional delays where the bargain ultimately is unsuccessful.\u201d). It is particularly appropriate to construe the time against the government in this case because it took the government nearly a year to actually present a written plea offer tp Tigano. When it finally presented the plea offer, it did so on the night before.the scheduled conference, forcing Meyers Buth to request a 30-day continuance because she had not had any opportunity to review the plea offer with Tigano.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">We additionally observe that the district court should have set a firm cutoff date for plea negotiations rather than allow them to drag on for one-and-a-half years. Indeed, about ten months into the plea negotiations\u2014and we qualify the word \u201cnegotiations\u201d because Tigano had made clear from the time of his arraignment that he had no interest in a plea\u2014the government informed the court that it had yet to present a written offer to Tigano. At that point, the district court should have ordered the government to present its plea offer within a reasonable number of days, and scheduled a trial after a brief period for negotiations. Moreover, some of the delay was caused by the government\u2019s insistence on joint negotiations with Tigano\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">We have held that the time spent in plea bargaining is a gamble taken by the government regarding the defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights and is properly counted against the government. <em>See Buffalo Amusement, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1453267\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/600/368/#p377\">600 F.2d at 378</extracted-citation>. The government obliquely asserts that the process of plea bargaining counts against Tigano, but this is incorrect. The substantial delay caused by the government\u2019s failure to timely produce a written plea offer, its obstinacy in insisting on a joint resolution, and the court\u2019s failure to monitor the endless delays occasioned by the \u201cnegotiations\u201d are all attributed to the government. .</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">4, District Court Congestion</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">Delays due to \u201covercrowded courts,\u201d are counted against the government. <em>Barker, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">407 U.S. at 531</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>. It is dear that court congestion\u2014and a failure of the court to prioritize this long-lingering criminal case\u2014contributed to the substantial delay faced by Tigano. For example, even though its calendar was- congested, the court could have set a trial date when Tigano\u2019s attorney informed the court that plea negotiations had failed and that she was ready to proceed to trial on Qctober 23, 2014, over six months before the trial ultimately commenced. Considering that this was a 2008 criminal case and that Tigano was incarcerated throughout the entire pretrial period, the.court should have given priority to this case. Additional delays were caused by fhe court\u2019s crowded docket, for example, at the August 1, 2013 and September -20, 2013 status conferences, when the court conceded that adjournments were being granted in part to accommodate the court\u2019s congested calendar. At the time of those status conferences, Tigano had already been detained for .over five years. It is difficult to imagine a case that, would have, warranted scheduling priority over Tigano, yet time and again this low-priority case took a backseat to competing demands. Again, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>that this time must be counted against the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">5. District Court Use of Magistrate Judges</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">On May 17, 2010, the magistrate judge who had been handling all of the nearly two years of pretrial activity properly recused himself from the suppression motion, because he had been the issuing magistrate of the search warrant. Rather than deciding the suppression motion itself and sending it back to the same magistrate, however, the district court split the motions and sent them to two separate magistrates, despite the fact that they involved the same set of facts. The motions were further delayed because of confusion among the magistrates about who had authority over which issues, so that the magistrates sat on them respective motions until the discovery appeal was determined by the district court. In the end, Tigano spent two years in jail while this confusion was sorted out.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">There is no evidence the government was deliberately dilatory in its handling of these motions. Instead, the delay seems attributable to a series of misunderstandings and delays, as well as some poor decisions by the district court regarding court efficiency. However, <em>Barker </em>makes clear that \u201cneutral\u201d delays must be considered \u201csince the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than with the defendant.\u201d <em>Barker, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">407 U.S. at 531</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">6. Dilatory Tactics of Defense Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Despite Tigano\u2019s repeated demands for a speedy trial, his attorney requested multiple extensions and failed to urge the district court to set a trial date. It seems likely that she wanted Tigano to plead to the reduced charge and was repeatedly frustrated by Tigano\u2019s continued refusal to consider a plea and insistence on going to trial. Indeed, Tigano\u2019s attorney requested several delays for the purpose of trying to convince Tigano to accept a plea, requested or caused other delays because of her discomfort with Tigano\u2019s trial strategy, and generally aceeded to the requests for delays by Tigano\u2019s father, rather than asserting Tigano\u2019s right to a speedy trial or his desire for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Though her intentions may have been admirable, it is a bedrock rule of professional conduct that the decision to accept or reject a plea is ultimately a decision made by the client. <em>See, e.g., </em>American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct R. 1.2(a). It is also fundamental that an attorney may not coerce a client into accepting-a plea. <em>Purdy v. U.S., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11449825\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/208/41/#p45\">208 F.3d 41</extracted-citation>, 45 (2d Cir. 2000). This Court has explicitly instructed lower courts that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">[T]he defendant and not the court should decide what strategy should be pursued to-adequately protect the defendant\u2019s interest. To take this choice out of his hands would deprive him of the right to conduct his defense in his manner and in accordance with his own standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApU\">\n<em>U.S. v.

In the same vein, we have previously held that, \u201c[i]t is the role of the lawyer to be a professional advisor and advocate, not to usurp his client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of representation.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Wellington, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939216\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/284/#p289\">417 F.3d 284</extracted-citation>, 289 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal citations and punctuation omitted). It would be improper to count these delays against the objecting defendant, and we' decline to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">It will be an exceptional case where, as here, a delay caused by a defense attorney counts against the government, under the <em>Barker </em>analysis, and not the defense. Unless the record shows otherwise, we normally presume that a defense attorney is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>carrying out his or her client\u2019s chosen trial strategy and that any delays resulting from that strategy count against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">C. Defendant\u2019s Assertion of the Right</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We also must consider the defendant\u2019s own assertion of his right to a speedy trial. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s assertion of his speedy trial right ... is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the. right.\u201d <em>Barker, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">407 U.S. at 531-32</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>. On this factor, Tigano\u2019s case again presents exceptional facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Tigano adamantly, consistently, and explicitly raised his speedy trial rights at nearly every appearance he made before the court. At his October 20, 2008 arraignment, Tigano\u2019s attorney at the time told the district court, \u201cHe also had indicated to me that he does not wish to waive his speedy trial rights.\u201d App\u2019x at 56. At his next appearance on April 9, 2009, when the district court asked Tigano about a delay for a competency evaluation in the wake of his hunger strike, Tigano explained to the district court, \u201cSir, I mentioned it the last time I was in court, I don\u2019t want to waive my right to a speedy trial. And that\u2014 that\u2019s my main concern.\u201d App\u2019x at 68. During this same hearing, the district court instructed Tigano\u2019s attorney that there was no need to add a written statement to the record regarding Tigano\u2019s desire for a speedy trial because \u201che\u2019s already stated that on the record, and he thinks it\u2019s necessary to do it by writing. It\u2019s on the record, leave it there.\u201d \u00c1pp\u2019x at 79. This pattern continued nearly every time Tiga-no appeared before the district court, to the extent that the government observed at a March 31, 2010 hearing that the repeated speedy trial demands were part of the reason for the district court\u2019s decision to have Tigano\u2019s competency evaluated. App\u2019x at 241 (\u201cMr. Tigano III had been sort of demanding his speedy trial, which is part of the prompting for the Court sending him out for this evaluation.\u201d). Incredibly, the government now argues that Tigano made no formal assertion of his speedy trial right for purposes of the Sixth Amendment analysis. We dismiss that argument as implausible based on the facts and inapposite based on the law; a defendant may waive his statutory right to a speedy trial by failing to formally raise it, but not his constitutional right. <em>Barker, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">407 U.S. at 529-30</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation> <em>(\u201cWe, </em>therefore, reject ... the demand-waiver rule because it is insensitive to a right which we have deemed fundamental. The approach we accept is a balancing test, in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Tigano requested his speedy trial so frequently and vociferously that it is simply inconceivable the government was not \u201cput on notice\u201d that this issue would resurface if Tigano\u2019s speedy trial rights were not protected. <em>Buffalo Amusement, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1453267\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/600/368/#p377\">600 F.2d at 378</extracted-citation>. Having offered this analysis, we do not mean to suggest that the words \u201cspeedy trial\u201d ought to function as a magical incantation, that guarantee an immediate trial to any defendant who so wishes. We acknowledge, that there are many legitimate reasons why trials may be delayed. Nor do we expect every defendant to raise the issue as frequently as Tigano in order to preserve his right to a speedy trial. On this point we reiterate that the right to a speedy trial is a right explicitly enumerated in the Sixth Amendment. A defendant\u2019s lack of vigor in pursuing this right\u2014or his deliberately dilatory behavior in forestalling trial\u2014are factors to be considered in our analysis, but a defendant\u2019s failure to formally raise the right via motion does not necessarily count against the defendant, as the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>argues, it should. The speedy trial right is guaranteed to all. defendants by the Sixth Amendment and its precise contours are determined by courts on an \u201cad hoc basis\u201d considering the , facts of each case, including the defendant\u2019s invocation of that right. <em>Barker, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">407 U.S. at 530</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>. Formal procedural requirements are out of place in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">We .also observe that this case raises a new wrinkle to the fact patterns of the speedy trial cases in our Circuit. While Tigano himself made very- clear that he desired a speedy trial, this desire was not always echoed by or reflected in the choices made by his attorney. These facts are unusual in this area of law and distinguish this case from others within this Circuit\u2019s speedy trial jurisprudence. Accordingly, we conclude that in the context of a speedy trial action such as this one, a defendant\u2019s assertion of his own right to a speedy trial\u2014even though ignored or contravened by his counsel\u2014is the relevant fact for purposes of Sixth Amendment analysis. Quite simply, the right to a speedy trial belongs to the defendant, not to defendant\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">D. Prejudice to the Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"ad9-dedup-0\">The last <em>Barker </em>factor to' examine is the prejudice to the defendant occasioned by the delay. Prejudice should be assessed\" in regard to those interests the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is designed to\u2018protect; namely, \u201c(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\u201d <em>Barker, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">407 U.S. at 532</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>. While the last factor is \u201cthe most serious,\u201d it is only one of three interests protected by the Sixth Amendment right to speedy trial. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">Id.</extracted-citation> </em>Affirmative proof of impairment of the defense is not required in order to find a Sixth Amendment violation. <em>See, e.g., Doggett v. U.S., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p655\">505 U.S. 647</extracted-citation>, 655, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p655\">112 S.Ct. 2686</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p655\">120 L.Ed.2d 520</extracted-citation> (1992) (\u201caffirmative proof of particularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trial claim\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Tigano was severely prejudiced in terms of the first two factors. His nearly seven years of pretrial incarceration were egregiously oppressive; we reiterate that this appears to be the longest period of pretrial incarceration we have seen in a speedy trial context in this Circuit. In addition to the sheer passage of time, his confinement in local jails makes those years particularly oppressive. The <em>Barker </em>Court noted that \u201c[m]ost jails offer little or no recreational or -rehabilitative programs. The time spent in jail is simply dead time.\u201d <em>Barker, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">407 U.S. at 532-33</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>. Nearly seven years of pretrial detention in local jails\u2014before the defendant has been convicted of any crime\u2014is precisely the type of prejudice contemplated by the right to a speedy trial. .Tigano amply.demonstrates prejudice on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">The second interest protected by the Sixth Amendment right-to a speedy trial is the interest in minimizing the \u201canxiety and concern\u201d of the accused. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">Id.,</extracted-citation> </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">407 U.S. at 532</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">92 S.Ct. 2182</extracted-citation>. On this point, Tigano was severely prejudiced. Tigano repeatedly expressed his anxiety to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>court and explicitly cited that anxiety as the primary motivation for his desire for a speedy trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj4\">Basically time is going by, and more time goes on I\u2019m just\u2014-how would you say, just moving on in the past. Longer this takes, harder it is to remember everything that\u2019s happens, [sic] The sooner it happens, the better.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYa\">App\u2019x at 127-28.</p>\n<p id=\"aek-dedup-1\">Tigano told the district .court he wanted to proceed pro se because \u201c[i]t will just resolve this matter, sir.\u201d App\u2019x at 150. He later expressed his anxieties by explaining</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ap1-dedup-0\">[t]hat\u2019s why I was trying to go with the speedy trial thing, knowing that, if anything, my dad, if he can\u2019t stick around here, maybe he\u2019d stay with my mother, in, you know, the other part of New York, eastern New York. Otherwise, I\u2019m hoping to push things ahead. This way however\u2014whatever gets determined, I\u2019m more, how would you say, everything has been taken away from'me. So to me, whatever you guys want me to have, or do, I\u2019m trying to bring right to the front, and go with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAj\">App\u2019x at 213. Tigano made clear that he preferred to have the matter decided rather than living with the anxiety and uncertainty of charges hanging over,his head. Nearly seven years of delay in'a trial the AUSA described as \u201cvery simple,\u201d App\u2019x at 829, imposes an inexcusable amount of anxiety on the unconvicted defendant: This anxiety is the type of prejudice the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">E. Balancing Test</p>\n<p id=\"AOA\">Weighing the four <em>Barker </em>factors leads us to the inescapable conclusion that Tiga-no\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated by his nearly seven years of pretrial incarceration. The reasons for delay fall largely on the district court and government attorneys. Tigano s repeated assertions of his right to a speedy trial place him on the extreme end of our Circuit\u2019s case law. His repeated pleas for trial also speak to the fourth and final prong, the prejudice suffered by Tigano in the form of anxiety and the oppressiveness of his lengthy period of pretrial incarceration. The only remedy is to'dismiss the ease with prejudice, <em>Strunk v. U.S., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173133\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/434/#p440\">412 U.S. 434</extracted-citation>, 440, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173133\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/434/#p440\">93 S.Ct. 2260</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173133\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/434/#p440\">37 L.Ed.2d 56</extracted-citation> (1973), which we did via court order on November 15, 2017.</p>\n<p id=\"asr-dedup-0\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AJK\">We reiterate that the nearly seven years of pretrial detention \u215b this case, as well as Tigano\u2019s single-minded focus on obtaining a speedy trial, present extreme facts in the speedy trial context. In other words, these facts represent what we expect will be a ceiling, rather than a floor, for Sixth Amendment analysis. Yet the case is no less significant because of its outlier status. Years of subtle neglects resulted in a flagrant violation of Tigano\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. On January 21, 2010, the slow progression of the case left Tigano to reflect that ,\u201c[s]o much time has gone by.\u201d App\u2019x at 225. He would wait another 1,929 days\u2014over 5 years\u2014before his case would eventually proceed to trial. Tigano\u2019s years of imprisonment represent a failure of our courts to'comply with their obligation to bring defendants to \u201ca speedy and public trial.\u201d U.S. Const.' amend. VI.</p>\n<p id=\"A_\">Because we find that Tigano\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated, we need not consider Tigano\u2019s remaining claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the indictment is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-5\">.
