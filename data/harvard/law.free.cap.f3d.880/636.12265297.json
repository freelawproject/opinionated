At trial, the parties disputed (among other issues) whether Knight qualified as an employee for purposes of Title VII, and the jury was presented with conflicting evidence on that issue. At the close of evidence, Knight moved for;judgment as a matter of law that he was Stony Brook\u2019s employee. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Joanna Seybert, <em>Judge) </em>denied Knight\u2019s motion and submitted the issue to the jury, which found that Knight was not an employee. On appeal, Knight argues that: (1) the district court should not have submitted the- question of whether he was an employee to the jury; (2) the district court misinstructed the jury on how to determine whether he was an employee; (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that he was not an employee; and (4) the district court made several other errors unrelated to the question of Whether Knight was an employee. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">At all relevant times, Knight, who is African American, was an electrician and a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 25 (\u201cthe Union\u201d). The Union had an arrangement with Stony Brook under which it referred union electricians to Stony Brook when additional workers were needed to supplement its workforce during large construction projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Pursuant to this arrangement, the Union referred Knight to Stony Brook, and in April 2011, he began working on a construction project for a psychiatric emergency facility. Sometime that- summer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>fall,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Knight discovered racist graffiti in the bathroom he used at work every morning. He reported the graffiti to the project\u2019s' foreman, Thomas Murphy, who was also a member of the Union, and to the shop steward, James Malley.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His work was terminated sometime thereafter,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Knight had worked on the project for approximately six months. Knight then initiated this action against Stony Brook, claiming that he had - been- discriminated against on the basis of his race and retaliated against for reporting the graffiti in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Stony Brook moved to dismiss both claims for failure to state a claim. The district court granted, the motion without prejudice, and Knight submitted a first amended complaint. Stony Brook again moved to dismiss, and the district court dismissed the discrimination claim with prejudice, but declined to dismiss the retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The retaliation claim proceeded to a jury trial. At trial, Stony Brook argued that Knight was not its employee, and that it therefore could not be held liable under Title VII. As the district court recognized, whether a plaintiff is an employee of a defendant for purposes of Title VII is determined by what are blown as the <em>Reid </em>factors. <em>See Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">490 U.S. 730</extracted-citation>, 751-52, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">109 S.Ct. 2166</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">104 L.Ed.2d 811</extracted-citation> (1989). Borrowing from the common law of agency, the <em>Reid </em>Court established a non-exhaus-five list of thirteen factors which guide the determination of employee status. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">Id.</extracted-citation> </em>Those factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">the hiring party\u2019s right' to control the manner and means- by which the product is accomplished!;] ... the skill required; -the source of the instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the duration of the relationship between the parties; whether - the- hiring party has- the right to assign additional projects to the hired party; the extent of the hired party\u2019s discretion over when--and how long to work; the method of payment; the ' hired party\u2019s role in hiring and paying assistants; whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party; whether the hiring party is in business; the provision of employee benefits; and the tax treatment of the hired party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">\n<em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">Id.</extracted-citation> </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">. The parties presented conflicting evidence regarding several of these factors. Knight elicited testimony that Stony Brook provided some tools for him and the other electricians, tending to show that he was an employee; however, this testimony also revealed that the electricians were required to supply their own basic tools, tending to show the opposite. Knight also presented evidence that Stony Brook controlled the manner and means by which the work was accomplished because Knight received specific assignments every morning, and had no discretion over how or when the work was accomplished; Stony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Brook countered by arguing that Knight and the other union electricians had significant control over their work because they were given only an overview of the work that needed to be done, and were then instructed to handle the details of the work on their own. Similarly, when Knight argued that he was an employee because Stony Brook provided him with benefits, Stony Brook produced evidence that the benefits were in fact paid to' the union, which was charged'with dispersing the benefits to individual members.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Moreover, the factors as to which the facts were not disputed did not clearly favor one party or the other. For example, Knight presented uncontradicted evidence that he was paid by the State Comptroller and was treated as an employee for tax purposes, and Stony Brook, in turn, presented undisputed evidence that the construction work for which Knight was hired was not its usual business, and that the duration of the employment was brief. In sum, 'several of the factors were disputed, with evidence presented on both sides, and the rest of the factors did not trend decisively in favor of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\u25a0 At the close of evidence, Knight moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) for judgment as a matter of law that he was Stony Brook\u2019s employee. The district court denied Knight\u2019s motion and submitted the issue to the jury, finding that \u201cthe variety of evidence\u201d created questions of fact that needed to be determined by a jury. App. at 130. It instructed the jury to consider and balance the <em>Reid </em>factors in determining Knight\u2019s employment status. After brief deliberations, the jury returned a verdict finding that Knight was not an employee of Stony Brook. Because that finding resolved the case in Stony Brook\u2019s favor, the jury did not make any determination about the other elements of Knight\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Knight did not renew his Rule 50 motion after the verdict under Rule 50(b), or seek a new trial. Instead, he filed this appeal, raising the claims of error set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">I. Permitting the Jury to Determine Whether Knight was an Employee</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">First, Knight contends that a judge, not a jury, should decide whether an individual is an employee, and that the district court therefore erred when it submitted that question to the jury. Whether a jury may determine a plaintiffs status as an employee 'presents a question of law. We review questions of law <em>de novo. Waggoner v. Barclays PLC, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263592\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/79/#p97\">875 F.3d 79</extracted-citation>, 97 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting <em>Roach v. T.L. Cannon Corp., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051169\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/401/#p405\">778 F.3d 401</extracted-citation>, 405 (2d Cir. 2015)) (\u201c[W]e review the district court\u2019s construction of legal standards <em>de novo\u201d); see also U.S. v. Salameh, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11707460\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/88/#p142\">152 F.3d 88</extracted-citation>, 142 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cWhether jury instructions were properly given is a question of law that this court reviews <em>de novo\u201d).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">We rejected an argument virtually identical to Knight\u2019s in <em>Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"288228\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/149/\">148 F.3d 149</extracted-citation> (2d Cir. 1998). In that case a plaintiff sought a new trial on his state labor law claim on the ground that \u201cthe question of whether he was an employee was improperly submitted to the jury.\u201d <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"288228\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/149/\">Id. </extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"288228\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/149/\">at 170</extracted-citation>. Like Knight, he argued that the question was a legal one that only a court could decide after the jury had made relevant factual findings. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"288228\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/149/\">Id.</extracted-citation> </em>Without deciding whether determining employment status presents a question of fact or law, we concluded that \u201cthe submission of that question to the jury\u201d did not warrant a new trial.' <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"288228\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/149/\">Id. </extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"288228\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/149/\">at 171</extracted-citation>. We noted that a district court always has discretion to call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>for a general verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reasoned that the plaintiff had not suffered any harm to his substantial rights from the trial court\u2019s submission of the \u201cemployee\u201d issue to the jury on general instructions rather than having the jury decide only the narrow factual questions and reserving the bottom-line determination of the issue to itself as a question of law. Because errors that do not affect substantial rights are not grounds for reversal, <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202111\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111</extracted-citation>, reversal was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">\n<em>Kirsch </em>controls here. Although, as Knight notes, we have stated that the district court\u2019s \u201cultimate determination as to whether a worker is an employee ... is a question of law,\u201d <em>Eisenberg v. Advance Relocation &amp; Storage, Inc., </em><extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20F.3d%20111\">287 F.3d 111</extracted-citation>, 115 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>Kirsch </em>rejected the argument that submitting the question to a jury is prejudicial error, the same contention Knight now makes. In so doing, <em>Kirsch </em>noted that whether an individual is an employee is \u201cregularly presented to juries that are instructed to return general verdicts, informed by the court\u2019s instructions on the law and given the direction that if they find that the plaintiffs in ques- \u2022 tion were employees ... they should simply state that they find in favor of the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Kirsch, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"288228\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/149/\">148 F.3d at 171</extracted-citation>.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether the jury is asked a simple question about liability or a series of questions, the first of which concerns whether the plaintiff was an employee, the effect is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">As we held in <em>Kirsch, </em>a trial court does not commit error by submitting the question of whether the plaintiff was the defendant\u2019s employee to the jury, whether by general verdict or by special question. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">II. Instructing the Jury on the <em>Reid </em>Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Second, Knight asserts that the district court should not have instructed the jury on the <em>Reid </em>factors because those factors are only intended to distinguish employees from independent contractors, and Stony Brook did not contend that Knight was an independent contractor. The correctness of the jury instructions presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. U.S. v. Salameh, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11707460\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/88/#p142\">152 F.3d 88</extracted-citation>, 142 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cWhether jury instructions were properly given is a question of law that this court reviews <em>de novo\u201d).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">When the Supreme Court articulated the <em>Reid </em>factors, it stated that where Congress uses the term \u201cemployee\u201d without meaningfully defining it, \u201cCongress intended to describe the conventional master-servant relationship as understood by common-law agency doctrine.\u201d <em>Reid, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">490 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>U.S. at 740</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">109 S.Ct. 2166</extracted-citation>. The Court then reduced that doctrine to thirteen non-exclusive factors. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">Id. </extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">at 751-62</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">109 S.Ct. 2166</extracted-citation>. We have since determined that those <em>Reid </em>factors, subject to a' slight alteration, see <em>O\u2019Connor v. Davis, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"943657\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/126/112/#p115\">126 F.3d 112</extracted-citation>, 115-16 (2d Cir. 1997) (imposing antecedent requirement that individual receive remuneration), constitute the proper test under which to analyze whether an individual is an employee for purposes of Title VII, see, <em>e.g., Salamon v. Our Lady of Victory Hosp., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049012\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/217/#p226\">514 F.3d 217</extracted-citation>, 226-27 (2d Cir. 2008); <em>see also Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227709\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/318/#p321\">503 U.S. 318</extracted-citation>, 321-24, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227709\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/318/#p321\">112 5.Ct. 1344</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227709\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/318/#p321\">117 L.Ed.2d 581</extracted-citation> (1992) (applying <em>Reid </em>factors to statutory scheme containing similarly circular definition of employee as Title VII). Although the <em>Reid </em>test may distinguish employees from independent contractors, <em>see Reid, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">490 U.S. at 751</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p751\">109 S.Ct. 2166</extracted-citation>, that is not its only function. Rather, the <em>Reid </em>factors are the method of analysis. Congress intended to require for determining employee status generally under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Tellingly, while arguing that the <em>Reid </em>factors apply only for distinguishing employees from independent contractors, Knight offers no alternate test that should be used to determine employee status in other contexts, except to note that in some cases, an employee of one entity may be deemed an employee of another entity under the \u201cjoint employer\u201d theory. <em>See Arculeo v. On-Site Sales &amp; Mktg., LLC, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1550512\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/425/193/#p198\">425 F.3d 193</extracted-citation>, 198 (2d Cir. 2005). However,- that theory looks to the relationship between two possible employers when \u201can employee\u201d is \u201cformally employed by one entity,\u201d and -seeks .to impose liability on another. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1550512\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/425/193/#p198\">Id.</extracted-citation> </em>It therefore does not help to answer the antecedent question at issue here, of whether an individual is an employee of a single individual or entity.- Thus,- the \u201cjoint employer\u201d inquiry cannot replace the <em>Reid </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">We therefore reject Knight\u2019s contention that the district court erred when it instructed the jury to use the <em>Reid </em>factors to determine whether he was Stony Brook\u2019s employee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">III. The Application of the <em>Reid </em>Factors,</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Third, Knight argues that even if the <em>Reid </em>factors apply, they compel the conclusion that he was Stony Brook\u2019s employee and that the district court therefore erred in denying his Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law. [Blue 18] Stony Brook responds -that Knight is precluded from making such an argument because he failed to file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure following the jury\u2019s verdict. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">In <em>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court determined that a partyis failure to make a renewed, post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b) \u201cforecloses its challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence\u201d on appeal. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5985363\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/394/#p404\">546 U.S. 394</extracted-citation>, 404, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5985363\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/394/#p404\">126 S.Ct. 980</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5985363\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/394/#p404\">163 L.Ed.2d 974</extracted-citation> (2006). Here, Knight failed to file a motion under Rule 50(b), or for that matter make any motion challenging the jury\u2019s conclusion that he .was not ah employee of Stony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Brook. He nevertheless, argues that the evidence was insufficient to permit the jury to determine that he was not a Stony Brook employee and that the district \u201ccourt should have held as a matter of law that [he] was employed by Stony Brook.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 21. That argument is barred by <em>Unitherm. </em>Indeed, in his reply brief, Knight appears to abandon his sufficiency of the evidence challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In any event, the argument is without merit. The evidence in the case presented disputed issues of fact regarding several of the <em>Reid </em>factors, and the balancing of those factors and others that pointed both in favor of and against employee status also presented a disputed issue requiring resolution by the fact-finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">IV. Knight\u2019s Evidentiary &amp; Instructional Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Finally, Knight challenges several of the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, as well .as several of its other instructions to the jury. All of those challenges, however, address issues that the jury was instructed not to decide unless it first determined that Knight was Stony Brook\u2019s employee. <em>See LNC Invs., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, N.J., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11438372,1088646\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/308/169/\">308 F.3d 169</extracted-citation>, 177 n.10 (2d Cir. 2002) (noting that we presume that juries follow district court\u2019s instructions). Because we identify no error that requires reversal of the jury\u2019s firiding that he was not an employee, we need not reach those challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">.
