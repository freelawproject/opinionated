We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>The essential facts are not really in dispute. Plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident on July 2, 2004, while operating a van owned by his company and insured by ARI under a business auto policy with $500,000 in UIM coverage. The vehicle that hit plaintiff was insured by American International Companies (AIG) with policy limits of $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Plaintiffs policy, effective January 1, 2004, contained an endorsement providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">2. With respect to damages resulting from an \"accident\u201d with an \u201cunder-insured motor vehicle\u201d, we will pay under this coverage only if a. or b. below applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">a. The limit of any applicable liability bonds or policies have been exhausted by judgments or payments; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">b. A tentative settlement has been made between an \u201cinsured\u201d and the insurer of an \u201cunder-insured motor vehicle\u201d and we:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">(1) Have been given prompt written notice of such tentative settlement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">(2) Advance payment to the \u201cinsured\u201d in an amount equal to the tentative settlement within 30 days after receipt of notification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">Another section, entitled \u201cChanges In Conditions\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">The Conditions are changed for Uninsured and Underinsured Motorists Coverage as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-15\">2. Duties In The Event Of Accident, Claim, Suit Or Loss is changed by adding the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-16\">a. Promptly notify the police if a hit-and-run driver is involved; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-17\">b. Promptly send us copies of the legal papers if a \u201csuit\u201d is brought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-18\">c. A person seeking coverage under this endorsement must also promptly notify us, in writing, of a tentative settlement between the \u201cinsured\u201d and the Insurer of an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d, and allow us to advance payment to that \u201cinsured\u201d in an amount equal to the tentative settlement within 30 days after receipt of notification to preserve our rights against the insurer, owner or operator of such \u201cunder-insured motor vehicle\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-19\">Accordingly, plaintiff promptly advised ARI in writing on August 19, 2004 that the tortfeasor had a limited policy of $15,000 and therefore was \u201cnotifying [defendant] of an underinsured claim for injuries and damages sustained by [plaintiff]\u201d. The letter requested that defendant \u201cturn [the] matter over to [its] attorney and have [the] attorney select an arbitrator\u201d. In subsequent correspondence of September 7, 2004, plaintiff forwarded a copy of the police report to defendant, naming the identity and address of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the tortfeasor, and later, by letter of October 20, 2004, plaintiff requested of Kristin Mayes, an employee of defendant, confirmation that plaintiff had UIM coverage of $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">On October 26, 2004, plaintiffs counsel had a conversation with Mayes wherein he advised her of a written settlement offer from AIG dated the day before \u2014 October 25, 2004 \u2014 offering plaintiff the tortfeasor\u2019s $15,000 policy limit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This was confirmed by letter of October 27, 2004, formally advising defendant that AIG had offered plaintiff $15,000 conditioned upon receipt of medical bills and records, and enclosing AIG\u2019s letter of August 3, 2004, indicating that the liability limit was $15,000. The October 27, 2004 letter from plaintiffs counsel reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">This will confirm our telephone conversation on October 26, 2004. I am advising you that the underinsured carrier has agreed to offer their limits of $15,000.00 upon receipt of medical bills and medical records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">Additionally, this is [sic] will acknowledge that you have confirmed that the UIM benefits is [sic] $500,000.00. Likewise, all medical bills must be paid by PIP. There is no provision for medical payment in either of the commercial policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">I am enclosing herewith a letter from AIG Insurance Company dated August 3, 2004, indicating that the liability limit is $15,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">After waiting thirty-three days from the transmission of the October 27, 2004 letter, and having received no response from ARI \u2014 neither any objection to settlement nor request for additional information or time \u2014 on November 29, 2004, plaintiff tendered a general release from liability to AIG\u2019s insured in exchange for $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">Next, by letter of December 17, 2004 to ARI, plaintiff made a formal demand for arbitration, and reiterated that demand in a follow-up letter of February 17, 2005, enclosing an updated medical report. When ARI responded that it needed proof of the tortfeasor\u2019s limited policy and a complete medical package, plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tiffs counsel replied in a June 1, 2005 letter that the requested information had already been supplied and that if defendant did not name an arbitrator within fifteen days, plaintiff would file a declaratory judgment action to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Receiving no response, on September 1, 2005, plaintiff filed an order to show cause and verified complaint seeking to compel defendant to arbitrate his claim for UIM benefits. Defendant cross-moved to dismiss, alleging that plaintiff failed to provide notice of his intent to accept the settlement offer, which prejudiced ARI\u2019s subrogation rights. Rejecting this argument, the Law Division, on December 13, 2005, ordered ARI to submit to arbitration. The judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">[Plaintiff counsel\u2019s] October 27, 2004 letter to defendant stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\u201cI am advising you that the underinsured carrier has agreed to offer their limits of $15,000 upon receipt of medical bills and medical records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">This statement, although it may be deemed ambiguous as it states a condition upon which the offer is contingent; however, it\u2019s the Court\u2019s position that the statement appears to provide sufficient notice to defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">On appeal, defendant reiterates the argument made below, namely that plaintiffs failure to provide written notification of its intent to accept AIG\u2019s settlement offer violated both the terms of the insurance contract (Condition (E)(2)(c)) and <em>Longworth, </em>and that ARI\u2019s subrogation rights were prejudiced by the release because an asset check of the tortfeasor had not previously been conducted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Preliminarily, we note that since the issues involve contract interpretation and the application of <em>Longworth </em>to the facts of this case, our standard of review is de novo. <em>Fastenberg v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>415, 420, 707 A.2d 209 (App.Div. 1998); <em>Young v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 621, 688 A.2d 1069 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>408, 694 A.2d 193 (1997). As to the former, ARI\u2019s policy required that: \u201cA person seeking coverage under this endorsement must also <em>promptly notify us, in uniting, of a tentative settlement </em>between the \u2018insured\u2019 and the Insurer of an \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 \u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>(emphasis added). This is consistent with the notification required by <em>Longworth:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">[U]ntil a definitive response comes from the Legislature, the Commissioner or the industry, that, as a matter of future conduct, an insured receiving an acceptable settlement offer from the tortfeasor should notify his UIM carrier. The carrier may then promptly offer its insured that sum in exchange for assignment to it by the insured of the claim against the tortfeasor. While promptness is to be ultimately determined by the circumstances, 30 days should be regarded as the presumptive time period if the insured notices his carrier prior to assignment of a trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">[223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 194-95, 538 A.2d 414.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">In <em>Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co. v. </em>Vassas, 139 <em>N.J. </em>163, 652 A.2d 162 (1995), the Supreme Court expressly approved the procedure set forth in <em>Longworth, </em>finding that it \u201creflects a fair balance between the competing interests of the parties involved[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 172, 652 A.2d 162, and has been followed \u201calmost universally by the bar and insurance industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 652 A.2d 162 (quoting Craig &amp; Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Insurance Law, \u00a7 28:3 </em>(2005)). Not only did <em>Vassas </em>adopt <em>Longworth, </em>it also expounded upon <em>Longworth\u2019s </em>thirty-day time requirement, explaining that \u201cLongworth merely established thirty days as a \u2018presumptive time period\u2019 for notifying a UIM insurer of a settlement offer[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 173, 652 A.2d 162 (quoting <em>Longworth, supra, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 194, 538 A.2d 414), and emphasizing \u201cpromptness [is] to be ultimately determined by the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">As to the form of notification, our courts have since found that \u201c[u]nder the <em>Longworth </em>procedure injured parties will generally preserve their UIM benefits by placing their own carriers on notice of <em>proposed </em>settlements with tortfeasors.\u201d <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Co. v. Keystone Ins. Co., </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>73, 79, 668 A.2d 92 (Law Div.1995) (emphasis added). \u201c[A]s the Supreme Court has pointed out, [this] has become the standard practice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>To this end, our courts have accepted notification by a <em>\u201cLongworth </em>letter.\u201d <em>See Rivers v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>379, 711 A.2d 974 (App.Div.1998); <em>Barrett v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>613, 685 A.2d 975 (App.Div.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>29, 695 A.2d 671 (1997); <em>Prudential, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>per. </em>73, 668 A.2d 92. In <em>Rivers, </em>we specifically highlighted the significant information within the letter that would constitute appropriate <em>Longworth </em>notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">the letter reports that the tortfeasor had offered the single limit of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy, that plaintiff intended to accept the offer, and that [the insurer] had the options made available to insurers in <em>Longworth, </em>including the insured\u2019s representation that she would assign her claim against the tortfeasor if [her insurer] elected to follow that course. Finally, the letter informs [the insurer] that it had thirty days from the date of the letter to respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">[312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 384-85, 711 A.2d 974.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Vassas articulated the information that should generally be provided. <em>Vassas, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 174, 652 A.2d 162. We summarized this information in <em>Hallion v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>360, 367-68, 766 A.2d 1224 (App.Div.2001), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">The [Vassas] Court directed that when an insured under an insurance policy providing UIM benefits is involved in an accident, the insured must notify the insurer when suit is filed. Then while the claim is pending if it appears that the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance coverage will not satisfy the insured\u2019s damages, notice again should be given to the insurer. Thereafter, if the insured receives a settlement offer or an arbitration award that does not satisfy the insured\u2019s damages, then the insured should again notify the insurer of that fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Ultimately, the burden to show lack of notice is on the carrier. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. v. Farrell, </em>855 F.2d 146, 151 (3rd Cir.1988) (citing <em>Cooper v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>86, 237 A.2d 870 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Here, we are satisfied that the letters of August 19, 2004, October 20, 2004 and October 27, 2004, read in combination and in the context of the circumstances known to defendant at the time, satisfied not only the terms of the insurance contract but <em>Long-worth </em>requirements as well. The former only required prompt notice of a \u201ctentative settlement\u201d, and the October 27th letter advising of AIG\u2019s settlement offer conditioned on receipt of medical records clearly suffices since a completed, fully worked-out or agreed upon settlement was not required. Moreover, the combination of all three letters put defendant on plain notice of: (1) the lawsuit filed against the tortfeasor; (2) the tortfeasor\u2019s limited policy of $15,000; (3) the fact that the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>not satisfy plaintiffs damages for injuries sustained in the accident; (4) plaintiffs intent to pursue UIM benefits; and (5) AIG\u2019s settlement offer, which represented exhaustion of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits. Indeed, the fact that AIG extended the best offer possible was indicative of the likelihood that plaintiff would accept the offer. Significantly, for present purposes, the October 27th letter expressly stated that \u201cthe underinsured carrier has <em>agreed </em>to offer their [sic] limits\u201d (emphasis added), strongly suggesting that negotiations took place between plaintiff and AIG wherein an agreement acceptable to each was reached between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">It is undisputed that ARI never gave any verbal \u2014 much less formal or written \u2014 response advising plaintiff <em>not </em>to settle with the tortfeasor. In fact, by the time plaintiff accepted AIG\u2019s offer on November 29, 2004, three months had passed since plaintiffs initial correspondence of August 19th, and thirty-three days had elapsed since the October 27th letter advising of the settlement offer and confirming plaintiffs UIM benefits amount. Significantly, no response whatsoever was forthcoming from defendant to either the October 20th or October 27th correspondence from plaintiffs counsel. Indeed, it was not until February 17, 2005, after two formal demands for arbitration, that defendant finally responded and then only expressing a need for information which plaintiff claims had already been provided and in defendant\u2019s possession. Under the circumstances, we conclude that plaintiff adequately conveyed to ARI that an acceptable offer had been extended, which satisfied the contractual condition and substantially complied with <em>Longworth\u2019s </em>notification requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Obviously, the preferred course would have been the transmittal of correspondence clearly expressing the insured\u2019s intent to accept the tortfeasor\u2019s offer of settlement. Such an unequivocal statement would have avoided the very question spawning this litigation and left no doubt as to fulfillment of plaintiffs <em>Longworth </em>obligation. It would also have set the date certain for the UIM carrier to have commenced its own evaluation of the magnitude of its insured victim\u2019s claim, the tortfeasor\u2019s negligence, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>prospect of further recovery from the tortfeasor himself in order to determine whether to consent to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">While exact compliance with <em>Rivers, supra, </em>is to be encouraged, we nevertheless find that the series of correspondence at issue here, given the surrounding circumstances, accomplishes the same result. We are further satisfied that defendant suffered no prejudice from any technical deficiency in notification. To be sure, a UIM insurer is \u201centitled to protection against any prejudice it reasonably may have suffered\u201d as a result of the unauthorized settlement by the insured with the tortfeasor. <em>CNA Ins. Cos. v. Cave, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>185, 191, 753 A.2d 141 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>678, 762 A.2d 659 (2000). Accordingly, the insured \u201cis not ... entitled to a windfall.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, \u201c[a] carrier may not deny a claim for UIM[ coverage on grounds of prejudice where its own acts caused or significantly contributed to the claimed prejudice.\u201d <em>Kor v. Nat\u2019l Consumers Ins. Co., </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>80, 87, 706 A.2d 776 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>379, 718 A.2d 1208 (1998). Thus, our courts have refused to recognize per se prejudice to the UIM carrier where the plaintiff failed to adhere to the <em>Longworth </em>procedure, but the carrier also failed to act in accordance with <em>Longworth. See CNA, supra, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 190, 753 A.2d 141 (holding that settling a case in violation of <em>Longworth </em>and <em>Vassas </em>is not a per se bar to UIM coverage and rejecting \u201can irrebuttable presumption of prejudice\u201d); <em>Breitenbach v. Motor Club of Am. Ins. Co., </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 334-35, 685 A.2d 36 (App.Div.1996) (holding that where the carrier failed to respond in writing within thirty days of receipt of plaintiffs notice, the carrier\u2019s subrogation rights were not compromised and did not constitute a per se bar to UIM coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In <em>Rivers, supra, </em>we specifically noted: \u2018We do not read the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in [Fassas] to create a bright-line rule that the insured\u2019s failure to protect the insurer\u2019s right of subrogation amounts to prejudice per se, sufficient under all circumstances to deny the insured UIM benefits and excuse the insurer from its coverage obligation.\u201d <em>Rivers, supra, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>386, 711 A.2d 974. Instead, we have held that a plaintiff who defaults on his obligations under <em>Longworth </em>must be allowed \u201cto prove that his premature release of the insurer\u2019s subrogation rights caused the insurer no damage.\u201d <em>Rivers, supra, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 386, 711 A.2d 974 (internal citation omitted). The <em>Rivers </em>court read <em>Breitenbach </em>to \u201callow an insured relief if the insured was capable of proving a lack of prejudice to the insurer, even though the insurer\u2019s subrogation right had been extinguished by the release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 711 A.2d 974 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In this regard, defendant argues that by executing the release before notifying defendant of its intent to accept AIG\u2019s offer, and before defendant commenced an asset check of the tortfeasor, plaintiff prejudiced defendant\u2019s subrogation rights. We have already held that plaintiffs written correspondence advised defendant of the settlement offer and effectively notified defendant of its acceptability. Equally important, defendant was in possession of information on which a claims investigation could have commenced as early as September 7, 2004, when it received the police report listing the tortfeasor\u2019s name and address. Moreover, defendant was in possession of medical records detailing the extent of plaintiffs injuries. And defendant itself acknowledges being advised as early as October 26th that the tortfeasor\u2019s limited policy had been offered to plaintiff, and that this fact was confirmed in written correspondence on October 27th to the effect that AIG \u201chas agreed\u201d to the offer. Yet, despite all this information, defendant made no attempt to conduct an asset check or any meaningful type of claims investigation from August 19, 2004 to November 29, 2004. Plaintiff, on the other hand, acted in compliance with <em>Longworth </em>by waiting the presumptive thirty-day period once it wrote to defendant on October 27th revealing the settlement offer. Still, no action was taken by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In <em>Breitenbach, </em>the plaintiff gave his UIM insurer notice of an intent to settle for the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits and advised that unless the insurer objected within thirty days, he would accept the settlement and submit the UIM claim to the insurer. <em>Breiten</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>bach, supra, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 330, 685 A.2d 36. Prior to the expiration of the thirty-day period, plaintiff completed the settlement with the tortfeasor. Thereafter, the insurer refused to pay UIM benefits. <em>Ibid. </em>In the subsequent action by the insured against the UIM insurer, the motion judge dismissed the complaint, finding that plaintiffs failure to wait thirty days before settling with the tortfeasor irreparably prejudiced the UIM insurer\u2019s subrogation rights. We reversed, finding no prejudice to the UIM insurer, and explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">While plaintiff settled with the tortfeasor within the thirty days, defendant never delivered a response within that period, either objecting to the settlement or offering to pay the settlement proceeds. Having not responded in writing within thirty days of receipt of plaintiff\u2019s notice, the carrier\u2019s right of subrogation cannot be deemed to have been compromised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 335, 685 A2d 36.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We are persuaded that ARI\u2019s dilatory conduct in this instance should fare no better.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-13\"><em> Longworth v. Ohio Casualty Group, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 538 A.2d 414 (App. Div.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-12\"> That much is undisputed. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel certifies that he further advised Mayes of plaintiff's intent to accept the offer absent timely objection from defendant and that his subsequent October 27, 2004 letter would confirm the same. Mayes, on the other hand, has certified that plaintiff's counsel did not express plaintiff\u2019s intent to accept the offer absent timely objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
