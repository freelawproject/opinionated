This represents the third time that this matter has been before an appellate panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In our first decision, we concluded that the Law Division judge properly retained jurisdiction over these claims. <em>Muise v. GPU, Inc. (Muise I), </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140, 146, 753 A.2d 116 (App.Div. 2000). In our second decision, we affirmed the decertification of the overall class, however, we remanded for certification of the limited Red Bank class. <em>Muise v. GPU, Inc. (Muise II), </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 64, 851 A.2d 799 (App.Div.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">We now reverse the decertification of the Red Bank class and we remand to afford plaintiffs sufficient time to establish individual proof of damages causally related to the outages sustained as a result of the transformer failures at defendants\u2019 Red Bank substation as previously directed by our opinion in <em>Muise II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">We recite the underlying procedural history and facts as set forth in our opinion in <em>Muise II.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">Plaintiffs are residential and business customers of defendants GPU, Inc., and related affiliates (GPU or the utility), providers of electrical service. On July 20, 1999 the Tzannetakis plaintiffs filed a class action complaint ... alleging damages resulting from power failures in July 1999. On July 22, 1999 Muise filed a class action complaint in the same court against the same defendants, with similar allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">On August 4, 1999 Muise filed a motion for class certification. In September 1999 the Tzannetakis plaintiffs also moved for class certification. On October 8 consolidation was ordered. In an October 12, 1999 hearing Judge Chaiet granted plaintiffs\u2019 motions for class certification and denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in favor of deferring to the primary jurisdiction of the Board of Public Utilities (the Board).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">On January 11, 2000 we granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal from the denial of their motion to dismiss, \u201cin order to determine the proper forum for [plaintiffs\u2019] claims.\u201d <em>[Muise I, supra, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 148, 753 A2d 116]. Defendants did not seek leave to appeal from the class certification because they wanted to develop the factual record. We concluded that the Law Division judge properly retained jurisdiction, rather than deferring to the Board. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 753 A.2d 116....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">At a hearing on May 24, 2001 Judge Uhrmacher denied defendants\u2019 motion to decertify the class. On January 28, 2002 she heard arguments on defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. In an opinion issued on August 14, 2002 Judge Uhrmacher granted defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs\u2019 claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>violation of the Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), N.J.S.A 56:8-1 to -20, and strict product liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">On November 8, 2002 defendants filed a renewed motion to decertify the class. On December 17, 2002 plaintiffs filed a notice of motion for a declaration of admissibility of their experts\u2019 class-wide damage model. On November 10, 2003 Judge Perri issued her opinion denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to permit expert testimony on their proposed survey model for proof of class-wide damages, and decertifying the class. On January 5, 2004 we granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to appeal this ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\"><em>[Muise II, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 19-20, 851 A2d 799.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Recognizing that decertification of the overall class was justified by the predominance of individual issues, we nevertheless concluded that \u201ccertification is appropriate for a more limited class of customers affected by the failures of equipment at the Red Bank substation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 851 A2d 799. Pointing to the Board\u2019s expert\u2019s findings that the Red Bank substation \u201cbushing failures in transformer bank number 1 and transformer bank number 2 resulted primarily from long-term insulation degradation, exacerbated by elevated temperatures and overvoltages,\u201d and that \u201ca later study proposed replacement of transformer banks 1 and 2,\u201d the <em>Muise II </em>panel provided the following reasoning behind its decision to certify the limited class:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">We agree with plaintiffs that a Red Bank class would be proper if their evidence could establish that failure to timely install two new transformers constituted negligence and that this failure was the proximate cause of the related outages. The lack of predominance in causation issues for the larger proposed class is much reduced in a Red Bank class. A court must not make a preliminary decision on the merits when determining whether a class should be certified. However, the court is bound to take the substantive allegations of the complaint as true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">Once the court finds that common questions of liability, and the fact of damage, predominate, individual variations in the calculation of damages does not preclude class certification. However, plaintiffs may be required to present individualized proof of damages. The judge did not err by finding a lack of predominance of common liability issues for the overall class. However, we remand for certification of a limited, Red Bank, class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 45-46, 851 A2d 799 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Regarding proof of damages, we noted that \u201cindividual proof of damages, through customer claim forms, is not impossible or even impractical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 851 A2d 799. We provided the following direction on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>With respect to proof of damages on the remand, as to the \u201cRed Bank\u201d class, the <em>proof or disproof of damages in individuM cases should be feasible through use of customer claim forms and surveys, judicious use of interrogatories and demands for admission, reasonable investigative efforts, and perhaps statistical interpretation of sampling data from the relevant universe, established based on competent data. </em>We do not in any sense intend to limit the demonstrated thoughtful creativity of the trial judge, and the manifest energy of the parties in this regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">We affirm the orders decertifying the class and denying the motions to permit expert testimony on proposed class-wide damages but <em>we remand for certification on the more limited Red Bank class, i.e., that class of customers whose outages directly resulted from the alleged negligence in delaying the replacement of the transformers at the Red Bank substation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 64, 851 A.2d 799 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">On September 8, 2004, the Supreme Court denied both parties\u2019 applications for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">On August 4, 2005, defendants filed their motions for summary judgment and decertification of the remaining class. Oral argument on defendants\u2019 motion was held on December 7, 2005. Defendants asserted that the appellate panel\u2019s decision in <em>Muise II </em>\u201cimposed upon Your Honor an almost impossibly unmanageable situation.\u201d Defendants argued that the decision was \u201cunclear ... defyfing] anyone to tell ... with certainty what it is remanded to certify.\u201d Defendants also maintained that \u201cthe Appellate Division fundamentally erred in [its] holding, substituting its judgment for Your Honor\u2019s that common issues predominate on liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Arj\">Defendants also argued that the observation in <em>Muise II, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 52, 851 A.2d 799, that \u201cit might be reasonable to presume that all class members, merely by losing power, suffered some damage, if only the inconvenience of having to reset clocks,\u201d has been eliminated as actionable damages in class actions by subsequent decisions in <em>Thiedemann v. Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>234, 872 A.2d 783 (2005) and <em>Dabush v. Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 874 A.2d 1110 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>265, 883 A.2d 1062 (2005). Defendants maintained that, with the setting aside of inconvenience damages, plaintiffs are unable to establish that all members of the class have suffered damages to depart from the general preference for individualized proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Plaintiffs countered, essentially arguing: (1) they relied upon <em>Muise II, </em>and the appellate panel\u2019s decision deserves respect; (2) they are in receipt of optional claim forms from defendants\u2019 customers in the Red Bank area indicating that the Red Bank customers have suffered millions of dollars of loss and, together with the other information in defendants\u2019 possession, plaintiffs can create a reliable class-wide damage model; and (8) the <em>Thiedemann </em>and <em>Dabush </em>decisions dealt with ascertainable loss in class actions under the Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -20, rather than breach of contract or negligence actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In reaching her decision to decertify the Red Bank class, the motion judge made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">GPU asserts that plaintiffs cannot meet their burden to prove that every class member or even a vast majority was injured or damaged as a consequence of the power interruptions____Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate economic loss for all class members because many class members did not suffer any compensable loss as a result of their power interruptions____ Plaintiffs\u2019 response to this point is to suggest that all customers experienced inconvenience and discomfort. This court has already considered and rejected plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to quantify such claims through the use of a model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">... As previously established in this case, both at the trial and appellate level, plaintiffs must prove either individual damages or provide a reliable mathematical formula for calculating damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">In <em>Muise II, </em>the appellate court presupposed that each member of the proposed Bed Bank class sustained damage, if only some minor inconveniences associated with the interruption of power. Pursuant to <em>Thiedemann </em>and <em>Dabush, </em>a plaintiff must \u201cdemonstrate a real and measurable loss of property or moneys\u201d under the lower threshold required for a private cause of action under the CFA and inconvenience alone is insufficient to bestow standing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">The court thus finds that customers who suffered no demonstrable loss of property or money, and who suffered inconvenience alone, cannot prove the actual damages necessary to sustain their cause of action and to unite a class. Individual claims predominate in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-15\">The proofs presented demonstrate that many of the class members admit that they did not suffer damages. The claims of class members who did suffer damages are more appropriately addressed in individual suits against GPU rather than by class action in which they are joined with and must share recovery with class members whose claims are either non-existent or entirely dissimilar. Accordingly, GPU[\u2019s] renewed motion to decertify the class is granted on the basis that plaintiffs cannot sustain their burden of proving damages on a class-wide basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0L\">(footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>On appeal, plaintiffs argue: (1) the motion judge essentially reversed and improperly disregarded our decision in <em>Muise II; </em>(2) the decisions in <em>Thiedemann </em>and <em>Dabush </em>are limited to CFA claims arising out of defects fixed by manufacturers under warranties; and (3) the judge ruled prematurely without permitting plaintiffs to develop and submit a new damage model for the Red Bank class as envisioned in <em>Muise II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Defendants concede that following remand the Law Division never issued an order certifying the Red Bank class as directed by <em>Muise II. </em>However, defendants counter, contending that developments in class action jurisprudence following <em>Muise II, </em>particularly the decisions in <em>Thiedemann </em>and <em>Dabush, </em>establish that inconvenience alone could not constitute a class-wide injury, thus preventing plaintiffs from satisfying predominance under <em>R. </em>4:32-1(b)(3). They also contend that, under the circumstances, the motion judge did not disregard our opinion in <em>Muise II, </em>rather she effectively treated the Red Bank class as having been certified and her decertification of the class was in accordance with <em>R. </em>4:32-l(b)(3) because the putative class does not have a common legal grievance due to the fact that all members did not suffer injury sufficient to give them a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">We begin our analysis with the decisions in <em>Thiedemann </em>and <em>Dabush. </em>Defendants assert that both of these cases \u201cconfirm[ ] that inconvenience alone could not constitute injury, and in the absence of cognizable injury common to the class there could be no predominance of common issues.\u201d Defendants argue that \u201cit is now the law of New Jersey that inconvenience alone, in the absence of a quantifiable or measurable economic loss, does not create the essential element of injury necessary to sustain a cause of action ... for negligence____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\"><em>Thiedemann </em>involved plaintiffs who sought damages under the CFA from the defendant Mercedes-Benz for defective fuel gauge sensors that failed to report the correct amount of gasoline in their vehicles. The defendant repaired the gauges without charge under the vehicle warranty agreement. <em>Thiedemann, supra, </em>183 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 241-42, 872 A.2d 783. In <em>Dabush, </em>the plaintiffs sought damages against Mercedes-Benz under the CFA in a class action alleging the satellite navigation system did not work as advertised in the marketing literature for the vehicle. <em>Dabush, supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111, 874 A.2d 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The issue in both cases was whether the plaintiffs could demonstrate \u201cascertainable loss\u201d to sustain a private action under the CFA and, thus, survive defense motions for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 108, 874 A.2d 1110; <em>Thiedemann, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 238, 872 A.2d 783. Noting that \u201cthe CFA implicitly encourages ... automobile sellers[ ] to initiate pro-consumer warranty programs,\u201d the Court in <em>Thiedemann </em>concluded that \u201cdefects that arise and are addressed by warranty, at no cost to the consumer, do not provide the predicate \u2018loss\u2019 that the CFA expressly requires for a private claim.\u201d <em>Thiedemann, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 250-51, 872 A.2d 783. Although the Court noted that it had no \u201cdoubt that [plaintiffs] were inconvenienced by problems caused by the defective fuel gauge sensors,\u201d all repairs were performed under warranty at no cost to the plaintiffs who were provided with loaner cars, thus suffering no \u201cout-of-pocket monetary loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251-52, 872 A.2d 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The appellate panel in <em>Dabush, </em>relying in part on the then-recent decision in <em>Thiedemann, </em>found that the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he arrived forty minutes late to a business meeting due to a defect in the navigation system did not establish an ascertainable loss under the CFA. <em>Dabush, supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 124, 874 A.2d 1110. The panel explained that, as a lessee of the vehicle, the plaintiffs proofs could not demonstrate loss in future resale value and did not present any evidence of cost, price, or value of the system, which was not optional equipment on the vehicles in question, \u201c \u2018to satisfy the CFA requirement of a demonstration of a quantifiable or otherwise measurable loss as a condition of bringing a CFA suit.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Thiedemann, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 252, 872 A.2d 783).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Here, the motion judge rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that <em>Thiedemann </em>and <em>Dabush </em>were confined to the CPA, reasoning that \u201ca plaintiff must \u2018demonstrate a real and measurable loss of property or moneys\u2019 under the lower threshold required for a private cause of action under the CFA and inconvenience alone is insufficient to bestow standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">At oral argument on appeal, defendants argued that the following quote from <em>Muise II </em>supports the motion judge\u2019s reasoning that <em>Thiedemann </em>and <em>Dabush </em>are controlling and that had those decisions been rendered before <em>Muise II, </em>we would have declined to certify a more limited class.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">Judge Peni correctly observed that proof of damage in CFA cases is easier than proof of damage in negligence eases. To establish a cause of action for consumer fraud, a plaintiff need show only that a defendant engaged in a practice unlawful under the CFA that resulted in an \u201cascertainable loss of moneys or property, real or personal.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19. In contrast, to establish a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff must prove breach of a duty of care and actual damages sustained as a proximate cause of the breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\"><em>[Muise 11, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 34-35, 851 A.2d 799.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The above quoted portion of <em>Muise II </em>dealt with the appropriateness of the judge\u2019s decision concerning the significance of the dismissal of the CFA claims as altering plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proof with regard to the overall class, rather than plaintiffs\u2019 contention that it evidenced a reason for their earlier decertification. It was not directed at the more limited Red Bank class. Indeed, in our decision certifying the more limited Red Bank class we relied on <em>Delgozzo v. Kenny, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 190, 628 A.2d 1080 (App. Div.1993), as support for our conclusion that \u201c[o]nce the court finds that common questions of liability, and the fact of damage, predominate, individual variations in the calculation of damages does not preclude class certification.\u201d <em>Muise II, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 46, 851 A.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">In our view, the <em>Thiedemann </em>and <em>Dabush </em>decisions are confined to an interpretation of the term \u201cascertainable loss\u201d under the CFA. <em>See Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs Local </em># <em>68 Welfare Fund v. Merck &amp; Co., </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 292, 894 A.2d 1136 (App.Div.2006) (upholding a class certification despite the need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>plaintiffs to show ascertainable loss under the CFA), <em>motion for leave to appeal granted, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>215, 902 A.2d 1232 (2006); <em>Serna v.

DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>99, 112, 890 A.2d 997 (App.Div.2006) (\u201c[A] claim that a defect may, but has not, manifested itself until after the expiration of the warranty period cannot form the basis for a claim under the CFA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Under <em>R. </em>4:32-l(b)(3), predominance is established when \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and ... a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\u201d Our \u201ccourts will permit class certification even though individual questions, such as the degree of damages due a particular class member ... may remain following resolution of the common questions.\u201d <em>Delgozzo, supra, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 181, 628 A.2d 1080 (citing <em>In re Cadillac V8-6-4 Class Action (In re Cadillac), </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>412, 429-30, 432-35, 461 A.2d 736 (1983); <em>Blackie v. Barrack, </em>524 F.2d 891, 905 (9th Cir.1975) (\u201cThe amount of damages is invariably an individual question and does not defeat class action treatment.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>816, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>57, 50 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>75 (1976)). \u201cGenerally, \u2018[ijf a common nucleus of operative facts is present, predominance may be found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 628 A.2d 1080 (quoting <em>In re Cadillac, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 431, 461 A.2d 736) (alteration in original). \u201c\u2018[T]he basic question is whether the potential class, including absent members, seeks to remedy a common legal grievance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>In re Cadillac, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 431, 461 A.2d 736). We thus decline to alter the view expressed in <em>Muise II </em>that \u201cit might be reasonable to presume that all class members, merely by losing power, suffered some damage, if only the inconvenience of having to reset clocks,\u201d was an operative fact sufficient to present a common nucleus to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>establish predominance. <em>Muise II, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 52, 851 A.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Generally, \u201cit is inconsistent with sound judicial policy for the Law Division to reconsider a case, based on some arguably new precedent, after [the Appellate Division] affirmed the judgment and the Supreme Court denied certification.\u201d <em>Smid v. N.J. Highway Auth., </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>306, 309, 633 A.2d 580 (App.Div. 1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>467, 640 A.2d 849 (1994). At the time of the motion, plaintiffs had not presented their damage model for the Red Bank class. As such, the individual proof of damages as potentially acceptable proof of injury as a result of defendants\u2019 alleged negligence in the form suggested, namely, \u201cuse of customer claim forms and surveys, judicious use of interrogatories and demands for admission, reasonable investigative efforts, and ... statistical interpretation of sampling data from the relevant universe,\u201d was neither presented nor considered by the motion judge. <em>Muise II, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 64, 851 A.2d 799. Plaintiffs should be afforded a reasonable time to present those proofs. Only then would it be appropriate for the trial court to consider a motion to decertify or maintain the class with respect to the liability issue only, under <em>R. </em>4:32-2(d), on a showing that plaintiffs\u2019 individual damage issues are so significant when compared to those that are common to the class as a whole. <em>See In re Cadillac, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 437, 461A 2d 736; <em>Varacallo v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins.
