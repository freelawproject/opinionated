REISNER, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">Complainant, Martin O\u2019Shea, appeals from a revised final decision of the Government Records Council (GRC) dated October 28, 2005, denying O\u2019Shea\u2019s request for a copy of handwritten notes taken by the Secretary of the West Milford Board of Education (Board) during an executive session of the Board. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">The dispute in this case concerns a Board meeting conducted on June 22, 2004. O\u2019Shea requested four types of records relating to the meeting: collective bargaining agreements approved by the Board during the meeting; the resolution passed by the Board prior to going into closed session during the meeting; a copy of a letter referenced during the meeting; and the minutes of the executive session held during the meeting. In connection with this latter request, O\u2019Shea asked that \u201c[i]f the minutes of the executive session are not [on] audio tape, I am requesting a copy of the original handwritten notes.\u201d The Board Secretary advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>O\u2019Shea that there were no audiotapes and provided him with the unapproved but typed formal minutes of the executive session, as prepared by the Secretary and submitted to the Board. The Secretary declined to provide the handwritten notes \u201cbecause they are not government records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In response to O\u2019Shea\u2019s complaint under the Open Public Records Act (OPRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47.TA-1 to -13, on October 14, 2004, the GRC directed the Board to provide O\u2019Shea a copy of the handwritten notes, \u201csubject to appropriate redactions in accordance with OPRA.\u201d The Board appealed, and we granted the GRC\u2019s motion to remand the matter so that the agency could review the notes <em>in camera </em>to determine whether they fell within the statutory exemptions or privileges claimed by the Board under OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">After conducting an <em>in camera </em>review of the handwritten notes, the GRC concluded that they were not a public record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">The <em>in camera </em>inspection disclosed a page of cryptically written notes, punctuated by the frequent use of initials and abbreviations, apparently intended to serve as a memory aid for the Board Secretary. Without further explication from the Board Secretary, the notes cannot be relied on as a factual account of board proceedings. For that reason, the Council has determined that the statutory exemption for advisory, consultative and deliberative material applies. Alternatively, the notes constitute a work-in-progress, as opposed to a completed draft, and therefore cannot fairly be characterized as a \u201cgovernment record\u201d under OPRA. The requestor \u2014 who has both the approved and unapproved draft minutes \u2014 has no discemable interest in obtaining the handwritten notes such that it would be appropriate to override the statutory exemption; consequently, the notes need not be released.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The Board withdrew its appeal of the GRC\u2019s original decision, and O\u2019Shea filed an appeal of the GRC\u2019s order on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Having canvassed the record, including the handwritten notes which we reviewed <em>in camera, </em>we conclude that the GRC reached the correct result. The Open Public Records Act defines a \u201c[gjovernment record\u201d as a document \u201cmade, maintained or kept on file <em>in the course of his or its official business </em>by any [governmental] officer, commission, [or] agency.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>1.1 (emphasis added). Government records do not include \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency advisory, consultative, or deliberative material.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The term also</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">shall not include the following information which is deemed to be confidential ...: information generated by or on behalf of public employers or public employees in connection with ... any grievance filed by or against an individual or in connection with collective negotiations, including documents and statements of strategy or negotiating position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">[fitd]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">We agree with the GRC that the handwritten notes might be considered \u201cintra-agency consultative material,\u201d because they were informal notes taken preliminary to the Secretary preparing a draft of minutes for the Board\u2019s consideration and approval. However, we also conclude that they are not \u201cgovernment records\u201d at all. While the Secretary\u2019s job includes the responsibility to record the proceedings of the Board, <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:17-7, that responsibility is carried out by preparing the minutes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\"><em>The secretary shall </em>give notice of all regular or special meetings of the board to the members thereof and <em>record the minutes of all proceedings of the board </em>and the results of any annual or special school election <em>in suitable minute books. [Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">It is clear from the statutory language that the preparation of formal minutes is the Secretary\u2019s \u201cofficial business\u201d and that the formal minutes themselves, not the Secretary\u2019s handwritten notes, are the public record. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-14 (requiring a public body to keep \u201creasonably comprehensible minutes of all its meetings\u201d). <em>Fox v. Estep, </em>118 <em>Idaho </em>454, 797 P.2d 854, 855 (1990), on which O\u2019Shea relies, is not on point, because the Idaho statute at issue there required the secretary to \u201c[rjecord\u201d the agency\u2019s proceedings, and the court construed recording as a separate statutory duty from preparation of the formal minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">We reject O\u2019Shea\u2019s contention that the Secretary\u2019s handwritten notes, jotted down as a memory aid to assist in preparing the formal minutes, are a public record merely because they were \u201cmade\u201d by a government official. Under that rationale any Board member\u2019s personal handwritten notes, taken during a meeting to assist the member to recall what occurred, would be a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>record because the member might arguably refer to them later in reviewing the Secretary\u2019s draft of the formal minutes. Taken further, every yellow-sticky note penned by a government official to help him or her remember a work-related task would be a public record. Such absurd results were not contemplated or required by OPRA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\"><em>Gannett New Jersey Partners, LP v. County of Middlesex, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 877 A.2d 330 (App.Div.2005), is not on point. In that case, we held that a county planner\u2019s thirteen pages of factual notes of her conversations with applicants for a farmland preservation program were public records. However, we permitted the County to redact portions reflecting her evaluation of the application. <em>Id. </em>at 219-20, 877 A.2d 330. In <em>Gannett, </em>it appeared that the notes were made as part of the planner\u2019s investigation of the application. There was no indication that the notes had been translated into some more formal form, such as an official report. Nor were they the kind of informal memory aid at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In <em>Atlantic City Convention Center Authority v. South Jersey Publishing Co., </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>53, 63-64, 637 A.2d 1261 (1994), the Court held that audiotapes of executive sessions, used to prepare the agency\u2019s meeting minutes, were not public records under the Right-to-Know Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 to -4.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">[I]n this ease, the Authority used the audio tapes merely as a convenience for its own purposes in preparing the official minutes that it recognizes it must disclose under the Right-to-Know Law. The situation is as though a secretary had taken shorthand notes of the meeting. The secretary\u2019s transcribed notes, approved by the body, not the notes themselves, would constitute the official record of the meeting. Simply because a public agency uses an electronic note pad in place of a steno pad as a method to prepare \u201creasonably comprehensible minutes\u201d does not establish that that electronic record constitutes a Right-to-Know record. Because the audio tapes of these proceedings served only as a convenient means to enable preparation of the official minutes and were not records required to be \u201cmade, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>maintained or kept,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:lA-2, the audio tapes do not constitute Right-to-Know records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\"><em>[A\u00dc. City, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 63-64, 637 A2d 1261 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The Court held, however, that the tapes were common law records and ordered limited disclosure in the circumstances of that case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Moreover, the treatment of the executive session notes for purposes of OPRA must be considered in light of the Open Public Meetings Act (OPMA), pursuant to which the agency is permitted to go into executive session. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-12b. As the Court recognized in <em>Atlantic City, supra, </em>OPMA permits an agency to go into closed or executive session to discuss matters which the Legislature has determined as matter of policy agencies have a legitimate need to discuss privately. These include certain personnel matters and contract negotiations. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-12b(4) and (8). OPRA dovetails with OPMA by exempting documents on these subjects from disclosure as public records. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Under OPMA, the Board is required to keep minutes of its executive sessions, and must \u201c \u2018promptly\u2019 \u201d release the notes to the public \u201cunless full disclosure would subvert the purpose of the particular exception\u201d that justified the closed session in the first place. <em>Payton v. N.J. Tpk. Auth., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>524, 557, 691 A.2d 321 (1997) (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-14). However, particularly with respect to minutes of a closed session, the Board\u2019s determination as to what information to include in the minutes is itself a policy decision. The minutes of executive sessions are typically general enough to avoid disclosure of the kind of \u201cfree and frank exchange of views among the members\u201d that OPMA intended to protect. <em>Atl. City, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 68, 637 A.2d 1261. <em>See also S. Jersey Publ\u2019g Co. v. N.J. Expressway Auth., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>478, 493-94, 591 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>A.2d 921 (1991). A Secretary\u2019s handwritten notes may not reflect the Board\u2019s views in terms of the accuracy and inclusiveness of its minutes. Unlike the audiotapes considered in <em>Atlantic City, supra, </em>the notes here are not a verbatim record of what happened at the meeting and therefore may be inaccurate. It would defeat the purpose of the exception in OPMA for executive sessions, and defeat the Board\u2019s right to approve its minutes, if the Secretary\u2019s informal, preliminary notes were deemed public records. <em>See also Home News v. Bd. of Educ. of Spotswood, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>380, 387-89, 669 A.2d 295 (App.Div.1996) (working drafts of budget documents not public records).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">O\u2019Shea\u2019s remaining appellate contentions are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\"> O'Shea's citation to <em>Warder v.

In that case, the secretary's handwritten notes had been discarded, and it appears that what was at issue were the minutes that the secretary was required to keep in an official journal of the board's proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\"> We acknowledge that OPRA, <em>NJ.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1, is broader than the Right-to-Know Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-2, in its definition of what constitutes a public record.
