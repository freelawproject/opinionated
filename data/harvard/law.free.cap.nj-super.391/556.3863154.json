We granted the State\u2019s motion for leave to appeal the interlocutory order dismissing the reckless manslaughter indictment. Although our reasons differ from that of the motion judge, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Several witnesses were called before the grand jury to testify to the events surrounding the death of A.R. The following includes facts asserted by witnesses during the five days of testimony on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">At approximately 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 18, 2003, seventeen-year-old A.R. went to the home of twenty-year-old defendant Michael Lisa, purchased methadone from him, and ingested at least one tablet. Defendant had previously purchased fifty methadone pills from Doug Smith, to whom he had been referred by a co-worker. Each pill contained a forty-milligram dose, and was segmented in order that it might be easily broken into four separate pieces. According to Smith, at the time of purchase, defendant told him that he was purchasing the methadone for his personal use. Defendant explained to Smith that he knew the drug was used as a pain killer, knew that the drug was addictive, and knew that it should not be taken with alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">A.R. was acquainted with defendant and had \u201chooked up\u201d with him once or twice prior to October 18, 2003. After taking the first dose of methadone, A.R., along with numerous friends, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>proceeded to attend several parties, where she drank wine and beer, and smoked marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">A few hours later, A.R. began itching profusely, which is a symptom of methadone withdrawal. She announced to her friends that she wanted to go to defendant\u2019s home. Shortly before 3:00 a.m., A.R. and her friends arrived at the home of defendant. The group congregated in the basement where they drank beer and played guitar. A.R. sat on defendant\u2019s lap and flirted with him. Her pupils were almost fully dilated.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Apparently, A.R. continued to scratch herself and was described as being \u201cwired.\u201d A.R. was heard saying that she \u201cwanted more\u201d and asking defendant \u201c[i]s there any more?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Approximately twenty-five minutes after her arrival at defendant\u2019s residence, A.R. and defendant began to go upstairs together. Several of A.R.\u2019s friends wanted to leave, and A.R. was asked if she wanted to leave with them. She declined, held hands with defendant, and proceeded upstairs with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">At this point, three of A.R.\u2019s friends departed. Vinny Mercuri and Tom Spinelli remained. Shortly after defendant and A.R. were seen climbing the stairs, Mercuri went to look for A.R. The door at the top of the basement steps was unlocked. Mercuri proceeded through the door and up another flight of stairs where he came upon defendant\u2019s bedroom. The door was closed. Mercuri knocked on the door. When defendant opened the door, Mercuri saw A.R., who appeared to be intoxicated, leaning back on defendant\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Defendant told Mercuri that he and A.R. needed privacy. Mercuri asked, \u201c[w]hat do you mean privacy?\u201d A.R. stated that she and defendant needed to discuss something. Defendant closed the door and Mercuri went back to the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">After about ten minutes, Mercuri again attempted to go to speak with A.R. Again, the door at the top of the basement stairs was unlocked. Mercuri proceeded to defendant\u2019s bedroom. He knocked on the door, but no one answered. He did not hear any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>conversation or movement coming from the bedroom. The bedroom door was locked. Mercuri returned to the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Soon thereafter, defendant came running down into the basement. He momentarily disappeared into a second room in the basement. Defendant did not communicate with Mercuri, Spinelli, or defendant\u2019s friend Adam Krentzman, who was also present but seemingly \u201cpassed out\u201d on the couch. Mercuri attempted to follow the defendant. Yet, when he reached the top of the basement steps, the door, which was previously unlocked, was now locked. Mercuri and Spinelli left through another exit, which led directly to the exterior of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">At about 4:30 a.m. to 4:45 a.m., defendant entered the basement and woke his friend, Krentzman. Defendant told Krentzman, \u201cI got a problem. Can you come upstairs?\u201d When the two arrived at defendant\u2019s bedroom, Krentzman realized A.R. was passed out on defendant\u2019s bed. Krentzman described defendant as nervous. Defendant stated that he and A.R. had had sex and that after sex, while they were lying on his bed talking, A.R. passed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Defendant also explained that he had redressed A.R. by putting on her bra, underwear, and pants. In an attempt to awaken A.R., Krentzman and defendant shook her, slapped her face, and called her name. When A.R. remained unresponsive, Krentzman suggested they call 9-1-1. Defendant responded, \u201c[mjaybe she\u2019ll sleep it off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Defendant and Krentzman proceeded to fall asleep in the bed, with A.R. lying between them. Defendant and Krentzman awoke at 12:30 p.m. Once again, they tried to rouse A.R. They threw water on her and slapped her face. Other than a quiet snore, A.R. did not respond. Again Krentzman suggested calling 9-1-1. Defendant replied, \u201c[w]ait it out, wait it out. See if she\u2019ll sleep it off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Thereafter, defendant left the home and purchased ammonia to put under AR.\u2019s nose to revive her. The ammonia was not effective. Defendant also called a nurse, with whom he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>acquainted, for advice on the situation. The nurse told defendant to call 9-1-1. Defendant ignored the nurse\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Over the next several hours, defendant and Krentzman stayed in defendant\u2019s room, played video games, watched football, and periodically checked A.R. to \u201cmake sure she was okay.\u201d They also propped her up in the bed to help her breathe easier. Although she slumped over several times, defendant and Krentzman continued to prop her up. Occasionally, her head would twitch or slightly spasm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">During the early morning hours, before defendant summoned Krentzman, while defendant and A.R. were alone in defendant\u2019s room, A.R. and defendant crushed up one of defendant\u2019s forty-milligram methadone tablets and snorted it together. According to Krentzman, defendant believed he was responsible for A.R.\u2019s condition because he thought the methadone was the cause of her inability to breathe. Krentzman explained that defendant did not want to summon 9-1-1 because he was fearful of liability. Krentzman also stated that, based on statements made to him by defendant, Krentzman was \u201cpositive\u201d that defendant had sex with A.R. at least twice that night, \u201cpossibly more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Although defendant\u2019s parents were in the home during the entire course of events, defendant never revealed A.R.\u2019s presence until emergency aid was finally summoned at approximately 5:00 p.m. Police arrived at 5:10 p.m. At that time, A.R. was unresponsive and unconscious. Defendant told police that A.R. and friends arrived at his home at approximately 3:00 a.m. and that it appeared they had been drinking alcohol prior to their arrival. He insisted that A.R. had not consumed anything at his home other than a pill she retrieved from a prescription bottle in her purse. Defendant told police that A.R. took this pill at 3:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Defendant further stated that he and A.R. \u201chung out\u201d in his bedroom for twenty minutes before Krentzman joined them. Defendant told police that, while he and Krentzman were playing video games, A.R. fell asleep on his bed. At this time, defendant did not tell police that he gave A.R. methadone or that the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>had sex. Later, defendant admitted to another officer that he had sex with A.R., maintaining that it was \u201cregular\u201d consensual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">While in defendant\u2019s bedroom, police observed a half-dollar sized stain on the bed sheet, which appeared to be blood. They also noticed several empty condom wrappers on the floor, and a blood stained tampon<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as a marijuana-filled cigar blunt located in the waste basket.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Medics performed advanced life support until A.R. was transported by ambulance to Kimball Medical Center. Upon arriving at the hospital, A.R.\u2019s temperature had fallen to eighty-seven degrees Fahrenheit. By that time, A.R. had a strong pulse, but a blood pressure could not be measured, and she was experiencing major organ failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">A sexual assault examination was performed. The exam revealed numerous tears to the vagina, cervix, and perineal tissue, as well as one tear inside the anus. According to the State\u2019s nursing expert, a sexual assault examiner, these types of tissue tears cause significant pain. People engaged in sexual intercourse typically reposition themselves to minimize pain, if necessary. When a person does not (or cannot) move in order to reposition themselves, the likelihood of pain and injury increases. Particularly, with regard to the cervix, a substantial amount of force and trauma are required to cause it to tear. A.R.\u2019s injuries were deemed to have occurred within twenty-four hours of the examination. The nurse testified that of the 150 patients she has examined and approximately 1,000 charts she has reviewed, A.R. suffered \u201cby far the most injuries [she has] ever seen on one person after a report of an assault.\u201d She had only observed a tear of the cervix in one other case.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Specimens were retrieved from AR.\u2019s vagina, cervix, and anus, all of which tested positive for spermatozoa. DNA samples were taken from defendant and Krentzman for comparison purposes. Defendant was identified as the source of the DNA found in the vaginal specimen. The DNA contained in the cervical and anal specimens were determined to be a mixture of AR.\u2019s DNA and defendant\u2019s DNA. Defendant was also identified as the source of semen found on the sheets and on A.R.\u2019s pants. Krentzman was excluded as a possible contributor to all of the aforementioned specimens, except the specimen taken from AR.\u2019s bra.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">By the time A.R. was admitted to the hospital, she had already suffered severe brain damage and was almost clinically dead. If paramedics had not administered CPR, A.R. would have died in defendant\u2019s bedroom. In the days that followed, she was on a respirator, her brain function ceased, and her major organ systems failed. AR. died on October 29, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Upon conducting an autopsy, the medical examiner (M.E.) concluded that the cause of death was multi-organ system failure caused by ethanol and drugs. The causative drugs were methadone, methamphetamine, amphetamine and benzodiazepine. The M.E. specifically found that methadone contributed to A.R.\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The M.E. explained that the methadone, alcohol consumption, and benzodiazepine all worked together to suppress AR.\u2019s ability to breathe properly. During the approximately twelve hours that A.R. was unconscious and without medical attention, the oxygen in her blood gradually decreased, eventually causing brain death. The M.E. concluded that A.R.\u2019s chance of survival would have increased had medical attention been summoned when A.R. first lost consciousness between 4:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the reckless manslaughter count was based on the assistant prosecutor\u2019s charge to the grand jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>which was said to be legally deficient. Because of its importance to the discussion which follows, we set out the instruction in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alb\">One charge for your consideration in this case is reckless manslaughter. \u201cA person is guilty of reckless manslaughter if he recklessly causes the death of another person.\u201d In order for you to determine whether the defendant should be charged with reckless manslaughter, you must decide whether evidence has been presented that shows (1) the defendant engaged in conduct that caused the victim\u2019s death, and (2) that the defendant did so recklessly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">The first element the defendant engaged in conduct that caused the victim\u2019s death. That\u2019s the first thing you have to look at. \u201cConduct means an action or omission or a series of actions or omissions. Action means a bodily movement, whether voluntary or involuntary. Omission means the failure to aet. The law provides that criminal liability for an offense may not be based on an omission or a failure to act unaccompanied by action unless a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">In this case, the State is alleging that the defendant had a duty to provide emergency medical care for the victim, A.R. He failed to perform that duty, and that failure was a cause of the victim\u2019s death. It\u2019s up to you to determine from the evidence whether there is probable cause that such a duty existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">Insofar as the law of duty is concerned, I instruct you as follows. Generally one has no legal duty to aid another person in peril, even when that aid can be rendered without danger or inconvenience to himself. However, there are situations that give rise to a duty to act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">A person has a duty to act where he has voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless person as to prevent others from rendering aid. For example, a duty to act may be triggered where the defendant takes the victim from a place where others might have taken care to prevent injury to her to a private place where the defendant alone is to provide such care. A duty to aet may be triggered where the defendant makes statements or engages in conduct that prevents another person from seeking aid to the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">(2) A person has the duty to aet when the person is responsible for placing the victim in the position of danger or peril. If the person knows or has reason to know that by his conduct he has caused bodily harm to another [so] as to make her helpless and in danger of further harm, the person is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent such further harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">Additionally, if a person doesn\u2019t aet and subsequently realizes or should realize that it has created an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, he is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent the risk from taking effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">As stated above, you must determine whether given the evidence that you have heard regarding the circumstances surrounding A.R.\u2019s drug and alcohol ingestion and her loss of consciousness, the defendant had had a duty to timely provide emergency care for A.R. If you found the defendant did have the duty and then failed to discharge that duty, then you must determine whether the failure to provide emergency care caused A.R.\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Causation has a special meaning under the law. To establish causation, you must find sufficient [facts] to support probable cause that the victim would not have died but for the defendant\u2019s failure to provide emergency care, and (2) A.R.\u2019s death was within the risk of which the defendant was aware when he neglected to provide her emergency care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">In other words, the evidence must show that A.R.\u2019s death was not such an unexpected or unusual result of the defendant\u2019s failure to provide medical care under the circumstances of this case that it would be upjust to hold the defendant liable for reckless manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">The last element is recklessness. A person who causes another\u2019s death does so recklessly when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death will result from his act or omission, failure to act. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that considering the nature and purpose of defendant\u2019s conduct and the circumstances known to the defendant, a disregard of that risk is a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would follow in the same situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">That\u2019s assuming such conduct that the actor was aware of the risk he was creating and consciously disregarded that risk however much he may have hoped no harm would result he acting [sic] recklessly. In other words, you must find the defendant was aware of and consciously disregarded the risk his failure to provide emergency care to A.R. would result in A.R.\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">If you find the defendant was aware of the disregard of the risk of causing death, you must determine whether that risk that he disregarded was substantial and unjustifiable. In doing do, you must consider the nature and purpose of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the circumstances known to defendant, and you must determine whether in light of those factors defendant\u2019s disregard of that risk was a gross deviation from the conduct a reasonable person would have observed in defendant\u2019s situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss focused on that portion of the instruction that resulted from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-lb(2). The entire subsection reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">b. Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">(1) The omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">(2) A duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law, including but not limited to, laws such as the \u201cUniform Fire Safety Act,\u201d P.L.1983, c. 383 (C:52:27D-192 <em>et seg.), </em>the \"State Uniform Construction Code Act,\u201d P.L.1975, c. 217 (C.52:27D-119 <em>et seg.), </em>or any other law intended to protect the public safety or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">That portion of the language in (b)(2) beginning with the word \u201cincluding\u201d was added by a 1997 amendment. L. 1997, c. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">As the motion judge correctly stated, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-lb was based on section 2.01(3) of the Model Penal Code, which contains identical language. I <em>The New Jersey Penal Code, Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission </em>14 (1971). The accompanying Commentary on this provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">4. Subsection b stated the conventional provision as to when omissions unaccompanied by action suffice for liability. The omission must be one of the two sorts: (1) it may be made expressly sufficient by the law defining the offense; or (2) <em>it </em>may arise out of a duty to perform the omitted act which is otherwise imposed by law. Thus, under the Code, as well as under existing law, the duty to act may arise under some branch of the civil law. <em>See Wechsler and Michael, </em>A Rationale of the Law of Homicide, 37 <em>Colum. L.Rev. </em>701, 751 (1937). <em>See also State v. O\u2019Brien, </em>32 <em>N.J.L. </em>169 (Sup.Ct.1867) (Failure of railroad switch-operator to perform employment duty).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">[II New Jersey Penal Code, <em>supra, </em>at 39.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Thus, there is little doubt that the drafters of our Penal Code intended that the duty to act could be found in \u201csome branch of the civil law,\u201d which means the civil common law. Our Penal Code commentary is, in this respect, identical to the Model Penal Code Commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Putting aside for the moment what the referenced \u201ccommon law\u201d might be, we turn to the 1997 amendment. Defendant argued that the phrase \u201cotherwise imposed by law\u201d was limited by the 1997 amendment to enacted legislation, including \u201cany rule or regulation enacted thereunder,\u201d \u201cintended to protect the public safety.\u201d The State countered that the phrase \u201cotherwise imposed by law\u201d includes duties flowing from the common law, including duties imposed by civil tort law. The 1997 amendment, the State argued, was not intended to narrow the meaning of the statute as originally enacted, but to clarify it. The motion judge, in a thoughtful oral decision, accepted defendant\u2019s argument, finding that the 1997 amendment effected a major change in the provision, precluding reliance on common law principles as a source of the duty to act required for liability based on a failure to act. Despite the judge\u2019s careful analysis, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>There is no legislative history concerning the amendment, only the unilluminating statement accompanying the law: \u201cEstablishes criminal offense dealing with violation of public health and safety statutes.\u201d Our task is to determine whether the amendment intended to change the meaning of \u201cotherwise imposed by law\u201d to eliminate the inclusion of civil common law duties, as originally intended by the drafters of the Penal Code. As a general proposition, a change in a statute, whether by revision or, as here, by amendment, will only be construed to effect a change in the substance of the law if the Legislature\u2019s intent is clear. <em>See State v. Kohler, </em>40 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 606, 123 A.2d 881 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>225, 125 A.2d 439 (1956); <em>Borough of New Shrewsbury v. Block 105, Lot 11, </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>360, 365, 250 A.2d 53 (Ch.Div.1969), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>550, 270 A.2d 46 (App.Div.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We discern no such legislative intent here. Indeed, we find the language of the amendment to evidence a clear intent to the contrary. The addition of the several specific laws, and others of like effect, is introduced by the phrase, \u201cincluding but not limited to.\u201d Our courts have consistently held that the use of the term \u201cinclude\u201d signifies enlargement rather than limitation. <em>Cuna v. Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs, Avenel, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>292, 304, 200 A.2d 313 (1964); <em>Fraser v. Robin Dee Day Camp, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>480, 485-86, 210 A.2d 208 (1965); <em>Zorba Contractors, Inc. v. Hous. Auth. of the City of Newark, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430, 434, 660 A.2d 550 (App.Div. 1995); <em>Legge Indus. v. Kushner Hebrew Acad., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>537, 559, 756 A.2d 608 (App.Div.2000). Even if there could be any doubt as to the proper meaning of \u201cincluding\u201d in the 1997 amendment, <em>Cuna, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 304, 200 A.2d 313, the use of \u201cbut not limited to\u201d clearly indicates that no change was intended in the meaning of \u201cotherwise imposed by law\u201d as it pre-existed the amendment. Indeed, we note the obvious: the statutes included by the amendment were already covered by the phrase, \u201cotherwise imposed by law.\u201d Thus, while we do not divine the Legislature\u2019s purpose in the amendment, it does appear to have been superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>For these reasons, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the 1997 amendment eliminated civil common law principles as a basis for defining a duty the purposeful violation of which could be found to be conduct that, in turn, could provide the basis for a charge of reckless manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">As a result, we next turn to a consideration of the applicable common law duty that the assistant prosecutor sought to describe in his charge to the grand jury. As one court has noted, \u201c[t]he problem of establishing the duty to take action which would preserve the life of another has not often arisen in the case law of this country,\u201d <em>Jones v. United States, </em>308 F.2d 307, 310 (D.C.Cir.1962), although it \u201chas evoked considerable study.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>at n. 7. <em>Jones </em>quoted \u201cthe most commonly cited statement of the rule,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>appearing in <em>People v. Beardsley, </em>150 <em>Mich. </em>206, 113 <em>N.W. </em>1128, 1129 (1907):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">The law recognizes that under some circumstances the omission of a duty owed by one individual to another, where such omission results in the death of the one to whom the duty is owing, will make the other chargeable with manslaughter. * * * This rule of law is always based upon the proposition that the duty neglected must be a legal duty, and not a mere moral obligation. It must be a duty imposed by law or by contract, and the omission to perform the duty must be the immediate and direct cause of death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\"><em>[Jones, supra, </em>308 F.2d at 310.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">The <em>Jones </em>court continued as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">There are at least four situations in which the failure to act may constitute breach of a legal duty. One can be held criminally liable: first, where a statute imposes a duty to care for another; second, where one stands in a certain status relationship to another; third, where one has assumed a contractual duty to care for another; and fourth, where one has voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless person as to prevent others from rendering aid. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-12\"><em>Jones </em>itself involved the pre-arranged placement by a mother of her newborn infant into the care of defendant, a family friend who severely neglected and abused the child, leading to its death. Referring to its earlier formulation of the rule, quoted above, the court, in reversing defendant\u2019s convictions due to inadequate jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>instructions, observed that the jury, on retrial, would have to decide whether the mother entered into a contract with defendant for the care of the child or whether the defendant \u201cassumed the care of the child and secluded him from the care of his mother, his natural protector.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It has been noted by one court that \u201cLaFave and Scott, in their work, suggest three other duties: The duty based upon creation of the peril, the duty to control the conduct of others and the duty of a landowner to act affirmatively to provide for the safety of those whom he invites onto his land.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>129 <em>Ariz. </em>347, 631 P.2d 129, 132 (App.1981) (citing LaFave and Scott, <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 26 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In <em>West v. Commonwealth, </em>935 S.W.2d 315, 316-17 (Ky.App. 1996), cited by the State in this appeal, the duty of care was found in a specific statute, while in <em>Commonwealth v. Pestinikas, </em>421 <em>Pa.Super. </em>371, 617 A.2d 1339 (1992), the duty was found in a contract to provide food and medical care for another. <em>Id. </em>at 1341. Finally, in <em>State v. Brown, supra, </em>the duty arose from the special relationship between defendant, who operated a boarding home, and the ninety-eight-year-old resident who died as a result of defendant\u2019s failure to provide special nursing care. 631 P.2d at 132. <em>See United States v. Hatatley, </em>130 F.3d 1399, 1406 (10th Cir.1997) (citing LaFave and Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 3.12, at n. 84 (2d ed.1986)) (defendant had duty to man he helped to eject from car after beating him, and then leaving him beaten and shirtless in freezing weather); <em>State ex rel. Kuntz v. Thirteenth Jud. Dist., </em>298 <em>Mont. </em>146, 995 P.2d 951, 956 (2000) (citing LaFave and Scott, \u00a7 3.3(a)(5) at 288 (1986)) (after defendant stabbed the man she had lived with as husband and wife for six years, she had duty to summon medical assistance for him); <em>State v. Morgan, </em>86 <em>Wash. App. </em>74, 936 P.2d 20, 23-24 (1997) (defendant had statutory duty to render aid to his wife who had passed out from a drug overdose.)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Only one New Jersey decision addressed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-lb prior to its 1997 amendment. In <em>State v. Bass, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 535 A.2d 1 (App.Div.1987), the defendant was convicted of aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>manslaughter arising from the death of his three-year-old daughter following a brutal beating. The child\u2019s mother was similarly charged, and there was conflicting evidence as to which parent inflicted the beating. The mother was convicted in the same trial of murder and related charges, demonstrating the jury\u2019s belief that the mother directly caused the harm while the father was responsible as an accomplice. Of relevance to the present case, the father argued that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that his purposeful failure to stop the mother from beating the child \u201cwas sufficient for a finding of guilt of murder or aggravated manslaughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 535 A.2d 1. We rejected that contention, noting that the jury instruction in fact stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">Ladies and gentlemen, I also instruct you that if only one person committed the acts causing Shawn\u2019s death, the other can be deemed an accomplice to murder if you find that he or she was a natural parent or person having custody or control of the child or who otherwise assumed responsibility for him <em>and </em>that he or she purposely did nothing to stop the beating and did nothing with purpose or knowledge that the beatings by the other would result in Shawn\u2019s death or in serious bodily injury resulting in death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">Moreover, if you find that Renee Nicely caused Shawn\u2019s death but Allen Bass was a father or a person who assumed responsibility for Shawn with the purpose of [sic] knowing that the result would lead to his death or seriously [sic] bodily injury resulting in death, he must be found guilty of murder as an accomplice even if you find that Miss Nicely was not capable of forming the requisite state of mind or did not have the requisite intent to commit murder herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(Emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Finally, we concluded \u201cthat there was sufficient evidence in the record to infer that defendant was the father of [the victim] or at least on that fatal day he had assumed responsibility in part for the care of [the child].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 535 A.2d 1. As a result, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, became applicable, providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">Any person having a legal duty for the care of a child or who has assumed responsibility for the care of a child ... who causes the child harm that would make the child an abused or neglected child as defined in <em>R.S. </em>9:6-1, <em>R.S. </em>9:6-3 and <em>[N.J.S.A.] </em>9:6-8.21 is guilty of a crime of the third degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 provides that cruelty to a child may consist not only in the infliction of corporal punishment and unnecessary mental or physical pain or suffering, but also in \u201cany willful act of omission or commission whereby necessary pain and suffering, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>mental or physical, is caused or permitted to be inflicted on a child.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, defendant had a statutory duty, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1, 9:6-3 and 9:6-8.21, \u201cto prevent [the child\u2019s] painful death.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In support of that conclusion, we cited to <em>State v. Muniz, </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>436, 375 A.2d 1234 (App.Div.1977), <em>certif. denied, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>473, 391 A.2d 488 (1978), a pre-Code case involving two parents convicted of abuse and neglect of their child in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3, in which we concluded that defendant\u2019s conviction could be based on the failure of one parent to stop the assault by the other. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 375 A.2d 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We have discussed <em>Bass </em>at length to underscore its inapplicability to the case under review. As the opinion makes clear, <em>Bass </em>involved a duty to act imposed by statute, not common law. <em>Muniz, </em>for the same reason, and because it did not involve the Penal Code at all, has even less applicability. Thus, we continue our search for the source of the duty sought to be imposed on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">For emphasis, we repeat the pertinent portion of the grand jury instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">The first element the defendant engaged in conduct that caused the victim\u2019s death. That\u2019s the first thing you have to look at. \u201cConduct means an action or omission or a series of actions or omissions. Action means a bodily movement, whether voluntary or involuntary. Omission means the failure to act. The law provides that criminal liability for an offense may not be based on an omission or a failure to act unaccompanied by action unless a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">In this case, the State is alleging that the defendant had a duty to provide emergency medical care for the victim, A.R. He failed to perform that duty, and that failure was a cause of the victim\u2019s death. It\u2019s up to you to determine from the evidence whether there is probable cause that such a duty existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">Insofar as the law of duty is concerned, I instruct you as follows. Generally one has no legal duty to aid another person in peril, even when that aid can be rendered without danger or inconvenience to himself. However, there are situations that give rise to a duty to act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">A person has a duty to act where he has voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless person as to prevent others from rendering aid. For example, a duty to act may be triggered where the defendant takes the victim from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>a place where others might have taken care to prevent injury to her to a private place where the defendant alone is to provide such care. A duty to act may be triggered where the defendant makes statements or engages in conduct that prevents another person from seeking aid to the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">(2) A person has the duty to act when the person is responsible for placing the victim in the position of danger or peril. If the person knows or has reason to know that by his conduct he has caused bodily harm to another [so] as to make her helpless and in danger of further harm, the person is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent such further harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">Additionally, if a person doesn\u2019t act and subsequently realizes or should realize that it has created an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, he is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent the risk from taking effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">As stated above, you must determine whether given the evidence that you have heard regarding the circumstances surrounding A.R.\u2019s drug and alcohol ingestion and her loss of consciousness, the defendant had had a duty to timely provide emergency care for A.R. If you found the defendant did have the duty and then failed to discharge that duty, then you must determine whether the failure to provide emergency care caused A.R.\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The State based this instruction on several provisions of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>(1965), which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">\u00a7 314. Duty to Act for Protection of Others The fact that the actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another\u2019s aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">\u00a7 314A. Special Relations Giving Rise to Duty to Aid or Protect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">(4) One who is required by law to take or who voluntarily takes the custody of another under circumstances such as to deprive the other of his normal opportunities for protection is under a similar duty to the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">\u00a7 321. Duty to Act When Prior Conduct is Found to be Dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">(1) If the actor does an act, and subsequently realizes or should realize that it has created an unreasonable risk of causing physical harm to another, he is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent the risk from taking effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies even though at the time of the act the actor has no reason to believe that it will involve such a risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-15\">\u00a7 322. Duty to Aid Another Harmed by Actor\u2019s Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-16\">If the actor knows or has reason to know that by his conduct, whether tortious or innocent, he has caused such bodily harm to another as to make him helpless and in danger of further harm, the actor is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent such further harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-17\">\u00a7 324 Duty of One Who Takes Charge of Another Who is Helpless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-18\">One who, being under no duty to do so, takes charge of another who is helpless adequately to aid or protect himself is subject to liability to the other for any bodily harm caused to him by</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>(a) the failure of the actor to exercise reasonable care to secure the safety of the other while within the actor\u2019s charge, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">(b) the actor\u2019s discontinuing his aid or protection, if by so doing he leaves the other in a worse position than when the actor took charge of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u00a7 326. Intentionally Preventing Assistance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">One who intentionally prevents a third person from giving to another aid necessary to prevent physical harm to him, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the other by the absence of the aid which he has prevented the third person from giving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Although the dissent is correct that the grand jury instruction did not \u201crecite its special reliance on the Restatement\u201d, the assistant prosecutor conceded at oral argument in the trial court that he was \u201crelying on the Restatement of Torts for the proposition that a duty is created____\u201d Indeed, he specifically cited to and read \u00a7 322, quoted above. It is likewise clear that the judge understood the charge as being based on the Restatement, as reflective of common law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">While no New Jersey case has ever addressed the propriety of the Restatement as a source of legal duty underpinning a manslaughter charge, other jurisdictions have touched on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Levesque, </em>436 <em>Mass. </em>443, 766 N.E.2d 50 (2002), the defendants were indicted for involuntary manslaughter based on their having accidentally started a fire in a vacant warehouse where they were living and then failing to report the fire. As a result, six firefighters died in fighting the blaze. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54. The element of wanton or reckless conduct required for the involuntary manslaughter charge was premised on defendants\u2019 duty to act (to report the fire) under circumstances where an individual fails to exercise reasonable care to prevent the risk he created. <em>Id. </em>at 55-58. Specifically, the court found support for such a duty to act in the principles of \u00a7 321 of the Restatement, even though Massachusetts had yet to recognize \u00a7 321 explicitly as a basis for civil liability. <em>Id. </em>at 56-57. <em>See also Commonwealth v. Marcelli, </em>14 <em>Mass.App.Ct. </em>567, 441 N.E.2d 270 (1982). In <em>People v. Oliver, </em>210 <em>Cal.App</em>.3d 138, 258 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>138 (1989), the defendant was charged with and convicted of involuntary manslaughter resulting from the death of a man whom she met at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>bar, went home with, and aided in injecting heroin into his bloodstream by holding the spoon containing heroin. After he collapsed, defendant had her daughter drag the man out of the house where he was discovered the next morning, dead from a heroin overdose. <em>Id. </em>at 140. The victim was alive when he was taken outside and the defendant\u2019s daughter and friends checked on him during the evening and found that he had a pulse and was snoring. <em>Id. </em>at 140-41. The prosecutor\u2019s theory was that the defendant was criminally negligent when she failed to summon medical aid for the victim and then abandoned him knowing that he needed medical attention. <em>Id. </em>at 141. In upholding the defendant\u2019s conviction, the court found a duty to act flowing from principles expressed in \u00a7\u00a7 321 and 324 of the Restatement. <em>Id. </em>at 142-44. Although no California case in a criminal context had ever applied the duty to take affirmative action to render aid, <em>id. </em>at 143-44, the court was satisfied \u201cthat the rules governing the imposition of a duty to render aid or assistance as an element of civil negligence, are applicable to the imposition of a duty in the context of criminal negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144. <em>See also State v. Brown, supra, </em>631 P.2d at 131; <em>Flippo v. State, </em>258 <em>Ark. </em>233, 523 S.W.2d 390, 393-94 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Only a few New Jersey decisions have addressed the duty to render aid to another. The decisions that have faced the issue have generally done so only in the context of a pre-existing relationship that gave rise to a duty to render assistance. As the court noted in <em>Poole v. Janeski, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 84, 611 A.2d 169 (Law Div.1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">Traditionally, a person is under no duty to protect another person or control that person\u2019s conduct unless a special relationship exists between the two. <em>Restatement (Second) of Tarts, </em>\u00a7 314-320 (1965). Parties will be found to share a special relationship, thus giving rise to a duty, when one person has control of another, when the person\u2019s own conduct has created a perilous situation, or where one has voluntarily taken custody of another so as to deprive him of his normal opportunities for protection. <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 314A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">In <em>Poole, </em>the court found no duty on the part of an automobile driver to ensure that her blind, front-seat passenger utilized a seat belt. <em>Id. </em>at 85-87, 611 A.2d 169. In <em>Praet v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Borough of Sayreville, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>218, 527 A.2d 486 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>681, 532 A.2d 253 (1987), the defendants were police officers who had \u201ca pre-existing duty under the controlling circumstances to render emergency assistance\u201d to a motorist trapped in a burning ear. <em>Id. </em>at 223, 527 A.2d 486. There, we cited the <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 321 to 324A, but only to emphasize that the common law generally \u201cimposes no independent duty of rescue at all and relieves a bystander from any obligation to come forward.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 527 A.2d 486. That rule, however, does not reheve one who has a \u201ccontractual, relational, or transactional duty to render assistance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As noted, the police in that case had, by virtue of their position, a \u201cpreexisting duty of rescue.\u201d <em>Ibid. See Velazquez v. Jiminez, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>240, 262, 798 A.2d 51 (2002); <em>Lundy v. Adamar of New Jersey, Inc., </em>34 F.3d 1173, 1178-81 (3d Cir.1994); <em>Fuentes v. Reilly, </em>590 F.2d 509, 512-13 (3d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\"><em>Praet </em>cannot be read as adopting \u00a7\u00a7 321-22, 324 or 326 of the Restatement. When our courts have seen fit to incorporate Restatement principles into our common law, or to reject or modify them, the decisions have been clear to that effect. <em>See, e.g., Butler v. Acme Mkts., Inc., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>270, 280, 445 A.2d 1141 (1982); <em>Bauer v. 141-149 Cedar Lane Holding Co., </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>139, 144-49, 130 A.2d 833 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">In <em>Endre v. Arnold, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 692 A.2d 97 (App.Div. 1997), plaintiffs decedent, an alcoholic, was staying at the home of the defendant, a long-time friend. <em>Id. </em>at 139-40, 692 A.2d 97. Sometime during the night, the decedent apparently fell down the stairs. In the morning, the defendant saw him at the foot of the stairs but concluded he was \u201cunconscious and in no pain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 692 A.2d 97. Later, she realized that he might be injured and, on decedent\u2019s instructions, called his son rather than an ambulance. After the son, an ambulance was eventually summoned, but decedent died of his injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 140-41, 692 A.2d 97. Plaintiff claimed the defendant had breached a duty to render assistance to decedent, her social guest. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>The law as to the duty a host owes to a social guest who is at peril due to an injury sustained on the host\u2019s premises is not as well settled. We have not been able to unearth any reported decisional law in this slate precisely on point. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that a host has a duty to come to the aid of a social guest who the host knows or has reason to know is in serious physical peril due to an accident that occurred on the host\u2019s premises. The duty, however, only requires the host to give such assistance as the host reasonably can and to take reasonable action to turn the injured person over to those qualified to care for the guest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">More succinctly, \u201cft]he inquiry [as to whether a duty exists] involves a weighing of the relationship of the parties, the nature of the risk, and the public interest in the proposed solution.\u201d <em>Kelly, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 544 [476 A.2d 1219] (quoting <em>Goldberg, supra, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 583 [186 A.2d 291]). Employing that weighing process, we are satisfied that the common law, particularly in light of the special relationship between a host and a guest, imposes on a host a duty to come to the aid of a social guest who has seriously injured himself or herself on the host\u2019s premises even though the injury was sustained through no fault of the host.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 143-44, 692 A2d 97.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Ultimately, we concluded that the defendant had no reason to know her guest had fallen and injured himself in the night, <em>id. </em>at 146, 692 A2d 97, and that when she did learn of his condition early the next morning, any delay in summoning help could not be said to have been a substantial factor in bringing about the guest\u2019s death. Importantly, we never cited the Restatement in the course of our opinion, relying primarily on <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts </em>(5th ed.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Based on our review of these decisions, we conclude that New Jersey has never definitively adopted the common law principles embodied in the several Restatement provisions that formed the basis of the grand jury charge at issue here. Certainly our Supreme Court has not done so. While our dissenting colleague suggests otherwise, based on commendably exhaustive research, we remain unpersuaded that the duty as to which the grand jury was instructed here is so clearly embedded in our civil jurisprudence as to provide a foundation for criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">It is fundamental that procedural due process requires notice and the opportunity to be heard. <em>Avant v.

Notice is the \u201cfirst requirement of procedural due process.\u201d <em>Avant, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 525, 341 A.2d 629. As applied to the criminal law, the principle requires that \u201c[c]riminal statutes should be clear and understandable in order to achieve two goals: notice of illegality and clear standards for enforcement.\u201d <em>State v. Clarksburg Inn, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>624, 632, 868 A.2d 1120 (App.Div.2005). Thus, the \u201cvagueness doctrine sets forth the principle that \u2018the law must \u201cgive the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 868 A.2d 1120 (quoting <em>State v. Stafford, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 15, 837 A.2d 1118 (App.Div.2003) (quoting <em>Grayned v.

Caez, </em>81 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315, 319, 195 A.2d 496 (App.Div.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">It is a consequence of these rules that an indictment must be sufficiently clear to apprise a defendant of \u201cthat against which he must defend.\u201d <em>State v. Spano, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>90, 92, 319 A 2d 230 (App.Div.1973), <em>affd, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>566, 319 A2d 217 (1974); <em>State v. Wein, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>491, 497, 404 A.2d 302 (1979). Yet, it is also settled that a defendant indicted for a particular offense is deemed to be on notice that the indictment may encompass a lesser-included offense, <em>State v. Saulnier, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>199, 205-06, 306 A.2d 67 (1973); permit conviction as an accomplice even if the indictment alleges that defendant is a principal, <em>State v. Mancine, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>232, 256-59, 590 A2d 1107 (1991); or even, in some circumstances, allow conviction of an offense not charged at all. <em>State v. Talley, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>385, 389-95, 466 A.2d 78 (1983) (defendant charged with robbery could be convicted of theft by deception in light of consolidation of theft offenses and defendant\u2019s own testimony). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>See also State v. Branch, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>317, 324-25, 714 A.2d 918 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Against this background, we conclude that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-lb(2), to the extent that it seeks to incorporate principles derived from civil common law, does not provide sufficient notice to satisfy prevailing standards of constitutionally adequate procedural due process. Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the purported common law duty incorporated into the reckless manslaughter charge was based upon provisions of the Restatement that have never, as we have noted, been unequivocally adopted in our State. In any event, even if we were to agree with the dissent that a basis for these principles may be gleaned from our civil common law, the question remains whether those civil duties may be imported into the criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">It is a maxim that ignorance of the law is no defense. <em>State v. Western Union Tel. Co., </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>468, 493-94, 97 A.2d 480, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>346 <em>U.S. </em>869, 74 <em>S.Ct. </em>124, 98 <em>L.Ed. </em>379 (1953); <em>see also In the Matter of Two Seized Firearms, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>84, 88, 602 A 2d 728 (1992). That precept reflects the legal fiction that all persons are presumed to know the law. <em>See generally, </em>Lon L. Fuller, <em>Legal Fictions </em>(1967). But it stretches that fiction too far to put a defendant on notice that the prohibition against his conduct is to be found in emanations from a scholarly treatise that has never made its way into New Jersey substantive criminal law, and perhaps not into our civil law either. We fail to see how these civil common law principles could provide adequate notice to justify a criminal charge. A duty of care, upon which a duty to act is premised, must be so firmly established as to be beyond controversy or dispute if it is to provide presumed notice. In this case, the duty charged to the grand jury was based on amorphous concepts of the Restatement, as reflected in some civil cases, and thereby failed the fundamental test of due process notice. As his attorney argued, defendant could not have fairly \u201cbeen on notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>that that was the law on that evening.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is not sufficient that defendant might be held civilly accountable for A.R.\u2019s death. It is his criminal responsibility that is at issue and different rules guide that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We may all agree that defendant\u2019s actions, if true, were contemptible. But a general sense of outrage, that the defendant violated \u201cthe code of moral conduct,\u201d <em>Szabo v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., </em>132 <em>N.J.L. </em>331, 333, 40 A.2d 562 (E. &amp; A.1945), cannot substitute for adequate notice that the conduct may have penal consequences. We cannot equate \u201cimmorality with criminality.\u201d <em>State v. Cohen, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>1, 11, 158 A.2d 497 (1960) (Weintraub, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In light of our disposition we need not address defendant\u2019s alternative argument, adopted by the motion judge, that the grand jury charge improperly incorporated a negligence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">While we do not lightly set aside an indictment, <em>State v. Morrison, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>2, 12-13, 902 A.2d 860 (2006), and while \u201cmere incomplete or imprecise legal interpretations will not warrant dismissal of the indictment,\u201d <em>State v. Laws, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 563, 621 A.2d 526 (App.Div.1993), a patently \u201cincorrect statement of the law,\u201d <em>State v. Ball, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 120, 632 A.2d 1222 (App.Div.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>142, 661 A.2d 251 (1995), does impair the integrity of the proceedings to such an extent that dismissal is required. Here, the prosecutor could have given the grand jury a very general instruction on reckless manslaughter, and \u201choped for the best.\u201d However, and quite commendably, he placed before the grand jury his theory as to defendant\u2019s duty, which would, we assume, be the same legal position adopted at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Having done so, we are unable to see how the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>could not, in these circumstances, have been substantially motivated to return the indictment based on these instructions, which we have concluded were erroneous. It is no answer to say that the evidence before the grand jury was sufficient to support an indictment on some other theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Of course, the State is free to re-present the manslaughter charge to the grand jury without reference to the Restatement principles we have discussed. Thus, the State could argue, for example, as it did in the motion court, that defendant\u2019s actions were \u201cas much conduct as [they were] an omission,\u201d a view seemingly endorsed by the dissent. We express no view on whether any such indictment would be legally or factually sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\"> One of A.R.\u2019s friends testified that she knew A.R. was menstruating on the night in question. She claimed that, knowing A.R., she did not believe A.R. would engage in consensual sex while menstruating.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\"> As counsel also argued, if the State\u2019s position were accepted, at trial the judge would \"have to give all the defense instructions that emanate out of the Restatement of Torts Second to this jury and tell them that it is the criminal law of the State of New Jersey.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\"> The prosecutor adopted a sound course by submitting his theory to be tested at the indictment stage, rather than waiting until trial and, if there were a conviction, an eventual appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b611-7\">LIHOTZ, J.T.C.</author>\n<p id=\"AjM\">(temporarily assigned), concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">I am in accord with the majority\u2019s legal reasoning and conclusion rejecting the trial court\u2019s determination that the 1997 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-lb eliminated civil, common law principles as a source of defining when a duty to act arises, the failure of which may result in criminal liability. I also agree that the purpose of the amendment was to enhance the omissions covered to now include statutorily defined duties \u201cintended to protect the public safety or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>in addition to those originally intended by the Code prior to the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">However, I part company with the majority\u2019s determination to dismiss the second-degree reckless manslaughter indictment and its reasoning that the charge relied on the definition of duty as recited in various sections of the <em>Restatement (Second) Torts </em>(1965), which have never been definitively adopted by our courts. While the majority correctly notes there is no reported New Jersey case \u201caddressing] the propriety of using the Restatement as a source of defining legal duty underpinning a manslaughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>charge,\u201d I cannot accede to its narrowly-tailored interpretation that the statute\u2019s incorporation of common law, renders <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-lb so constitutionally vague that it fails to sufficiently apprise defendant of \u201cthat against which he must defend.\u201d <em>State v. Spano, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>90, 92, 319 A.2d 230 (App.Div.1973), <em>aff'd, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>566, 319 A.2d 217 (1974); <em>State v. Wein, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>491, 497, 404 A.2d 302 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the indictment for reckless manslaughter is based solely on an omission. The question of whether defendant owed a duty to A.R. is intertwined with the issue of causation, requiring an analysis of defendant\u2019s actions as well as his omissions. Defendant\u2019s failure to provide emergency medical care for A.R. was the last event in a course of conduct that must be viewed in its entirety when examining whether a duty existed and whether the indictment should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The majority\u2019s conclusion focuses on the Restatement, stating: \u201cNew Jersey has never definitively adopted the[] common law principles embodied in the several Restatement provisions that formed the basis of the grand jury charge.\u201d This ignores our State\u2019s acceptance that the legal concept of duty is based on the underlying common law principles that form the \u201cnatural responsibilities of social living and human relations\u201d recognized by reasonable men, <em>Wytupeck v. Camden, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>450, 462, 136 A.2d 887 (1957), which are also reflected in the Restatement. Contrary to the majority\u2019s inference, the State did not recite its specific reliance on the Restatement to define when a duty arises. Rather, the charge to the grand jury presented principles of law expressed in past court decisions that are also reflected in the Restatement. This distinction is important because it is the common law, as reinforced by our court decisions, that provides sufficient notice to a defendant that a failure to act may be culpable when defining the limits of omission liability. Thus, if a person has a duty to prevent a harm but fails to do so, he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>shall be punished the same as one who affirmatively acts to cause such harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The imposition of criminal liability for the failure to act to perform a duty \u201cimposed by law,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-lb, without question includes a duty arising from civil common law. II <em>The New Jersey Penal Code, Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission </em>39 (1971). A pre-Code example where the \u201cmere act of omission\u201d had been held to be \u201cso criminal or culpable as to be the subject of an indictment for manslaughter\u201d based upon common law is found in <em>State v. O\u2019Brien, </em>32 <em>N.J.L. </em>169, 171-72 (N.J.Sup.Ct.1867). There, the defendant, a railway switch operator, negligently failed to adjust the switch, causing a passenger train to a side rail off the track, resulting in one passenger\u2019s death. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant was indicted and convicted on manslaughter, based on his omission, or the failure to perform his duty of adjusting the switch. On appeal, the defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed. The adoption of our Penal Code incorporates such common law legal duty concepts so that the existence of a legal duty accompanied by the knowledge of facts requiring the need to avert further harm imposes criminal liability for failing to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The question of whether a duty exists has been largely a question of fairness. <em>Kelly v. Gwinnell, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>538, 544, 476 A.2d 1219 (1984). \u201cThe inquiry involves a weighing of the relationship of the parties, the nature of the risk, and the public interest in the proposed solution.\u201d <em>Goldberg v. Housing Authority of Newark, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>578, 583, 186 A.2d 291 (1962); <em>see also Wang v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>2, 15, 592 A.2d 527 (1991); <em>Lombardo v. Hoag, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>36, 48-49, 634 A.2d 550 (App.Div.1993). In <em>Wytupeck, supra, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>at 461, 136 A.2d 887, the Supreme Court discussed duty, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">\u201cDuty\u201d is not an abstract conception; and the standard of conduct is not an absolute. Duty arises out of a relation between the particular parties that in right reason and essential justice enjoins the protection of the one by the other against what the law by common consent deems an unreasonable risk of harm, such as is reasonably foreseeable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Supreme Court has also quoted <em>Heaven v. Pender, </em>11 <em>Q.B. </em>503, 509 (1883), when describing the general common law duty of care resulting in tort liability for its breach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\u201cWhenever one person is placed by circumstances in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense who did think would at once recognize that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct with regard to those circumstances he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid 'such danger.\u201d <em>[Collopy v. Newark Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>29, 32, 141 A.2d 276 (1958) (quoting <em>Heaven, supra, </em>11 <em>Q.B. </em>at 509).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">As the prosecutor correctly explained to the grand jury, \u201cone has no legal duty to aid another person in peril, even when that aid can be rendered without danger or inconvenience to himself.\u201d <em>See Velazquez v. Jiminez, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>240, 262-63, 798 A.2d 51 (2002); <em>Endre v. Arnold, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 145, 692 A.2d 97 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>27, 695 A.2d 670 (1997); <em>Praet v.

Adamar of N.J., </em>34 F.3d 1173, 1178-79 (3d Cir. 1994). The rule, however, is not without exception and liability rests on those who, at the time of their omission, were under a \u201clegal duty\u201d to act. Oftentimes, such exceptions creating enforceable duties are aimed at preserving life.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Liability for non-action has been extended when the parties have a \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d <em>Poole v. Janeski, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 84, 611 A.2d 169 (Law Div.1992). The duty to render assistance results from \u201crelationships characterized as contractual, relational, or transactional.\u201d <em>Praet, supra, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 224, 527 A.2d 486 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 321 to 324A of Restatement); <em>see Endre, supra, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 143, 692 A.2d 97 (citing \u00a7 314A of Restatement); <em>Poole, supra, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84, 611 A.2d 169 (Good Samaritan Act does not confer immunity on one who has a preexisting duty to render emergency assistance, citing \u00a7\u00a7 314 and 320 of Restatement); <em>Szabo v. Pennsylvania R.R.

Arnold </em>resolved the question of the legal duty of a social host to exercise reasonable care to render aid to an injured guest. 300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 143-45, 692 A2d 97. In <em>Endre, </em>the decedent fell down a flight of stairs, in the defendant\u2019s home, while intoxicated. <em>Id. </em>at 140-41, 692 A.2d 97. Employing the \u201cweighing process\u201d recited in <em>Goldberg, </em>we stated that \u201cthe common law, particularly in light of the special relationship between a host and a guest, imposes on a host a duty to come to the aid of a social guest who has seriously injured himself or herself on the host\u2019s premises even though the injury was sustained through no fault of the host.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 692 A.2d 97. We determined further that the duty is \u201ccircumscribed,\u201d requiring \u201cnothing more than reasonable care under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 692 A.2d 97. Our ruling, finding no liability on the part of the defendant, turned on the failure to establish proximate cause, a problem not presented in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Here, the facts demonstrate a social guest/host relationship; A.R. and others gathered in defendant\u2019s basement where they \u201cdrank beer and played guitar.\u201d Defendant and A.R. knew each other and, in the past, had been intimate. Defendant was aware that A.R. was a minor and she had purchased drugs from him on prior occasions. Finally, defendant escorted A.R. from the basement, upstairs to his bedroom, separating her from her other companions. A.R. became unconscious and in need of medical attention as a result of a drug used while alone with defendant. Defendant\u2019s duty to assist A.R. was triggered once A.R. lapsed into unconsciousness. The exigencies of the situation presented called for medical attention at the earliest possible moment, action which I suggest would have been \u201creasonable under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Next, the grand jury charge addressed liability imposed upon one who voluntarily assumes care of another and then fails to act. The charge to the grand jury stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>A person has a duty to act where he has voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless person as to prevent others from rendering aid. A duty to act may be triggered where the defendant makes statements or engages in conduct that prevents another person from seeking aid to the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Flowing from the common law concept that one who voluntarily undertakes an obligation to perform emergency assistance may be liable for failure to do so, <em>see Praet, supra, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 224, 527 A.2d 486, this section of the charge is aimed at action, not merely omission. Section 314A(4) of the Restatement recites this duty as we noted in <em>Anslinger v. Martinsville Inn, Inc., </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>525, 535-36, 298 A.2d 84 (App.Div.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>334, 301 A.2d 449 (1973) (liability determination turned on finding that defendants\u2019 were not volunteers responsible for intoxicated colleague). <em>See also McIntosh v. Milano, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 483-84, 403 A.2d 500 (Law Div.1979); <em>Poole, supra, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84, 611 A.2d 169. The duty to rescue arises when the actor assumes total control of the victim who is rendered helpless by the actor\u2019s conduct or when the victim is in the rescuer\u2019s sole custody without access to alternative rescuers. <em>See Fuentes v. Reilly </em>590 F.2d 509, 513 (3d Cir.1979) (concluding New Jersey would impose civil duty on truck driver to summon medical aid for injured motorcyclist who collided with truck; citing \u00a7 322 of Restatement); <em>see also Cooper v. Hutchinson, </em>184 F.2d 119, 123 (3d Cir.1950) (\u201crights may be acquired by one from action by another, even though that action could not be legally demanded[,]\u201d citing \u00a7\u00a7 323-325 of Restatement).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The relationship between the parties, coupled with the actor\u2019s control of the helpless victim, has resulted in a finding of a duty to act in several cases. <em>See J.S. v. R.T.H., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>330, 338-39, 714 A.2d 924 (1998) (wife has legal duty to warn children of husband\u2019s potential for sexual abuse); <em>Duda v. Gaines, </em>12 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 328, 79 A.2d 695 (App.Div.1951) (teacher/coach had duty to render medical aid to ill student/athlete); <em>Szabo, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 333, 40 A.2d 562 (employer has duty to render medical aid to sick or injured employee); <em>see also Lundy, supra, </em>34 F.3d at 1178-79 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>(casino has duty to summon medical aid to patron suffering heart attack).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Overall, I believe these principles are firmly rooted in our civil law and see no due process barrier in adopting such longstanding principles to define a legal duty in the context of prescribing the limits of criminal liability for failure to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The final portion of the grand jury charge relates to the question of causation; that is, the precipitating factor in causing A.R.\u2019s death was the lack of immediate, necessary medical aid when she lapsed into unconsciousness after ingesting additional methadone. Duty is defined by the causal relationship between defendant\u2019s failure to act and harm suffered. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">A person has the duty to act when the person is responsible for placing the victim in the position of danger or peril. If the person knows or has reason to know that[,] by his conduct!,] he has caused bodily harm to another[,J as to make her helpless and endanger or further harm, the person Is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent such further harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Application leads to the conclusion that when the failure to act is inconsistent with the common expectation that one would act to prevent an unreasonable risk of harm he created and, but for that omission, the harm would not have resulted, a legal duty to act was triggered. <em>See Wytupeck, supra, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>450, 461, 136 A.2d 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Equally important, in this case, is the fact that defendant is not an innocent bystander, but an active participant. Defendant knew the risk of harm facing A.R. because defendant had previously explained to Smith, defendant\u2019s methadone supplier, that the drug was addictive and should not be taken with alcohol. Defendant sold A.R. methadone tablets and supplied her beer. Defendant then escorted A.R., whose pupils were almost fully dilated, to his bedroom where additional drugs were consumed, after which A.R. became unconscious and was slumped-over on defendant\u2019s bed. Defendant locked the bedroom and basement doors to prevent intrusion by others, and defendant did not respond to the request of others to speak with A.R. Defendant continued A.R.\u2019s isolation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>from her companions when she was helpless and in need of aid. These affirmative actions must be viewed in context with the omission to provide A.R. medical attention. The medical examiner concluded that A.R.\u2019s chance of survival would have increased had medical attention been summoned when A.R. first lost consciousness between 4:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. Defendant believed the methadone was the cause of AR.\u2019s inability to. breathe, but nevertheless actively resisted summoning 911 for over twelve hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Viewing the evidence and the rational inferences drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the grand jury could reasonably believe that a crime occurred and that the defendant committed it. <em>See State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 459, 236 A.2d 385 (1967). The indictment should not be disturbed as it is not manifestly deficient or palpably defective. <em>State v. Morrison, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>2, 12-13, 902 A.2d 860 (2006); <em>see also State v. Laws, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 562-63, 621 A.2d 526 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>475, 634 A.2d 523 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Accordingly, while concurring with some of the premises informing the majority\u2019s approach, I respectfully dissent from the conclusion it has reached.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
