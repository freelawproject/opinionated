After reviewing the record in light of the contentions advanced on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">The parties were involved in a long-term, intimate relationship. The parties met in September 1983 when plaintiff, then twenty-three years old, began working for defendant, then fifty-one years old, as a receptionist in the office he maintained for his medical practice as an ophthalmologist. After several months, their rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>tionsMp became intimate. Plaintiff was aware that defendant was married, but he told her the marriage was not a happy one and that he would be getting a divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">During the entire course of their relationship, plaintiff never socialized with defendant\u2019s family with the exception of once having dinner with defendant\u2019s son. Early in their relationship defendant began paying plaintiffs telephone bill and giving her money to purchase groceries for the dinners she would cook for the two of them. In 1988 plaintiff moved into Manhattan, and defendant paid one-half of her rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Plaintiff worked in defendant\u2019s office for approximately nine years. Even after the employment relationship ended, she would help when needed with office-related tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">By 1993 plaintiff was annoyed that defendant had not obtained a divorce, and she relocated to Connecticut and for a few months took care of her own expenses. She then returned to New York City, and defendant resumed paying all of her expenses. They went on several vacations together, both foreign and domestic, for which defendant paid. During the course of this relationship, defendant paid plaintiffs tuition and related expenses to obtain her college degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Late in 1994, when defendant had still not obtained a divorce, plaintiff moved to Seattle. She did not have a job, and defendant continued to pay her expenses. Plaintiff remained in Seattle for two and one-half years, and defendant visited her six or seven times. Plaintiff testified that in the summer of 1997 defendant promised her that he would buy her a home, continue working on getting a divorce, provide her with financial support and have a baby with her. She then returned to the east coast where defendant rented an apartment for her in North Bergen. Defendant paid all the expenses in connection with that apartment, which he ultimately purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">In the spring of 2003 the parties began to attempt to have a child together. Their efforts, however, were not successful, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>plaintiff learned that she would not be able to conceive a child naturally because her fallopian tubes were blocked. They began to discuss the possibility of invitro fertilization, but in August 2003 defendant, by then more than seventy years old, told plaintiff that he did not wish to have another child and that he did not wish to see her anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The ending of the relationship has resulted in protracted litigation between the parties. This is the second time they have appeared before us. In <em>L\u2019Esperance v. Devaney, </em>No. A-0286-04T1, 2005 <em>WL </em>3092849 (N.J.Super.App.Div. Nov. 21, 2005), we affirmed a trial court order granting defendant possession of the condominium which defendant had purchased but in which plaintiff had resided for more than seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">After defendant filed that ejectment action, plaintiff filed a palimony suit, based upon promises she alleged defendant had made to her during the course of their twenty-year relationship. Plaintiff appeals from the order entered by the trial court in defendant\u2019s favor after a six-day bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">New Jersey has, in a series of cases, recognized a cause of action for palimony, based upon promises of support made by one party to the other in the context of a relationship between unmarried partners. <em>In re Estate of Roccamonte, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>381, 808 A.2d 838 (2002); <em>Kozlowski v. Kozlowski, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>378, 403 A.2d 902 (1979); <em>McDonald v. Estate of Mavety, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>347, 891 A.2d 1218 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>79, 899 A.2d 302 (2006); <em>Levine v. Konvitz, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 890 A.2d 354 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>607, 897 A.2d 1061 (2006). Each of these cases involved promises of continued financial support between parties who cohabited with one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The record, here, however, is abundantly clear that these parties never cohabited with one another. Defendant continued to reside with his wife in his apartment in Manhattan throughout his entire relationship with plaintiff, and from the time in 1997 when he purchased the apartment in North Bergen until he filed his ejectment action in 2004, he spent less than ten nights there.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Plaintiff does not deny that the parties never cohabited with one another. She seeks to fill that legal gap by pointing to the couple\u2019s attempt to have a child together. This, she contends, demonstrates that their relationship was sufficiently akin to a marriage as to warrant our enforcing the promises she maintains defendant made to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We are unable to agree. Judge Fuentes set forth in <em>Levine v. Konvitz </em>the policy rationale behind the law\u2019s insistence on cohabitation as a necessary element to a cause of action for palimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">Although the quality, nature, and extent of the consideration sufficient to sustain a palimony action may differ depending on all the circumstances, we are satisfied that the rendering of such consideration must be done in a setting of cohabitation. Without such a bright-line requirement^ the concept of \u201cmarital-type\u201d relationship is unacceptably vulnerable to duplicitous manipulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">Requiring cohabitation as an element of a palimony action also provides a measure of advance notice and warning, to both parties to a relationship, and to their respective family members, that legal and financial consequences may result <em>from </em>that relationship. In this context, cohabitation requires the demonstrable act of setting up a household together. Thus, in contrast to an extramarital affair, even a long-term one, cohabitation announces to the ones most affected by the existence of the relationship, the innocent spouse and dependent children, that defendant has entered into a relationship that may result in significant and long-term impairment of family assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\"><em>[Levine </em>v <em>Konvitz, supra, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 10-11, 890 A.2d 354.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The trial judge at the end of these proceedings placed an oral opinion on the record in which she carefully analyzed the elements of plaintiff\u2019s claim and correctly recognized that absent cohabitation, plaintiffs cause of action could not succeed. Within that opinion, the trial judge also took note of each of the appropriate factors in connection with plaintiff\u2019s application for counsel fees and explained how those factors bore upon her final determination that neither side should receive counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">We are satisfied the order under review should be affirmed substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Maureen B. Mantineo in her oral opinion of August 31,2005.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
