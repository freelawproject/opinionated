(Lira Capital). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The essential facts are not in dispute. Defendant Charles Perez secured a car loan from plaintiff First Atlantic Federal Credit Union (First Atlantic) and granted First Atlantic a security interest in a vehicle that was subsequently damaged in an accident and deemed a total loss. As a result, Perez\u2019s auto insurance carrier, Allstate of New Jersey Insurance Company (Allstate), issued a check directly to Perez in the amount of $4,221.96 in satisfaction of his claim under his policy. The check was jointly payable to Perez \u201cand First Atlantic FCU\u201d and drawn on Allstate\u2019s account with BOA. Perez thereafter presented the check to Lira Capital d/b/a United Check Cashing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, which cashed the check without the endorsement of First Atlantic as co-payee and gave the proceeds to Perez.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">First Atlantic then sued Perez and BOA to recover the proceeds of the check, alleging that Perez had deposited the cheek into his account at BOA and that BOA had negotiated the check without the proper endorsement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> BOA in turn filed a third-party complaint against Lira Capital as the cashing agent,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>other things, that Lira Capital breached the presentment warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), Title 12A of the Revised Statutes of New Jersey, and violated the Fraudulent Transfer Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>22:2-20 to \u2014 34. Lira Capital answered, asserting fifteen affirmative defenses and cross-claiming for contribution and indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Less than three months later, on October 21, 2005, BOA made a <em>Rule </em>1:4-8 demand that Lira Capital withdraw its answer, claiming it was filed in bad faith,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and demanding that Lira Capital pay the check amount to First Atlantic and pay BOA\u2019s attorney fees. Less than one month later, First Atlantic and Lira Capital settled the dispute on November 16, 2005, and the underlying action was dismissed on March 3, 2006. By letter of November 17, 2005, Lira Capital advised BOA of the settlement and the putative dismissal of the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Despite the settlement, BOA advised Lira Capital that the matter between them was not fully resolved as the issue of attorney\u2019s fees and costs remained outstanding. Thus, BOA sent a second letter on December 19, 2005, again demanding attorney\u2019s fees and claiming that Lira Capital\u2019s encashment constituted conversion. A third demand letter was sent on February 3, 2006, enclosing a summary of BOA\u2019s costs and legal fees in defending the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">When Lira Capital refused to pay BOA\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs, BOA filed a motion for summary judgment on its third-party complaint and for attorney\u2019s fees and costs \u201cpursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>R[ule] 1:4-8 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1.\u201d Lira Capital cross-moved for dismissal of BOA\u2019s third-party complaint. Following a hearing, the court dismissed BOA\u2019s third-party complaint with prejudice, finding that because Lira Capital \u201cmade good\u201d on the check, BOA suffered no damages under the UCC; that there was no unjust enrichment, and no indemnification or contribution was necessary; and that there was no fraud and therefore no violation of the Fraudulent Transfer Act. The judge also denied BOA\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, finding neither a statutory basis for fee shifting, nor fraud to warrant an exception to the American rule embodied in <em>Dorofee v. Planning Bd. of the Tp. of Pennsauken, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 458 A2d 1341 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On appeal, BOA argues that it is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as other \u201cexpenses\u201d resulting from Lira Capital\u2019s breach of the UCC\u2019s presentment warranty, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-208(b); as \u201cdamages\u201d for bad faith conduct under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-103(e); as common law damages where the tort of another forces an innocent third party into litigation; and under the Frivolous Litigation statute and court rule. We reject each of the bases proffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">As a threshold matter, we note that New Jersey strictly adheres to the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d in regards to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Van Horn v. City of Trenton, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>528, 538, 404 A.2d 615 (1979) (\u201cthe prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee from the loser\u201d (quoting <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 <em>U.S. </em>240, 247, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>1612, 1616, 44 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>141 (1975))). Indeed, \u201csound judicial administration will best be advanced by having each litigant bear his own counsel fees.\u201d <em>Gerhardt v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>291, 301, 225 A.2d 328 (1966). Consistent with this policy, attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable absent express authorization by statute, court rule or contract. <em>State of New Jersey, D.E.P. v. Ventron Corp., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>473, 505, 468 A.2d 150 (1983). <em>See also R. </em>4:42-9(a)(7) and (8). And even where expressly provided, \u201cthe narrowness of [the exceptions] ... has always [been] rigorously enforced, lest they grow to consume the general rale itself.\u201d <em>Van Horn, supra, </em>80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 588, 404 A.2d 615. Where there is such express authorization and attorney\u2019s fees are granted or denied, we will not disturb the lower court\u2019s decision unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Furst v. Einstein Moomjy, Inc., </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>1, 25, 860 A.2d 435 (2004); <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 317, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">It is against this backdrop that we view BOA\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees under the Check Cashers Regulatory Act of 1993, <em>N.J.SA </em>17:15A-30 to -52; the UCC; the Frivolous Litigation statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-59.1, and <em>Rule </em>1:4-8; and the common law. We conclude that none of them affords a basis for the relief BOA seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">It appears indisputable that, by taking a check payable to a corporate co-payee and cashing it for the individual co-payee, Lira Capital violated the Cheek Cashers Regulatory Act (Act), which establishes reasonable commercial standards for cheek cashing licensees, and, as a consequence, Lira Capital further violated the presentment warranties contained in the UCC as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Valley National I, supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 425, 427, 875 A.2d 1056. The former requires a check cashing company to secure both the name and federal taxpayer identification number of each payee for each check. <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:15A-44(2)(b) and (c). The Act further provides that no check casher shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">a. Cash a cheek which is made payable to a payee which is other than a natural person unless the [check casher] has on file a corporate resolution or other appropriate documentation indicating that the corporation, partnership or other entity has authorized the presentment of a check on its behalf and the federal taxpayer identification number of the corporation, partnership or other entity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">b. Cash a check for anyone other than the payee named on the face of the check</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>17:15A-47.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Here, no one contests that Lira Capital cashed a check payable to a corporation without having a corporate resolution or other appropriate documentation indicating that the presentment was authorized, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:15A-47(a), or a federal taxpayer iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tifieation number for the corporation, <em>id., </em>or any agent of First Atlantic present when the check was negotiated. <em>Id. </em>Having so violated the Act, Lira Capital became subject to potential revocation or suspension of its license, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:15A-48(a)(l), as well as the imposition of a civil penalty of up to $5,000. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:15A-49(b)(2). <em>See also Valley National (I), supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 425-26, 875 A.2d 1056. However, these are the exclusive remedies available for such violations of the Act. Nowhere does the Act expressly or impliedly provide for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to an aggrieved party. And further on this score, since BOA was neither a \u201cpayee\u201d nor a \u201ccustomer\u201d, it was not a sufficiently aggrieved party with standing to make a claim under the Act against Lira Capital. <em>See Valley National (I), supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 415, 875 A.2d 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">To be sure, BOA may have a right to relief under the UCC\u2019s presentment warranties, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-208(a)(l), which were breached by Lira Capital in this case. In this regard, Article 4 of the UCC governs bank deposits and collections and the conduct of both Lira Capital and BOA as parties engaged in the business of banking. <em>See Valley National (I), supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 417-18, 875 A2d 1056 (Lira Capital as check cashing agent is a \u201ccollecting bank\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-105(e) and BOA is the \u201cpayor bank\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:4-105(c)). The collecting bank warrants to the payor bank that it is entitled to obtain payment on the check on behalf of the payee and that the check has no unauthorized or missing endorsements. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-208(a)(l). Here, of course, First Atlantic\u2019s endorsement was missing and Lira Capital presented the check to BOA without the endorsement of First Atlantic. <em>See </em>U.C.C. Comment 2 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-417, incorporated by reference in U.C.C. Comment on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-208; <em>see also Valley National (I), supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 427, 875 A.2d 1056 (holding that, as a matter of law, failure to comply with the Check Cashers Regulatory Act is a violation of the presentment warranty).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>While BOA may have a right to recover for such a breach under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-208(a)(l), the measure of its damages is limited to the amount paid by the drawee (less the amount the drawee is entitled to received from the drawer) plus expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach of warranty. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-208(b). <em>See also Valley National (I), supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 427, 875 A.2d 1056. There is no express provision for attorney\u2019s fees in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-208(b). And, although UCC Comment 5 to <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-417<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> intimates that \u201cattorney\u2019s fees ... could be granted because they fit within the language \u2018expenses ... resulting from the breach[]\u201d, <em>N.J.SA </em>12A:3-417, UCC Comment 5, that suggestion certainly does not represent the \u201cpractice of th[is] forum[]\u201d, 6A Ronald A. Anderson, <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>(3d ed.1993) at 33, and in fact has been expressly rejected by this court. <em>See Valley National (II), supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 235, 875 A.2d 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Our view is shared by the Third Circuit which concluded that under New Jersey law, attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable for breach of UCC warranties. <em>McAdam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>896 F.2d 750, 775 (3d Cir.1990). There, the court, in interpreting the UCC\u2019s transfer warranties of <em>N.J.SA. </em>12A:4-207(c), concluded that the \u201cvague reference\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:4-207(c) to \u201cexpenses\u201d was an insufficient basis to conclude that the statute expressly authorized an award of attorney\u2019s fees contrary to the general rule, <em>McAdam, supra, </em>896 <em>F.2d </em>at 776, and that UCC Comment 5 was an equally insufficient indicia of the Legislature\u2019s intent to award attorney\u2019s fees. Noting the virtual identity of the \u201ctransfer\u201d and \u201cpresentment\u201d warranty provisions of the UCC, we held similarly with respect to Section 4-208 in <em>Valley National (II), </em>affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of counsel fees to the payor bank, 378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 234, 875 A.2d 953 and its rationale that \u201cif the Legislature had meant to include an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the UCC presentment and transfer warranties, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>have done so explicitly.\u201d <em>Valley National (I), supra, </em>878 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 429, 875 A.2d 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Alternatively, BOA argues that it is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under section 4-103(e) of the UCC, which limits damages to the face value of the item in dispute <em>unless </em>\u201cbad faith\u201d conduct proximately causes \u201cany other expenses\u201d, in which case these expenses may be recovered. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-103(e); U.C.C. Comment 6 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-103. Although \u201c[t]he term \u2018bad faith\u2019 is not defined[,] the connotation is the absence of good faith (section 3-103).\u201d U.C.C. Comment 6 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-103. Thus, BOA argues that under <em>Valley National (I), </em>Lira Capital\u2019s breach of the UCC\u2019s presentment warranty constitutes a failure to conform to reasonable commercial standards which, in turn, is a failure to exercise good faith, 378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 420, 426, 875 A.2d 1056, entitling him to counsel fees as other damages under section 4-103(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">We find this argument unpersuasive. In the first place, the UCC does not expressly allow for counsel fees and we fail to see why the term \u201cexpenses\u201d should be given any broader meaning than the one ascribed for purposes of the UCC\u2019s presentment (section 4-208) and transfer (section 4-207) warranty provisions. Moreover, even assuming the lack of good faith equates to \u201cbad faith\u201d for fee shifting purposes, a proposition to which we do not adhere, the \u201cliability of the bank and some loss to the customer or owner must [still] be established.\u201d UCC Comment 6 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-103. In this regard, the \u201cproximateness\u201d of damages sustained is tested by the rules applied in \u201ccomparable cases\u201d. <em>Ibid. </em>However, BOA points to no ease authorizing an award of attorney\u2019s fees under these or similar circumstances. On the contrary, as already noted, our courts have repeatedly refused to award attorney\u2019s fees in the absence of a specific rule or statute expressly so providing. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 2.13 on <em>R. </em>4:42-9 (2007). Where courts have allowed recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in cases governed by <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(8), they have based that allowance on specific language in the statute providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>for such. <em>Powers v. Union City Bd. of Educ., </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 597-98, 308 A.2d 71 (Law Div.1973), <em>aff'd, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>294, 317 A.2d 373 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>575, 325 A.2d 709 (1974). <em>See, e.g., Kvaerner Process v. Barham-McBride, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 845 A.2d 692 (App.Div.2004) (Construction Lien Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44A-1 to -38); <em>Glen v. June, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>371, 381-82, 782 A.2d 430 (App.Div.2001) (Condominium Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8B-21); <em>Buccinna v. Micheletti, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>557, 562-63, 710 A.2d 1019 (App.Div.1998) (Conscientious Employee Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-5 and -6). Here, the mere reference to \u201cexpenses\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-103(e) hardly qualifies as an exception to our strict \u201cAmerican\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Most significant, however, is the fact that Lira Capital\u2019s alleged \u201cbad faith\u201d has never been demonstrated nor adjudicated as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-103. First Atlantic\u2019s underlying action was settled and subsequently dismissed. BOA\u2019s third-party complaint was also dismissed on Lira Capital\u2019s motion for summary judgment, a decision which operates as an adjudication on the merits, <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(a), and from which BOA has not appealed. Indeed, in dismissing BOA\u2019s third-party complaint, the motion judge expressly found no evidence of fraud and no liability. Thus, having failed to establish any bad faith on the part of Lira Capital, BOA is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees even under its strained interpretation of section 4-103(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">BOA next argues that because it was forced to defend an action by a third party on account of Lira Capital\u2019s tortious conversion of funds, it is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as a \u201ctraditional element of damages.\u201d We disagree. One of the few exceptions to the American rule is that if \u201cthe commission of a tort proximately causes litigation with parties other than the tortfeasor,\u201d \u201cthe plaintiff is entitled to recover damages measured by the expense of that litigation with third parties.\u201d <em>Jugan v. Friedman, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>556, 573, 646 A.2d 1112 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>271, 649 A.2d 1291 (1994) (citing several New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>decisions wherein attorney\u2019s fees were awarded when fraudulent conduct constituted the underlying offense); <em>Dorofee v. Planning Bd. of the Tp. of Pennsauken, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 144, 453 A.2d 1341 (\u201calthough attorneys fees are not ordinarily included as damages in a fraud action, one who is forced into litigation with a third party as a result of another\u2019s fraud may recover from the tortfeasor the expenses of that litigation, including counsel fees, as damages flowing from the tort.\u201d). <em>See also, </em>Pressler, <em>Current New Jersey Court Rules, </em>comment 2.9 on <em>R. </em>4:42-9 (2007) <em>(Rule </em>4:42-9 does not preclude an award of attorney\u2019s fees as a traditional element of damages). In this case, however, although BOA alleges tortious conversion, such a claim has never been proven or adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Rather, BOA\u2019s claim against Lira Capital sounds more properly in breach of the presentment warranty of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-208, for which the UCC provides an adequate remedy. Given the statute\u2019s comprehensiveness, \u201c[c]ourts should be hesitant to improvise new remedies outside the already intricate scheme of Articles 3 and 4.\u201d <em>Girard Bank v. Mount Holly State Bank, </em>474 <em>F.Supp. </em>1225, 1239 (D.N.J.1979). Indeed, \u201c[ojnly in very rare instances should a court upset the [UCC\u2019s] legislative scheme of loss allocation and permit a common law cause of action.\u201d <em>Bank Polska Kasa Opieki v. Pamrapo Savings Bank, </em>909 <em>F.Supp. </em>948, 956 (D.N.J.1995). Simply put, we do not view this matter as one of those \u201cvery rare instances\u201d, particularly where the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees for Lira Capital\u2019s breach of warranty would circumvent the entrenched policy of this State against fee shifting. <em>See Valley National (I), supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 428-29, 875 A.2d 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Lastly, BOA claims entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees under the Frivolous Litigation statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:59-1, and <em>Rule </em>1:4-8. Although the motion judge for some reason did not decide this issue, in the exercise of our original jurisdiction, <em>Rule </em>2:10-5, we conclude that neither source affords BOA the relief it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>To successfully invoke <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1, a party must \u201cprevail\u201d. <em>Fagas v. Scott, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 192, 597 A.2d 571 (Law Div.1991). Even if the matter settles, one party may be deemed to have \u201cprevailed\u201d for the purposes of this statute. <em>Ibid. </em>Similarly, if a complaint is dismissed because it lacks merit, the defendant is deemed to have prevailed and may recover under the statute. <em>Ibelli v. Maloof </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 608 A.2d 440 (Ch.Div.1992); <em>Chernin v. Mardan Corp., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>379, 582 A.2d 847 (Ch.Div.1990). Here, however, BOA\u2019s third-party complaint was dismissed with prejudice as having no merit. Under the circumstances, BOA is not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of recovering attorney\u2019s fees under the Frivolous Litigation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Nor may Lira Capital\u2019s answer and defenses be deemed \u201cfrivolous\u201d for purposes of <em>Rule </em>1:4-8. An assertion is deemed frivolous when \u201cno rational argument can be advanced in its support, or it is not supported by any credible evidence, or it is completely untenable.\u201d <em>Fagas v. Scott, supra, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 190, 597 A.2d 571 (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Evans v. Prudential Property and Casualty Ins. Co., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>652, 559 A.2d 888 (Law Div.1989). \u2018\u201cThat some of the allegations made at the outset of litigation later proved to be unfounded does not render frivolous a complaint that also contains some non-frivolous claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Iannone v. McHale, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>17, 32, 583 A.2d 770 (1990) (quoting <em>Romero v. City of Pomona </em>883 F.2d 1418, 1429 (9th Cir.1989)). Where a party has reasonable and good faith belief in the merit of the cause, attorney\u2019s fees will not be awarded. <em>DeBrango v. Summit Bancorp., </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 227, 745 A.2d 561 (App.Div.2000); <em>K.D. v. Bozarth, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>561, 574-75, 713 A.2d 546 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>425, 719 A.2d 1023 (1998); <em>see also Iannone v. McHale, supra, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29, 583 A.2d 770 (employing a test of objective reasonableness). The nature of conduct warranting sanction under <em>Rule </em>1:4-8 has been strictly construed, <em>Wyche v. Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>554, 560, 892 A.2d 761 (App.Div.2006) (citing <em>K.D. v. Bozarth, supra, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>574-75, 713 A.2d 546), and \u201cthe term \u2018frivolous\u2019 should be given a restrictive interpretation\u201d to avoid limiting access to the court system. <em>McKeown Brand v. Trump Castle Hotel and Casino, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>546, 561-62, 626 A.2d 425 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Here, Lira Capital\u2019s pleading clearly reflects an objectively reasonable belief that the actions of a third party, defendant Perez, were a direct cause of BOA\u2019s putative loss, and thus it was entirely proper for Lira Capital to seek to preserve its defenses and assert its crossclaims for contribution and indemnification. In fact, Lira Capital\u2019s crossclaims and affirmative defenses are explicitly authorized. <em>Metuchen Savings Bank v. Pierini, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>154, 163, 871 A.2d 759 (App.Div.2005) (the UCC does not preclude plaintiffs recovery from the payee who tortiously converted the funds as well as the bank that honored the improperly-endorsed check); <em>County Concrete Corp. v. Smith, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>50, 51, 721 A.2d 34 (App.Div.1998) (same). Moreover, its answer properly held BOA to its burden of proving the third-party claim, <em>S &amp; R </em>Assocs. <em>v. Lynn Realty Corp., </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 364, 769 A.2d 413 (App.Div.2001), lest BOA\u2019s claims be deemed admitted under <em>Rule </em>4:5-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Furthermore, paragraph b of <em>Rule </em>1:4-8 allows avoidance of the attorney-fee sanction where, after given notice and demand pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:5-2, the adverse party withdraws the offending paper within 28 days of service. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Comment to <em>R. </em>l:4-8(b) (2007). Here, although Lira Capital did not technically withdraw its answer within the 28-day period, it settled the underlying action instituted by First Atlantic within 26 days of service of BOA\u2019s written demand and therefore effectively qualified for the rule\u2019s protection. For all these reasons then, BOA was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under either the Frivolous Litigation statute or rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-11\"> Lira Capital is a franchisee doing business under the name of United Check Cashing. United Check Cashing is also the name of the franchisor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-12\"> First Atlantic also sought from Perez the sum of $21,244.77, representing the loan balance plus costs and fees as per the security agreement. First Atlantic never recovered from Perez, as Perez subsequently filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-13\"> BOA also impleaded JP Morgan Chase, where Lira Capital maintained an account. JP Morgan filed an answer, and BOA and JP Morgan subsequently executed a stipulation of dismissal without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\"> BOA\u2019s claim of bad faith was based, in part, on the holding in <em>Valley National Bank v. P.A.Y. Check Cashing, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>406, 875 A.2d 1056 (Law Div.2004) <em>(Valley National I), aff'd, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 875 A.2d 953 (App.Div. 2005) <em>(Valley National II), </em>wherein we held that P.A.Y. Check Cashing d/b/a United Check Cashing, failed to act in accordance with reasonable commercial standards or to exercise good faith in negotiating a check jointly payable to a corporation and an individual without the signature or presence of the corporate payee. In the present case, however, the motion court determined that Lira Capital, although also doing business under the name \u201cUnited Check Cashing\u201d, was not the same party as in <em>Valley National.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b458-5\"> This comment also applies to <em>NJ.S.A. </em>12A:4-208. <em>See </em>UCC Comment 1 to Section 4-208.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
