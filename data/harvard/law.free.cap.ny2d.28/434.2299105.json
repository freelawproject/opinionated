She thereupon applied to the New York City Social Services Department for replacement of the stolen articles, relying on section 131-a(subd. 6) of the Social Services Law which, in part, provides that \u2018 \u2018 a social services official may make provisions for the * * * replacement of necessary furniture and clothing for persons in need of public assistance who have suffered the loss of such items as the result of fire, flood or other like catastrophe\".<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The city agency denied the application and that determination was affirmed, following a hearing, by the Commissioner of the State Department of Social Services. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>was his Mew that \u201c [l]osses due to theft and vandalism are not losses due to catastrophe \u201d such as are contemplated by the statute. In this article 78 proceeding, the courts below reached a different conclusion; the Appellate Division \u2014 Justice McGtvebn dissenting\u2014held that a loss of clothing and furniture due to a burglary is a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d under the statute and remanded the case to the appellant State Commissioner for the purpose of having him determine \u201c the appropriate amount of the grant \u201d to be allowed the petitioner to replace the articles stolen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It appears that the petitioner and her children were housed, following the burglary, in a hotel but the propriety of such housing is not here involved, the only question presented and argued on this appeal being the reach of the phrase, \u2018 \u2018 or other like catastrophe \u201d, contained in section 131-a (subd. 6) of the Social Services Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The statute provides for replacement of necessary furniture and clothing for persons who have suffered the loss of such items \u201c as the result of fire, flood or <em>other like catastrophe\u201d. </em>The loss of those articles to one who has no money with which to replace them might well be deemed a \u2018\u2018 catastrophe \u2019 \u2019. However, our task is to decide not whether a burglary may, in some instances, be termed a \u201c catastrophe \u201d as that word is generally understood but, rather, what the Legislature and the Social Services Department intended when they used the phrase <em>\u20181 </em>fire, flood or other like catastrophe \u201d. Having in mind the maxims, <em>ejusdem generis </em>and <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>it is difficult to conclude that it was the legislative design to include \u2018 \u2018 burglary \u2019 \u2019 within the covering clause employed. Reasonably construed, the phrase, a <em>11 </em>like catastrophe \u2019 \u2019 encompasses only a natural occurrence \u2014 and, in the case of a fire, one that is man-made\u2014but a burglary is far too unlike a fire or a flood to be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">This was, the Commissioner informs us, the precise construction intended by his department in drafting the regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>implementing the statute and it is the meaning consistently accorded the provision in cases before it involving burglaries. It is well settled that the construction given statutes and regulations by the agency responsible for their administration, if not irrational or unreasonable, should be upheld. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Mounting &amp; Finishing Co. </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>294 N. Y. 104, 108; <em>Matter of Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co. </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>308 N. Y. 333, 338; <em>Udall </em>v. <em>Tallman, </em>380 U. S. 1, 16-18; <em>Power Reactor Co. </em>v. <em>Electricians, </em>367 U. S. 396, 408.) As this court wrote in the <em>Mounting &amp; Finishing Co. </em>case (294 N. Y., at p. 108), \u201c statutory construction is the function of the courts <em>\u2018 </em>but where the question is one of specific application of a broad statutory term in a proceeding in which the agency administering the statute must determine it initially, the reviewing court\u2019s function is limited \u2019 <em>(Board </em>v. <em>Hearst Publications, </em>322 U. S. 111, 131). The administrative determination is to be accepted by the courts \u2018 if it has <em>\u201c </em>warrant in the record \u201d and a reasonable basis in law\u2019 (same citation). \u2018 The judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions approved by the administrative body \u2019 <em>(Rochester Tel. Corp. </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>307 U. S. 125,146).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">It is highly unfortunate that burglaries are endemic to many sections of the city and occur in great numbers but such misfortune may not be labeled a \u201c catastrophe \u201d within the sense of the statute and, certainly, to so construe it \u2014 as the agency has\u2014may not be said to be irrational or unreasonable. In fact, to include within the phrase a <em>\u201c </em>like catastrophe \u201d a burglary would require a rewriting of the statute; the courts should not resort to such unwarranted judicial legislation. If there is to be a change in the Commissioner\u2019s construction of the statute, it must be accomplished by legislative amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The order appealed from should be reversed, without costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Judges Scileppi, Bergan, Jasen and Gibson concur with Chief Judge Fuld ; Judges Burke and Breitel dissent and vote to affirm on the opinion at the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Appeal taken as of right dismissed, without costs, upon the ground that the order appealed from does not finally determine the proceeding within the meaning of the Constitution. Motion for leave to appeal granted. Order reversed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\">. The State Department of Social Services has implemented the statute by a regulation which requires replacement of items lost \u201cin a fire, flood or like catastrophe \u201d (18 NYCRR 352.4 (a) (8) [now 352.2 (a) (5) and 352.7 (d) ]) \u25a0\u2014\u25a0 the same language as is contained in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">. The Appellate Division\u2019s order is clearly nonfinal (CPLR 5601; see <em>Matter of Velez </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>28 N Y 2d 898 and, therefore, the appeal, originally taken as of right, is subject to dismissal. However, on the argument, the Commissioner moved the court to grant him leave to appeal pursuant to CPLR 5602 (subd. [a], par. 2). We grant his motion and, accordingly, the case is properly here by our permission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\">. In reaching his determination, Commissioner Wyman relied solely on section 131-a (subd. 6) of the Social Services Law and since, so far as appears from the record before us, the petitioner made no application for \u201cemergency assistance \u201d under that statute\u2019s section 350-j (subd. 2) and its related regulations (e.g., 18 NYCRR 372.3 and 374.4 [a]), we do not consider whether the victim of a burglary is entitled to such relief. It is hardly necessary to add that our decision is without prejudice to an application by the petitioner under that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
