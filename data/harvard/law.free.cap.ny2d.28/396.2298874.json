The commission exceeded its jurisdiction and considered matters which it was not authorized by law to consider. <em>(Matter of Brous </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>304 N. Y. 164.) II. The commission\u2019s rejection was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-6\">Bergan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWY\">The case involves the statutory powers of the Nassau County Planning Commission under the County Government Law (Charter) of that county. The frame of its authority is broadly stated. Jurisdiction is vested over all territory of the county outside cities and villages (\u00a7 1610). The same section requires the approval of the commission for development of any plat for a subdivision of land. The legislative intent is to grant to the commission \u20181 the powers necessary for guiding and accomplishing a coordinated, adjusted and harmonious development of the county, which will * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>best promote health, safety, and the general welfare \u201d (\u00a7 1610, subd. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In exercising its authority to grant or deny approval of a . subdivision under the same section it may consider the impact of the proposed development on adjacent territory and property within its jurisdiction. The fact that portions of the Charter and Beal Property Law are addressed to approval or disapproval internal to the subdivision itself does not negate the broader powers of the commission (see, e.g., \u00a7 1610, dealing with the regulations directed by the board of supervisors as to land \u2018 \u2018 shown on a plat \u2019 \u2019 and \u20181 public places shown upon the plat\u201d, and Beal Property Law, \u00a7 334-a, \u201carea embraced within said map \u201d). These matters are the routine functions of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The commission denied petitioner\u2019s development approval, not because it regarded the plan itself as intrinsically not acceptable but because the project was so located as to create danger to nearby residents in the inadequate approaches to the development from the greatly increased demands to be exerted on the existing approaches. These reasons are set forth in extensive detail in the resolution of the commission which denied approval to petitioner\u2019s plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The grounds may be summarized by saying that the roads through which petitioner would 1 \u2018 channel traffic \u2019 \u2019 are very narrow and \u201cinadequate\u201d to accommodate \u201cthe additional traffic \u2019 \u2019 and in the absence of sidewalks will \u2018 \u2018 increase the hazards to young children \u201d going to school; that the Town of Oyster Bay advised the commission it is \u201cnot feasible\u201d to widen the existing road system without destroying the character of existing residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Finally, the commission found petitioner had created its own problem by purchasing the premises knowing it had no other access and it might have purchased additional land for that purpose from its grantor who had other access. The opinion at the Appellate Division concluded that the commission was without legal power to refuse approval on this ground. The determination <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>was erroneous * * * There is, however, no statutory provision * * * to require improvements on streets outside a subdivision map * * * the respondents clearly exceed their mandate \u201d. (35 A D 2d 211, 212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>But the commission is not limited, in disapproving a subdivision, to an intrinsic evaluation of the subdivision itself. It may consider, among other things, the \u201c safety \u201d and \u201cgeneral welfare \u201d of the county, including adjacent areas. Thus, as a matter of legal power, the commission acted within its jurisdiction. And if it was within its jurisdiction it is not easy to say that its action was arbitrary and without reasonable basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The Appellate Division also concluded there was no \u201c substantial evidence \u2019 \u2019 to support the determination. But there was proof of danger and inconvenience to the adjacent property owners, and although there was proof the other way from the county\u2019s Director of Traffic Engineering the accreditation of evidence was for the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Reasonable men might well feel that the dangers and difficulties imposed on the neighboring territory would balance against the intensive development sought by petitioner. Nor is the commission controlled by the expressed views of a county officer on the question of safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The area is not in an airtight compartment and the commission was required to look at the whole county outside corporate limits <em>(Matter of Wulfsolm </em>v. <em>Burden, </em>241 N. Y. 288; <em>Baddour </em>V; <em>City of Long Beach, </em>279 N. Y. 167, 174; <em>Matter of Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Stds. &amp; Appeals, </em>267 N. Y. 347).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The order should be reversed and the determination of appellant commission confirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Scileppi, Breitel, Jasen and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Order reversed, with costs, and the determination of appellants reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
