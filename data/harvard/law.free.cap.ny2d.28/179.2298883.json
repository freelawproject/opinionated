By long-standing official Insurance Department and Tax Commission interpretation and practice, by title insurance industry practice and by legislative acquiescence and adoption, charges for pre-insurance title examinations have been regarded as \u201c service charges \u201d and not \u201c premiums \u201d and have never been subject to the tax on gross direct premiums imposed by section 187 of the Tax Law. <em>(Mat</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>ter of City Tit.

The long-established official interpretation that charges for pre-insurance title examinations made in connection with title insurance transactions are not \u201c premiums \u201d subject to tax, under section 187 of the Tax Law, should be controlling as a matter of law absent \u2018 \u2018 a clear manifestation of legislative intent to the contrary. \u2019 \u2019 Here the Legislature had actual knowledge of this interpretation apd expressly acquiesced, in it. <em>(Consolidated Edison Co. of N.

Fees which are included in the rate manual filed by the taxpayer with the Superintendent of Insurance are included in the charge to policyholders by the title insurance company for the issuance of policies of title insurance and are therefore taxable as premiums under section 187 of the Tax Law. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>People, </em>47 N.

This appeal, here by our permission, requires us to say whether the tax may be levied on fees charged by the petitioner for title examinations made as a preliminary to the issuance of title insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Respondent Tax Commission, concluding that fees for title examinations, as well as fees for guaranteed searches and abstracts and other searches, were subject to tax, issued an additional assessment against the petitioner for the year 1962 and, after a hearing, refused its request for a refund.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this article 78 proceeding, the Appellate Division agreed with the commission insofar as it imposed a tax on fees for title examinations but modified its determination to eliminate taxes upon charges made for the other services.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">This is, as the petitioner stresses, the first time that the Tax Commission has sought to include charges for title examinations in the <em>\u201c </em>premiums \u201d subject to tax under section 187. Although long-standing interpretation is, as a rule, entitled to weight, it is by no means conclusive and does not preclude or estop a governmental agency from changing its prior interpellation when it appears, upon reappraisal, to have been erroneous. (Cf. <em>Matter of Consolidated Edison Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm:, </em>24 N Y 2d 114, 119; <em>Matter of Campo Corp. </em>v. <em>Feinberg, </em>279 App. Div. 302, 306, affd. 303 N. Y. 995; <em>Matter of Marx </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>286 App. Div. 913, 914; see, also, 31 C. J. S., Estoppel, \u00a7 147, pp. 730-731.) A consideration of past practice and procedure casts light on the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The pre-insurance service in the title insurance field\u2014the title examination by the insurer before it issues a policy\u2014 accounts for about three quarters of the entire cost of the insurance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to 1962, the petitioner and other title insurance companies in the New York metropolitan area filed with the Superintendent of Insurance, pursuant to section 26 of the Insurance Law, an annual statement in which they listed as separate items of income (1) title insurance premiums earned and (2) service charges, including (a) title examinations, (b) guaranteed searches and abstracts and (c) other searches. More specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the statement simply reported as premiums a flat one tenth of 1 <em>% </em>of the face amounts of the policies of insurance issued, the difference between the total fees received for the issuance of title policies and the one tenth of <em>1% </em>of the face amount of those policies being treated and designated as charges for title examinations and other services. This method of computing the premium is historical, stemming as it does from the early days of the Torrens or Land Title Registration Law (L. 1908, ch. 444), which required the aforementioned percentage to be deposited into an assurance fund to protect those who registered real property titles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a consequence, the title companies reported to the Tax Commission, and paid a tax upon, only that portion of fees received by it labeled \u2018 \u2018 premiums \u2019 \u2019 which, as already indicated, amounted to about one quarter of the total charges for title insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">This practice would probably have continued unchallenged but for this court\u2019s 1963 decision in <em>Matter of City Tit. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Ins. of State of N. Y. </em>(13 N Y 2d 686, affg. 16 A D 2d 768, affg. 31 Misc 2d 1012). In that case\u2014which involved a question not of taxes but of regulatory powers of the Insurance Superintendent\u2014the insurer departed from the accepted practice of including charges for title examinations in its manual setting forth the premium rates filed for the Superintendent\u2019s approval. Instead, the City Title Insurance Company\u2019s manual simply recited that its rate was \u201c $1. per thousand it did this on the ground that the title examination portion of the charge was not \u2018 \u2018 insurance \u2019 \u2019 and, accordingly, was not subject to the Superintendent\u2019s jurisdiction. Special Term rejected the insurance company\u2019s position and, in affirming, this court held that the Superintendent had undoubted authority to regulate the total charge for title insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The <em>City Title </em>decision caused the Superintendent of Insurance to review past procedures and, as a result, the Insurance Department and the Tax Commission determined that the cost both of \u201c insurance \u201d and of \u201c title examinations \u201d was taxable under section 187 of the Tax Law. The two departments also relied on section 550 (subd. 1) and section 46 (subd. 18) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Insurance Law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The construction given to the legislation and the determination arrived at were confirmed by the Appellate Division, and we agree with its disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In our judgment, the statutory scheme, found partly in the Insurance Law and partly in the Tax Law \u2014 and the provisions must be read and construed together (see, e.g., <em>Matter of Guardian Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>302 N. Y. 226, 244) \u25a0\u2014\u25a0 supports the conclusion that both the \u201c cost\u201d of title examination and the <em>\u201c </em>premiums \u201d are subject to a franchise tax. Thus, section 187 of the Tax Law mandates a tax on premiums and section 550 (subd. 1) of the Insurance Law includes in its definition of the term, premium \u2019 \u2019, every kind of compensation received as consideration for insurance contracts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Beyond that, the statutory definition of <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>title insurance \u2019 \u2019 necessarily includes title examinations, encompassing not only <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>insuring the correctness of searches \u2019 \u2019 but also the <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>power to procure and furnish information relevant thereto \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">It is not irrelevant to point out that a tax on insurance premiums is analogous to a tax on the \u2018 \u2018 net income \u2019 \u2019 of other types of business corporations (Tax Law, \u00a7 209). If title insurance companies were to be permitted to exclude from their \u2018 \u2018 gross direct premiums \u201d title examination charges \u2014 accounting, as they do, for more than three quarters of the cost and expense of the policy\u2014they would enjoy a large amount of income which would not be taxed. (Cf., e.g., <em>Matter of Guardian Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>302 N. Y. 226, 236, <em>supra.) </em>In consequence, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>companies would escape a fair share of taxes imposed on other types of insurance and noninsurance business corporations for the privilege of doing business in New York (Tax Law, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 209).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">In sum, then, the relevant statutes, as well as their underlying rationale, strongly confirm the Tax Commission\u2019s conclusion that title insurance companies must pay a franchise tax based upon the entire cost of the policy, both the \u201c risk \u201d and the \u2018\u2018 title examination \u2019 \u2019 portions of the premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Breitel, Jasen and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">. It was the commission\u2019s determination that the petitioner was subject to a total assessment of $70,924.08, based on additional unreported premiums of $3,546,204.34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">. The total fee charged for the policy is paid once and for all time, the risk insured against being not the happening of a future event but the uncovering of a past defective condition of title which had escaped detection in the title examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\">. This procedure is still provided for today by section 426 of the Real Property Law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\">. Subdivision 1 of section 550 provides, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\"><em>\u201c \u2018 </em>Premium \u2019 includes all amounts received as consideration for insurance contracts * * * and shall include premium deposits,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">assessments, policy fees, membership fees, and every other compensation for such contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The other provision, subdivision 18 of section 46, recites that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-11\"><em>\u201c \u2018 </em>Title insurance,\u2019 meaning insuring the owners of real property * * * against loss by reason of defective titles * \u2022 * and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">insuring the correctness of searches for all instruments * * * affecting the title to such property, including the power to procure and furnish information relative thereto \u201d.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b220-13\">. Indeed, the policies of title insurance issued by the petitioner, as well as by other companies, actually recite that titles are insured \u201c in consideration of the payment of * * <em>* </em>charges for examination of title and of the premium \u201d,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
