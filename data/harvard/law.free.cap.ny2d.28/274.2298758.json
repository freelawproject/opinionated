The City Court erred in allowing into evidence an admission made by defendant. III. The City Court erred in concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>that the People had met its burden of proof as to each and every element of the crime of driving while intoxicated. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>11 A D 2d 784; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hemleb, </em>4 A D 2d 878.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-5\"><em>Patrick D.

III. Defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not violated in this case by the failure of the police to advise him of the said right prior to requesting him to submit to a blood test and performance tests. <em>(Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.

To the officer\u2019s question, \u201c What happened,\u201d the lone occupant of the car, the defendant before us, replied, \u2018 \u2018 I was going about five miles an hour, and I just couldn\u2019t get around the corner.\u201d He was obviously drunk, his breath being alcohol laden, and his speech \u201cthick [and] slurred.\u201d Upon being arrested and taken to the police station-, the defendant was asked to submit to a blood test. He consented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>to do so, and the test revealed that he was \u2018 \u2018 intoxicated \u2019 \u2019 and <em>\u201c </em>unfit to drive.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was not given the warnings called for by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(384 U. S. 436) \u2014decided a month later, in June of 1966\u2014and he relies on that omission on this appeal from his conviction of driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Miranda </em>(384 U. S. 436, <em>supra) </em>that a person in custody must, prior to being questioned, be informed of certain rights, among others, the right to remain silent and to consult with counsel. In so.deciding, the court made it exceedingly clear that it was intent solely upon protecting a defendant against in-custody <em>interrogation </em>which might lead to <em>testimonial </em>incrimination. Thus, declared the court (p. 439), \u201cwe deal with the admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation and the necessity for procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to incriminate himself. \u2019 \u2019 (See, also, pp. 457-458, 478.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The initial question to be decided, therefore, is whether the withdrawal of blood, in order to ascertain its alcoholic content, and the receipt in evidence of the analysis report violate a defendant\u2019s privilege against self incrimination. The Supreme Court answered that question in the negative in <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California </em>(384 U. S. 757), just a week after it decided <em>Miranda. </em>The petitioner, charged with driving while intoxicated, had refused, on the advice of his lawyer, to consent to a blood test and upon the trial objected to the report\u2019s admission on the ground that the procedure, adopted offended against his due process rights, his privilege against self incrimination and his right to counsel. The trial judge overruled the objection, admitted the report, and, on appeal, the Supreme Court rejected Schmerber\u2019s claims. <em>\u201c </em>We hold \u201d, wrote the court, <em>\u201c </em>that the privilege protects an accused only from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature, and that the withdrawal of blood and use of the analysis in question in this case did not involve compulsion to these ends \u201d (384 U. S., at p. 761). <em>\u201c </em>The distinction which has emerged \u201d, continued the court (p. 764), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>11 </em>is that the privilege is a bar against compelling 1 communications \u2019 or \u2018 testimony,\u2019 but that compulsion which makes a suspect or accused the source of \u2018 real or physical evidence \u2019 does not violate it.\u201d (See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Gursey, 22 </em>N Y 2d 224, 229.) Accordingly, since the blood test proof was neither Schmerber\u2019s testimony nor evidence relating to some communicative act on his part,1 \u2018 it was not inadmissible on privilege grounds \u2019 \u2019 (384 U.S., atp. 765).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">It follows from this conclusion that the defendant before us was not entitled to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Indeed, the Supreme Court in <em>Schmerber </em>went so far as to say that, since the privilege did not encompass or protect against the extraction of blood, there was no denial of his right to the assistance of counsel even though the petitioner Schmerber had objected to the test \u201c on the advice of counsel.\u201d In short, as the court put it, \u201c [sjince [he] was not entitled to assert the privilege * * * [n]o issue of counsel\u2019s ability to assist [him] in respect to any rights he did possess is presented \u201d (384 U. S., at p. 766).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The defendant in the present case neither asked for a lawyer nor objected to the taking of his blood. He now asserts, however, that, because a New York statute gives him a choice whether or not to submit to such a test (Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 1194, subd. I),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it was impermissible to subject him to the test, absent <em>Miranda </em>warnings, without effecting a violation of his right to counsel and his privilege against self incrimination. Although he does not put it in these words, his argument seems to be that, had he been informed of his right, he would have * availed himself of counsel and, had the latter advised against submitting to the test, he would have followed such advice \u2014 even at the cost of losing his driver\u2019s license\u2014in consequence of which the prosecution would have been deprived of the evidence of intoxication derived from analysis of his blood. Therefore, he insists, the failure to give him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings seriously prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The defendant does have a right to counsel, as the Supreme Court observed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(388 U. S. 218, 226-227), \u201cat any stage of the prosecution * * * in court or out, where counsel\u2019s absence might derogate from [his] right to a fair trial.\u201d But no such danger exists in a case such as this. Quite obviously, the presence of a lawyer at the time blood is extracted from his client\u2019s body is not required, to cull further from the <em>Wade </em>opinion (p. 227), to assure the defendant\u2019s \u201cright meaningfully to cross-examine the witnesses against him \u201d\u2014namely, those involved in the pretrial blood test \u2014 \u201c and to have effective assistance of counsel at the trial itself.\u201d Most appropriate here is the court\u2019s statement in <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California </em>(388 TJ. S. 263, 267), with respect to the taking of a defendant\u2019s handwriting exemplars, that there is a \u201c minimal risk that the absence of counsel might derogate from his right to a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Nor does section 1194 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law call for a different result. That statute was designed to enable the authorities to deal promptly and effectively with the scourge of drunken drivers by immediate revocation of their licenses either upon chemical proof of intoxication or upon refusal to take the blood test. This option was provided out of concern by the Legislature \u201c not with those who consented to take the test, but with those who were required to submit.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>307 N. Y. 73, 77.) Accordingly, section 1194 gave \u201c the accused * * * the choice of waiving his right against self-incrimination\u2014 <em>assuming such a right </em>exists\u2014or losing the privilege to continue driving on our highways \u201d (Interim Report of Joint Legislative Committee on Motor Vehicle Problems, Chemical Tests for Intoxication [N. Y. Legis. Doc., 1953, No. 25], p. 26; italics supplied). However, as indicated above, the Supreme Court in its <em>Schmerber </em>decision resolved the problem by holding that one accused of drunk driving may not prevent the State from conducting a blood test. Consequently, there is neither need.nor reason for the presence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gursey </em>(22 N Y 2d 224, <em>supra), </em>upon which the defendant relies, is not to the contrary. We there upheld the Appellate Term\u2019s reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction for driving while intoxicated where he had asked for and been denied permission to consult with his attorney and had submitted to a dr\u00fankometer test only after being told by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>police that he would lose his license if he refused. The <em>Gursey </em>case is distinguishable in that, unlike the one now before us, the defendant had expressly requested, and been denied, an opportunity to talk to a lawyer. We deemed such denial so offensive as to taint the subsequent criminal trial. Moreover, there is a vast difference between a failure to advise or warn a defendant of his rights \u2014 as in the present case \u2014 and a flat refusal\u2014as in Gursey\u2014to afford him \u201caccess to counsel\u201d after he has requested the assistance of a lawyer. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ianniello, </em>21 N Y 2d 418, 425, cert. den. 393 U. S. 827; <em>People </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>9 N Y 2d 571, 574.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We have considered the other points advanced by the defendant and find them without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Breitel, Jasen and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\">. The alcoholic content of the defendant\u2019s blood was found to be \u201c.20 by weight \u201d \u2014 .15 being \u201c prima facie [evidence of] intoxication.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\">. Section 1194 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that, if a person, who is placed under arrest for driving while intoxicated, refuses,'upon request, to submit to a chemical test of his blood, <em>\u201c </em>the test shall not be given, but the commissioner shall revoke his license \u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
