Despite negotiations between the parties on local and national levels, no agreement could be reached on a new contract, and a national strike was called. It began on September 25 and continued until November 10. Involved on the present appeals are GM employees at five New York plants who claim and were awarded State unemployment benefits for various periods during the strike. GM opposes their grant on the ground that they are barred by section 592 (subd. 1) of the Labor Law which suspends an employee\u2019s right to such benefits for seven weeks if his unemployment arises from a \u2018 strike, lockout, or other industrial controversy <em>in the establishment in which he was </em>employed\u201d'. (Italics supplied.) The claimants consist of two groups: (1) those employed at the Chevrolet assembly plant at Tonawanda and (2) those employed at the other four GM plants, which make automobile parts. It is helpful to discuss the facts as to each group separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">When the UAW called the nationwide strike on September 25, picket lines went up around the plant at Tonawanda. Although all of the national issues involved were tentatively settled by October 5, local issues at the Tonawanda plant, and at most of the other struck plants, remained in dispute and the strike persisted. The local differences between the union and GM at the Tonawanda facility were settled on October 26 \u2014 at which time the picketing terminated<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 and, although steps were immediately taken to ready the plant for production, it did not return to full operation until November 2. The Tonawanda employees thereupon filed claims for unemployment benefits for the period from October 26 to November 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Forty-one other plants made parts for other automobile manufacturers, as well as for GM, and no strike occurred at those plants. This reflected a stated union policy to confine the dispute to the UAW and GM and thereby increase pressure on the latter by allowing its competitors to obtain the parts necessary to produce their cars. Among the 41 parts plants mentioned were four in this State, located in Buffalo, Lockport, Rochester and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Syracuse, and the employees at those facilities continued to work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, despite the fact that an attempt was made to operate them at normal production, it soon became evident that this was impossible. Since the strike had closed the GM assembly plants, there was no place to which the great bulk of the output of the parts plants could be shipped. This necessitated curtailing production at those plants and laying off the people working there. They thereupon filed claims for unemployment benefits for the period between layoff and recall.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The Industrial Commissioner granted the requested benefits to all of the claimants, and his decision was upheld, in turn, by the Unemployment Insurance Referee and the Appeal Board. Following the Appellate Division\u2019s unanimous affirmance of the board\u2019s determination, G-M appealed to our court, as of right, on asserted constitutional grounds. Its constitutional argument, briefly stated, is that sanctioning the State\u2019s payment of benefits to the claimants would do violence to the pervasive Federal scheme of labor regulation and, by that token, offend against the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. More particularly, GM maintains that Congress has \u201cpre-empted\u201d the field of labor-management relations in industries engaged in commerce and, consequently, that, by paying compensation in a case such as this, the State \u201c interferes with the \u00ae \u00b0 \u00b0 federally mandated freedom [of management and labor] to mutually exert economic pressure in an atmosphere free of all governmental support \u2019 \u2019.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>In order to ascertain if the question posed is \u201c directly involved \u201d in the present cases (CPLR 5601, subd. [b], par. 1), we look to the situation as it existed at the several plants involved to determine whether, in fact, the payment of unemployment benefits interferes with GM\u2019s ability to bring \u201c economic pressure \u201d to bear on the union. Only if this is so would it be necessary to decide the constitutional contention advanced as a basis for the appeal as of right, namely, that the alleged \u201c interference \u201d improperly thrust the State into a federally pre-empted area.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Certainly, no such question is raised or presented by the decision below that the Chevrolet-Tonawanda employees are entitled to benefits for the period which was necessary to get the plant back into full production after the local issues had been settled. A strike ends when the workers stop striking and not at some later date when, because of the employer\u2019s method of doing business, it is again ready for full production. (See <em>Matter of George </em>[Catherwood], 14 N Y 2d 234, supra; <em>Matter of Acquisto </em>[Catherwood], 25 A D 2d 326, mot. for lv. to app. den. 18 N Y 2d 577.) It follows, therefore, that the unemployment at Tonawanda, after the local issues were settled, was occasioned not by GM\u2019s labor relations policy in connection with a strike but by the manufacturing conditions that there existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">It is equally clear that the unemployment at the parts plants was not the result of a labor-management relations decision. Although GM recognizes that there was no strike at those locations, it contends that there had been a \u2018 \u2018 lockout \u2019 \u2019 or \u2018 \u2018 industrial controversy. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The claim of lockout ignores the fact that the employees were laid off not because the employer utilized an economic sanction to prevent the employees from working but because of lack of work. <em>\u201c </em>A lockout \u201d, it has been aptly said, <em>\u201c </em>is the refusal by an employer to furnish available work to his regular employees. It is apparent that the considerations which fault an employer for refusing to furnish available work are quite different from those which would prohibit him from laying off workers for whom there is no work.\u201d <em>(American Ship Bldg. </em>v. <em>Labor Bd., </em>380 U. S. 300, 321 [per White, J., concurring]; see, also, Baird, Lockout Law, 38 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 396, 397; Rosen, The Evolution of the Lockout, 4 Suffolk L. Rev. 267; Stokes, Nonstoppage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Strikes: Rationale and Review, 20 Lab. L. J. 79.) In other words, <em>\u201c </em>a temporary withholding of the right to work due to lack of work is commonly understood to be a lay-off and not a lockout.\u201d (Rosen, The Evolution of the Lockout, 4 Suffolk L. Rev. 267.) Thus, it is quite obvious that the employer, far from resorting to any so-called economic weapon, sent the men home only because it was unable to go forward with its work.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Nor, as already demonstrated, was there a strike or any other industrial controversy at the parts plants which led to the unemployment. It may be true that were negotiations taking place there with regard to local issues but it was not those negotiations, or any failure to come to agreement, which occasioned the layoff of employees. Rather, since the GM assembly plants \u2014 the primary users of the parts manufactured\u2014were on strike, the employer decided to send the men home. This decision, based solely on the exigencies of doing business, was in no sense a labor relations tactic.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In sum, none of the claimants before us were prevented from working by the employer, by lockout or other device, in order to bring \u2018 \u2018 economic pressure \u2019 \u2019 to bear on the union in connection with the national strike. This being so, the present records do not raise the question whether the payment of unemployment benefits to the employees would interfere with GM\u2019s national bargaining position and thereby improperly intrude into a federally protected sphere. Consequently, the question which GM raises to support an appeal as of right is not involved in the cases, and the respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeals \u2014 initially denied with leave to renew on the argument (19 N Y 2d 690) \u2014must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The appeal in each case .should be dismissed, with costs, on the ground that no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Breitel and Jasen concur; Judge Gibson taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In each case: Appeal dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\">. The national strike, as noted above, continued until November 10, on which date the essential agreement of settlement was signed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\"><em>. </em>The claimants in <em>Matter of Weis, </em>other than the Chevrolet-Tonaw&amp;nda employees discussed above, are employed in the Buffalo, Lockport and Rochester plants. The claimants in <em>Matter of Jones </em>are employed in the Syracuse plant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\">. The basis for this asserted intrusion into the federal sphere is the Appellate Division\u2019s holding \u2014 consistent with our decision in <em>Matter of George (Catherwood) </em>(14 N Y 2d 234)\u2014that this court\u2019s narrow construction of the statute barring benefits to workers whose unemployment is brought on because of a labor controversy \u201c in the establishment in which he was employed \u201d (Labor Law, \u00a7 592, subd. 1)\u2014equating \u201cestablishment\u201d with \u201c\u2018place\u2019 rather than \u2018 enterprise \u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Sierant [Catherwood\u2014Gen.
