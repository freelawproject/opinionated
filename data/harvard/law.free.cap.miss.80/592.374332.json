On the trial certain confessions of the defendant, obtained by the aid of a sweat-box in the manner mentioned in the opinion of the court, were offered in evidence against defendant over his objection. Without the confessions there was not sufficient evidence to support the verdict. From the conviction the defendant appealed to the supreme court, assigning as error the admission of the confessions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-12\"><em>D.

It was summer time \u25a0 when this was done, and the heat must have been terrible to a person so environed. The prisoner was not allowed to have any communication with relatives or friends.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-15\">' During the several days in which the detectives and police officers were hunting the property the chief of the police and the other officers questioned him in regard to the crime. The .chief of police not only did not tell him he did not have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>answer the question, but on the contrary, testified that it was his orders that prisoners should be kept in this sweat-box until they told him what he (the chief of police) thought they ought to tell him. Mark you, not what was the truth, but what the chief thought he ought to be told. The chief of police, having gotten hold of some of the stolen property, told defendant that it was' \u201cbest for him to tell what was right,\u201d that \u201cit was better for him to tell the truth.\u201d Tie also told the prisoner, fresh from the tortures of the sweat-box, that, if he did not quit stealing the white folks would hang him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-6\">If the confession has been extorted by duress or fear, as by threat of violence, or any increased rigbr of confinement, or by any other menace which can inspire dread or alarm, it will be excluded. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State, 31 </em>Miss., 288; 8 Am. &amp; Eng.

Much of the picture is drawn from imagination. The record shows that the apartment called the \u201csweat-box\u201d was simply a small room in one corner of a large room.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-6\">There is a distinction between the confession in this case and the one in <em>Hamilton </em>v. State, Y7 Miss., 6Y5. Hamilton made a confession to his employer, and the officer testified that he supposed the confession was made as a result of the employer\u2019s talk to Hamilton. The relationship between the police officer and the appellant in this case is entirely different from the relationship of the employer and employe in the Hamilton case. Unless the court disregards the testimony of Price relative to the confession being voluntary, it will hold the confession admissible.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b610-7\">Oalhoon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWM\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The chief of police testified that the accused made to him a \u201cfree and voluntary\u201d statement. The circumstances under which he made it were these: There was what was known as a \u201csweat-box\u201d in the place of confinement. This was an apartment about five or six feet one way and about eight feet another. It wa,s kept entirely dark.- Por fear that some stray ray of light or breath of air might enter without special invitation, the small cracks were carefully blanketed. The prisoner was allowed no communication whatever with human beings. Occasionally the officer, who had him put there, would appear, and interrogate him about the crime charged against him. To the credit of our advanced civilization and humanity it must be said that neither the thumbscrew nor the wooden boot was used to extort a confession. The efficacy of the sweat-box was the sole reliance. This, with the hot weather of summer, and the fact that the prisoner was not provided with sole leather lungs, finally, after \u201cseveral days\u201d of obstinate denial, aceom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>plished the purpose of eliciting a \u201cfree and voluntary\u201d confession. The officer, to bis credit, says be did not threaten bis prisoner, that be held out no reward to bim, and did not coerce bim. Everything was \u201cfree and voluntary.\u201d He was perfectly honest and frank in bis testimony, this officer was. He was intelligent, and well up in tbe law as applied to such cases, and nothing would have tempted bim, we assume, to violate any technical requirement of a valid confession \u2014 -no threats, no hope of reward, no assurance that it would be better for tbe prisoner to confess. He did tell bim, however, \u201cthat it would be best for bim to do what was right,\u201d and that it \u201cwould be better for bim to tell tbe truth.\u201d In fact, this was tbe general custom in tbe moral treatment of these sweat-box patients, since this officer says, \u201cI always tell them it would be better for them to tell tbe truth, but never bold out any inducement to them.\u201d He says, in regard to tbe patient, Ammons, \u201cI went to see this boy every day, and talked to bim about tbe case, and told bim it would be better for bim to tell tbe truth; tell everything be knew about tbe case.\u201d This sweat-box seems to be a permanent institution, invented and used to gently persuade all accused persons to voluntarily tell tbe truth. Whenever they do- tell tbe truth \u2014 that is, confess guilt of the crime \u2014 they are let out of tbe sweat-box. Speaking of this apartment, and tbe habit as to prisoners generally, this officer says, \u201cWe put them in there [the sweat-box] when they don\u2019t tell me what I think they ought to.\u201d This is refreshing. Tbe confession was not competent to be received as evidence. 6 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, p. 531, note 3; <em>Id., </em>p. 550, note 7; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>State, 77 </em>Miss., 675 (27 So., 606); <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State, 37 </em>Miss., 288. Defendant, unless demented, understood that tbe statement wanted was confession, and that this only meant release from this \u201cblack hole of Calcutta.\u201d Such proceedings as this record discloses cannot be too strongly denounced. They violate every principle of law, reason, humanity, and personal right. They restore tbe barbarity of ancient and medieval methods. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>obstruct, instead of advance, the proper ascertainment of truth. It is far from the duty of an officer to extort confession by punishment. On the contrary, he should warn his prisoner that every statement he may choose to make may be used against him on his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
