The plaintiffs now appealing are the 13 state agencies to which the defendant employees received four-year term appointments beginning in fall 2002. We agree with plaintiffs that the Commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the cases of 20 of the 27 defendant employees. Accordingly, we vacate the Commission\u2019s order reinstating those 20 employees to their government positions. As to the remaining seven employees, we find that although the Commission had jurisdiction over their terminations, the rule changes authorizing the term positions, promulgated by the Department of Central Management Services (CMS) under Ryan\u2019s administration, were void ab initio because they contradicted the Illinois Personnel Code (20 ILCS 415/1 et seq. (West 2000)). Therefore, we reverse the Commission\u2019s order reinstating those seven employees to their state positions.</p> <p id=\"b371-3\" pgmap=\"371\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b371-4\" pgmap=\"371\">In January and February 2003, Governor Rod Blagojevich fired approximately 60 employees who were appointed by the Ryan administration in 2002 to four-year terms in state government jobs. Most of those positions carried the job title of \u201csenior public service administrator.\u201d Among the employees given term appointments near the end of Governor Ryan\u2019s term were his press spokesman and his deputy chief of staff. Although a number of the employees had lengthy careers in Illinois government and had received favorable performance evaluations and promotions, the record indicates that several of the defendant employees had little or no experience in the area of their term appointment.</p> <p id=\"b371-5\" pgmap=\"371\">1. Hiring Procedures under Personnel Code</p> <p id=\"b371-6\" pgmap=\"371\">To discuss the actions taken by the Ryan administration, it is necessary to review the pertinent provisions of the Personnel Code and the procedures for passing administrative rules under that statute. The Personnel Code establishes for state government \u201ca system of personnel administration under the Governor, based on merit principles and scientific methods.\u201d 20 ILCS 415/2 (West 2000). The Code is administered by CMS and establishes, inter alia, the five-member Civil Service Commission. 20 ILCS 415/3, 7a (West 2000).</p> <p id=\"b371-7\" pgmap=\"371\">Employees subject to the Personnel Code are hired from eligibility lists compiled on the basis of competitive examinations. 20 ILCS 415/ 8b.1, 8b.3 (West 2000). The Personnel Code requires testing to determine if applicants are qualified for certain positions and, if so, to assess an applicant\u2019s fitness relative to other candidates. 20 ILCS 415/8, 8b.1 (West 2000). Qualified candidates are ranked by relative merit, and appointments are made from among the three highest candidates on the appropriate eligibility list or from the highest ranking group if candidates are listed by ranking as opposed to numerical rating. 20 ILCS 415/8b.5 (West 2000). Veterans are given first preference in this appointment process. 20 ILCS 415/8b.7 (West 2000).</p> <p id=\"b371-8\" pgmap=\"371(30) 372(27)\">The Personnel Code states that hired employees are subject to a probationary period \u201cnot to exceed one year,\u201d after which the employee\u2019s appointment or promotion is complete. 20 ILCS 415/8b.6 (West 2000). The Commission can review the termination of an employee who has been \u201cappointed under the rules and after examination.\u201d 20 ILCS 415/11 (West 2000).</p> <p id=\"b372-3\" pgmap=\"372\">2. Overview of Administrative Rulemaking</p> <p id=\"b372-4\" pgmap=\"372\">Although the Illinois General Assembly holds the general legislative power to determine what the law shall be, the legislature can delegate to an administrative agency the authority to execute the law. M. Barker, An Overview of Administrative Law, in Illinois Administrative Law \u00a7 1.2 (Ill. Inst, for Cont. Legal Educ. 1991). The rationale behind such delegation is that the legislature cannot address each particular case and that administrative agencies develop expertise in their respective fields. M. Barker, An Overview of Administrative Law, in Illinois Administrative Law \u00a7 1.3 (Ill. Inst, for Cont. Legal Educ. 1991). The rules and regulations that state agencies promulgate under their respective enabling statutes are passed in accordance with the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act (5 ILCS 100/1 \u2014 1 et seq. (West 2000)) and are compiled in the Administrative Code.</p> <p id=\"b372-5\" pgmap=\"372\">Administrative rulemaking is a three-step procedure, with each step documented in the Illinois Register, a weekly publication of the Secretary of State\u2019s Administrative Code Division. M. Barker, An Overview of Administrative Law, in Illinois Administrative Law \u00a7 1.6 (Ill. Inst, for Cont. Legal Educ. 1991). First, the agency gives notice of a proposed rule, indicating the statute upon which the proposed rule is based and authorized and including a \u201ccomplete description of the subjects and issues involved.\u201d 5 ILCS 100/5 \u2014 40(b)(3) (West 2000). At this stage, known as the \u201cfirst notice\u201d period, members of the public can comment and request a public hearing. 5 ILCS 100/5 \u2014 40(b)(5) (West 2000). At the end of the first notice period, the agency submits the proposal and additional information to the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR), a bipartisan, bicameral legislative support services agency composed of members of the General Assembly. 5 ILCS 100/5 \u2014 90 (West 2000).</p> <p id=\"b372-6\" pgmap=\"372\">When notice to JCAR is complete, the second step of the administrative rulemaking process begins, known as the legislative review period or the \u201csecond notice\u201d period. During this stage, JCAR reviews the second notice and can file a certification of no objection to the proposed rule or a statement objecting to or prohibiting the filing of the proposed rule. 1 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 220.1000 (1994). JCAR also can recommend that the agency pursue further action.</p> <p id=\"b372-7\" pgmap=\"372(34) 373(92)\">The third and final step in the administrative rulemaking process is the rule\u2019s adoption. If the agency has received a certification of no objection from JCAR or has responded to a statement of objection from JCAR, the agency may file the proposed rulemaking for adoption. 1 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 220.1100 (1994). If the agency has refused to modify a proposed rule, the agency must notify JCAR in writing of that response and submit a notice of refusal to meet the committee\u2019s objection for publication in the Illinois Register. R. Kane, Specific Rulemaking Procedures in Illinois, in Illinois Administrative Law \u00a7 5.31 (Ill. Inst, for Cont. Legal Educ. 1991) (noting that JCAR \u201croutinely introduces legislation based on an agency\u2019s refusal to meet objections\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b373-3\" pgmap=\"373\">3. Amendments Proposed by CMS in 2002 Under Ryan Administration</p> <p id=\"b373-4\" pgmap=\"373\">CMS is the administrative agency charged with making rules to effectuate the Personnel Code\u2019s general provisions. 20 ILCS 415/8 (West 2000). In July 2002, CMS gave first notice of its proposals to amend the Administrative Code. In describing the \u201csubjects and issues involved,\u201d the notice stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b373-5\" pgmap=\"373\">\u201cDuring the next few months, vacancies will occur as a result of the recently enacted early retirement legislation. Because of a concern that State government continue to operate efficiently and provide necessary services, there may be a need to fill some critical positions quickly to account for the substantial loss of experience and expertise. The proposed amendments are intended to accommodate this need by providing more flexibility in the process for filling these positions.\u201d 26 Ill. Reg. 10084 (July 12, 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b373-6\" pgmap=\"373\">The suggested amendments allowed term appointments to be made at the discretion of the director of the department, board or commission, without reference to eligibility lists, provided that the appointee was \u201cqualified\u201d and the position was determined by the director of CMS to be exempt from the requirements of Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois, 497 U.S. 62, 111 L. Ed. 2d 52, 110 S. Ct. 2729 (1990).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 26 Ill. Reg. 10093 (July 12, 2002).</p> <p id=\"b373-7\" pgmap=\"373(10) 374(61)\">The probationary period under the existing rules was either four months or six months, depending on the circumstances of the employee\u2019s hiring. 80 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7\u00a7 302.300(a), (b) (2000). The proposed rules reduced the probationary period to 30 days for employees who \u201cimmediately prior to the appointment\u201d had \u201cserved the State as a full time employee, continuously, for a minimum of 2 years.\u201d 26 Ill. Reg. 10092 (July 12, 2002).</p> <p id=\"b374-3\" pgmap=\"374\">During the second notice period, JCAR objected to the proposed rules, noting that CMS \u201chas not provided adequate justification and rationale for the proposed rulemaking and for departing from existing personnel policies.\u201d 26 Ill. Reg. 14290 (September 27, 2002). JCAR pointed out that the proposed amendments would \u201cabandon\u201d the use of candidate lists for term appointments and would delegate CMS authority to agency directors in making term appointments. JCAR stated that the proposed rules constituted</p> <blockquote id=\"b374-4\" pgmap=\"374\">\u201cthe extraordinary action of long term measures to address possible, unknown, short term needs by appointing permanent and/or 4 year term appointees to address temporary management shortfalls when interim replacements could be designated from within existing agency ranks or obtained on an emergency, temporary or provisional basis pursuant to the Personnel Code.\u201d 26 Ill. Reg. 14290 (September 27, 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b374-5\" pgmap=\"374\">CMS responded to the latter concern as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b374-6\" pgmap=\"374\">\u201cAn extraordinary number of vacancies are anticipated in this time of transition, due in large part to the early retirement legislation. While emergency, temporary or provisional appointments can be made currently, this new rulemaking will provide more flexibility and additional incentives to help agencies fill these vacancies and ensure that necessary State services are not interrupted.\u201d 26 Ill. Reg. 15328-29 (October 25, 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b374-7\" pgmap=\"374\">CMS also responded that the 30-day probationary period was within the Personnel Code\u2019s requirement that probation not exceed one year (20 ILCS 415/8b.6 (West 2000)). 26 Ill. Reg. 15328 (October 25, 2002). As to the abandonment of eligibility lists, CMS responded that under the proposed rules, individuals appointed to Rutan-exempt term positions must be \u201cqualified\u201d and that \u201cit is anticipated that agency directors will determine qualifications by following the same procedures that are used currently by CMS.\u201d 26 Ill. Reg. 15329 (October 25, 2002).</p> <p id=\"b374-8\" pgmap=\"374(58) 375(80)\">An agency may file a proposed rulemaking for adoption, the third and final step in the process, only if it has responded to a statement of objection from JCAR. 1 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 220.1100 (1994). According to the \u201cNotice of Adopted Amendments,\u201d CMS\u2019s response to JCAR\u2019s objections was submitted on September 30, 2002. 26 Ill. Reg. 15285 (October 25, 2002). The October 25, 2002, issue of the Illinois Register, which offered published notice of CMS\u2019s response to JCAR\u2019s objection to the proposed amendments, also included the notice that those amendments had been adopted and were effective on October 15, 2002. 26 Ill. Reg. 15285 (October 25, 2002). The notice indicates that no difference existed between the proposed rules and the adopted amendments, and it states that \u201cno changes were necessary.\u201d 26 Ill. Reg. 15285 (October 25, 2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b375-3\" pgmap=\"375\">On October 16, 2002, the day after the amendments\u2019 published effective date, Deborah Hensey, the manager of the Bureau of Personnel of CMS, informed agency heads and agency personnel managers in writing that the revised rules would \u201crequire changes in personnel procedure.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b375-4\" pgmap=\"375\">4. Actions of Ryan and Blagojevich Administrations After October 15 Amendments</p> <p id=\"b375-5\" pgmap=\"375\">Governor Ryan had announced in August 2001 that he would not run for reelection in November 2002. During their campaigns for governor, Blagojevich and his opponent, Jim Ryan, both publicly criticized the October 15 amendments.</p> <p id=\"b375-6\" pgmap=\"375\">Blagojevich was elected in November 2002 and took office in January 2003. On January 15, 2003, the Governor\u2019s chief of staff, Alonzo Monk, advised all state agencies and departments that the October 15 amendments were \u201clegal nullities\u201d and ordered the director of each department to review all appointments made on or after July 10, 2002, including promotions, lateral hires and voluntary reductions. Each department was ordered to report the salary, title, job description and other pertinent employment information regarding any such appointment to the Governor\u2019s office by January 17, 2003. Following that survey, in January and February 2003, Monk informed each of the defendant employees in writing that his or her employment was terminated.</p> <p id=\"b375-7\" pgmap=\"375\">5. Decisions of the Commission and the Circuit Court of Cook County</p> <p id=\"A1S\" pgmap=\"375(53) 376(33)\">More than 40 of the approximately 60 terminated employees appealed their dismissals to the Commission. In their brief to this court, plaintiffs indicate that approximately 13 of those terminated employees: (1) were rehired by the State after reapplying for their jobs under the Personnel Code provisions as they read before the October 15 amendments, i.e., with competition from an eligibility list and a four- to six-month probationary period; or (2) did not pursue their claims because they obtained employment elsewhere or for some other reason.</p> <p id=\"b376-3\" pgmap=\"376\">The appeals of 27 employees proceeded before the Commission. The plaintiff agencies moved to dismiss the appeals, arguing that the Commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the workers were not \u201cappointed under the rules and after examination\u201d as required by section 11 of the Personnel Code (20 ILCS 415/11 (West 2000)). The administrative law judge (ALJ) recommended that plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss be denied and determined, in a six-page written decision, that the Commission should decide the appeals under the presumption that the amendments \u201care proper and were properly promulgated.\u201d The ALJ further stated that \u201cthe cases turn primarily on questions of law.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b376-4\" pgmap=\"376\">On September 18, 2003, the five-member Commission issued a one-page decision, stating in its entirety:</p> <blockquote id=\"b376-5\" pgmap=\"376\">\u201cThe undersigned, having read the decision of the administrative law judge, hereby adopt said decision and hereby certify it to the director of the Department of Central Management Services, State of Illinois, for enforcement.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b376-6\" pgmap=\"376\">The [employees] are to be reinstated in their respective positions they occupied at the time of their discharge and are to receive full compensation in accordance with the Personnel Code. This is a final administrative order subject to the Administrative Review Act.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b376-7\" pgmap=\"376\">The decision was approved by three members of the Commission, with two members dissenting.</p> <p id=\"b376-8\" pgmap=\"376\">On September 29, 2003, the plaintiff agencies filed a complaint for administrative review in the circuit court of Cook County, challenging the Commission\u2019s decision. Plaintiffs alleged that the defendant employees were political appointees of the Ryan administration who previously had jobs from which they could be discharged at will by the incoming governor and that the employees were selected for \u201csenior positions in Illinois government known as term appointments.\u201d On February 27, 2004, the circuit court issued a three-line written order affirming the Commission\u2019s decision and ordering that the employees \u201cbe reinstated in their respective positions they occupied at the time of their discharge.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b376-9\" pgmap=\"376\">ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"Aqr\" pgmap=\"376\">1. Standard of Review</p> <p id=\"b376-10\" pgmap=\"376(10) 377(73)\">Initially, the parties disagree as to the appropriate standard of review. Plaintiffs assert that the issues of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction and the validity of the October 15 amendments are legal questions to be reviewed de novo. In response, defendants refer to the standards used to review factual findings and mixed questions of law and fact, and they argue that factual findings of an administrative agency are presumed to be correct and are reviewed under a manifest weight of the evidence standard.</p> <p id=\"b377-3\" pgmap=\"377\"> Although an administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact are presumed prima facie true and correct (County of Cook v. Illinois Local Labor Relations Board, 302 Ill. App. 3d 682, 686, 707 N.E.2d 176, 179 (1998)), the various propositions offered by defendants are inapplicable here. The ALT acknowledged that this case involved questions of law and presumed the October 15 amendments\u2019 validity. The Commission then adopted the ALJ\u2019s decision and reinstated the employees to their positions, and the circuit court summarily affirmed the Commission\u2019s ruling. Whether the Commission has subject matter jurisdiction to hear the employees\u2019 cases is a question of law to be reviewed by this court de novo. See Spiel v. Property Tax Appeal Board, 309 Ill. App. 3d 373, 377, 722 N.E.2d 306, 309 (1999). Given the procedural history of this case and the nature of the issues presented to this court, the appropriate standard of review is de novo. Moreover, our task is to review the decision of the administrative agency, not the judgment of the trial court. Alm v. Lincolnshire Police Pension Board, 352 Ill. App. 3d 595, 598, 816 N.E.2d 389, 391 (2004).</p> <p id=\"b377-4\" pgmap=\"377\">2. Jurisdiction of the Commission</p> <p id=\"b377-5\" pgmap=\"377\"> Plaintiffs contend that under the Personnel Code, the Commission reviews the termination of employees who were \u201cappointed under the rules and after examination.\u201d See 20 ILCS 415/11 (West 2000). They point out that the civil service system is intended to protect employees who have competed for their jobs through merit selection and that, in turn, the Commission reviews the termination of employees who have undergone that process to insure that competitively selected workers are discharged or disciplined only for cause.</p> <p id=\"b377-6\" pgmap=\"377\">Plaintiffs assert that 20 of the 27 employees were not appointed from eligibility lists (Backfield, Barrow, Brown, Ciarlo, Cole, Hampton, Harmeyer, Kimble, Madigan, Messina, Murphy, Narup, Overaker, Trees, Urbanek, Vega, Vespa, Williams, Woodward and Wyatt), thereby circumventing the requirements of appointment \u201cafter examination\u201d that is necessary to invoke the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.</p> <p id=\"b377-7\" pgmap=\"377(32) 378(21)\">Defendants do not assert that those 20 employees were appointed from eligibility lists. Therefore, since those 20 employees were not appointed under the rules and after examination, we conclude that the Commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their cases, and we vacate the Commission\u2019s order reinstating those employees to their state positions.</p> <p id=\"b378-3\" pgmap=\"378\">Turning to the remaining seven employees (Booker, Dutton, Fulgenzi, LeBegue, Nelson, Parker and Turnbull), plaintiffs refer to them as \u201creinstatement\u201d employees who previously had been appointed from eligibility lists, completed their probationary periods with the State, and were \u201creturning to the merit and fitness system after serving in various political positions\u201d when they were offered term positions in the fall of 2002. Plaintiffs do not contest the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over those seven employees. Rather, plaintiffs contend that, as to those defendants, this court should determine whether the October 15 amendments were valid.</p> <p id=\"b378-4\" pgmap=\"378\">3. The October 15 Amendments</p> <p id=\"b378-5\" pgmap=\"378\">Plaintiffs assert that by removing the requirements of competitive examinations and eligibility lists, the October 15 amendments conflict with the Personnel Code\u2019s provisions that mandate those procedures, and, therefore, the amendments were void ab initio. They also argue that the October 15 amendments reduced the probationary period from either 4 months or 6 months to 30 days, thus precluding any meaningful performance review because CMS regulations do not require an employee evaluation until 90 days after the employee\u2019s appointment.</p> <p id=\"b378-6\" pgmap=\"378\">a. The Amendments\u2019 Promulgation</p> <p id=\"b378-7\" pgmap=\"378\">At the outset, we note that plaintiffs argued to the ALJ and the circuit court that CMS did not submit the proposed rules to the Commission, as the Personnel Code requires. See 20 ILCS 415/8 (West 2000) (stating that CMS director \u201cshall prepare and submit to the Civil Service Commission proposed rules for all positions and employees subject to this Act\u201d). In this appeal, defendants contend that plaintiffs have waived those arguments or any other assertions as to the procedure used to pass the amendments by failing to raise them to this court. Defendants previously responded that that practice had not been followed for several years and that publication of rule changes in the Illinois Register had since superseded the previous method.</p> <p id=\"b378-8\" pgmap=\"378(71) 379(120)\">Defendants are correct that plaintiffs have now focused on the amendments\u2019 substance and have not challenged the validity of the procedure by which they were promulgated. However, this court would be shortsighted not to observe that the amendments were passed swiftly and with an inexplicable dismissal of the objections voiced by JCAR. During the second notice period, JCAR reported that CMS did not provide \u201cadequate justification and rationale\u201d for \u201cdeparting from existing personnel policies,\u201d and the committee referred to the use of term appointments as an \u201cextraordinary action of long term measures to address possible, unknown, short term needs.\u201d 26 Ill. Reg. 14290 (September 27, 2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although CMS responded to JCAR\u2019s statement of objection to the proposed rulemaking, CMS did not submit for publication its notice of refusal to meet JCAR\u2019s objections. See R. Kane, Specific Rulemaking Procedures in Illinois, in Illinois Administrative Law \u00a7 5.31 (Ill. Inst. for Cont. Legal Educ. 1991) (if an agency has refused to modify a proposed rule, the agency must notify JCAR in writing of that response and submit a notice of refusal to meet the committee\u2019s objection for publication in the Illinois Register).</p> <p id=\"b379-3\" pgmap=\"379\">In any event, the published notice of CMS\u2019s response to JCAR\u2019s objections did not appear in the Illinois Register until 10 days after the amendments took effect and approximately 9 days after the Ryan administration began to use the amendments to effectuate the employees\u2019 four-year term appointments. See 26 Ill. Reg. 15285 (October 25, 2002). Although the recommendations of JCAR were not binding on CMS, JCAR\u2019s acquiescence to the adoption of the amendments in unaltered form represented a remarkable change of course from its initial opposition to most, if not all, of the amendments\u2019 content. Unfortunately, the process that led to the amendments\u2019 adoption in the same form that initially had prompted JCAR\u2019s vehement objection is dehors the record.</p> <p id=\"b379-4\" pgmap=\"379\">b. The Amendments\u2019 Substantive Validity</p> <p id=\"b379-5\" pgmap=\"379\"> An administrative agency possesses no inherent or common law powers, and any authority that the agency claims must find its source within the provisions of the statute by which the agency was created. Illinois Local Labor Relations Board, 302 Ill. App. 3d at 686-87, 707 N.E.2d at 179. Accordingly, the authority of an administrative agency to adopt rules and regulations is defined by the statute creating that authority, and such rules and regulations must be in accord with the standards and policies set forth in the statute. Gunia v. Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Merit Board, 211 Ill. App. 3d 761, 769, 570 N.E.2d 653, 658 (1991); Popejoy v. Zagel, 115 Ill. App. 3d 9, 11, 449 N.E.2d 1373, 1374 (1983). Properly promulgated administrative regulations have the force and effect of law. Applegate v. Department of Transportation, 335 Ill. App. 3d 1056, 1063-64, 783 N.E.2d 96, 103 (2002).</p> <p id=\"b380-2\" pgmap=\"380\">However, an administrative body cannot extend or alter the enabling statute\u2019s operation by the exercise of its rulemaking powers. Popejoy, 115 Ill. App. 3d at 11, 449 N.E.2d at 1375; see also Glenn v. City of Chicago, 256 Ill. App. 3d 825, 831, 628 N.E.2d 844, 848 (1993) (noting that civil service commission must exercise powers \u201cin subordination to those rules established by the legislature\u201d). If an agency promulgates rules that are beyond the scope of the legislative grant of authority or that conflict with the statute, the rules are invalid. R.L. Polk &amp; Co. v. Ryan, 296 Ill. App. 3d 132, 141, 694 N.E.2d 1027, 1034 (1998).</p> <p id=\"b380-3\" pgmap=\"380\">Plaintiffs contend that the October 15 amendments were void ab initio because by omitting the required examinations and eligibility lists, the amendments conflict with the Personnel Code\u2019s provisions that mandate those procedures. Plaintiffs assert that sections 8b.18 and 8b. 19 are subsections of section 8b, which requires CMS to promulgate rules regarding employees\u2019 selection based on merit and fitness, and that all of those sections are under the larger umbrella of section 8. They argue that the rules contained in section 8b pertain to term appointees as they do to other state employees who are subject to the merit and fitness provisions.</p> <p id=\"b380-4\" pgmap=\"380\">Defendants respond that term appointments are governed by sections 8b. 18 and 8b. 19 of the Personnel Code and that the remainder of section 8b does not apply to those positions.</p> <p id=\"b380-5\" pgmap=\"380\">The pertinent Personnel Code sections, from the general to the more specific, provide:</p> <blockquote id=\"b380-6\" pgmap=\"380\">\u201c\u00a7 8. Rules. The Director of Central Management Services shall prepare and submit to the Civil Service Commission proposed rules for all positions and employees subject to this Act. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b380-7\" pgmap=\"380\">The rules and amendments thereto shall provide: ***.\u201d 20 ILCS 415/8 (West 2000).</blockquote> <p id=\"b380-8\" pgmap=\"380\">Section 8a, titled \u201cJurisdiction A \u2014 Classification and pay,\u201d requires CMS to promulgate rules as to the classification of positions and their pay. 20 ILCS 415/8a (West 2000). Those rules are found in subsections 8a. 1 and 8a.2 of the Personnel Code. 20 ILCS 415/8a.l, 8a.2 (West 2000). Section 8c, titled \u201cJurisdiction C; conditions of employment,\u201d enables CMS to formulate rules regarding a plan to address employee complaints and grievances. 20 ILCS 415/8c (West 2000).</p> <p id=\"b380-9\" pgmap=\"380\">Section 8b provides, in relevant part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b380-10\" pgmap=\"380(44) 381(12)\">\u201c\u00a7 8b. Jurisdiction B \u2014 Merit and fitness, (a) For positions in the State service subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Central Management Services with respect to selection and tenure on the basis of merit and fitness, those matters specified in this Section and Sections 8b.1 through 8b. 17.\u201d 20 ILCS 415/8b(a) (West 2000).</blockquote> <p id=\"b381-3\" pgmap=\"381\">Sections 8b.l through 8b.l7 require CMS to promulgate rules as to competitive examinations, promotions, eligibility lists, probationary periods, preference for veterans, emergency and temporary appointments, reinstatements, layoffs, performance reviews, disciplinary actions, discharge and demotion, among other subjects. 20 ILCS 415/ 8b.l through 8b.l7 (West 2000).</p> <p id=\"b381-4\" pgmap=\"381\">Sections 8b.18 and 8b.19, both titled \u201cTerm Appointments,\u201d do not begin with the same introductory language (\u201cFor . . . \u201d) as do section 8b(a) and sections 8b.1 through 8b.17. Sections 8b(a) and 8b.1 through 8b.l7 provide predicates to the subject language in section 8 that the rules and amendments proposed by CMS \u201cshall provide.\u201d The gist of defendants\u2019 argument is that sections 8b. 18 and 8b. 19, addressing term appointments, are independent provisions that do not fall under the umbrella of section 8b, unlike sections 8b. 1 through 8b.17, and that, therefore, the rules as to term appointments that conflict with the larger group of merit- and fitness-related provisions of section 8b are not invalid.</p> <p id=\"b381-5\" pgmap=\"381\">Defendants also argue that although the Personnel Code once treated term appointments and other employee classifications comparably, sections 8b.18 and 8b.19 indicate that employees given term appointments after January 1, 1980, are to be appointed without reference to the merit and fitness requirements of sections 8b. 1 through 8b. 17. Defendants assert that because section 8b. 18 \u201cis silent as to the specifics of the appointment process,\u201d CMS can provide those details by rule, and they contend that CMS established that procedure in the October 15 amendments.</p> <p id=\"b381-6\" pgmap=\"381\">Several flaws in defendants\u2019 position are immediately apparent. First, because defendants assert that the language in section 8 enabling CMS to propose rules extends to sections 8b. 18 and 8b. 19 to provide specific provisions for term appointments, they cannot also logically argue that sections 8b. 18 and 8b. 19 are independent of the broader merit and fitness provisions of section 8b. Sections 8a, 8b and 8c each are subparts of section 8 addressing different areas of CMS\u2019 rulemaking powers.</p> <p id=\"b381-7\" pgmap=\"381(75) 382(76)\">Moreover, defendants\u2019 contention that the eligibility list provision and other merit and fitness requirements of section 8b did not apply to sections 8b.18 and 8b.l9 is belied by the fact that CMS sought to change the administrative rules pertaining to term appointments to \u201cprovide more flexibility *** to help agencies fill these vacancies.\u201d 26 Ill. Reg. 15329 (October 25, 2002). In initially opposing the amendments, JCAR noted that the proposed amendments would remove the use of eligibility lists in making term appointments. In its response to those objections, CMS did not challenge that representation, instead stating that agency directors would \u201cdetermine qualifications\u201d using the same procedures as used previously. 26 Ill. Reg. 15329 (October 25, 2002). If, as defendants now argue, the Personnel Code\u2019s merit and fitness provisions are unrelated to the provisions pertaining to term appointments, there would have been no need to seek the amendment of those provisions.</p> <p id=\"b382-3\" pgmap=\"382\">Second, defendants\u2019 argument that sections 8b. 1 through 8b. 17 do not apply to term appointments is inconsistent with their assertion that section 8b.6 pertains to term appointments. Plaintiffs assert that the October 15 amendments\u2019 reduction of the probationary period to 30 days for term appointees precludes any meaningful performance review because CMS regulations do not require an employee evaluation until 90 days after the employee\u2019s appointment, meaning that an employee\u2019s 30-day probation would end before he or she received an evaluation. See 80 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 302.270 (2002). Defendants have responded that the amendments do not contradict the applicable probationary period because section 8b.6 does not state a minimum period of probation; it simply provides that probation cannot exceed one year. See 20 ILCS 415/8b.6 (West 2000).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants argue that a 30-day probationary period is reasonable for term appointees who had previously served as state employees exempt from the merit- and fitness-related provisions of section 8b. However, defendants cannot contend that sections 8b. 18 and 8b. 19 are unrelated to the merit and fitness requirements of section 8b.1 through 8b.l7 and, at the same time, argue that section 8b.6 applies to term appointments.</p> <p id=\"b382-4\" pgmap=\"382\">Moreover, defendants\u2019 contention that the October 15 amendments provided \u201cthe specifics\u201d of term appointments under sections 8b.18 and 8b.19 \u201cby rule\u201d implies that no procedures for term appointments existed before October 15, 2002. Statutes should be construed, if possible, so that no portion is rendered superfluous or meaningless. Hitt v. Ryan, 307 Ill. App. 3d 344, 349, 718 N.E.2d 695, 700 (1999). Defendants\u2019 argument suggests that sections 8b.18 and 8b. 19 were dormant until the passage of the October 15 amendments.</p> <p id=\"b382-5\" pgmap=\"382(36) 383(80)\">Construing the statute in its entirety, as we are required to do, section 8 of the Personnel Code involves the promulgation of rules for state employment based on merit and fitness. See Perez v. Civil Service Comm\u2019n, 153 Ill. App. 3d 176, 180, 505 N.E.2d 1067, 1070 (1987) (Personnel Code\u2019s purpose \u201cis to establish a system of personnel administration based on merit\u201d). Because term appointments are subject to the merit and fitness requirements outlined in sections 8b. 1 through 8b.l7 of the Personnel Code, the October 15 amendments to the Illinois Administrative Code contradicted their enabling statute by removing the eligibility fist requirement and a meaningful probationary period for employees who were given term appointments.</p> <p id=\"b383-3\" pgmap=\"383\"> Rules that conflict with the statutory language under which they were adopted are invalid. R.L. Polk &amp; Co., 296 Ill. App. 3d at 141, 694 N.E.2d at 1034. Because the October 15 amendments conflict with the language of the Personnel Code, the amendments are void ab initio. Therefore, the state of the law is as if the amendments were never passed. In re G.O., 191 Ill. 2d 37, 43, 727 N.E.2d 1003, 1007 (2000). When the defendant employees were discharged, they were within the probationary period in effect previously, which was either four months or six months. 80 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7\u00a7 302.300(a), (b) (2000). Accordingly, the defendant employees were subject to termination at will by the incoming administration. See, e.g., Vanko v. Sheahan, 278 Ill. App. 3d 302, 303, 662 N.E.2d 512, 514 (1996) (involving discharge of deputy sheriff and applicability of sheriff\u2019s merit system act). Therefore, the Commission\u2019s order reinstating defendants Booker, Dutton, Fulgenzi, LeBegue, Nelson, Parker and Turnbull to state employment is reversed.</p> <p id=\"b383-4\" pgmap=\"383\">4. Timeliness of the Commission\u2019s Hearings and Decision</p> <p id=\"b383-5\" pgmap=\"383\"> Defendants next assert that the Commission failed to grant hearings in their cases within 30 days or render decisions within 60 days as required by section 11 of the Personnel Code (20 ILCS 415/11 (West 2000)). Because we have found that the Commission lacked jurisdiction over 20 of the employees, we need not address these arguments as to those 20 defendants. However, because the Commission had jurisdiction over defendants Booker, Dutton, Fulgenzi, LeBegue, Nelson, Parker and Turnbull, it is necessary to consider the timeliness of the Commission\u2019s actions in their cases.</p> <p id=\"b383-6\" pgmap=\"383(92) 384(35)\"> If an employee requests a hearing before the Commission, the Commission shall \u201cgrant a hearing within 30 days\u201d of the filing of such a request and the Commission\u2019s \u201cfinding and decision *** shall be rendered within 60 days after the receipt of the transcript of the proceedings.\u201d 20 ILCS 415/11 (West 2000). If the Commission does not commence a hearing within 30 days, it loses jurisdiction over the employee\u2019s case. Winkler v. Department of Public Aid, 114 Ill. App. 3d 133, 135, 448 N.E.2d 266, 268 (1983). If the Commission\u2019s finding and decision are not rendered within the 60-day period, \u201cthe employee shall be considered to be reinstated and shall receive full compensation for the period for which he was suspended.\u201d 20 ILCS 415/11 (West 2000).</p> <p id=\"b384-3\" pgmap=\"384\">a. Timeliness of Defendants\u2019 Hearings</p> <p id=\"b384-4\" pgmap=\"384\"> Defendants contend that their employment was terminated in January and February 2003 and that they all requested hearings within 15 days of their termination, or by February 11, 2003, at the latest. Defendants assert that although the Commission held conferences regarding their cases within the 30-day period, those proceedings did not satisfy the hearing requirement. They argue that their hearings were not \u201cheld\u201d until May 2003, when the ALJ began to hear testimony.</p> <p id=\"b384-5\" pgmap=\"384\">Plaintiffs agree that six of the seven defendant employees requested hearings before February 11, 2003; they state that Booker did not appeal her case to the Commission until March 25, 2003. However, plaintiffs argue that, as to all seven defendants, the Commission began hearings in February and March 2003, within 30 days of each defendant\u2019s written notice to the Commission. Citing Ragano v. Civil Service Comm\u2019n, 80 Ill. App. 3d 523, 400 N.E.2d 97 (1980), plaintiffs correctly assert that although the Commission must begin a hearing within 30 days of the employee\u2019s filing of a request, the hearing need not be completed within 30 days. In addition, plaintiffs object to defendants\u2019 contention that the hearings were delayed by plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests, and they argue that defendants not only agreed to the timing of the hearings but also made abundant discovery requests of their own.</p> <p id=\"b384-6\" pgmap=\"384\">Defendants do not assert that their hearings were not commenced within 30 days, only that they were not \u201cheld\u201d within 30 days. Again, section 11 does not require that the Commission complete its hearing within 30 days of defendants\u2019 request, only that the hearing must be \u201cgranted, scheduled and started within 30 days of the written notice.\u201d Hardaway v. Civil Service Comm\u2019n, 52 Ill. App. 3d 494, 497, 367 N.E.2d 778, 780 (1977) (noting the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that continuances are sometimes necessary in proceedings before the Commission). For that reason, defendants\u2019 argument on this issue is unavailing.</p> <p id=\"b384-7\" pgmap=\"384(53) 385(60)\">Furthermore, the Hardaway court observed that requiring the completion of a hearing within 30 days could prompt a party to unnecessarily extend the presentation of evidence beyond that 30-day window, thus nullifying the proceedings. Hardaway, 52 Ill. App. 3d at 497, 367 N.E.2d at 780. Although we have held that the Commission complied with the Personnel Code by commencing defendants\u2019 hearings within 30 days, we hasten to add that given the voluminous record in this case and the number of employees involved, along with the ALJ\u2019s attempt to streamline the proceedings by identifying at the outset any issues common to all defendants, the timetable of hearings in this case was reasonable.</p> <p id=\"b385-3\" pgmap=\"385\">b. Timeliness of Commission\u2019s Decision</p> <p id=\"b385-4\" pgmap=\"385\">Defendants next contend that they are entitled to reinstatement to their state employment because the Commission failed to render its decision within 60 days of receiving the transcript of proceedings. Defendants assert that the Commission received a transcript on July 21, 2003, and therefore was required to render a decision by September 19, 2003. As with the 30-day period for commencing a hearing, the requirement that the Commission make a final decision in a case within 60 days of receiving the transcript of proceedings is mandatory. Epstein v. Civil Service Comm\u2019n, 47 Ill. App. 3d 81, 86, 361 N.E.2d 782, 786 (1977).</p> <p id=\"b385-5\" pgmap=\"385\">The record indicates that the Commission\u2019s decision was dated September 18, 2003, which was within the 60-day period. Nevertheless, defendants assert that the Commission\u2019s decision was not \u201crendered\u201d until five days later, on September 23, 2003, when it was delivered to the clerk of the Commission and mailed and/or delivered to defendants. In support of that assertion, defendants cite Nudell v. Forest Preserve District, 207 Ill. 2d 409, 799 N.E.2d 260 (2003). However, in Nudell, the Illinois Supreme Court decided that the 35-day period for filing a complaint for administrative review begins on the date that the decision being appealed is placed in the United States mail, as opposed to the date that the affected parties actually receive the decision, noting the clear language of section 3 \u2014 103 of the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 103 (West 1998)). Nudell, 207 Ill. 2d at 424, 799 N.E.2d at 268.</p> <p id=\"b385-6\" pgmap=\"385\">Defendants maintain that the Commission\u2019s September 18, 2003, ruling was not a \u201cdecision\u201d that they could appeal. They attempt to make use of Nudell by contending that they could not have appealed from the Commission\u2019s decision until it was mailed to them on September 23, 2003. We do not find Nudell applicable here, since it involves the commencement of the time period for filing an administrative review complaint, as opposed to the ending of the time period for a Commission decision, which is the subject of defendants\u2019 current challenge.</p> <p id=\"b385-7\" pgmap=\"385(22) 386(45)\">As plaintiffs point out, the Illinois Administrative Code indicates that a decision of the Commission becomes final \u201cat the time it is made in writing and announced at an open and public meeting of the Commission.\u201d 80 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 1.270(b) (2000). Because the Commission\u2019s written order was dated and made public on September 18, 2003, we reject defendants\u2019 assertion that the decision was untimely.</p> <p id=\"b386-3\" pgmap=\"386\">5. The Right to Pretermination Hearings</p> <p id=\"AK1\" pgmap=\"386\"> Defendants also contend that they were denied procedural due process under the Personnel Code because they did not receive pretermination hearings as required by section 302.705 of the Administrative Code (80 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 302.705 (2002)). It is noteworthy that that provision is part of the \u201cmerit and fitness\u201d section of administrative rules under the Personnel Code, which defendants previously contended does not apply to term appointments.</p> <p id=\"b386-4\" pgmap=\"386\">The relevant administrative regulation, promulgated by CMS, begins: \u201cBefore an agency shall suspend any certified employee pending decision on discharge or bring charges for discharge against any certified employee ***.\u201d 80 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 302.705 (2002).</p> <p id=\"b386-5\" pgmap=\"386\">The Illinois Administrative Code defines a certified employee as:</p> <blockquote id=\"A9_\" pgmap=\"386\">\u201cany employee currently employed in a position subject to jurisdiction B who has satisfactorily completed a required period of probation and attained certified status in any position during the employee\u2019s most recent period of continuous State service.\u201d 80 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 302.625 (2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b386-6\" pgmap=\"386\">See also Cherniavsky v. Department of Labor, 74 Ill. App. 3d 517, 520, 392 N.E.2d 1135, 1137-38 (1979) (employee is certified upon completing required period of probation).</p> <p id=\"b386-7\" pgmap=\"386\">We have determined that because the October 15 amendments conflicted with the Personnel Code, the amendments were void ab initio. Therefore, when the defendant employees were discharged, none of them had completed their four- to six-month probationary period and thus were not entitled to a pretermination hearing under section 302.705, which applies only to certified employees.</p> <p id=\"b386-8\" pgmap=\"386\">6. Section 5 \u2014 10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act</p> <p id=\"Ada\" pgmap=\"386\"> As a final matter, this court reaches defendants\u2019 assertion that even if we find the October 15 amendments void, plaintiffs cannot seek to invalidate their own actions. Defendants rely on the following provision of the Administrative Procedure Act:</p> <blockquote id=\"b386-9\" pgmap=\"386\">\u201cNo agency rule is valid or effective against any person or party, nor may it be invoked by the agency for any purpose, until it has been made available for public inspection and filed with the Secretary of State as required by this Act. No agency, however, shall assert the invalidity of a rule that it has adopted under this Act when an opposing party has relied upon the rule.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 5 ILCS 100/5 \u2014 10(c) (West 2000).</blockquote> <p id=\"b387-2\" pgmap=\"387\">Defendants distinguish the administrative rulemaking principles in the previous sections of this opinion by contending that the amendments were proposed, adopted and utilized by CMS and that CMS therefore is estopped from denying their validity. Defendants argue that because they relied on the passage of the October 15 amendments by CMS, plaintiffs (which include CMS and other state agencies) cannot now assert that the amendments are invalid.</p> <p id=\"b387-3\" pgmap=\"387\">Plaintiffs respond that an illegitimate provision cannot be transformed into a legal rule when relied upon by those it was unlawfully designed to benefit, i.e., by claiming reliance on an invalid rule, defendants cannot transmute the provision into a valid one. Plaintiffs also assert that even if section 5 \u2014 10(c) was to apply here, many of the defendant employees could not have relied on the October 15 amendments in good faith because they knew of the likelihood that the incoming governor would challenge the amendments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b387-4\" pgmap=\"387\">We first address defendants\u2019 contention that CMS seeks to invalidate its own rule. It is true that the plaintiff agencies that now challenge the rule include the Department of Central Management Services, which is the same entity that proposed the rules under Governor Ryan. CMS is one of the 13 state departments that now contest the amendments\u2019 validity. However, the amendments were promulgated in October 2002 by CMS at the direction of then-Governor Ryan and were challenged in January 2003 by a different administration, that of incoming Governor Blagojevich.</p> <p id=\"b387-5\" pgmap=\"387(143) 388(19)\">The key players in this analysis are not the plaintiff state agencies but, rather, the two gubernatorial administrations. Michael Rumman, CMS director under Governor Blagojevich, stated in a deposition that shortly after the Governor took office in January 2003 and Rumman started work at CMS, the Governor\u2019s chief legal counsel \u201cindicated to [him] the intent to terminate these individuals\u201d and that the direction to do so \u201ccame from the [G]overnor\u2019s office.\u201d Monk, Governor Blagojevich\u2019s chief of staff, gave similar testimony. Rumman said that CMS\u2019 execution of the necessary paperwork was based on the legal counsel\u2019s representation that the amendments were invalid. Indeed, defendants admit in their brief that the decision to discharge the employees from their state positions was prompted by the change in gubernatorial administrations and, although implemented by CMS, was \u201cmade within the Office of the Governor.\u201d Therefore, we find that CMS does not now seek to invalidate its \u201cown\u201d rule under the meaning of section 5 \u2014 10(c).</p> <p id=\"b388-3\" pgmap=\"388\">We further agree with plaintiffs that the rationale of section 5 \u2014 10(c) is not to transform an improperly passed rule into a valid rule by virtue of the opposing party\u2019s reliance. Read in its entirety, section 5 \u2014 10(c) addresses an agency\u2019s obligation to provide formal notice of a proposed rule and limits an agency\u2019s ability to disinherit a rule if the rule\u2019s invalidity stems from the agency\u2019s failure to comply with the public inspection and filing requirements described in the section. As plaintiffs assert, it is logical to allow an opposing party to rely on its actual knowledge of the rule to support the rule\u2019s validity. However, defendants\u2019 attempt to invoke the rule here would create a type of estoppel that essentially would validate rules that were improperly promulgated.</p> <p id=\"b388-4\" pgmap=\"388\">The legislative history of section 5 \u2014 10(c) reveals that the last sentence of that statutory section was added in response to the Illinois Department of Revenue\u2019s attempt to assess a tax retroactively. See Illinois Bell Telephone Co. v. Allphin, 95 Ill. App. 3d 115, 124, 419 N.E.2d 1188, 1196-97 (1981), aff\u2019d, 93 Ill. 2d 241, 245, 443 N.E.2d 580, 582 (1982). In Allphin, the appellate court found that the Department of Revenue\u2019s regulations at the pertinent time stated that interstate revenues were not subject to a particular tax and that Illinois Bell had accordingly excluded those revenues from its tax computation. Allphin, 95 Ill. App. 3d at 124, 419 N.E.2d at 1196-97. Holding that the Department could not retroactively assess the tax, the appellate court held that the Department attempted, \u201cto the absolute detriment of the taxpayer who relies on the Department\u2019s rules and regulations, [to] totally ignore its own written rules and regulations and retroactively assess a tax when clearly none was due\u201d under the rules in effect during the relevant tax period. Allphin, 95 Ill. App. 3d at 126, 419 N.E.2d at 1198.</p> <p id=\"b388-5\" pgmap=\"388\">Therefore, in Allphin, the state\u2019s Department of Revenue attempted to disavow its own regulations, and Illinois courts prohibited the Department from retroactively applying newly revised rules when the complaining party had relied on the original rules in effect at the time. After Allphin was decided, the Illinois legislature added the final sentence to section 5 \u2014 10(c) to reflect that principle. 83d Ill. Gen. Assem., Senate Proceedings, June 21, 1984, at 91 (statements of Senator Bloom).</p> <p id=\"b388-6\" pgmap=\"388(38) 389(70)\">Here, unlike in Allphin, the defendant employees are attempting to enforce, by their alleged reliance, administrative rules that conflict with their enabling statute. Furthermore, in contrast to Allphin, the rules being challenged were promulgated by a different administration than that which now seeks their invalidation. Accordingly, we hold that section 5 \u2014 10(c) is inapplicable to this case, and defendants cannot rely on that provision to validate the October 15 amendments. Because we have held that section 5 \u2014 10(c) does not apply, we do not consider the factual question of whether any of the defendant employees relied on the amendments\u2019 validity in accepting their term appointments.</p> <p id=\"b389-3\" pgmap=\"389\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b389-4\" pgmap=\"389\">Because the Commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the cases of defendants Backfield, Barrow, Brown, Ciarlo, Cole, Hampton, Harmeyer, Kimble, Madigan, Messina, Murphy, Narup, Overaker, Trees, Urbanek, Vega, Vespa, Williams, Woodward and Wyatt, we vacate the Commission\u2019s order reinstating them to their state positions. In addition, because the remaining seven defendants, Booker, Dutton, Fulgenzi, LeBegue, Nelson, Parker and Turnbull, were appointed under the October 15 amendments, which we have found void ah initio, those individuals were within their probationary period when their employment was terminated by the Blagojevich administration. We therefore reverse the Commission\u2019s order reinstating those employees to their state jobs. Moreover, we reject those defendants\u2019 contentions that the Commission failed to hold timely hearings or issue a decision within the period required by the Personnel Code.</p> <p id=\"b389-5\" pgmap=\"389\">Plaintiffs ask this court to order all of the defendant employees to disgorge the back pay and benefits that they have received since they were reinstated by the Commission. Plaintiffs make no further argument on this issue and offer no citation to authority. See 188 Ill. 2d R. 341(e)(7) (requiring arguments to be accompanied by reference to supporting authority). Plaintiffs do not contend that any of the defendant employees who have remained in state service since their reinstatement on September 18, 2003, have not performed their jobs during that period in exchange for the compensation received. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 request on this point is denied.</p> <p id=\"b389-6\" pgmap=\"389\">Vacated in part and reversed in part.</p> <p id=\"b389-7\" pgmap=\"389\">NEVILLE, J., concurs.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b373-8\" pgmap=\"373\"> A Rutan-exempt position is one for which the government can consider an applicant\u2019s party affiliation in making a hiring decision.

The issues before this court on appeal are: (1) whether the Commission has subject matter jurisdiction over the appeals of the defendant state employees; and (2) whether the \u201cOctober 15\u201d rules promulgated by CMS were valid. These two questions are inextricably intertwined. Under a proper analysis on administrative review, I would answer both of these questions in the affirmative. The majority opinion is rife with fact finding and conclusions which are improper on the appellate review of an administrative decision.</p> <p id=\"b390-3\" pgmap=\"390\">I</p> <p id=\"b390-4\" pgmap=\"390\">Initially, the majority declares the applicable standard of review as de novo, based on the assertion of the plaintiff agencies and the majority\u2019s determination \u201c[gjiven the procedural history of this case.\u201d 357 Ill. App. 3d at 361.1 disagree.</p> <p id=\"b390-5\" pgmap=\"390\">Judicial review of a decision of the Commission is governed by the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 101 et seq. (West 2000)). 820 ILCS 405/1100, 2205 (West 2000). Under the Administrative Review Law, the scope of judicial review extends to all questions of law and fact presented by the record before the court. 735 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 110 (West 2000). The applicable standard of review, which determines the degree of deference given to the agency\u2019s decision, depends upon whether the question presented is one of fact, one of law, or a mixed question of law and fact. AFM Messenger Service, Inc. v. Department of Employment Security, 198 Ill. 2d 380, 763 N.E.2d 272 (2001); City of Belvidere v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 181 Ill. 2d 191, 204-05, 692 N.E.2d 295 (1998); Branson v. Department of Revenue, 168 Ill. 2d 247, 265, 659 N.E.2d 961 (1995).</p> <p id=\"b390-6\" pgmap=\"390\">In City of Belvidere, our supreme court set forth the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review for questions of mixed law and fact. A mixed question of law and fact is one \u201cinvolving] an examination of the legal effect of a given set of facts.\u201d City of Belvidere, 181 Ill. 2d at 205. This standard of review is described as lying \u201cbetween a manifest weight of the evidence standard and a de novo standard,\u201d so as to provide \u201csome deference\u201d to the agency\u2019s decision. City of Belvidere, 181 Ill. 2d at 205. Meanwhile, even when we review an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute de novo, we acknowledge that the agency\u2019s interpretation was \u201crelevant.\u201d Branson, 168 Ill. 2d at 254.</p> <p id=\"b390-7\" pgmap=\"390\">When the decision of an administrative agency presents a mixed question of law and fact, the agency decision will be deemed \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d only where the reviewing court, on the entire record, is \u201c \u2018left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d AFM Messenger, 198 Ill. 2d at 393, quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 92 L. Ed. 746, 766, 68 S. Ct. 525, 542 (1948).</p> <p id=\"b390-8\" pgmap=\"390(10) 391(120)\">In the present case, the Commission\u2019s decision presents a mixed question of law and fact. The Commission\u2019s decision is, in part, factual because it involves considering whether the facts support the finding that the defendant employees were improperly terminated under the rules. At the same time, the Commission\u2019s decision also concerns a question of law, as the plaintiff agencies allege that the regulation by which the employees were appointed to their respective positions was improperly promulgated and therefore void. Accordingly, the standard of review applicable to the aforementioned questions is the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. This court must determine whether the decision of the ALJ to reinstate the defendant employees, based on his presumption that the October 15 rules were properly promulgated, as adopted by the Commission, was clearly erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b391-3\" pgmap=\"391\">II</p> <p id=\"b391-4\" pgmap=\"391\">As I noted above, the questions before this court are effectively inseparable. To review the relevant facts: 13 state agencies dismissed 27 defendant state employees without cause and without notice early in January and February 2003. The record shows that the plaintiff agencies provide diverse functions to the State of Illinois and that each position held by the 27 employee defendants was distinct, as provided for by individual position descriptions. The defendant employees immediately filed individual appeals of their terminations, each requesting hearings by the Commission, pursuant to the Commission rules regarding discharge appeals.</p> <p id=\"b391-5\" pgmap=\"391\">On March 27, 2003, plaintiffs filed a combined motion to dismiss defendants\u2019 individual requests for hearings arguing that the rules under which defendants were appointed to their respective state positions, the October 15 rules, were \u201cvoid\u201d for failing to comply with the \u201csubmission requirement of the Personnel Code,\u201d which purportedly requires that any proposed rules implementing the Code be submitted to the Commission prior to becoming effective. Plaintiffs further argued that the October 15 rules \u201cillegally\u201d changed the procedure that previously required that employees wait through a probationary period of six months prior to being eligible for these particular positions of employment.</p> <p id=\"b391-6\" pgmap=\"391\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to hear the defendants\u2019 appeals is generated out of plaintiffs\u2019 belief that the October 15 rules were void and therefore defendants improperly held their positions in the first place.</p> <p id=\"b391-7\" pgmap=\"391(37) 392(98)\">Notwithstanding the objection of the plaintiffs, the Commission commenced the individual and consolidated hearings of the defendant employees pursuant to the rules pertaining to their employment status. On September 5, 2003, the administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a \u201cDecision on Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.\u201d Therein, the ALJ made the following findings of fact: (1) no action of any type was initiated by anyone to challenge the October 15, 2002, rule changes except the immediate discharge of defendants based on opinions received from outside counsel; (2) the Civil Service Commission is empowered to hear and determine written charges filed seeking the discharge of employees; (3) plaintiffs terminated certified employees; and (4) the Commission has the jurisdiction to decide the propriety of the discharges of the employees. The ALJ denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p> <p id=\"b392-3\" pgmap=\"392\">The ALJ then commenced to issue his \u201cDecision and Recommendation.\u201d Initially, the ALJ determined that the Commission has the jurisdiction to determine the appeals of the defendant employees. The ALJ then issued the following findings of fact: (1) administrative rules and regulations are presumed to be valid; (2) both sides of the case raised interrelated issues which create questions of law; (3) the Commission is charged with hearing discharge appeals. Discharge cases are fact-based and are resolved on the basis that the employee either did or did not violate a policy of an agency to the extent that the employee\u2019s conduct would warrant discipline up to and including discharge; (4) while the Commission rules upon certain questions of law and jurisdictional issues, in general, those rulings are based on recommendations by the administrative law judge based on an understanding of statutes and case law. Finally, the ALJ issued his opinion as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b392-4\" pgmap=\"392\">\u201cIt is my opinion that the Commissioners should not be put in a position to make significant rulings of law in cases of first impression. This case was initiated when the Executive Branch of Government, relying on legal opinions, solicited from non-governmental attorneys who were apparent partisans in an election, relied upon an opinion of those lawyers and determined that prior conduct of the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules acted inconsistently with statutes and acted in contravention to requirements that had previously been imposed on hiring as determined by CMS, the legislature, and the Courts. In other words, this case involved the Executive Branch of Government ruling that the conduct of the Legislative Branch was illegal resulting in the discharge of many State employees.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b392-5\" pgmap=\"392\">The Commission, I need to point out[,] is an arm of the Executive Branch of Government. It is created by Statute in the Chapter of Illinois Laws that deals with the Executive Branch. There are some quasi judicial functions performed by the Commission, but it was, in my opinion, never intended to serve as an arbiter of disputes between the Legislature and the Executive.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b393-2\" pgmap=\"393\">The proper forum for this decision is the Circuit Court, and if necessary, higher Courts. Traditionally, the Courts resolve disputes between the Executive and the Legislature, and in my view after cutting through all of the facts and briefs, that\u2019s what this case is all about.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b393-3\" pgmap=\"393\">My recommendation to the Commission is for the Commission to presume that the Rules are proper and were properly promulgated. Based on that recommendation, it necessarily follows that the employees need to be reinstated.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b393-4\" pgmap=\"393\">The Commission adopted the recommendation of the ALJ, without making any new findings of fact. Plaintiffs filed a complaint .in administrative review in the trial court requesting that the decision of the Commission be rendered void for want of subject matter jurisdiction, reversed as \u201ccontrary to the law and public policy of the State of Illinois,\u201d or reversed as against the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court, in affirming the decision of the Commission, made no new findings of fact.</p> <p id=\"b393-5\" pgmap=\"393\">Ill</p> <p id=\"b393-6\" pgmap=\"393\">The ALJ properly characterizes this action as a dispute between the executive branch and the legislature. The Commission adopted the decision of the ALJ. The ALJ determined that it was not within the province of the Commission to determine the validity of the October 15 rules. The ALJ further found that if the executive branch believed that the statute was improperly enacted or unconstitutional, it was incumbent upon the executive branch to take its case against the legislature directly to the court system or back to the legislature to amend the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And yet, the executive branch did no such thing. Instead, the plaintiffs, under the orders of the executive branch, and based on the advice of outside and \u201cpolitically partisan counsel,\u201d ipso facto determined that the law was \u201cvoid,\u201d and sua sponte issued letters of termination to the defendant employees; essentially shooting first and asking questions later. The plaintiffs then attempted to bootstrap their belief in the invalidity of the October 15 rules, without making a proper claim, onto the ordinary hearing procedure for appeals of termination.</p> <p id=\"b393-7\" pgmap=\"393(82) 394(29)\">It is well settled that issues not raised in the trial court are deemed waived and may not be raised for the first time on appeal. Haudrich v. Howmedica, Inc., 169 Ill. 2d, 525, 536 (1996); Daniels v. Anderson, 162 Ill. 2d 47, 58-59 (1994). In Daniels, our supreme court held that \u201c \u2018the theory upon which a case is tried in the lower court cannot be changed on review, and *** an issue not presented to or considered by the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on review.\u2019 \u201d Daniels, 162 Ill. 2d at 58, quoting Kravis v. Smith Marine, Inc., 60 Ill. 2d 141, 147 (1975).</p> <p id=\"b394-3\" pgmap=\"394\">The majority, however, without precedent and authority, delves into the record of the hearings and into hearsay de hors the record to reinterpret the facts in order to make its own and numerous findings of fact contrary to the standard of review on administrative appeal. After making its own findings of fact, the majority leads us on a field excursion through the legislative process. Along the way, the majority, echoing the plaintiffs\u2019 brief, complains that in enacting the October 15 rules, CMS refused to comply with the recommendations of JCAR. At the same time, the majority concedes in a footnote and within the text of the opinion that \u201c[t]he opinions of JCAR are not binding on administrative agencies,\u201d and that CMS properly submitted a response to the recommendation issued by JCAR, with an explanation for the changes in the rules. 357 Ill. App. 3d at 359 n.2.</p> <p id=\"b394-4\" pgmap=\"394\">Finally, based on its own fact-finding, the majority concludes that the October 15 rules are void ab initio, i.e., \u201cfrom their inception\u201d based on the illogical argument that the prior rules were \u201cdifferent\u201d than the amended rules; the prior rules for probation required a 6-month period of eligibility, while the amended rules required 30 days.</p> <p id=\"b394-5\" pgmap=\"394\">The posture of this case is such that this court assumes common questions of law and fact and defers to the expertise of the agency to determine whether a serious mistake has been committed by the administrative body. The majority fails to recognize that by the time of the commencement of the individual hearings, the defendant employees would have held their respective positions in excess of six months, thereby more than meeting the prior standard for employment eligibility. The record fails to suggest that the defendants were unqualified to hold their respective positions; that the various agencies intentionally hired individuals who were unqualified for the respective positions; or that the agencies failed to comply with the appropriate hiring procedures. No mistake is apparent.</p> <p id=\"b394-6\" pgmap=\"394\">The majority distinguishes between gubernatorial administrations rather than recognizing that every gubernatorial administration is the same branch of government: the executive branch. To adopt the majority\u2019s opinion one would have to believe that with every change of administration, all laws enacted during a prior administration are unlawful. The majority improperly acts as a vehicle to promote politics rather than reviewing the administrative decision before this court.</p> <p id=\"b394-7\" pgmap=\"394(18) 395(148)\">The majority\u2019s further conclusion that the October 15 rules somehow altered the enabling statute\u2019s operation is without support in the record. The majority relies on a series of cases where it was held that police departments unlawfully promulgated probation rules in order to effectuate demotions which conflicted with the Illinois State Police Act (Popejoy v. Zagel, 115 Ill. App. 3d 9, 449 N.E.2d 1373 (1983)) or the sheriffs merit system act (Vanko v. Sheahan, 278 Ill. App. 3d 302, 662 N.E.2d 512 (1996)). These cases are inapposite. The personnel rules applicable to the Cook County sheriff are governed by the sheriffs merit system act (55 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 7008 (West 2002)), which establishes appointment eligibility criteria, and the personnel rules applicable to the Illinois State Police are governed by the rulemaking authority of the Illinois State Police Act (20 ILCS 2610/0.01 et seq. (West 2002)). Neither police department is subject to the rulemaking of the Administrative Procedure Act, which sets forth its own distinct rulemaking criteria.</p> <p id=\"b395-3\" pgmap=\"395\">In the present case, the defendant employees were properly certified according to the October 15 rules, which did not purport to extend the power of the Civil Service Commission. The October 15 rules purported to reduce the probationary period from 6 months to 30 days. Section 8b.6 of the Personnel Code provides for probationary periods \u201cup to one year.\u201d A 30-day probationary period is, by definition, within one year.</p> <p id=\"b395-4\" pgmap=\"395\">The majority further notes via footnote that subsequent to the entry of the decision of the Commission and during the pendency of the present case, effective November 19, 2003, the Illinois legislature enacted an amendment to the Personnel Code section 90 \u2014 11, providing: \u201cfor a person appointed to a term appointment under Section 8b.8 or 8b.l9, the period of probation shall not be less than 6 months.\u201d See 357 Ill. App. 3d at 366 n.4. This very legislation is evidence that the plaintiffs are well aware of the appropriate method for amending legislation.</p> <p id=\"b395-5\" pgmap=\"395\">IV</p> <p id=\"b395-6\" pgmap=\"395(126) 396(45)\">As stated above, our review here involves a mixed question of law and fact. The facts as found by the ALJ, and adopted by the Commission, support the determination that the defendant employees were improperly terminated under the rules pertaining to their employment. \u201cTo say that a court is \u2018not bound\u2019 by the administrative determination does not mean, however, that the court is free to wholly ignore the ruling, afford it no probative value, or substitute its own findings on the matter after conducting a de novo review of the evidence.\u201d In re Austin W., 214 Ill. 2d 31, 55 (2005). Judicial review of an administrative agency decision is limited. Courts may not consider evidence outside of the record of the administrative appeal, reweigh the evidence to determine where the preponderance lies, or evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. 735 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 110 (West 2002); In re Austin W., 214 Ill. 2d at 56, citing Lyons v. Department of Children &amp; Family Services, 209 Ill. 2d 264 (2004).</p> <p id=\"b396-3\" pgmap=\"396\">Under the facts found by the ALJ and adopted by the Commission, the question of law, whether the defendant employees were appointed to their positions under an improperly promulgated rule, was properly answered in the negative by the trial court. There are no facts in the record which reveal that the rules were improperly amended to reduce the probationary period. The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are fraught with hearsay attempts to circumvent an ordinary interpretation of the applicable enabling statutes.</p> <p id=\"b396-4\" pgmap=\"396\">The record further shows that plaintiffs never raised the issue of the constitutionality of the October 15 rules at the trial court level; thus the trial court was never afforded the opportunity to rule on any constitutional violation. While a party may raise a constitutional challenge to a statute at any time (People v. Zeisler, 125 Ill. 2d 42, 46, 531 N.E.2d 24 (1988)), this court cannot, sua sponte, determine that a constitutional violation has ensued. Any constitutional issue is waived on review. See Haudrich, 169 Ill. 2d at 536; Daniels, 162 Ill. 2d at 58. Meanwhile, well aware of the flaws of its arguments here, and concurrent to the pendency of this action, plaintiffs undertook to reamend the rules under the proper legislative process to reinstate a probationary period of six months for certain types of employees. Under the clearly erroneous standard of review, no mistake has been committed by the Commission in presuming that the October 15 rules were properly promulgated and that the defendant employees were improperly terminated.</p> <p id=\"b396-5\" pgmap=\"396\">For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Commission and the judgment of the trial court.</p> <footnote label=\"6\"> <p id=\"b393-8\" pgmap=\"393\"> In fact, plaintiffs eventually did so: see infra.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
