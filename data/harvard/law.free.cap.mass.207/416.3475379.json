On the premises of the defendant was a brick building which he had erected after he acquired title in 1896, the face of the southerly wall of which coincided with the dividing line between the two estates. The plaintiff acquired title in 1905 and immediately began the erection of a brick building according to plans which contemplated that the northerly foundation and wall should be up to and flush with the northerly line of her land and the dividing line between the two estates. In excavating for the foundations the plaintiff found that all along the dividing line the foundation stones of the defendant\u2019s building projected irregularly into her land from ten to twelve inches and interfered materially with the construction of her building. Thereupon she complained to the defendant, and after a delay which inflicted upon her, as the plaintiff contended, a substantial loss, the defendant caused the stones to be cut off up to the dividing line except for a distance of twelve or fourteen feet near the front of the two estates where the building inspector of the city of Boston refused to allow it to be done on the ground that owing to the peculiar nature of the foundation of the defendant\u2019s building at that point it would tend, if done, to weaken the wall of the defendant\u2019s building. In consequence thereof the plaintiff was subjected, as she alleges, to additional expense in the erection of her building which she seeks to recover in this action <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> with other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>expenses and damages alleged to have been caused by the projection of the stones into her land and the maintenance of them there. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the presiding judge<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant. The case is here upon exceptions by the plaintiff to this ruling and direction. We think that the ruling and direction were wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Projecting the stones into the adjoining land without a right or license from the owner to do so was a wrongful act on the part of the defendant, and the maintenance of them in the positian in which they were so placed constituted a continuing trespass or nuisance. <em>Smith </em>v. Smith, 110 Mass. 302, 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">The plaintiff cannot maintain an action against the defendant for the original trespass since she was not in possession at the time that it was committed. The plaintiff, however, does not seek to recover for that. But the maintenance of the stones in the places where they were originally put constituted successive or continuing trespasses or nuisances and any one injured thereby could maintain an action therefor. <em>Prentiss </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>132 Mass. 486, 488. <em>Curtis Manuf.
