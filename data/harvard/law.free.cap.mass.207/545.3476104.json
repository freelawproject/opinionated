It appeared that, when the strap broke, the intestate\u2019s wagon was in a street, which adjoined a great market and was lined with teams on both sides, leaving a space for other teams to pass through in the middle, and that the plaintiff fell backward into this space and was run over by a loaded team. There was no evidence in regard to the condition of the strap at the beginning of the employment of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence of due care on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and that the question, whether he assumed the risk of such an accident by voluntarily exposing himself to danger, was for the jury.

There was evidence from which it might have been found that about a week before his injury the plaintiff\u2019s intestate showed to a superintendent of the defendants a strap used for binding a load, calling attention to its weakness. The latter, after examination of the strap, said, \u201c That will hold all the load you ever put on your wagon.\u201d About? a week later, while the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was pulling hard to tighten the strap around his load, it broke, he fell into the street between the wheels of a passing wagon, and received fatal injuries. The street was adjacent to the great market in Boston, and was lined with teams on each side, leaving space enough between so that there was no blockade.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">1. It is urged that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not in the exercise of due care, for the reason that he braced one foot upon the wheel of his wagon in order the better to tighten the strap around some barrels, knowing its weakened condition, and pulled upon it hard in such a position that he must have foreseen that if it gave way he would be likely to fall under the heavy wagon which he saw approaching. He had spoken of deterioration in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the strap to his superior, who had given emphatic assurance of its strength. It does not appear that he dissented from this view or further discussed the subject, but there was testimony that after the accident he said that he supposed the superintendent knew better about it than he did, and he let it go at that. It could not have been ruled, as matter of law, in view of this testimony and his subsequent conduct, that he did not rely on this statement, and it might have been inferred that he surrendered his own opinion to that thus expressed by the representative of his employer. It was said in <em>Garriere </em>v. <em>Merrick Lumber Co. </em>203 Mass. 322, at p. 326, that \u201c an assurance of safety by a superintendent has usually been held to be such a consideration as to render the due care of a workman relying upon it a question of fact.\u201d While there may be exceptions to this rule, no considerations appear which take the present case out of its operation. If the deceased relied upon the assurance as to the strap given by the superintendent, then the fact that he was in such position when pulling upon it that in case it broke he might fall under passing vehicles was of slight significance. It does not appear that he could have stood in any other position and efficiently performed his work. The street was a busy one, and whether he could have waited for the heavy wagon by which he was injured to pass without encountering other dangers was one of the circumstances to be weighed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">2. Whether the deceased assumed the risk by voluntarily exposing himself to danger, after knowing the facts and having a full appreciation of their bearing upon his safety, was a question of fact. <em>McKinnon </em>v. <em>Riter-Conley Manuf. Co. </em>186 Mass. 155. <em>Frost </em>v. McCarthy, 200 Mass. 445. <em>O\u2019Toole </em>v. Pruyn, 201 Mass. 126. This aspect of the case is so interwoven with the inquiry as to due care in view of the assurance given by the defendants\u2019 representative touching the strength of the strap as to stand upon the same ground. The defendants strongly rely upon <em>Davis </em>v. Forbes, 171 Mass. 548. Without impairing the authority of that case, it is distinguishable on the ground that the plaintiff there relied upon an exp'eriment performed in his presence to determine the soundness of the appliance, and not primarily upon the assurance given by the defendant. In <em>Levesque </em>v. <em>Janson, </em>165 Mass. 16, there was apparently opportunity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>selection by the plaintiff of a safe harness, and he chose to use the rotten one. Hence that case affords no support to the defendants. Cases like <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Hingham Cordage Co. </em>168 Mass. 278, where the risk from permanent conditions was held to have been assumed by the contract of employment, have no bearing, because there was no evidence to show the condition of the strap at the beginning of the employment of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and because it might have been inferred that this worn condition did not manifest itself until about the time when notice was given to the defendants\u2019 superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">3. It was the duty of the defendants to furnish reasonably safe appliances. The fact that this strap broke, coupled with evidence that its worn condition had been especially called to the attention of the representative of the defendants, was sufficient to\u201d make improper a ruling as matter of law that the defendants were not negligent. <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Davis Sulphur Ore Co. </em>165 Mass. 71. <em>Shannon </em>v. Willard, 201 Mass. 377. Whether the use being made of the strap at the time it gave way was within the line of duty of the deceased was for the jury. Hard pulling in order to tighten the binding of a load of barrels might have been found to be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
