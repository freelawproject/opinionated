P. died before the trial. A witness testified that P. told him that he was \u201c running the job,\u201d and that he was foreman. The plaintiff testified that he went to work on a certain day, that on the previous day he asked the defendant \u201c for a job \u201d on the barn and that the defendant said, \u201cGo and see P.,\u201d to which the plaintiff answered, \u201cI went to see him and he told me to come and see you, he wasn\u2019t hiring the men,\u201d and that the defendant then said \u201c Go and see him and tell him it is I told you to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>come there,\u201d that the plaintiff went to P. and was hired on that day and went to work on the morning of the next day. P.\u2019s son testified that \u201c the job started\u201d on the day on which the plaintiff testified that P. hired him, and the defendant testified that the contract with P. was made on the morning of the next day, on which the plaintiff testified that he went to work. So far as appeared, the only agreement of hiring which the plaintiff made was that to which he testified as above. There was evidence that after the accident by which the plaintiff was injured the defendant took the plaintiff home in his buggy, or hired his brother to do so and paid him for it. <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by the negligence of a superintendent of the defendant, which warranted a verdict for the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">Tort, by a carpenter against his alleged employer, for personal injuries sustained on October 24, 1908, caused by the collapse of a barn in process of construction on Eastern Avenue in Fall River, in which the plaintiff was at work.

One Perrault was in charge of the work. The evidence warranted a finding that the collapse of the barn was caused by the negligent method of erection pursued by Perrault. The defendant contended that Perrault was doing the work as an independent contractor, and the only question here is whether there was evidence that the plaintiff was hired by the defendant and not by Perrault as an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">If Perrault was not an independent contractor he was or could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>have been found to be a superintendent of the defendant. We are of opinion that there was evidence of that fact. Perrault was dead at the time of the trial. One witness testified that \u201c Perrault always told me that he was running the job; he was foreman.\u201d In addition the plaintiff testified that he went to work on October 20; that on October 19 he asked the defendant \u201c for a job \u201d on the barn and the defendant said \u201c Go and see Perrault.\u201d To which the plaintiff answered: \u201c I went to see him and he told me to come and see you, he wasn\u2019t hiring the men,\u201d and the defendant replied, \u201c Go and see him and tell him it is I told you to come there.\u201d That he then went to Perrault and was hired on that day and went to work on the morning of the next day, the twentieth. Perrault\u2019s son testified that \u201c the job started on the nineteenth of October,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s story was that the contract with Perrault was made on the morning of the twentieth. Not only was the plaintiff hired the day before the contract was made and seemingly at an earlier hour on that day, but so far as appears this was the only agreement of hiring which the plaintiff made. There was also evidence that the defendant took the plaintiff home in his buggy after the accident, or hired and paid his brother, a livery stable keeper, for doing so. This could be taken to be an admission that he was the person interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\n<em>jExceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
