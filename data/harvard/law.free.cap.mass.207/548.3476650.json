The plaintiff testified that as she was facing toward the side\" of the car and was in the act of sitting down, she first was thrown forward with a sudden jerk and then jerked back and that one of her companions, another witness, who was standing, was not thrown but would have been if she had not been holding on to a strap. The companion referred to testified that the accident happened at 11.30 in the evening and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>that people were going home from the theatre, that there were a number of jerks of the car near together violent enough to take one off one\u2019s feet, but that she was not taken off her feet because she recovered herself by taking hold of a strap. The third witness, another companion of the plaintiff, similarly described the movements of the car and testified that she saved herself from being thrown by taking hold of the door frame. <em>Held, </em>following <em>McGann </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>199 Mass. 446, that there was no evidence of so unusual a movement of the car as to warrant a finding that the motorman was negligent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b571-4\">A constant stopping and starting of an electric street car with a jerky movement to avoid collisions with persons, vehicles and cars as the car passes along a public street in front of a theatre from which crowds are emerging after an evening performance does not in itself constitute evidence of negligence on the part of the motorman.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-5\">Two actions oe tort, the first for injuries alleged to have been received by reason of the jerking and sudden starting of a closed electric car upon which the plaintiff was about to take a seat, as stated in the opinion. The second action originally was by the husband of the plaintiff in the first action and was for loss of consortium and expenses to which the husband was put because of the injuries to his wife. The husband died during the pendency of the actions, and the second action was prosecuted by the administrator of his estate, the claim for damages due to loss of consortium being waived. Writs dated November,26, 1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-6\">In the Superior Court the cases were tried together before <em>Wait, </em>J.

After the theatre they waited for a car at the corner of Washington and Boylston Streets. The car stopped. The plaintiff entered first, followed by Mrs. Goodwin, then by Mrs. Goodwin\u2019s daughter, and lastly by her own daughter. The plaintiff, her own daughter and Mrs. Goodwin testified at the trial; Mrs. Goodwin\u2019s daughter did not. The plaintiff\u2019s story was that she went to the forward end of the car because there was but one vacant seat at the rear. To quote her own words, \u201c She was in the act of sitting down when the car gave a sudden jerk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>threw her forward. She thought she was facing toward the side of the car at the time. She was just in the act of sitting down. She was thrown forward, first with a sudden jerk, and then jerked back, and fell, she thought on Mrs. Goodwin, . . . who had followed her into the car. When she sat down her left knee began to pain, and as a result of what happened, she suffered from pain and has a weakness in the leg.\u201d The plaintiff further testified that Mrs. Goodwin was not thrown down, but \u201cif she hadn\u2019t been holding on to a strap, she would have gone down too,\u201d and that no one else in the car was thrown over. Mrs. Goodwin testified that there were a number of jerks near together and \u201c violent enough to take you off your feet,\u201d but that they did not take her off her feet; that the sudden jerks threw the plaintiff off her feet into a passenger\u2019s lap, and \u201c jerked me some, but I recovered myself by taking hold of the strap.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s daughter testified that \u201c the car started and then stopped, not a dead stop, and then started again\u201d; that one motion followed the other suddenly, and that the car went \u201c a very, very little distance\u201d on the first start before it stopped again. That she had to support herself \u201c by taking hold of the door frame, or it would throw me in the car.\u201d That she did not see her mother thrown and could not do so, being behind Mrs. Goodwin and her daughter. The testimony showed that all four were safely seated, that no other persons boarded the car at the time, and that those previously in the car were seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We are of opinion that the evidence did not go far enough to warrant a finding that the motorman was negligent, and that the case comes within <em>McGann </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>199 Mass. 446. A jerk such as is usual might well throw a passenger \u201c just in the act of sitting down \u201d into the lap of a passenger next to her if the passenger was not prepared for it, and a person might well take hold of a door frame to steady himself in such a case. In <em>Byron </em>v. <em>Lynn Boston Railroad, </em>177 Mass. 303, one of the witnesses testified that the motion of the car there in question \u201c knocked me over, my hand against the sash of the window. I came near falling over the lady I had given my seat to.\u201d In spite of that it was held in that case that the evidence did not go far enough to warrant a. finding that the motorman was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Mrs. Goodwin\u2019s testimony gave the explanation of the series of jerks. She testified \u201cthat it was eleven-thirty and people were going home from the theatre.\u201d If the constant stopping and starting was to avoid collision with persons or carriages crossing ahead of the car, or because of cars ahead of it, there was no negligence on the part of the motorman. See in this connection <em>Timms </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>183 Mass. 193, 194, and <em>McGann </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>199 Mass. 446, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
