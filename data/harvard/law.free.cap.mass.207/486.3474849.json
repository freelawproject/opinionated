On the day in question the surface car of which the plaintiff was the conductor had reached the end of its run in the Sullivan Square station and the plaintiff was in the act of pulling out and fastening the fender for the return trip when he was run into by the negligence of the motorman of another surface car, who ran in for the same purpose on the same track behind the plaintiff\u2019s car. The judge <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> ruled that R. L. c. 106, \u00a7 71, as amended by St. 1908, c. 420, applied to such a car, found that the motorman was negligent, that the plaintiff\u2019s damages amounted to $500, and reported the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Unless this surface car was an \u201celevated train\u201d within St. 1908, c. 420, the plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy is against the motorman whose negligence caused the injury to him. <em>Fallon </em>v. <em>West End Street Railway, </em>171 Mass. 249. <em>McGilvery </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>200 Mass. 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The judge found that the car was not defective.
