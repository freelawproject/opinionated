The place of the accident was about one hundred yards from a light, and the lights were so placed between the trees as to throw no light at all except directly down to the ground. It was so dark at the place of the accident that \u201c you could run into somebody before you saw them,\u201d and \u201c you wouldn\u2019t notice the hole until you got up on to it.\u201d The superintendent of streets for the defendants testified that he had inspected the place of the accident two or three days before the accident occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-8\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to rule : (1) That \u201c upon all the evidence the plaintiff is not shown to have been in the exercise of due care and the verdict must be for the defendant \u201d; (2) that \u201c upon all the evidence the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ant is not shown to have been negligent and the verdict must be for the defendant \u201d; (3) that \u201c upon all the evidence the verdict must be for the defendant \u201d ; and (4) that \u201cif the jury find that the plaintiff upon the morning of the accident passed over the place and saw its defective condition and on returning at night walked along without paying any attention to it as she says she did, then she was not in the exercise of due care and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAEG\">judge refused to make any of these rulings, and submitted the case to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $3,700.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnV\">There is nothing in this case that calls \u2022 for the consideration of any but very familiar rules of law, and the facts are simple. The jury properly might find that there was a defect in the earth sidewalk on a much travelled street, which was in the form of a hole or gully, caused by a flow of water across the walk; that this defect had existed there for a long time; and that the authorities of the town knew it, or would have known it if they had exercised due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">It was a question for the jury whether the plaintiff, at the time of the accident, was using due care. The fact that she had passed over the hole before and knew of its existence does not, as a matter of law, preclude her from recovering. <em>Winship </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>201 Mass. 273. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>189 Mass. 7. <em>Greorge </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>110 Mass. 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
