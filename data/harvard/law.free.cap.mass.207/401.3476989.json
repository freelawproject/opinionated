L. c. 122, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10, for wrongfully refusing to transmit for the plaintiff a telegram written upon a blank of the defendant to which the plaintiff had attached a small sticker containing a notice that the message was a business one and that a failure to deliver it promptly would cause the sender financial loss, the defendant relied on the following rule : <em>\u201c </em>Messages to be on message forms. Each message for transmission will be written upon the form provided by the company for that purpose, or will be attached to such form by the sender or by the person presenting the message as the sender\u2019s agent, so as to leave the printed heading in full view above the message,\u201d It appeared that the plaintiff had no knowledge of the rule when he presented his message, that the rule was in a tariff book, which was open to the public in the defendant\u2019s office but which the defendant otherwise did nothing to call to the attention of the public. Inspection of the traffic book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>showed that the rule quoted above was a rule of the receiving department and was intended for the use and guidance of the company\u2019s agents and not for the public. The judge, who tried the case without a jury, found as facts, that the presence of the sticker on the telegram blank had no tendency to confuse the defendant's operator or to increase the probability of error or delay in transmitting the message, and that it did not obscure the printed heading above the message. The defendant contended that the rule forbade the sender of a message to put anything upon the face of the blank except the message, the date, and the name and address of the person to whom it was to be sent, and that the sticker and notice attached to the plaintiff\u2019s telegram were in violation of the rule. The defendant offered testimony that the defendant and its agents always had put this construction on the rule. The judge excluded the testimony and ruled that the construction put upon the rule by the defendant and its agents did not affect the rights of the plaintiff. He found as a fact that the rule was not intended for the public and ruled that it did not have the meaning which the defendant contended for, and that it was not a justification for the defendant\u2019s refusal to transmit the message. <em>Held, </em>that the findings of the judge were justified and that his rulings were correct; that the defendant\u2019s construction of the rule was immaterial, and that, even if the rule could have affected the plaintiff who had no knowledge of it, it merely required that messages should be written upon the forms provided for the purpose and did not forbid the writing or pasting of any other unobjectionable matter upon the same paper in such ,a way as not to mislead the defendant\u2019s agents or cause them inconvenience in the performance of their duties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b424-23\">In an action against a telegraph company under R. L. c. 122, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10, for wrongfully refusing to transmit a telegram, the defendant at the trial did not ask for any ruling that the statute was unconstitutional as a regulation of interstate commerce and this question seemed not to have been brought to the attention of the judge or to that of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, but the defendant asked the judge to rule that <em>\u201c </em>the defendant cannot be held liable under R. L. c. 122, \u00a7 9, for refusal to receive and transmit the message in question under the circumstances under which it was presented.\u201d This ruling was refused by the judge and the defendant excepted, and this court, against the plaintiff\u2019s contention, treated the question of the constitutionality of the statute as open under this exception.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b424-34\">Although it is settled, that telegraph lines extending through different States for use in the ordinary way are instruments of commerce, and that messages passing over them from one State to another in the transaction of business are a part of interstate commerce that is entitled to the protection of the Constitution of the United States, yet it also is well settled, that a statute like R. L. c. 122, \u00a7 9, requiring a telegraph company to receive despatches upon payment of the usual charges according to the regulations of the company and to transmit them faithfully and impartially, so long as Congress has passed no law upon the subject, is not a regulation of interstate commerce within the meaning of the constitutional provision, but is a proper police regulation for the enforcement of the rules and policy of the common law, which affects interstate commerce only incidentally.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b424-42\">R.

The judge found for the plaintiff on all three counts, requiring the plaintiff to elect between counts one and two, on each of which nominal damages in the sum of $1 were awarded. On count three the judge ordered that the defendant should forfeit to the plaintiff the sum of $50. The defendant alleged exceptions, raising the two questions not previously disposed of which are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-4\">The notice, mentioned in the opinion, which was printed on a small sticker attached by the plaintiff to the blank form of the defendant on which the plaintiff\u2019s message was written, was as follows: \u201c Notice is hereby given that this is a business message, and that failure to deliver it promptly and correctly is likely to cause the sender financial loss. Further particulars will be furnished if desired on application to the sender at 116 Bedford Street, Boston.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">The plaintiff, when he presented his message, tendered a sum of money sufficient to pay the charges for its transmission as an unrepeated message. When the message was presented to the clerk of the defendant at its office on Bedford Street, she said that she must see the manager, and the manager then stated to the plaintiff that the message could not be accepted with that notice attached, and that it was refused by instructions from headquarters. The only reason given by the defendant\u2019s manager or clerk for refusing to transmit the message was that the sticker was attached. The plaintiff was informed at the time that without the sticker the message would have been transmitted upon payment of the usual charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">The facts material to the rulings and findings of the judge in regard to the rule of the defendant quoted in the opinion are there stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">The sections of R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">This action was brought by the same plaintiff and tried at about the same time as <em>Vermilye </em>v. <em>Postal Telegraph Cable Co., </em>reported in 205 Mass. 598, and it is almost identical with that case in its facts, and in the findings and rulings of the Superior Court. The only questions raised by the defendant\u2019s exceptions in this case that are not covered by our decision in the other are two: one as to the effect of a certain rule of the defendant, and the other as to the constitutionality of the R L. c. 122, \u00a7\u00a7 9,10, in their application to a telegraph company that transmits messages in connection with interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The rule relied on by the defendant is as follows: \u201c Messages to be on message forms. Each message for transmission will be written upon the form provided by the company for that purpose, or will be attached to such form by the sender or by the person presenting the message as the sender\u2019s agent so as to leave the printed heading in full view above the message. \u201d The plaintiff had no knowledge of this rule when he presented the message. It was in a tariff book which was open to the public in the defendant\u2019s office, but the company did nothing to call the attention of the public to the book, beyond leaving copies of it in its office. The defendant contended that the rule forbade the sender of messages to put anything upon the face of the blank but the message, the date, and the name and address of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>person to whom it is to be sent, and that the \u201c sticker \u201d and notice attached to the plaintiff\u2019s telegram were in violation of this rule. Witnesses for the defendant were in court ready to testify that the defendant and its agents had always put this construction upon the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"ANR\">The judge ruled that the construction put upon it by the defendant and its agents was of no force to bind the plaintiff. This was plainly right. The question for the court was, what was the true meaning of the rule. Not only had the plaintiff done nothing in his dealings with the defendant that would affect him by the defendant\u2019s construction of the rule, but he did not even know of the existence of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"ARcE\">The judge found as a fact that the rule did not have the meaning for which the defendant contended. Inspection of the tariff book showed that this was a rule of the receiving department, and that this and other rules under the same and similar headings in the tariff book were intended for the use and guidance of the company\u2019s agents, and not for the public. The language of the rule shows that the judge was right in his construction of it. While it requires that messages shall be written upon the form provided for the purpose, it does not forbid the writing of any other unobjectionable matter upon the same paper, in such a way as not to mislead the agents or cause them inconvenience in the performance of their duties. It was put upon the paper by the plaintiff in the form of a sticker or a notice which it was proper for him to give to the company, orally or in writing, in any reasonable way. The judge found that its presence on the blank had no tendency to confuse the defendant\u2019s operator, or to increase the probability of error or delay in transmitting the message, and that it did not obscure the printed heading above the message. The judge was right in holding that this rule was not a justification for the defendant\u2019s absolute refusal to transmit the message.</p>\n<p id=\"ARN\">The only other question is whether the statute under which the plaintiff was permitted to recover is unconstitutional as a regulation of interstate commerce. ^Seemingly this question was not brought to the attention of the judge or the plaintiff\u2019s attorney at the trial, and perhaps it was not thought of then by anybody. But, against the plaintiff\u2019s contention, we treat it as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>open under the defendant\u2019s exception to the refusal of its fifth request for a ruling, namely, that \u201c the defendant cannot be held liable under R. L. c. 122, \u00a7 9, for refusal to receive and transmit the message in question under the circumstances under which it was presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">It is settled that telegraph lines extending through different States, to be used in an ordinary way, are instruments of commerce, and that messages passing over them from one State to another in the transaction of business are a part of interstate commerce that is entitled to the protection of the Constitution of the United States. <em>Pensacola Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>96 U. S. 1. <em>Telegraph Co. </em>v. Texas, 105 U. S. 460. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Pendleton, </em>122 U. S. 347. It is also as well settled by the highest authority that such a statute as that in question, so long as Congress passes no law upon the same subject, is not a regulation of interstate commerce, within the meaning of the constitutional provision, but is a proper police regulation for the enforcement of the rules and policy of the common law, which affects interstate commerce only incidentally. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>James, </em>162 U. S. 650. <em>Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway </em>v. <em>Haber, </em>169 U. S. 613, 634. <em>Missouri Pacific Railway </em>v. <em>Larabee Flour Mills, </em>211 U. S. 612, 622. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>213 U. S. 52, 55. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Commercial Milling Co. </em>218 U. S. 406. The defendant\u2019s counsel has given us no reason and has referred us to no decision that should call for a different conclusion. There is no constitutional objection to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery under the findings of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-27\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
