Bott.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>One hundred and fifty cases of these goods had been shipped in May and paid for. The plaintiff\u2019s shipper testified that he was in charge of the shipping department of the plaintiff, and that he knew that the clams in question, namely, the remaining one hundred and fifty cases, were shipped. The defendant testified that he received no bill of lading and no other notice in writing of that shipment or of the arrival of the clams except the invoice printed above. The defendant testified, however, that he might have known of the arrival of the clams at the station in Fall River. He testified that he did not take them from the station and that he refused to take the clams because he bought them less freight and the bill was marked \u201c f. o. b. Boston.\u201d The price named in the contract between the parties was ninety cents less freight, and the first shipment of one hundred and fifty cases was billed at that price and was paid for. The second shipment of one hundred and fifty cases was billed at eighty-five cents f. o. b. Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-4\">It appeared that ninety cents was the price per dozen cans and that there were six hundred dozen cans in one hundred and fifty cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">It was contended by the defendant that he was entitled to a deduction of five cents a dozen from the contract price under the guaranty contained in the contract, as follows: \u201c Price guaranteed against our own price up to time of shipment,\u201d and that the second invoice should have been billed to him at eighty-five cents less freight instead of eighty-five cents f. o. b. Boston, and that because of that overcharge he had a right to reject the goods. Upon this point the evidence was in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">Upon the receipt of the invoice for the second lot of clams the defendant immediately returned it with the statement that he could not use the clams at the above price, and the plaintiff mailed the invoice back to the defendant with no further comment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">Bott, who made the contract with the defendant for the plaintiff, testified on cross-examination that \u201cf. o. b. Boston \u201d meant that the freight was to be paid by the defendant; that at the time he closed the order with the defendant the plaintiff\u2019s price was ninety cents f. o. b. Boston, and that he allowed the defendant a concession of the freight because of the size of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>order and also for the purpose of getting the defendant\u2019s business for the future.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that at the time they sent the second invoice to the defendant on July 15, 1908, their price was eighty-five cents f. o. b. Boston in sales of twenty-five cases or over, ninety cents f. o. b. Boston on sales of fifteen cases, and ninety-five cents f. o. b. Boston on sales of five cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\">The defendant testified that the understanding by the trade as to the guaranty contained in the contract of sale was that if the market declined the buyer got the benefit. \u201c Q. Assuming the price went down ten cents what would be the benefit that would be allowed ? A. That would be ten cents a dozen. \u2014 Q.\" What would be the understanding by the trade when the list price is f. o. b. Boston ninety cents and if it is then reduced to eighty-five cents f. o. b. Boston ? A. Five cents.\u201d This evidence was not contradicted by the plaintiff or its witnesses, although the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses all were in court at the time that the testimony was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">Bott further testified that after the drop in price he came to Fall River, saw the defendant, and told him \u201c that they would be able to make a little better price on clams, and would be able to fill his order at eighty-five cents Boston,\u201d adding, \u201c He seemed well satisfied at the time and I considered the matter settled. We shipped the order according to the contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">The defendant testified as to this conversation that Bott came to him and told him that the clams had declined five cents a dozen and that the defendant\u2019s price would be reduced accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-7\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">1. Upon all the evidence judgment should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-9\">2. Upon all the evidence the title to the goods never passed to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-10\">3. Upon all the evidence there was no delivery of the goods to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-11\">4. Upon all the evidence the plaintiff cannot recover the sale price of the goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-12\">5. The defendant had a right to reject the goods upon the terms offered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>6. The title to the goods does not pass to the consignee by-delivery to the carrier where freight is paid by the consignor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-4\">7. A fair construction of this contract is that the defendant was to receive the benefit of any decline in price from the time that the contract was made up to the time of shipment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">8. Upon all the evidence the plaintiff failed to give the defendant the benefit of that decline of five cents per dozen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">The judge made the seventh ruling requested as above, and refused to make any of the others. He found for the plaintiff in the sum of $510 with interest. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-8\"><em>JD. R. </em>Radovshy, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-9\"><em>A. S. </em>Phillips, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b97-10\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayt\">The defendant contends, that, as the goods when packed were to be shipped to him by rail at a price from which the cost of transportation was to be deducted, the title did not ' pass until their arrival at his place of business. But there was no express clause in the agreement that this expense was to be borne by the seller, and, while the amount undoubtedly measured what the buyer would have to pay for carriage, the stipulation could be found to have been intended by the parties as a discount from the seller\u2019s regular prices, and not as a prepayment of the freight. The question was one of fact, and the finding for the plaintiff, having been warranted by the evidence, cannot be revised. <em>Suit </em>v. <em>Woodhall, </em>113 Mass. 391. <em>American Malting Co. </em>v. <em>Souther Brewing Co. </em>194 Mass. 89. It being settled that, unless there is an agreement or usage of the trade to the contrary, delivery to the carrier is a delivery to the buyer, when the sale becomes complete, the case at bar falls within this familiar rule, and, the title having passed, the refusal of the defendant to accept the clams was unjustifiable, and furnishes no defense to the action for the price. <em>Barrie </em>v. <em>Quinby, </em>206 Mass. 259. The plaintiff concedes, and the judge so ruled, that by a fair construction of the contract the defendant was entitled to the benefit of any decline in price during the period between the date of sale and the time of the shipment of the last invoice. But his further contention, that in the adjustment of the amount due, the plaintiff having allowed on the first invoice a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>discount below the regular price charged to other customers, he was bound on the second invoice to make a similar discount, is not in accordance with the terms of sale. The agreement was to give him the benefit of any drop in prices which they gave to other customers even if less than the contract called for, and, the price charged having been upon this basis, the defendant has no ground of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The requests were rightly refused, and the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
