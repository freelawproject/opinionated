The conductor testified that, before reaching the stopping place where the plaintiff desired to leave the car, the motorman lessened the speed of the car to cross some switches, then applied the power and started forward and, upon receiving the conductor\u2019s second signal, applied air brakes too quickly. <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence warranting a finding that the motorman was negligent in the operation of the car.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b573-10\">Tort for injuries alleged to have been received, while the plaintiff was a passenger upon a closed electric car of the defendant, by an unwarrantably sudden stopping of the car as stated in the opinion.

She testified that she was sitting on the last cross seat with one Callahan. As the car was nearing the crossing where she had asked the conductor to stop she got up, took hold of the handles in the upper corner of each of the two rear seats and stood in the aisle waiting for the car to stop, but the car did not stop. Then the conductor \u201c gave another quick bell,\u201d saying in a disturbed tone, \u201cWhat is the matter with that fellow?\u201d Thereupon, to quote the plaintiff\u2019s words, \u201cthe car came to a terrible stop \u201d; the stop \u201c was an unusual stop; I never saw one like it ... in its violence.\u201d \u201c I was thrown on the ground, on my back.\u201d She testified that she \u201chad quite a firm hold \u201d of the two handles, and that she knew of the signs in the defendant\u2019s cars asking passengers to \u201c Please be at the door when nearing your stop.\u201d This story was corroborated by Callahan. Callahan also testified that he stepped into the aisle to let the plaintiff, who was sitting next the window, pass out; that he took hold of the handle of the seat next in front of the seat on which he and the plaintiff had been sitting, and that he \u201cwas thrown backward like that against the side of the seat\u201d by the abrupt stop, and the seat back, of which he had hold, slid forward. The conductor was called as a witness by the defendant. He testified that the plaintiff was standing in the vestibule when the car stopped and that she was thrown against the end of the car, that she \u201cstarted to swing around\u201d and that he \u201c caught her arm and held her. I wasn\u2019t staggered at all, because I was used to the cars, and wasn\u2019t thrown at all.\u201d The conductor added that the motorman slowed down the car as it went over some switches and connections just before the plaintiff\u2019s stopping place, and then in place of bringing the car to a stop to let the plaintiff off he put on the power and started <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ahead whereupon he \u201cgave another bell\u201d and the motorman put on too much air or put it on too fast and \u201c brought up kind of abrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">We do not mean to intimate that the story of Callahan and the plaintiff taken alone would not have brought this case within <em>Lacour </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, </em>200 Mass. 34, <em>Black </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated </em>Railway, 206 Mass. 80, and <em>Work </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>ante, 447, nor that the conductor\u2019s testimony taken alone would not have brought it within <em>Cutts </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated </em>Railway, 202 Mass. 450. Upon those points it is not necessary to express an opinion for when the two are taken together there was without question evidence which warranted a finding that the motorman was negligent in the way he brought the car to a stop, and the case comes with the class of cases like <em>Work </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, ante, </em>447.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
