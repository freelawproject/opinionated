Writ in the First District Court of Bristol, dated December 11,1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADBh\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>Hardy, </em>J., without a jury, upon an agreed statement of facts. On a petition of the board of commissioners of savings banks to the Supreme Judicial Court the defendant was placed in the hands of a receiver on February 29, 1904. Previous to December 14,1909, the receiver in the administration of the defendant\u2019s affairs had collected practically all of its assets and had distributed to the depositors, among them the plaintiff, a dividend of seventy-five per cent, and, in order to pay to the depositors the balance still due them, it became \u201c necessary to levy an assessment upon the stockholders of the corporation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-31\">On December 14, 1909, the plaintiff filed the following petition in the receivership proceedings: \u201c And now comes Patrick Coyle of Taunton in said Commonwealth and says that he is a creditor of said trust company; that it appears from the receiver\u2019s report that there are not funds enough to pay his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>in full; that his claim is a debt or contract for which the stockholders of said company are liable to be assessed; wherefore he prays that he may be allowed to bring suit against said company that he may reduce his claim to judgment for the purpose of finally establishing said stockholders\u2019 liability.\u201d The petition was allowed and this action was brought. At the time it was brought there were no assets or property in the hands of the defendant. The judge found that the sole purpose of bringing this action was to enforce the liability of stockholders of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-3\">George B.

L. c. 110, \u00a7 60, the personal liability of stockholders created by R. L. c. 116, \u00a7 30. The only defense set up here is that before the date of the writ on a petition brought against it under R. L. c. 113, \u00a7 6 (which is applicable to trust companies by force of R. L. c. 116, \u00a7 37), all the property of the trust company had been put in the hands of a receiver to wind up its affairs and it had been enjoined from the further prosecution of any business. The defendant contends that this defense is good on the authority of what was said by Holmes, J., in <em>Archambeau </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>173 Mass. 249, 251: \u201c Apart from the statute, we cannot see how it is possible to justify bringing an action which it is admitted never can result in satisfaction from the defendants.\u201d The defendant also relies on <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Toppan, </em>3 Gray, 411, 412; <em>Train </em>v. <em>Marshall Paper Co. </em>180 Mass. 513; <em>Norfolk </em>v. <em>American Steam Gras Co. </em>108 Mass. 404, 407. But the answer to that is that the amendment to R. L. c. 116, \u00a7 30, made by St. 1905, c. 228 (authorizing receivers of insolvent trust companies to enforce the personal liability of stockholders which is here in question), of necessity implies that a judgment can be obtained against a trust com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>pony in the hands of a receiver. We do not intimate that the result would not have been the same before the enactment of St. 1905, c. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
