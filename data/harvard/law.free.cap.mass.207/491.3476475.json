There also was evidence that, a controversy arising as to whether the plaintiff should be paid anything, the matter was brought before the defendant\u2019s board of directors who left it to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>secretary of the defendant \u201c to settle,\u201d the secretary testifying that <em>\u201c </em>it was allowed that we owed him this amount.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence for the jury on the question of the defendant\u2019s liability.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b514-4\">The declaration in an action of contract against a corporation contained three counts, the first being for alleged arrears of salary, the second for a fixed amount alleged to be due as a commission for bringing about a sale of shares of capital stock of the defendant, and the third, alleged to be for the same cause of action as the second, being on a <em>quantum meruit </em>for bringing about the sale of the capital stock. At the trial there was evidence for the jury on the first and the third counts, but none on the second. The defendant asked for a ruling as to each count that on all the evidence the jury should find for the defendant. The rulings were refused. The jury found a general verdict for the plaintiff for an amount equal to the amount claimed in the first count with interest from the date of the writ, which was less than the amount claimed in the second count, and the defendant alleged exceptions. While the defendant\u2019s exceptions were pending, hut before they were entered in this court, the plaintiff filed a motion, alleging that \u201c the evidence at the trial would have warranted \u201d the verdict which was rendered \u201c on the first count, and upon no other,\u201d and asking that the verdict be entered on the first count and that on the second and third counts judgment be entered for the defendant. The motion was allowed, subject to an exception by the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that the exception must be overruled because the defendant was not harmed by the granting of the motion and justice did not require a new trial.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">Contract, with a declaration in three counts. The first count was upon an account annexed for a balance of $488.70 and interest, alleged to be due to the plaintiff as salary as vice president and treasurer\u2019s assistant of the defendant from November 10, 1902, to March 15, 1903, at $50 per week. The second count was for bringing about a sale of capital stock of the defendant, the count alleging a special agreement made with the plaintiff by the defendant through its treasurer and manager, and claiming $1,000 as \u201c the usual and customary commission \u201d for the bringing about of the sale. The third count, alleged to be for the same cause of action as that set out in the second count, was upon a <em>quantum meruit </em>for the services in bringing about the sale of stock. Writ dated April 10,1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">The case was tried in the Superior Court before Sherman, J. The following is the substance of the material evidence :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">As to the sale of stock, the plaintiff testified: \u201c In the spring of 1902, a broker by the name of Solomon was employed by the treasurer [of the defendant], to obtain a purchaser for stock of the company, and a purchaser applied to him. Solomon requested some one connected with the company to take the matter up with this purchaser. The treasurer asked me to do this. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>I asked if I would be paid for my time, and she said I would be well paid for it. I took the matt\u00e9r up with the purchaser and he subsequently bought the stock and paid $20,000 for it. A commission was paid to Solomon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-3\">The plaintiff further testified that in May of 1902 a conversation took place between one Amanda M. Lougee, treasurer and manager of the defendant, and himself in the presence of one William H. Chick, secretary of the defendant, in which Miss Lougee stated to him that she was contemplating taking a long vacation in Colorado and desired him to give his whole time to the defendant\u2019s business; that he told her that he should want $50 per week and \u201c one per cent on sales \u201d [of capital stock] ; that she said she was willing to make a contract with him; that he said he should want a contract for one year; that she said she was willing to make such a contract, but that \u201c the amount of commission was to be- left until she came back, she thought it excessive, so we left it in abeyance \u201d; that he went to work under that arrangement \u201c for a year,\u201d and was paid the salary of $50 per week until the following November 10, when the treasurer refused to pay him more than $25 per week. It appeared that, at the rate of $25 per week since November 10, there was $3.70 due him at the date of the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-4\">The plaintiff further testified that he rendered to the treasurer of the defendant a statement of the amount set out in the account annexed to the first count of the declaration, and that he had a conversation with the other directors of the defendant two hours before the annual directors\u2019 meeting. \u201c They said they wanted to settle this thing up, and they wanted me on the board, and they thought we had better settle our differences. Miss Lougee said that. I said \u2018 Well, do you acknowledge that you owe me? \u2019 She said, \u2018Well, I suppose I will have to.\u2019 And Mr. Chick spoke up and said, \u2018 Remember what you are doing, because if you acknowledge you owe you have got to settle.\u2019 She said, \u2018Well, I admit I owe it.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff also testified that at the directors\u2019 meeting it was voted \u201c that they settle with me, and Mr. Chick be appointed a committee of one to settle that claim and get it out of the way.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">William H. Chick, called by the plaintiff, testified in corroboration of the plaintiff as to the agreement that he should be paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>for his services $50 per week for a year, that the treasurer and manager was absent for about three months, and that the plaintiff managed the company while she was gone. As to the conversations on the day of the directors\u2019 meeting, and as to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for commissions for sale of capital stock, he testL fled: The plaintiff \u201c brought a slip of paper on which he had made up his account, and spoke about what was owed him.... I stopped [Miss Lougee] and said, \u2018Now, Miss Lougee, if you talk about what you owe this man, or about how you are going to settle it, you accept this. Now do you consider you owe him this ? \u2019 She said, 61 do, but we don\u2019t want to pay it now, but we want to fix up this matter so we can go along.\u2019 There was some talk about what cash he wanted and what balance would be paid in stock. His suggestion was to make payments of so much a week. That was the same day as the directors\u2019 meeting, Mr. Fallon was there, but he withdrew from the meeting. There was some talk among the directors about paying this money to him now. It was allowed he was owed this amount, but we wanted to try and make the best settlement we could. Then the meeting was adjourned, and they made me a committee of one to make that settlement. . . . There was nothing said to me direct at any time by Miss Lougee in regard to commission on account of stock sold. Mr. Fallon [the plaintiff] and I talked, and on his slip of paper I wrote \u2018 Stock for Hyneman.\u2019 That was the claim for what was due him, and the way it was to be settled. He said, \u2018 If I have got to get my claim for salary, I think I might as well have what is due me as commission.\u2019 I asked him if there was anything which he claimed was due him for commissions, and he said, \u2018 I do,\u2019 and I wrote on the inside of that little paper, \u2018 Stock for Mr. Hyneman,\u2019 \u2014 that is, commission for the stock sold to Hyneman. That was my abbreviation.\u201d Later the witness Chick testified, \u201cAt the meeting of the directors it was the opinion of all present that they did not owe him anything.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-7\">The treasurer of the defendant testified that the arrangement she made with the plaintiff was that he should be paid $50 per week during her absence, and that nothing was said as to commissions; that when November was reached, she stated to the plaintiff that \u201c the company could no longer afford to pay $50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>per week, blit that $25 was all that it could pay the plaintiff thereafter \u201d; that at the directors\u2019 meeting she stated that <em>\u201c </em>we owed him [the plaintiff] nothing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-3\">The president of the company testified in corroboration of the treasurer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-4\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked for a ruling as to each count of the declaration that on all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover on that count. The rulings were refused, and all three counts were left to the jury, who on March 15, 1905, returned a general verdict for the plaintiff for $489.54; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">The defendant thereafter moved for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence and the weight of the evidence, and that the verdict was contrary to law. The motion was denied on March 24,1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">On April 8,1909, the plaintiff filed the following motion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-7\">\u201c And now comes the plaintiff and says that it appears by the record that the declaration was in three counts; that the first count was for services claimed to have been performed upon an agreement made with the defendant in the sum of $438.70 and interest; that the verdict was a general verdict in the sum of $489.54; that the evidence at the trial would have warranted that verdict on the first count, and upon no other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-8\">\u201c Wherefore he moves . . . that said verdict may be entered upon the first count thereof, and that on the second and third counts judgment be entered for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-9\">The motion was allowed; and the defendant alleged a further exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-10\"><em>E. F. McOlennen, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-11\"><em>J. Bennett, (W. E.

There was evidence that the treasurer of the defendant agreed with the plaintiff to pay him the sum of $50 per week for the services which he was to render; that he rendered these services with the knowledge and consent of the defendant and its officers; and that he was paid at that rate for about five months. This warranted a finding that the treasurer\u2019s agreement had been either originally authorized or subsequently ratified by the corporation. And Chick, the defendant\u2019s secretary, testified that when the plaintiff\u2019s bill was presented at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>meeting of the directors, \u201cit was allowed he was owed this amount, but we wanted to try and make the best settlement we could.\u201d His further testimony, apparently on cross-examination, that all the directors thought \u201c that they did not owe him anything,\u201d was to be weighed only in connection with what he formerly had said. <em>Dunton </em>v. <em>Derby Desk Co. </em>186 Mass. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">2. It may be, though we should hesitate so to decide, that a verdict for the plaintiff on the second count was not warranted. There was to be sure nothing to indicate what the usual commission in such a case was. But this is not now material; for if the jury allowed him any commission it is evident from the amount of the verdict that the finding as to that must have been upon the third count.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">3. Upon the third count the evidence was meagre, but there was something for the jury. Besides the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to his agreement with the treasurer it could be found on Chick\u2019s testimony that this matter too was brought before the board of directors by Chick\u2019s memorandum on the plaintiff\u2019s bill for services, and was included in their approval, in spite of Chick\u2019s further testimony already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">4. Under these circumstances, the defendant was not harmed by the order made on the plaintiff\u2019s motion that the verdict should be entered on the first count, and that judgment should be entered for the defendant on the second and third counts. The averment in that motion, \u201c that the evidence at the trial would have warranted that verdict on the first count, and upon no other,\u201d may be treated as meaning only that a verdict for that amount, being the sum claimed in the first count with interest from the date of the writ, must have been rendered upon that count alone. Whether or not this conclusion is an absolutely necessary one, it is yet manifest that a judgment upon the verdict as amended gives to the plaintiff exactly what the jury found and were warranted in finding to be due to him, and finally disposes of all the issues in the case. Computation shows that the verdict was for the amount claimed in the first count with interest to the date of the verdict; arid therefore it is highly probable, if not practically certain, that the verdict was rendered upon the first count only.
