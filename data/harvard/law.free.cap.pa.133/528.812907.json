She served as such trustee until her death in 1879, when H. E. Harmony was appointed trustee in her stead. On the death of Phcebe Gosner, H. E. Harmony became her executor, and as such on March 11,1880, filed an account for her as trustee of David Gosner. This account, as well as H. E. Harmony\u2019s account as executor of Phcebe Gosner, was referred to <em>Mr. Frank Reeder, </em>as auditor, to examine and if occasion required to re-state, and to make distribution according to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-9\">The auditor reported that he had caused the usual notice of the audit to be given by publication; that he had also notified David Gosner and the devisees of Phoebe Gosner by mail, and had received from them by mail acknowledgments of the receipt of the notices. He also reported the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-10\">Phcebe Gosner, as trustee of David G osner, received @1,624.03, as the proceeds of David\u2019s share of the property. This money David persuaded his sister to let him have, thus receiving the whole fund though only entitled to the income thereof. He gave her as security two notes to her order as trustee, one for @442.50 and one for @110, and also a bond and mortgage, made' to her individually, for @1,200. These securities proved worthless, and in December, 1880, H. E. Harmony, as executor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Phoebe Gosner, obtained judgment against David Gosner, and subsequently by an attachment execution he attached all of David\u2019s interest under the will of Anna Catharine Gosner, deceased, and made himself, as trustee of David Gosner, garnishee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">Upon these facts, the auditor on February 12,1881, reported the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">\u201c That the principal of the trust, payable to the heirs of David Gosner after his death, is $1,624.08 ; that the said David Gosner shall pay to H.

E. Harmony, nor of the confirmation of said account; that he had no reason to believe that his right to the interest of the trust fund would be adjudicated by the auditor, and had no knowledge of the auditor\u2019s report, or of the conditional decree made thereon. As further grounds for review the petitioner alleged the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-8\">1. That there is error of law apparent on the face of the record of adjudication, as above set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-9\">2.

That the transfer of the income of said trust fund, by the decree of said auditor, is against the express terms of said trust, as established by the will of Anna Catharine Gosner, deceased, which provides that said devise shall not under any circumstances enure to the benefit of the creditors of the said David Gosner, nor the estate thereby given be at all liable for his debts, or under his control or that of his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-6\">5. That said H. E. Harmony, as executor of Phoebe Gosner, deceased, represented interests antagonistic to the right and interest of your petitioner, whose trustee he was, and his acts constituted a fraud upon your petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-7\">Answers having been filed, the court below, upon argument, dismissed the petition, without filing an opinion.
