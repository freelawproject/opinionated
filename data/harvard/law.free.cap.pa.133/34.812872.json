M. Hoppes, Agents,\u201d were plaintiffs, and A. W.

M. Hoppes, Agts., G. B. Wagner and Wm.

M. Hoppes, Agts. [l. s.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">\u201cW. M. Hoppes. Chas. B.

S.] \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-8\">On June 3, 1889, the writ having been returned served, and defendant\u2019s property attached, as per schedule, the defendant moved to quash the attachment for the reasons following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-9\">1. The plaintiff already has issued a writ of attachment for the same cause of action to No. 127 July Term 1889, which was quashed by this court after service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-10\">2. The said plaintiff has a judgment for the amount claimed, entered to No. 129 July Term 1889, on which a writ of fieri facias has been issued, a levy on the personal property of the defendant made and still pending in the hands of the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-11\">3. The bond is not in the form required by the act of 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-12\">A rule having been granted, after argument, the court, Pershing, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-13\">A prior attachment was issued in this case to No. 127 July Term 1889, which was quashed, and the costs paid. That proceeding, therefore, was at an end. The plaintiffs having made another affidavit and filed a new bond, issued the above stated attachment for the same cause of action. The defendant contends that this cannot be done, and refers to National Bank v. Tasker, 1 Pa. C. C. R. 173, and Robinson v. Atkins, 2 W. N. 111, in support of this position. These cases, however, do not go so far. They, on this point, only decide that two attachments cannot issue in the same suit or action. We think the quashing of the first attachment was equivalent to a nonsuit, which left the plaintiffs free to pursue any remedy provided by law for the recovery of their claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>But' there are other and more serious difficulties in the way of sustaining the present attachment. The act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 197, amendatory of the act of 1869, prescribes that before the attachment shall issue, there shall be executed and filed with the prothonotary, \u201c a bond to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, <em>for the use of the parties interested, </em>in the penalty of at least double the amount claimed, with good and sufficient surety to be approved by one of the judges of the court,\u201d etc. The words above underscored have been omitted from the bond filed in the case in hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-5\">The attachment act of 1869, \u00a7 2, provides, that \u201c every such attachment shall be made returnable on the first return day of said court next after the time of issuing thereof.\u201d In Parks v. Watts, 112 Pa. 4, the attachment was made returnable to the next term. Monthly return days were fixed by law for that county, Crawford, and one of these intervened between the issuing of the attachment and the date of the next term of the court. For the reason that the statute had not been strictly followed, the Supreme Court affirmed the action of the court below in quashing the proceeding. This is a rigid construction of the act, and is necessarily fatal to the bond in this case. If the language of the statute, \u201c shall,\u201d is mandatory as to the return day, it is equally mandatory as to what must be written in the bond, which would seem to be the more important matter of the two. The parties for whose use a bond is given may become liable for costs \u201cin like manner as plaintiffs in other cases \u201d and how are they to be ascertained unless named?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\">Another matter in reference to the bond is suggested at this point. It is signed \u201c A. &amp; D. M. Hoppes, Agts. [l. S.] \u201d No authority is shown for one of these partners to sign in the name of the firm. It is familiar law,, that one partner has no power to bind another by an instrument under seal, although the instrument itself did not require a seal: Schmertz v. Shreeve, 62 Pa. 457.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\">Among other facts in this controversy, it appears that shortly after the second attachment (the one in Jhand) was issued, Houtz, the defendant, confessed a judgment to Samuel Frack, in trust for a large number of his creditors, including the firm of A. &amp; D. M. Hoppes. Upon a fieri facias issued on this judgment, the personal property of the defendant was levied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>on by tbe sheriff, and, as I understand, this is the same property, already in the custody of the sheriff, which was seized in the attachment proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">A legal question presents itself hero, which has not been raised and which need not be discussed in the view we take of the case. The plaintiffs seem to have acquiesced in this judgment, and in its use for their benefit. In Brenner v. Moyer, 98 Pa. 274, the plaintiffs instituted a suit, and also issued an attachment on the same day for the same cause of action. They recovered a judgment in the suit, and then proceeded with the trial on the attachment. It was held that the judgment first recovered was a bar to recovery in the attachment suit; that where two personal actions are instituted between the same parties for the same cause of action, a recovery of judgment in one extinguishes the right to recover judgment in the other. \u201c The first judgment when given, whether it be in the action commenced first or last, extinguishes the original cause of action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\">The affidavit of the plaintiffs charges the defendant with having fraudulently confessed a judgment or judgments to Daniel Track. No depositions have been taken by either side, and the facts are not before us which would enable us to form any opinion as to the honesty of this transaction. A confessed judgment is not presumed to bo fraudulent. The facts when properly proved may make it so: Lennig v. Senior, 21 W. N. 379.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\">We will dissolve this attachment mainly for the defects in the bond. In the absence of an answer on the part of the defendant we will make no order to quash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-8\">\u2014A general bill of exceptions having been sealed, the plaintiffs took this appeal, specifying that the court erred: 1. In dissolving the attachment. 2. In not discharging the rule to show cause why the attachment should not be dissolved. 4. In making said rule absolute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-9\"><em>Mr. A. W. Schalck </em>and <em>Mr. M.

It brings up nothing but the record. From it we learn that the proceeding below was an attachment under the act of 1869, and that the court dissolved it. The record does not show the ground upon which the attachment was dissolved. Nor is it material, as the order was interlocutory and not reviewable here. It was a matter within the discretion of the court below, and we have nothing before us to show that this discretion was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"AGI\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
