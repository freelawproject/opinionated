Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-8\">At the trial on March 28, 1889, the case shown was in substance as follows : On May 9, 1884, the plaintiff, through one Westbrook, the agent or manager of the Pen Argyl Land Improvement Company, the defendant, purchased three lots of ground alleged to lie within the limits of the borough of Pen Argyl. The deed of the defendant company, dated that day, was delivered by the agent to the plaintiff, the latter giving, for the consideration to be paid, his note for $625, payable to the order of Samuel M. Schenck, the company\u2019s secretary, three months after date. The plaintiff at once began to build upon the lots. On May 22, 1884, having been informed that the lots were outside the borough limits, he complained about the matter to Westbrook, who assured him that the lots were within the borough, but he was not satisfied and stated that he would not go on with his building. Thereupon Westbrook drew and executed an agreement, on the part of the defendant company, in substance to the effect that if the lots were not within . the borough, the company would hold the plaintiff\u2019s note for two years, and in the meantime endeavor to get them in; and, if at the end of two years the lots were not in the borough, the note should be considered paid and should be returned to the plaintiff. This agreement was not under seal, and it was signed, \u201cPen Argyl Land Improvement Company, by H. Westbrook, agent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-10\">On June 2, 1884, the plaintiff communicated with Mr. Schenck, and the latter wrote in reply that-he had parted with the plaintiff\u2019s note and wished to have Mr. Westbrook\u2019s agreement modified as follows: \u201c If the borough lines are not extended as he agreed, then I will agree that the amount of your note be refunded to you, you agreeing on your part to do all you can towards having the borough lines extended.\u201d This was satisfactory to the plaintiff, who went on and completed his improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The note of the plaintiff was paid by him at maturity to the holder of it, and the defendant company refusing, after the lapse of two years, to carry out the agreement to reftmd the amount of the note, this action was brought. The matters in controversy were (1) whether the lots were in or out of the borough, and (2) whether Westbrook or Schenck, or both of them, had authority to bind the company to return the purchase money of the lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">At the close of the testimony, the court Reeder, J., instructed the jury at length, and answered the points presented as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">The plaintiff requests the court to charge :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-8\">1.

Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">We are unable to see the necessity of twenty-seven assignments of error in this case. There was one question of fact, viz., was the property outside the borough limits ? and, if so, there was the further question of law, whether the parties by their agreement had liquidated the damages b3r the amount of the note. The jury have found the question of fact in favor of the plaintiff below, and we think the court ruled the question of law correctly. We notice nothing in the other assignments which requires discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
