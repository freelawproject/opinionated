On cross-examination:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-10\">Q. I am asking you whether you would sell to somebody for $700, who would not offer to pay damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>By tlie court: It is not a question whether he is willing to sell or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-4\">Mr. Snyder: The question we propose to ask this witness is, whether he would take $700 for this property now?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-5\">By the witness: You give me the $700 and the amount of the damage, and I will give it to you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-6\">Mr. Bland: The question is incompetent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-7\">By the court: Objection sustained; exception.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-8\">The plaintiff having rested, the defendant called John Bar-bey, who testified that he was acquainted with the plaintiff\u2019s property, with the manner in which the siding was constructed, and that the market value of the property before the railroad was constructed was $1,200 or $1,250, and that after the construction it was $1,100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\">Q.

How is this property injured? A. It may not be as easy of access as before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-15\">Mr. Snyder: The plaintiff having testified that the property is injured by the running of trains on the road, that in that way the house is shaken, plaster loosened and hot smoke driven into the second story, and the plaintiff having declared that, by the dust, dirt, noise and disturbance caused by the usual and ordinary operations of the said railroad, his property is injured and depreciated, the defendants now propose to show how the siding is used, for what purpose it is used and has been used, and to show the amount of freight that is transferred and. the number of trains that are run; this in order to give the jury such information as will enable them to estimate the injury, if any, there is to this property, caused by the ordinary and probable uses to which this railroad may be put.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-16\">Mr. Bland: The proposed inquiry is immaterial and incompetent, for the reason that the branch road put down by the company upon Gordon street is a public highway, and the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>fendant company has a right to use it to its fullest extent, and whether the defendant does so now or not is a matter immaterial; they have an unlimited right so to do, and it is not relevant or material to this case that the defendants are now using the said railroad in a limited manner; the law gives them the right to use it to its fullest extent or capacity for use, and it is to be presumed that in the course of time, and as the necessities of the road require it, they will so use it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-4\">By the court: So far as this offer is concerned, it is entirely too comprehensive. We will sustain this objection and give the defendant an exception.4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-5\">Q. In your judgment, the market value of that property, as it was right after the road was constructed, is $1,100 ? A.
