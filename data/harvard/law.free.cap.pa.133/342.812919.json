Griesemer was duly appointed trustee thereunder, in the place of George D. Stitzel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\">The adjudication was as follows, Schwartz, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-10\">There is a contention between the creditors of the decedent and the guardian of the minor son, Harry Mannerback, respect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ing the distribution of this fund. The former contend that the decedent had an absolute estate in it; and the latter that it was but for life, with the remainder over to his children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">The fund was realized under the decedent\u2019s father\u2019s will. The question for solution is, did the father bequeath him an absolute or a life-estate ? The same must be gathered from the former\u2019s entire will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\">The first clause of the father\u2019s will bequeathed to his son, Samuel, the decedent, the sum of nine hundred dollars. The second clause directs the residue of his estate to be divided into four equal shares. The third clause gives one of said shares to each of three of his children, viz: George W., Rosa R. and Samuel L., which, so far as this account is concerned,' consists of personalty, \u201c each to receive the interest only of his or her share respectively during his or her natural life, and upon the death of each of the said children, then the children of such deceased child shall take absolutely and without restriction, in equal shares, the share so limited to their parent during his or her natural life.\u201d The ninth clause, referring to the share of Samuel, the interest in controversy here, provides that in the event of Samuel dying \u201c before attaining the age of twenty-one years without leaving issue living at the time of his death, his share shall vest and be equally divided among the testator\u2019s other children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-8\">The general question is, does Samuel take his share absolutely or merely the interest for life ? And this again depends upon whether those who are to take after Samuel, viz.: his offspring, shall take through him, or as direct objects of testator\u2019s bounty. If the gift in Samuel is absolute, under the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case, the trust does not prevent its immediate vesting. It is difficult to determine whether the testator used the word \u201c children \u201d in the sense of \u201c issue,\u201d or in its natural and legal acceptation. The testator seems to use the words children and issue indiscriminately through his entire will. In the ninth clause, however, when the testator comes to limit the extent of Samuel\u2019s interest, and the contingency upon which that interest is to go to his other children, he says that should he (Samuel), die before attaining the age of twenty-one years without leaving issue living at his death, then the share, which would otherwise vest in Samuel\u2019s children, shall be equally divided among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>his surviving brothers and sisters. Here the word \u201c issue \u201d is undoubtedly used in its technical sense, and was intended not only to embrace children, but the issue of the deceased children, if living at Samuel\u2019s death. In other words, any issue living at Samuel\u2019s death should take under this gift.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">From the other parts of the will, it also appears to have been the intention of the testator to limit and bequeath his entire estate to his lineal descendants ad infinitum. In Yaruall\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 335, and Ilaldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29, the doctrine is established that when the testator intends the estate to go to the whole body of persons constituting in law the entire descent lineal, he means \u201c issue, or heirs of the body,\u201d and this under the act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 368, is enlarged into an absolute estate. Distribution will have to be made accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">\u2014Accordingly, after directing payment of the costs and of the claims of creditors of Samuel L. Mannerback, deceased, the auditing judge awarded the one third of the residue of the fund to a trustee for Mary Mannerback, and the other two thirds to the guardian of Harry Mannerback. Exceptions to the adjudication having been dismissed and the adjudication confirmed, the Heading Trust Company, guardian of Harry Mannerback, took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">4. In not distributing the entire balance of the fund, after deducting costs, to the appellant, as guardian of Harry Mannerback.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-9\"><em>Mr. Isaao Hiesler </em>(with him <em>Mr. W. D. </em>Horning), for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-10\">\u25a01. The trust in this case was an active one, because the trustee had active duties to perform, viz.: (a) to invest the trust fund; (6) to preserve it for the remaindermen; and <em>(e) </em>to preserve it from the creditors of the life-tenant as a spendthrift trust: Rife v. Geyer, 59 Pa. 393; Bacon\u2019s App., 57 Pa. 504. The trust terminated on Samuel\u2019s death and vested in his children absolutely as a legal estate. The life estate being equitable and the estate in remainder legal, the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case does not apply: Preston on Estates, 382; Fearne on Remainders, 56; Smith on Executory Interests, \u00a7 470; Bacon\u2019s App., 57 Pa. 504; Little v. Wilcox, 119 Pa. 440; Carson v. Fuhs, 131 Pa. 256; Rife v. Geyer, 59 Pa. 393. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The cases cited by the court below, Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29, and Yarnall\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 335, are not applicable, because the trusts in favor of the life-tenants therein were dry trusts. The decree of the court renders all the testator\u2019s precautions to protect against creditors useless.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-6\">2. Even if the life-estate and the estate in remainder were both legal, this will would not vest in Samuel an estate-tail, because the failure of issue is not indefinite, but is a failure which must take place, if at all, at Samuel\u2019s death, and in such case the first taker has a life-estate: Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 <em>W. </em>447; Nicholson v. Bettle, 57 Pa. 384 ; Lantz v. Trusler, 37 Pa. 482. The clear meaning of this will is, that after the death of Samuel, his children should become the owners of his share as purchasers. Although the word \u201c children \u201d may be used in the sense of heirs of the body, there must be an express warrant for such a construction, going beyond conjecture or'even equilibrium of apparent intention: Guthrie\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 9. Moreover, the word \u201c issue \u201d has a different meaning as to personalty from that which it has in devises of realty, and Samuel\u2019s share being personalty, the remaindermen take as purchasers: Sheets\u2019 Est., 52 Pa. 257; Myers\u2019s App., 49 Pa. 111.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-7\"><em>Mr. Gr. B. Stevens </em>(with him <em>Mr. J. H. Marx), </em>for the appellees :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-8\">1. This trust cannot be sustained as a spendthrift trust, as Samuel was a toddling infant when the will was written and admitted to probate, and there was nothing to justify the creation of such a trust for his benefit. Assuming that every trust must have some good reason or object to support it, this trust became executed by reason of the fact that Samuel did not \u201c die before attaining the age of twenty-one years without leaving issue,\u201d and on attaining his majoritjr Samuel was entitled to his estate in possession: Ogden\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 501; Yarnall\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 335; Lewin on Trusts, 209. That he did not then claim it, is no reason why we should not now do so for him: Silknitter\u2019s App., 45 Pa. 365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-9\">2. If, therefore, this is not a spendthrift trust and the gift is to the cestui que trust for life, with remainder to his issue, the law casts on Samuel an absolute estate, which is charge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>able with his debts: Price v. Taylor, 28 P . 95; Dodson v. Ball, 60 Pa. 492; Yarnall\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 335. The devise over utterly failed, and there is no further attempt in the will to restrict or limit the devise to Samuel, so as to make his share descend in any other manner than by the intestate laws. The only restriction is upon the enjoyment, not upon the quantity of the estate. The estate passed out of the testator and did not vest in the trustee; the only person in whom it could vest was Samuel, \"who took an estate-tail, enlarged to a fee: Wild\u2019s Case, 6 Rep. 17. It is argued that this fund is wholly personal, and a different rule of construction prevails. But there was no direction to the executor to convert real estate, and we must look at the fund as it was at the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\"> Cf.

Justice Williams:</author>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">This case depends on the construction of the will of Prisca Levan Mannerback. The testator, after certain specific bequests, directed that the residue of his property, real, personal, and mixed, should be divided into four equal parts, that being the number of his children. He gave one part each to Samuel, George, and Rosa, and the other part to the children of William, with the direction that \u201c each of my said children shall receive the interest only of his or her respective share during his or her natural life, and, upon the death of each of my said children, then the children of such deceased child shall take absolutely and without restriction, in equal shares, the share so limited to their parent during his or her natural life.\u201d The testator then appoints George D. Stitzel trustee for all his children, and gives him full power to \u201creceive, collect, hold, and invest as he may deem most advantageous,\u201d the entire fund, with direction to pay the interest on one fourth of it to each of his children during life. He expressly provides that the interest so to be paid by the trustee shall not be liable for the debts of his children, nor liable to seizure or attachment, nor capable of assignment or transfer by way of anticipation, and that nothing but the receipt of the child entitled to the interest shall be a discharge to the trustee from his liability to pay. The persons to whom the estate was to pass from the trustee on the death of the children of the testator are described in item third of the will as \u201c the children of my children.\u201d In the seventh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>item they are described as \u201c my grandchildren.\u201d The purpose of the testator to be gathered from these provisions, and from the whole will, was to give his estate absolutely to his grandchildren on the decease of his own children, and meantime to secure the payment of the annual income in- equal parts to his children during their lives. To secure this result, he created a trust imposing the duty of the management of his estate and the collection and payment of the income on the trustee. Upon the death of one of his children leaving children or issue surviving, one fourth of the estate was to be paid over to such children absolutely, until, upon the death of the last one, the payment of the last share to the children of such child of the testator would execute the trust, and leave the trustee with no further duties to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">It would be difficult to imagine a clearer case of an active trust than that created by this will. Samuel Mannerback, one of the four children of the testator, died some time after coming of age, leaving a widow and one child to survive him. The question- raised is over the disposition of the one fourth of the estate on which he received the income during his life from the trustee. This depends, as the learned judge of.the court below well said, on the answer to the question, \u201c Does Samuel take his share absolutely, or merely the interest for life ? \u201d The trust company is the guardian of his child, and claims the fund for its ward, while the creditors of Samuel and his widow were allowed by tbe court to come in on the fund, on the theory that Samuel was the absolute owner of one fourth of the estate of the testator. This is contrary to the general scheme or purpose of the testator, which was to give his estate absolutely to his grandchildren. It is opposed to the express terms of the bequest, which provided that \u201c each of my said children shall \u25a0receive the interest only,\u201d and this'for the natural life of each. It subjects the principal to the debts of Samuel, although the testator had directed that it should go to Samuel\u2019s children, and had declared that the interest should not be liable for the debts of Samuel, should not be subject to attachment, nor capable of transfer. It overlooks the fact that Samuel had an equitable interest only, and that the legal title was in the trustee for the purpose of enabling him to discharge the duty that the will imposed upon him, to pay over on the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>eacli of testator\u2019s children, to tbe children whom he or she should leave surviving, the share of the testator\u2019s estate on whicb the deceased parent bad been entitled to the interest or income. Tbe rule in Shelley\u2019s Case is not applicable, because tbe life-estate is an equitable one, and the remainder is a legal estate in fee-simple: Rife v. Geyer, 59 Pa. 393 ; Myers\u2019s App., 49 Pa. 111. Moreover, tbe word \u201c children,\u201d so constantly used by the testator, is ordinarily a word of purchase: Guthrie\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 9. Tbe word \u201c issue \u201d used in tbe ninth item of the will, is used in the same sense as the word \u201c children,\u201d and bas no effect on our question. In Sheets\u2019 Est., 52 Pa. 257, it was distinctly held that, both as to personalty and realty, when an absolute interest is given in remainder, after a life-estate, to tbe children of the first taker, a limitation over on default of issue does not raise an estate-tail by implication. \u201c Issue \u201d means such issue; that is, children. Bnt it is enough that tlie children of Prisca Levan Mannerback had but an equitable interest in the estate of their father, tbe legal title to which was limited to tlieir children, tbe grandchildren of the testator, who took from him, and not as heirs at law of his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and tbe fund awarded to tbe appellant, the guardian of tbe child of Samuel Mannerback.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
