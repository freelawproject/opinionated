Balthaser filed his final account as guardian of Howard Webber, a minor. Exceptions to the account having been filed by the ward, the account was called for audit on April 1, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-12\">On October 5,1889, the auditing judge, Schwartz, P. J., filed the following adjudication:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-13\">The ward\u2019s exception to this account is that the accountant, his guardian, did not, but should have charged himself with the one fourth of the proceeds of a promissory note his mother held against Maria Elizabeth Faust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-14\">The facts relating to and governing this matter are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-15\">Matilda Webber died intestate in April, 1877, and left to survive her a widower, John B. Webber, and four minor children under the age of fourteen years, viz.: Howard, John M., Mollie Ann and Annie\" E. Webber, for whom the accountant, upon their father\u2019s petition, became guardian on February 28, 1878. She died possessed of household goods and kitchen furniture and of a promissory note against her mother, Maria Elizabeth Faust, for $1,000, on account of her share of inher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>itance out of her father\u2019s estate. There was due on this note, April 1, 1878, the sum of $719.61. The following fall, the accountant and Webber, widower, assuming the authority without raising an administration upon the estate, made sale of the goods, nearly all of which were purchased by Webber, and afterwards, with the consent of Baltliaser, were allowed to Webber as his share of inheritance of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">The note, however, was delivered to the accountant as guardian for the use of his wards. He now testifies and contends that Esquire Haag placed it among his papers surreptitiously and without his knowledge and consent and that be had never accepted it. What is his own testimony upon this point ? He says he took the note back to Haag and after some conversation with him retained it, and that he, in company with Haag, called upon Mrs. Faust, the maker of it, and demanded payment ; that Mrs. Faust replied that she could not then pay it, but would do so as soon as she had money; that, afterwards, he took the note to Daniel Ermentrout, Esq., an eminent counsel of this bar, who, he alleges, said that the note was worthless and could not be collected; that he, however, had left it with him and that it remained there for eleven years, during which time he made but one or two inquiries respecting it; that he paid him nothing for the advice, nor does he state what information he gave the attorney to base said advice upon.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">Mrs. Maria Elizabeth Faust held in fee, when her daughter, Matilda Webber, the mother of the exceptant died, and up to October, 1879, a plantation, farm and tract of land, situate in Centre township, Berks county, containing 144 acres and 82 perches. It was sold by her assignees for creditors for the sum of $6,792.09, less $3,544.89, dower charge for the use of the said Maria Elizabeth Faust, widow of Solomon Faust, deceased, who was at this time the owner of the property, and was sold by her assignees as such. She having become the purchaser, her dower interest merged into that of the title. Her entire interest in and to it passed by the sale, divesting all rights in it, save the payment of $3,544.39, to the heirs of Solomon Faust at her death. Instead of selling it divested of her dower interest, the assignees sold it subject to the assignor\u2019s dower interest in the property as widow, at the expense of accountant\u2019s wards. Notwithstanding this, there was still remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>$92.97, after the payment of all her debts, which, instead of being distributed to the accountant for his wards, was distributed to the assignor.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">When Balthaser took the note it became his duty to do either one of two things: Obtain security from Maria Elizabeth Faust for the payment of said note, or take out letters of administration upon the estate of Matilda Webber and obtain judgment against her for the claim. According to the accountant\u2019s own testimony, fully a year elapsed between the taking and his demanding payment of the note, and the date of the assignment of Maria Elizabeth Faust. In addition to the $92.97, which he allowed to be distributed to the assignor after payment of debts, without making claim for it, he also allowed a fund of $360.62 to be distributed among the heirs of the said Maria Elizabeth Faust, deceased, upon the adjudication of the account of her administrators, January 8, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-7\">On the 28th of October, 1879, over one year after Balthaser got the note for his wards, Joseph Faust obtained judgment against Maria Elizabeth Faust for $437.86, and upon the distribution of the funds in the hands of the assignees, his judgment was paid in full; showing that this accountant had ample time and abundant chances to collect or secure his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-8\">In Royer\u2019s App., 11 Pa. 36, the Supreme Court says: \u201c A guardian is liable for losses of money of his wards incurred \u25a0through culpable indifference and negligence, .... A fiduciary relation requires vigilance as well as honesty. A dead and sluggish calm, a supine negligence, is full of peril to the minor; it is often as fatal as positive dishonesty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-9\">No one would pretend to say that in the case in hand there was not a sluggish calm, nor that there was not supine negligence. Neither would it be claimed that this accountant would have stood idly by and seen every opportunity for making his money pass away, without making some effort to secure it, had he undertaken to manage this matter for himself or his children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-10\">At the time he received this note, no liens, except the $3,544.39, stood against the old lady\u2019s farm. Thus he might easily have recovered the whole of his claim. The court is clearly of the opinion that his case is one of exceeding gross \u2022and supine negligence, and that it would be derelict in its duty did it not surcharge him with at least part of this money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Considerable expense would, no doubt, have been connected with the collection of this money. The court now finds that the net sum of $400 could have been realized by the guardian, if he had in anywise discharged his bounden duty. It also finds that he should have had the money seven years ago. He is, therefore, surcharged on this ward\u2019s account with $100 thereof and seven years\u2019 interest, viz.: $142.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">\u2014To the foregoing adjudication the accountant filed exceptions alleging, in substance, that the auditing judge erred \u201c in finding, from all the facts in the ease, gross and supine negligence on the part of accountant, and in surcharging him with $100 and interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">Said exceptions having been argued, they were dismissed, and the adjudication confirmed. Thereupon, the accountant took this appeal, specifying the dismissal of his exceptions and the confirmation o'f the adjudication as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-7\"><em>Mr. C.

The learned judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court has found, upon abundant evidence, that he was guilty of supine negligence, and that the money due his ward from Maria Elizabeth Faust was lost in consequence thereof. Had reasonable diligence been used it could have been collected. The guardian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>made no serious effort to collect or secure it. Moreover, lie allowed the $92.97, surplus remaining in the assigned estate of the said Maria Elizabeth Faust, to be distributed to the assign- or; and also allowed $360.62 to be distributed to the heirs of said Maria. It may be the guardian had no knowledge of these matters; he says he had not, and it may be so. But he should have known and would have known it, if he had paid even reasonable attention to the duties of his trust. While a court is always loth to surcharge a trustee with money that never came into his hands, and exacts from him only reasonable and ordinary pare in such matters, it will not do for a guardian to utterly neglect his duties in the care and management of his ward\u2019s estate. Ordinary prudence in this instance would have saved his ward\u2019s money, and we are not measuring his responsibility by any higher standard. It is not too much to say that, had this been his own money, in all probability it would not have been lost; and he ought not to have been less vigilant in his ward\u2019s interest than he would have been in his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
