Mahoney.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-9\">To the foregoing bill, the defendant filed a general demurrer. Issue having been joined on the demurrer, the court, on June 24,1889, filed an order overruling the demurrer and directing the defendant to answer, all questions to remain open until the facts were found by a master. The defendant having answered, and issue being joined, the cause was referred to <em>Mr. Charles M. </em>Zerler, as examiner and master, who on December 16, 1889, filed a report recommending a decree in favor of the plaintiffs against the defendant, as prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-10\">To the report of the master the defendant filed exceptions, certain of which were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-11\">8. The master erred in finding from the'facts and the law that the plaintiffs were entitled to a specific performance of the assignment of the said judgment by the said defendant to the said plaintiffs and marking the same to their use.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-12\">11. The master erred in finding that there was a mutuality of remedy by specific performance between the said plaintiffs and the said defendant, the one against the others, and vice versa.8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-13\">Said exceptions having been overruled by the master and filed with his report, on January 3,1890, after argument thereof, the court, McPherson, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-14\">When the demurrer was overruled, all questions were expressly left open for future determination, and it now becomes necessary, therefore, to decide whether the plaintiffs have made out a case which entitles them to equitable relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-15\">Subject to some exceptions, not now material, the general rule in equity is, that to entitle a party to a decree for specific performance the contract must be mutual. As was said in Bodine v. Glading, 21 Pa. 53: \u201cBoth parties must, by the agreement, have a right to compel specific performance; otherwise, it would follow that the court would decree a specific performance when the party called upon to perform it might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>be in this situation, that if the agreement was disadvantageous to him he would be liable to the performance, and <em>yet if </em>advantageous to him he could not compel a performance.\u201d And in Meason v. Kaine, 68 Pa. 340, the court say: \u201c One of the fundamental principles adopted by courts of equity in bills for specific performance, is that there must be mutuality of remedy. Both parties must have a right to a decree.\u201d See, also, New-ell\u2019s App., 100 Pa. 518, where Bodine v. Grlading is recognized as authority. Another rule upon this subject is thus stated in Hammer v. McEldowney, 46 Pa. 336: \u201c It is a settled rule in equity, that the specific performance of a contract will not be decreed, unless its terms are clear and capable of ascertainment from the instrument itself.\u201d To the same effect is Backus\u2019s App., 58 Pa. 195: \u201cAn agi\u2019eement to be carried into specific performance ought to be certain, fair, and just in all its parts.\u201d <em>We </em>also refer to Waterman on Specif. Perf., ch. III. and VI. Tested by these rules, the bill before us cannot be sustained, because the contract sought to be enforced is, in some material parts, too vague and uncertain, and because, therefore, the remedy here is not mutual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">The contract is too vague and uncertain, because the consideration agreed to be given to March is not sufficiently determined. He agrees to accept from a corporation thereafter to be organized, \u201c securities thereof for my judgment, interest, costs, franchises, rights, and property, and a contract for the construction of a part of said road.\u201d But the contract does not inform us what securities are meant, whether bonds alone,, or stock alone, or bonds and stocks together; or, in the latter event, what proportion of each. Neither do we know at what rate these securities are to be accepted, whether at par, at a premium, or at a discount; or, whatever be the rate, to what amount they are to be given. In reference to the construction contract, we have as little information. We do not even know between what points the South Mountain Railroad is to run; the length of the road which the defendant is to be allowed to build, and the situation of this section and the price he is to receive for the work are equally undetermined. It may very well be, that under the circumstances, the consideration could not have been more precisely specified. As to this we cannot speak; the fact certainly is, that such gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>eral terms are used that no definite conclusion upon this matter can possibly be reached. In other words, the contract is one which the defendant cannot specifically enforce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">The contract is too uncertain also, because of the doubt whether the plaintiffs ever will be in a situation to carry out its provisions. Assuming that the plaintiffs are personally bound to March, how can it be said with certainty, or even with sufficient probability, that the proposed corporation will be organized by them or in their interest? They desire to use March\u2019s judgment in order to sell the franchises of the road, expecting to buy them at the sheriff\u2019s sale, to reorganize under existing legislation, and thus, and not otherwise, to be in a position to give March his securities and award him his construction contract. But suppose, as may readily happen, that other persons buy at the sheriff\u2019s sale and organize a corporation from which the plaintiffs are wholly excluded; how then could March compel specific performance by the plaintiffs, whatever his legal rights under the contract might be ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">Assuming, however, that the proposed corporation is organized by the plaintiffs, or in their interest, and that the contract in question is held to bind the corporation as far as it now binds the plaintiffs, could March compel the company to deliver securities to him and award him a construction contract? Obviously, the uncertainty already referred to, as surrounding both these matters, would still exist, and would be fatal to his bill for this purpose against whomsoever it might be brought, and he would be turned over to whatever legal rights he might be found to have.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">Without further elaboration, it seems to follow that, if the considerations thus briefly indicated are well founded, the remedy by specific performance upon this contract is not mutual, and therefore that the bill must be dismissed. In this view of the case, it is unnecessary to discuss the other question suggested and we intimate no opinion thereon. We simply decide, that because of the uncertainties above referred to and the consequent lack of mutuality in the remedy, this proceeding cannot be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-8\">The eighth and eleventh exceptions are sustained, and it is now decreed that the plaintiffs\u2019 bill be dismissed at their costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>A decree haying been entered dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 bill, etc., the plaintiffs took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-4\">1, 2.
