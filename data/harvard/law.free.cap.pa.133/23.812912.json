Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-15\">At the trial on May 23, 1888, the ease made to appear was as follows: Elizabeth Miller, the plaintiff in the present action, resided in Lebanon county, where suit was brought against ber and judgment obtained by one G. F. M. Rick. After the judgment was entered, and without an execution and a return thereon of nulla bona, the plaintiff Rick caused a transcript to be filed with a justice of the peace of Berks county, who then issued an execution which was returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>nulla bona. This was followed by an attachment-execution, which was served upon Davilla Snyder, the defendant in the present suit, as garnishee, Elizabeth Miller, the defendant in the judgment, not being served. Judgment in the attachment having been entered against Snyder, on his answers to interrogatories filed, the amount thereof was paid by him. Afterward, Elizabeth Miller brought this suit against Snyder, in Lebanon county, alleging that the garnishee was not discharged by the payment of the judgment in the attachment proceedings in Berks county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-4\">The original indebtedness of the defendant in the present suit having been shown, the court directed the jury to render a verdict for the plaintiff for $102.03, subject to the question of law reserved fully appearing in the opinion subsequently filed, SlMONTON, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-5\">This case turns on a very narrow point, and one which will not be at rest until it has been settled by the court of last resort. It is, as stated in the reserved question, \u201c whether, it being the fact that the\u2019 defendant in the original judgment was a resident of Lebanon county, and a transcript having been taken from the docket of the justice in Lebanon county who rendered a judgment against her, and an attachment-execution having been issued thereon by the justice of Berks county, where the defendant did not reside, the justice in Berks county had jurisdiction to render any judgment in the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-6\">By \u00a7 1, act of April 15, 1845, P. L. 459, it is enacted that \u201cthe jurisdiction of aldermen and justices of the peace is hereby extended to the issuing, service, trial, judgment and execution of all process required by the thirty-second, thirty-third, thirty-fourth, thirty-fifth, thirty-sixth, thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth sections of the act relating to executions, passed the 16th day of June, 1836.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-7\">The act of April 29,1844, P. L. 512, provides that proceedings under \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 36 of the act of 1836 shall be valid without service of the writ on the defendant, in case he reside out of the county; and \u00a7 4, act of March 20,1845, P. L. 189, repeals so much of \u00a7 36 of the act of 1836 as requires service of the attachment on any defendant, \u201cexcept where the defendant is a resident of the county in which attachment is issued.\u201d These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>acts were held in Hains v. Viereck, 2 Phila. 40, to require service to be made upon the defendant, if he resided or could be found in the county in which the execution was issued; but it was clearly the opinion of the learned judge who decided that case that the acts above cited placed attachment-executions issued by a justice of the peace on the same footing as those issued from a court of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">It might, therefore, seem the proper conclusion that, as the defendant need not be served if he does not reside in the county, the attachment execution might be issued in any county in the state. But, as stated in Hintermeister v. Ithaca Organ Co., 1 Pa. C. C. R. 268, the question of jurisdiction still remains. If the justice has jurisdiction, the execution may issue and be valid without service on defendant. But the jurisdiction being statutory, we must find it conferred, if it exists, in the words of the statute, which are, \u201cany alderman or justice of the peace, before whom any judgment remains unsatisfied, and an execution has returned no goods, may, on the application of the plaintiff, and his compliance with the requisitions of the act to which this is a supplement, issue an attachment in the nature of an execution, as therein provided, to levy upon stock, debts and deposits of money belonging, or due to the defendant, in satisfaction of said judgment:\u201d Section 2, act of April 15,1845, P. L. 459.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">This seems to limit the jurisdiction to the justice \u201cbefore whom\u201d the judgment has been recovered, or at least by whom the \u201cexecution has been issued and returned no goods.\u201d But we think an execution cannot legally be issued in a county where the defendant does not reside or cannot be found, for \u00a7 12, act of March 20, 1810, 5 Sm. L. 167, requires the execution to be directed to the \u201c constable of the ward, district or township where the defendant resides, or the next constable most convenient to the defendant,\u201d which has been held in Clark v. Worley, 7 S. &amp; R. 853, to mean, any constable of the county. Therefore, the justice of the county where defendant does not reside, and cannot be found, cannot legally do that which is necessary to give him jurisdiction to issue the attachment-execution, and if issued without jurisdiction it is of course void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-7\">For this reason the motion to enter judgment non obstante <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>veredicto is overruled, and judgment is directed to be entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-4\">\u2014Judgment having been entered for the plaintiff on the verdict, the defendant took this appeal, assigning the order overruling the motion of defendant for judgment in his favor, non obstante veredicto, for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-5\"><em>Mr. Thomas H.

We need not discuss the effect of filing the transcript before the justice in Berks, as neither justice, as his docket stood, had the right to issue an attachment. The second section of the act of April 15, 1845, P. L. 459, enacts that \u201cany alderman or justice of the peace, before whom any judgment remains unsatisfied, and an execution has returned no goods, may, on the application of the plaintiff, and his compliance with the requisitions of the act to which this is a supplement, issue an attachment in the nature of an execution, as therein provided, to levy upon stock, debts and deposits of money belonging, or due to the defendant, in satisfaction of said judgment.\u201d It will thus be seen that an execution, and a return thereto of \u201c no goods,\u201d is a prerequisite to an attachment execution before a justice. Whatever might have been the plaintiff\u2019s right to take his transcript and use it in Berks county, he could not have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>an attachment in Lebanon county without this prerequisite; much less can he have an attachment upon his transcript in Berks county without it. The learned judge below committed no error in entering judgment upon the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
