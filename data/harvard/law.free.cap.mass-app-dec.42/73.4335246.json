Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>made sixteen payments to counsel for the plaintiff on the note beginning February 4,1967 and ending Hay 12, 1967, the total of these payments amounted to Two Hundred Two ($2-02.00) Dollars; defendant became twenty one years of age on November 20, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">At the close of the trial the plaintiff filed six requests for rulings. The court disallowed requests number 1, 3 and 5 and allowed requests number 2, <em>4 </em>and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In addition to finding the above recited evidence as facts, the court found the defendant \u201csigned the note as a co-maker for his brother and under the impression that the brother was borrowing $300.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The court further found \u201cthat there was no evidence presented to prove the plaintiff\u2019s damages, if any\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The court found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The plaintiff duly filed a motion for a new trial partly based on alleged inconsistencies as to the findings of fact and rulings of law by the court. The plaintiff duly filed six requests for rulings in relation to his motion for a new trial. The court denied the motion for a new trial and made no ruling on the plaintiff\u2019s request for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">The report states that it contains all the evidence to the questions reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">It is apparent from the evidence that the note in question was introduced into evidence and the defendant\u2019s signature thereon was estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>lished at the time of trial. The plaintiff thus had established a <em>prima facie </em>case and was entitled to recover unless the defendant established a defense. G.L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-307, <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Paeff, </em>318 Mass. 366, 371-372, <em>Worcester Bank and Trust Company </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>287 Mass. 228, <em>Starks </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hara, </em>266 Mass. 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The court allowed plaintiff\u2019s request for ruling number two that \u201con the evidence of the defendant that he signed the note in blank, the only warrantable inference is that he authorized the payee of the note to fill in the blanks.\u201d The court allowed plaintiff\u2019s request for ruling number six that \u201cDefendant has offered no evidence of alteration in the note upon which he is being sued.\u201d These rulings disposed of the questions of fraud and material alteration set up in the defendant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The question of the defendants! minority at the time he signed the note is readily disposed of by the fact that at no time did he attempt to disaffirm his liability but rather he ratified the note four years after reaching his majority by making sixteen payments on the note. <em>Babtkus </em>v. <em>Jutras, </em>31 Mass. App. Dec. 98 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">It is apparent that the court\u2019s finding \u201cthere was no evidence presented to prove plantiff\u2019s damages, if any\u201d and the finding for the defendant were wrong and prejudicial to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was entitled to judgment in accordance with the evidence and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>terms of the note. G.L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-415, G.L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-307.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZT\">Mezoff <em>&amp; </em>Bauman of Canton for Plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"APv\">Stephen T.
