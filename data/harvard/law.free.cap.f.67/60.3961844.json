Campbell, citizens of the state of New York, against Marion county, Tex., to recover some $50,000 alleged to be due upon certain bonds issued by that county. Of this amount, about $27,000 was claimed to be due on funding and refunding bonds, and about $32,000 on courthouse and jail bonds. A jury was waived by written stipulation, and the case tried by the court, which filed written findings of fact, with its conclusions of law thereon. Judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs -for $59,757.43, with interest. Defendant brings error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-14\">The courthouse and jail bonds sued upon were issued under an act passed by the legislature of Texas February 22, 1873.

N. Coler, Jr., one of the plaintiffs in this suit; and the causes of action in said suits were in part coupons cut from the said courthouse and jail bonds, also those cut from said funding and refunding bonds, and a part of registered scrip; and that, pending said suits, said defendant county made a settlement thereof, and by decrees and orders of the commissioners\u2019 court of Biarion county made and entered September 11 and October 15, 1886, fully recognized the validity of said indebtedness, and paid off same in compromise by the execution and delivery of new bonds; and that the plaintiffs purchased said coupons sued on for value before maturity bona fide, and without notice of any infirmities therein; that, by the acts of defendant county in the levy, collection of taxes, and payment of interest on said several bonds, and the orders and decrees of the commissioners\u2019 court in settlement of such bonded indebtedness from time to time, the defendant has acquiesced in, confirmed, and ratified the validity of all of several issues of bonds, (f) The court finds that the amount of principal and interest at 6 per cent, on all the coupons of the funding and refunding bonds introduced in evidence, figured up to September 28,1893, to be $27,391.39, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>with 6 per cent, interest thereon from that date; that the amount of principal and interest at 8 per cent, on all the coupons of the courthouse and jail bonds offered in evidence, up to September 28, 1893, is $32,366.04, with 8 per cent, interest thereon from date; and the judgment will be entered for the aggregate amount of $59,757.43, with 6 per cent, interest on $27,391.39, and with <em>8 </em>per cent, interest on $32,366.04, from date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-4\">Findings of Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">(1) That the courthouse and jail bonds were issued under the constitution of 1869, and full power was conferred by it upon the legislature to authorize counties to issue bonds in such manner as prescribed by law. (2) That the act of February 22, 1873, prescribing the manner and conferring the power upon trustees and Marion county to issue the courthouse and jail bonds, was not in conflict with the constitution of 1869. See Sp. Laws 1873, p. 65, c. 9. (3) The power to create agents by counties to make contracts for building or repairing public buildings had existed since the act of December 29, 18-19. See Oidh. &amp; W. Dig. art 275. (4) By section 20, art. 5, Const. 1869, the legislature was clothed with authority to grant such powers as it saw fit to the commissioner^\u2019 court to make and issue bonds. This court became the creature of the iaw prescribed. The legislature could increase or diminish its authority, or even take away all other powers than such as the constitution had prescribed. The court, therefore, concludes that the legislature had the power and authority to pass the act of 22d February, 3873, and confer the power of making and issuing the courthouse and. jail bonds upon trustees appointed in the first instance by the legislature, and upon the officers of the county. The county had no power before this act to issue these bonds. Under this act, the power was granted under limitations to be exercised by the officers of the county and the trustees; and, the act having been pursued, the bonds were issued, and therefore legal and valid. (5) The court further finds that the funding and refunding bonds were made under the acts of March 25, 3879, and April 6, 1881, after the adoption of the constitution of April 18, 1876, but the indebtedness, funded and refunded, was created and existed prior to April 18, 1870; and that the rules of decision arising under the constitution of 1869 are applicable to these bonds; and that the same are legal and valid obligations. (6) 'fiie court further finds that, under the evidence, the defendant has acquiesced in and ratified the validity of the several issues of bonds in question; that for twenty years the defendant has recognized the courthouse and jail bonds as valid, enjoyed the proceeds, levied, collected, and paid taxes on the interest and sinking fund, funded and refunded, and settled the interest maturing thereon, and, by reason thereof, the defendant is estopped now from disputing their validity or repudiating their payment. (7) Finally, the law applicable to a bona fide holder, for value, of negotiable paper purchased before due, and without notice of any infirmities therein, entitles the plaintiffs to recover in this suit. Those obligations in the hands of plaintiffs, as innocent holders for value, had the right, to presume that the bonds were made in pursuance of the laws granting the power; and the defendant cannot be heard to question their validity in the hands of plaintiffs as such holders and owners. The court, therefore, finds the law applicable to the evidence to be with the plaintiffs, and entitles them to judgment, which is entered accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-6\">F. H. Prendergast, W. T. Armistead, and L. S. Schluter, for plaintiff in error, set up the following contentions:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-7\">(1) That this act is unconstitutional, because it gives to the commissioners named powers which by the constitution of 1869 (section 20) are vested in the court composed of justices of the peace. Section 20: \u201cJustices of the peace shall have such civil and criminal jurisdiction as shall be provided by law. And the justices of the peace in each county or any three of them shall constitute a court having such jurisdiction, similar to that heretofore exercised by county commissioners and police courts, as may be provided by law. And when sitting as such courts the justice who resides at the county seat shall bo the presiding justice.\u201d It was claimed that the effect of this provision was to invest the court of the justices with such jurisdiction as the county commissioners and police courts had theretofore possessed, and that prior to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>time such jurisdiction was prescribed by Pasch. Dig. Laws, art. 1055 (Hart Dig. art. 217), which reads as follows: \u201cThe county courts may appoint an agent or agents to make any contract on behalf of the county for the erection or repair of any county building and to superintend their erection or repairing or for any other purpose authorized by law and the contracts or acts of such agent or agents duly executed and done for or on behalf of the county and within his powers, shall be valid and effectual to bind such county to all intents and purposes.\u201d Re-enacted under the constitution of 1869 (Act Aug. 13, 1870;' 2 Pasch. Dig. 612S).</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-5\">(2) That, even if the court should find that the law was constitutional, the bonds must be held to be void, because the law was not complied with in issuing them. The act provides (section 3) \u201cthat when said bonds are signed, and before they are issued,\u201d the county court shall levy a tax to pay the interest and 2 per cent, sinking fund every year. But it was proved and found by the court that the courthouse and jail bonds were issued June 30, 1873, and that no tax was levied to pay the bonds until January, 1874.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-6\">(3) That the fact that the county has levied taxes, and paid Interest on the bonds, and created a sinking fund, did not estop it from denying their validity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-7\">W. S. Herndon and Ben B. Cain, for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b88-8\">Before PARDEE and McCORMICK, Circuit Judges, andBRUGE, District Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AmY\">McCORMICK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">The debt which is the consideration of the bonds involved in this case was contracted before the adoption of the constitution now in force in Texas. At the time it was contracted, there ivas no provision in the constitution of the state similar to section 9 of article 8, or to sections 5 and 7 of article 11, of the constitution adopted in 1876. The constitution being silent, the legislature had power to provide, in its discretion, for the taxing of property in the state, and for the distribution and appropriation of the taxes to be raised. New Orleans v. Clark, 95 U. S. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">The contention that the enabling act violated fundamental principles, and is therefore invalid, does not seem to be supported by authority. The contention that the enabling act of February 22, 1873, required provision to be made for the payment of the interest, and creating a sinking fund, before the contraction of the debt and the execution of the bonds, does not appear to be supported by the terms of statute. On the contrary, it appears that the authority given the specially named commissioners to contract the debt was full and complete, and the duty was imposed on the county government to execute the bonds to meet the debt, and to provide for the interest and required sinking fund before issuing the bonds. The power to provide the courthouse and jail is not made contingent on any action by the county. The contractor who erected the buildings might be paid in the bonds of the county, or out of the proceeds of the sale of its bonds; but the county could not, by its refusal to execute the bonds, or by its refusal or neglect to provide for the levy and collection of a tax sufficient to meet the interest and sinking fund, defeat the execution of the power conferred by the statute to provide a courthouse and jail for the county. These necessary public grounds and buildings were secured; the bonds were executed and issued; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>and at the January term, 1874, of the proper court of the county a,n order was made and entered levying a tax to pay the interest and sinking fund, and the rax was collected annually for several years thereafter. We see no ground co question the validity of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
