T. Porter and G. W. Macrae, partners under the firm name of Porter <em>&amp; </em>Macrae, against I. L. James and J. E. Penney, to cancel an assignment for benefit of creditors, and procure the application o\u00ed certain moneys to a, judgment obtained by complainants against defendants. The circuit court entered a decree dismissing, the cause, and complainants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-9\">I. L. .Tames was doing a mercantile business at Hillsboro, Ala., and Porter &amp; Macrae, of Memphis, Term., were his commission merchants. As such they furnished him money and goods; and <em>on </em>the 1st of <em>December., </em>1S9J, lie owed them something over $8,000. At this juncture, W. J. Booker, agent for Porter <em>&amp; Macrae, </em>visited James, to get a settlement or security for llxe debt. James proposed to sell certain property to Booker in payment of the debt, but, his authority, being- limited, he asked time to go to .Memphis, and lay the matter before Ms firm, and answer, and was to telegraph to James on the 2d of December, and return and close the matter if acceptable to the firm. While Bookpr was on this mission, on the said 2d of December. 1891. and after he had sent the telegram, James made an assignment purporting to convoy all of Ms property; at least, pretended to assign it all. J. If. Penney was named as assignee, and on Booker\u2019s return he learned of what liad happened. Attachment was afterwards sued out and levied on all the property, and the personalty was sold under attachment, and the realty was being advertised by the assignee when this bill was filed. The appellants claim that the assignment, is void upon its face, because its provisions impress it as fraudulent in law; also, that it was fraudulent in fact, as shown by the facto proven at the trial. The facts relied upon to support the latter contention were, among others, that while the assignment purported to convey all the property and assets of the assignor, particularly set out and described in the schedule annexed thereto, yet, in fact, it did not convey all of the debtor\u2019s property, and that various items of real estate, personal property, and credits were not included therein, and that this property constituted so large a proportion of his assets as to preclude any assumption that the omission was unintentional; that, after the attachment was served, the assignor, with the consent of the assignee, took from the property, presumably in the possession of the assignee, $1,000 worth of property, the same not having been, theretofore selected and set apart from the other property as exempt, contrary to the law of Alabama; that the assignee is peremptorily directed in the deed to pay the creditors the amounts stated in the schedule, while the proofs show that. $692.60 of this amount was fictitious and not due, for which reason this direction would operate to divert this much property from the creditors; that over $3,000 of creditors was wholly omitted from the schedule; and that the claims of creditors who were named were cut down to the extent of nearly $2,500 less than was actually due them. It was further contended that the proofs showed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the assignor prepared for an assignment for some time before making the same, and intended to do so at no distant day, and that his proposition to sell a portion of his property to pay the complainants\u2019 debt was not made in good faith, but to deceive them, until he could make his assignment, and place his property out of their reach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-4\">The provisions of the deed of assignment which were alleged to show that it was fraudulent and void upon its face were: That it directed the assignee, if in his judgment such a course was deemed advisable, to carry on the mercantile business for a reasonable time in the assignee\u2019s store, until the stock of goods then in the said store were sold and disposed of. This provision, it was claimed, placed it in the discretion of the assignee to continue the business for an indefinite time, which might be extended for a long period by him for the purpose of continuing his own compensation; further, directed the assignee to pay to certain creditors the sums therein set down, and reserve the overplus to the grantor, notwithstanding that nearly $2,500 was cut out of the amounts due to the creditors named; operated as a reservation by the debtor of some control over the property conveyed, whereby the deed was prevented from being such an absolute and unconditional assignment as the law required. Also, that the deed expressly provided that no part of the real estate, which constituted the most valuable part of the property assigned, should be sold or disposed of until after all the personal assets had been exhausted, which provision it was claimed would require the prosecution of suits upon notes and accounts to judgment and collection, or return of nulla bona; thus leading to indefinite delay, amounting to a hindrance and delay of the sale of the real estate, such as would make the instrument fraudulent and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-5\">The deed of assignment was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-6\">\u201cThe State of Alabama, Lawrence County.
