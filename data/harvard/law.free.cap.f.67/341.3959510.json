In the district court the libel was dismissed, and the libelant appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\">Tlie policy of insurance contained the following provisions: \u201cIn case of loss, damage, detriment, hurt, or misfortune, it shall be lawful and necessary to and for the assured, their factors, servants, and assigns, to sue, labor, and travel for, in, and about the defense, safeguard, and recovery of the said vessel or any part thereof, without prejudice to this insurance, and to the reasonable and just charges thereof this company will contribute in proportion as the amount herein insured bears to the valuation of said vessel as expressed in this policy. No claim for partial loss or particular average shall in any case be paid unless the amount of such claim equals or exceeds the sum of $100 on each vessel, and said sum of $100 is to be deducted therefrom, ini lieu of average on each vessel.\u201d The insurance was effected through Carpinter &amp; Baker, who, as Mr. Carpinter testified, were the local marine agents of the defendant company for .New York, having charge of the marine business in reference to insurance effected through that company, \u201csubject to approval.\u201d The barges were chartered by the libelant company to the street cleaning department of New York City. On the morning of January 30, 1894, the street-cleaning department received notice from the life saving station at Rockaway that the Barney Dumping Company\u2019s boats were adrift out at sea. The street-cleaning department notified the dumping company of the receipt of this information, and the latter then called up by telephone Carpinter &amp; Baker, and communicated to them the information received. The secretary of the dumping company testified that he simply reported the information that two dumpers had gone adrift, and asked the agents what should be done about it; and that the latter replied directing them to get the best tug they could, and send for the barges immediately. Mr. Carpinter, with whom the conversation was had, testified that he said in answer to the question: \u201cCertainly, if those boats are adrift, the best thing is to send a tug to look for them.\u201d The dumping company accordingly employed a tug, which spent 48 hours in searching for the boats, but did not find them. It was afterwards ascertained that the boats had not in fact gone adrift, but were tied up in a safe place on the shore of Staten Island. The bill for the hire of the tug was presented to Carpinter &amp; Baker, and they refused to pay it, on the ground that the insurance company was not liable under the policy.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-5\">Peter S.
