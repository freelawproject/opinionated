The opinion of Judge Coxe (62 Fed. 150) states clearly and at length the various reasons which induced him to affirm the decision of the collector, and to hold that the article was not bauxite, but was dutiable under the name of \u201calumina.\u201d In those reasons we fully concur. While the article, technically speaking, is hydrate of alumina, it sufficiently appears from the testimony taken for use before the circuit court that in common speech the terms \u201chydrate of alumina\u201d and \u201calumina\u201d are used as synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The decision of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
