The case deals with copyrighted matters alone, which are only the musical parts, or notations, of complainants\u2019 publications. We are not called on to consider a case in which more than the notation is covered by a copyright. That musical compositions, as such, differ, in the view of the copyright law, from books, as such, necessarily follows from the fact that when musical compositions were first made copyrightable the penalty for infringing was made expressly and distinctively other than that for infringing the copyrighted book. Act Feb. 3, 1831 (4 Stat. 437, 438, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7). And it so stands in the present statute. Act March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 1109, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8). There are other particulars in which the statutes make the same distinction, but in this one the result is unavoidable. What were copyrighted here were clearly musical compositions, and nothing else, and the distinction thus made by these penal provisions cannot be maintained unless the result reached by the circuit court is accepted. The word \u201clithograph,\u201d found in the proviso in section 3 of the statute under consideration, represents only a subdivision of the matters embraced in the word \u201cprint,\u201d in the same section, which gets its meaning and limitation, for the purposes of this statute, from its immediate association with the words \u201cengraving, cut.\u201d This is emphasized by the third section of the act of June 18, 1874 (18 Stat. 78), which expressly limits the word to pictorial illustrations, or works connected with the fine arts. Moreover, the introduction of the proviso by the words \u201cin the case\u201d constitutes a legislative selection from what precedes it, and shows that the qualifying effect of the proviso was intended to be limited to a part only of the things named in the body of the section. These words necessarily make the whole section in pari materia. It is true that in some parts of the statutes the words \u201cbook,\u201d \u201cprint,\u201d and \u201cmusical composition,\u201d refer to the intellectual conception as the essential element, and in other parts may refer more particularly to the material form in which it is expressed; but nowhere does either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>element exclusively exist, because no intellectual conception is copyrightable until it has taken material shape. Therefore, there is no reason for holding that the use of the words \u201cbook, photograph, chromo, or lithograph,\u201d in the proviso, involves a departure from the distinctive idea appertaining to either in other parts of the statutes touching the subject-matter of copyright. If the statutes were of doubtful meaning, the history of the bill, the omission of the words \u201cdramatic composition\u201d from some of the provisions of the statutes, the contemporaneous construction by the departments or officers of the United States, and perhaps other propositions urged upon either side, might have weight; but, in a case so clear as the one at bar, we do not deem it necessary to invoke such aids, or to note the con ditions or limitations under which such considerations should weigh in the interpretation of doubtful statutory provisions. The decree of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
