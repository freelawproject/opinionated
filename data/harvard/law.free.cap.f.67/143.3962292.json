The spring of the appellees is not attached to or fastened in the groove of the bail ear, but passes through it and extends to a point below the lower extremity of the ear, and is there fastened to the body of the pail itself. Consequently, and in accordance with his restrictive understanding of the scope of the claim, the learned judge held that the contrivance of the appellees does not infringe. In our opinion, it would be impossible to hold otherwise, without so expanding the claim as to render it invalid. Similar springs, not fastened to, but brought in contact with, similar lugs, by being passed through grooves therein, were old. This is shown by, at least, the patent (No. 163,598) granted to Robert B. Kepner, dated May 18, 1875. McDonnell merely substituted the existing bail ear lugs for the separate, but, for this purpose, substantially identical lugs which Kepner had employed. This substitution did not amount to invention, and therefore the utmost which, with any show of reason, McDonnell can be said to have originated\u2014and even this, in view of the Bligh patent, No. 27,265, is not unquestionable\u2014consisted in fastening the spring, not to the body of the pail, but to the lug itself, and this the appellees have not done. The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
