If you find that said property embraced in said chattel mortgage was improperly and unlawfully taken and sold on the 13th day of July, 1895; and if you find from the evidence that the mortgagee did not make out a statement showing the items of property sold, the names of each purchaser, and the amount for which each article sold, and also an itemized statement of the necessary reasonable expenses incurred in taking, keeping and selling said property, and did not deliver the same to the mortgagor, in person or by mail; and if you find that the said Arthur Eobley, the mortgagee, failed within ten days after said sale to make out said statement above mentioned and deliver the same to the mortgagor, in person or by mail, then you are instructed that the said mortgagor, the plaintiff in this action, is entitled to recover one-third of the value of the property so sold from the defendant; and under this state of facts, it makes no difference whether any of the causes enumerated in the chattel mortgage for foreclosing the same existed or not at the time the same was foreclosed and sold.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\" pgmap=\"271\">It was conceded the averments of the declaration were insufficient to warrant the recovery of the statutory penalty imposed under this instruction, and leave was granted appellee to add an additional count to the declaration, which was done. Thereupon the court overruled the motion for a new trial and entered judgment upon the verdict.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\" pgmap=\"271\">The count so added to the declaration charged that the appellant with force and arms seized the property as mortgagee, sold it but did not deliver to the appellee, the mortgagor, a statement of the articles of property so sold, the purchasers thereof, the expenses of the sale, as required by the provisions of Sec. 2 of the act of the General Assembly approved June 21, 1895, entitled, An act to * * * regulate the sale of property under chattel mortgages.
