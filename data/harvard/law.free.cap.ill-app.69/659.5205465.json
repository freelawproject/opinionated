Fuller Co. and' the Pioneer Fireproof Construction Co. In February, 1892, the George A. Fuller Co. was engaged as general contractor in erecting the fourteen story building at 34 and 36 Washington street, Chicago. The deceased, Oscar Hansen, was an employe of the Fuller Co. The Fireproof Construction Co. was employed by the Fuller Company to fill in the floors and partitions with fireproof material, and to put on the tile roof.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-6\" pgmap=\"658(285) 659(119)\">The building faces north. Along the eastern side is an alley in which material for the building was unloaded, and from which, by means of a derrick placed on the roof, it was hauled up. Oscar Hansen was stationed in the alley, and with another employe of the Fuller company controlled the hoisting operation from that point. The material was loaded onto a platform called a \u201c boat,\u201d five feet wide by seven feet long; this \u201c boat\u201d was then fastened to the rope of the derrick and hauled up until it was level with the roof; then the \u201cboom\u201d or arm of the derrick, over the end of which the hoisting rope passed, was raised, thus swinging the boat in until over the spot where it was to be landed, when it was lowered and guided to its resting place. This was done by the employes of the Fuller Company. The tile was then unloaded by laborers paid by the Fireproof Company. At this particular time the roof was partly on, and the boat had to be pulled into a space left in the roof for a dormer window, the iron rafters slanting up on each side thereof. Running north and south on the floor and near the slope of the roof was a six-inch steam pipe. When the loaded boat was hauled in through this hole in the roof, it was lowered and rested across this pipe. There was sufficient room where it could have been drawn in clear of this pipe. On the morning of February 15th, a boat load was landed above and rested across the steam pipe. Thereupon the workmen began unloading the tile from the side nearest them, the inner side, and after a certain quantity of tile had been removed from the inner side, the boat tilted across the steam pipe and one or more of the tile slid off, striking the steep roof and thence down into the alley. A piece of tile struck Hansen on the head. At the close of the evidence the court instructed the jury to find the defendant, George A. Fuller Co., not guilty. The case proceeded against the Pioneer Fireproof Construction Co., and the jury returned a verdict finding it guilty, and assessing the damages at $5,000. Motion for a new trial was overruled and judgment was given on the verdict, from which judgment this appeal is taken.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b659-4\" pgmap=\"659\">Burnham &amp; Baldwin, attorneys for appellant,</attorneys><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATB\" pgmap=\"659\">contended that if the plaintiff had knowledge of the danger and continued to work there, exposing himself to the danger, it was strong evidence of contributory negligence, citing Beach on Contributory Negligence, pp. 39, 40, 161; Shear &amp; Redfield Neg.

Because one is obliged to use explosives to remove an object, he is not absolved from responsibility for the result of such use to the house of a stranger.</p> <p id=\"b661-7\" pgmap=\"661\">Any adult person working at raising these tiles must have known that such work was dangerous; knowledge that prior to the accident to the deceased, tiles had fallen, would have added little, if anything, to a sense of the obvious danger.</p> <p id=\"b661-8\" pgmap=\"661\">The deceased was bound to exercise ordinary care for his safety; that is, such care as was consistent with the work he had to do under his employment.</p> <p id=\"b661-9\" pgmap=\"661\">If appellant had provided a place of safety, viz., a shed, for the protection of those working in the alley, and if the deceased at the time he was struck by the falling tile, might properly and consistently with the work he had to do, have been in this shed, and knew this, so that his exposure to danger from falling tiles was his voluntary act, and not necessitated by his employment, appellant would not have been liable for an accident to him, if he, despite its care, of his own volition, unnecessarily exposed himself to danger. Appellant did not offer to show this; although it did offer to show that it had erected a shed in the alley.</p> <p id=\"b661-10\" pgmap=\"661(47) 662(57)\">Appellant had contracted to fireproof this building; it employed another corporation to raise the roof tile to the fourteenth story; when such tiles had been so elevated its own servants unloaded them from the boat in which they came up. Whether the Fuller Company had so surrounded the place of unloading that appellant could not unload without proceeding as it did, and thereby causing tiles to fall to the alley below, is immaterial. If it undertook to do a dangerous act, it was bound to provide against injury thereby to the deceased, whose employment required that he should work where he did.</p> <p id=\"b662-5\" pgmap=\"662\">For a mere passer-by to have walked into the alley and there remained, knowing that from the hoisting going on tiles had fallen, would probably not have been for him an exercise of ordinary care; for the deceased, duty to his employer required him to remain in a place of danger.</p> <p id=\"b662-6\" pgmap=\"662\">The fact, if such there be, that the Fuller Company retained a certain control over the manner in which appellant performed its w.ork, did not absolve it from responsibility for acts resulting in injury to the deceased. A can not, by contract with B, relieve himself from liability for injury to C, caused by acts done by him, A, although commanded by B.</p> <p id=\"b662-7\" pgmap=\"662\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
