What may be a rule to-day, may not be to-morrow. Conceding plaintiff to have known of the rule previously, he was not called upon to question the act of the agent, as to the rule on the day he bought the ticket. It is neither reasonable nor practical for passengers to take notice of such matters or attempt to correct agents in regard to them. Ellsworth v. C., B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 63 N. W.

He kept the ticket and went again to that station December 10, 1893, to take passage, and presented the ticket to the agent who had sold it to him, asking if it was good for the train that day. The answer of the agent was not admitted in evidence, but the act of the agent was a return of the ticket to the appellant, unlocking the turnstile through which only could the appellant go .to the train, and the appellant went upon' the cars. He had with him money enough to have bought another ticket, but not enough to pay the fare which must be paid on the car by passengers not having tickets. The conductor put him off at another station, on a very cold night, and the appellant was much injured in health in consequence thereof.</p> <p id=\"b629-4\" pgmap=\"629\">In the absence of any fraud by the appellant\u2014and no fraud is pretended\u2014what was thus done was an acceptance by the company of the appellant as a passenger.</p> <p id=\"b629-5\" pgmap=\"629\">In the regular course of employment, the agent at 36th street had opened the way for him to the train, with that ticket as the evidence that he'had paid the company for the right to ride to Kensington. The defense of the company is that the ticket was:</p> <blockquote id=\"b629-6\" pgmap=\"629\">\u201c Illinois Central K. K.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"AjW\" pgmap=\"629\">One Passage Between</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"ATll\" pgmap=\"629\">Douglas (A) and Kensington</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"AUm\" pgmap=\"629\">On Suburban Trains only. If presented on date of sale</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Amm8\" pgmap=\"629\">shown on back.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"AyM\" pgmap=\"629\">A. H. Hanson, General Ticket Agent,\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"ANoC\" pgmap=\"629\">and was perforated by a stamp cutting little round holes in it, and when held up to the light with the back of the ticket to the observer, the holes were so arranged as to form the figures 331 : 3. Whether such figures meant anything, and, if anything, what, would be to the general run of uninstructed passengers an unsolvable riddle.</p> <p id=\"b629-11\" pgmap=\"629\">\u201c Date of sale shown on back \u201d might be indicated to the employes of the company by any cipher of which they had the key. The restriction Avas not to date of sale simply, but to such date \u201c shown on back.\u201d The appellant did not understand the effect of these hieroglyphics and went to the agent for guidance, who answered him by turning him, to the cars.</p> <p id=\"b629-12\" pgmap=\"629\">We have nothing to do with the duty of the conductor to the company.</p> <p id=\"b629-13\" pgmap=\"629\">The company, through an agent put there to discharge,, among other duties, that of accepting passengers, accepted the appellant as a passenger.</p> <p id=\"b630-4\" pgmap=\"630\">The act of the ticket agent, and the act of the conductor, were both acts of the company, and, if by reason of' their inconsistency the appellant has suffered, he is entitled to compensation.</p> <p id=\"b630-5\" pgmap=\"630\">The instruction by the court to the jurjr to find for the defendant was wrong, and the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
