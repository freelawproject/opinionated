Counsel contends:</p> <p id=\"b18-4\" pgmap=\"18\">\u201c First. That George A. Heilman never purchased, had, or sold one bushel of wheat for Gustave Eiebe.</p> <p id=\"b18-5\" pgmap=\"18\">Second. That H. 0. Gray, through whom Heilman claims to have effected Eiebe\u2019s business, never delivered one bushel of wheat to Gustave Eiebe, or to anybody for him.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b18-6\" pgmap=\"18\">We have examined the record as to these matters, and do \u25a0not find that it sustains the contentions of appellant.</p> <p id=\"b18-7\" pgmap=\"18\">Appellant wrote the following letter:</p> <blockquote id=\"b18-8\" pgmap=\"18\">' \u201c Chicago, August 30, 1895.

That was the price at which the balance of $177.90 was due Mr. Eiebe.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b18-14\" pgmap=\"18\">Mr. Hhlman, a clerk for Eosenbaum Brothers, corroborated appellee and testified to the reception by Eosenbaum Bros, from him of 35,000 bushels of wheat for appellant. Mr. Gray also testified to the purchase and delivery of this wheat.</p> <p id=\"b18-15\" pgmap=\"18\">Appellee wrote to appellant as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b18-16\" pgmap=\"18\">\u201c George A.

I can carry only 5,000 bushels of cash wheat for you, for the other 30,000 bushels you must provide somewhere else, as my money is not sufficient to carry all the 35,000.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b19-4\" pgmap=\"19\">1 need money in my business and can not pay out for all the wheat I bought for you. This was agreed upon at the time in june, as I bought it for you for July. 1 can positively not carry your wheat beyond the 1st of September, and I respectfully request you to find a place where the wheat can be delivered, and paid for when it comes in to me.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b19-5\" pgmap=\"19\">A reply is respectfully solicited at once.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b19-6\" pgmap=\"19\">Yours truly,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b19-7\" pgmap=\"19\">Geo.

Riebe.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b19-15\" pgmap=\"19\">There is no dispute as to the law.</p> <p id=\"b19-16\" pgmap=\"19\">We have considered appellant\u2019s argument that the delivery notices in evidence, taken in connection with the testimony, show that appellee did not purchase this wheat, and do not agree with the conclusion arrived at by counsel.</p> <p id=\"b19-17\" pgmap=\"19(59) 20(39)\">Appellee could not have delivered 35,000 bushels of wheat to Rosenbaum Bros, for appellant, unless he, appellee, had purchased the same. If such wheat was not so delivered, it was a simple thing to have shown it. Appellant does not himself testify that Rosenbaum Bros, did not account to him for such quantity of wheat as received from appellee. That in the purchase and sale of this wheat, that there was what is known as \u201c ringing up,\u201d does not make the transaction illegal. Pardridge v. Cutler, 1st Dist. Ill. App., opinion filed February 1, 1897.</p> <p id=\"b20-5\" pgmap=\"20\">After the delivery of the wheat to Eosenbaum Brothers, as ordered by appellant, he received the balance due him and gave following receipt</p> <blockquote id=\"AP\" pgmap=\"20\">\u201cAugust 31, 1895.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b20-7\" pgmap=\"20\">Eeceived from George' A.
