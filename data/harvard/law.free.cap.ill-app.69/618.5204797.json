Story on Bailments, Sec. 478; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 503; Cayle\u2019s Case, 8 Coke, 32.</p> <p id=\"b617-10\" pgmap=\"617\">The application of the principles of the common law is modified from time to time; with the changing conditions under which business is transacted obligations are entered into and men live.</p> <p id=\"b617-11\" pgmap=\"617(31) 618(145)\">In this country the baggage of travelers is usually transported in cars separated from those in which its owners ride; such owners receive from the carrier checks, a kind of receipt, upon surrender of which the luggage is given up to whomsoever, so equipped, calls for it. In consequence of this, it has become a frequent custom for travelers to hand their baggage checks to a representative of a chosen hotel, and there, as its guest, await the arrival of the baggage the check calls for. It has consequently been held that one who becomes the guest of a hotel, by giving his baggage checks into its possession, places the goods they represent in its custody, i/nfra hospitium, so far as to make the innkeeper responsible for goods which, by means of the possession of such checks, his representative or agent receives, although the baggage be never brought within the walls, yards or outbuildings of the hotel.
