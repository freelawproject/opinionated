Lowber, trustee under the said will. Whereupon it is ordered that the defendant, Henry S. Lowber, do forthwith convey to the complainant and the defendant, Thomas Sergeant, and their heirs as tenants in common, the four several lots or pieces of ground referred to in the pleadings as S.

Spencer Miller, do pay to the complainant, out of the personal estate of his testatrix, a moiety of the sum of two thousand and thirty-seven dollars, together with interest thereon from the 5th day of October 1863, and if the personal estate of the said testatrix shall not be sufficient to pay the said sum, it appearing to the court that of the said proceeds of sale, the sum of $1000 was invested by the said testatrix in the purchase of the said premises, No. 922 Clinton street, which she devised to her son the defendant, Thomas Sergeant, in fee, it is ordered that the said sum of $1000, with interest as aforesaid, or so much thereof as shall be required' to make up the moiety to which the said complainant is so entitled as aforesaid, be and remain a lien and charge on the said last-mentioned premises in her favour, and that the defendant, E.

The course of devolution, or \u201cmanner\u201d in which the testator indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the estate, given by him to his daughter, her heirs and assigns, shall be transmitted, differing in no respect (except so far as concerns the right of alienation) from what such course would have been had he said nothing, the indication or expression of such manner (his daughter being the only object of his bounty in existence at the time) can only be regarded as evidence of an intention which cannot prevail against the rules of law, viz.: that the estate to her heirs and assigns should be inalienable during her life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-6\">2. That we come to the same result if we consider the devise as falling under the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case (the modern reasons for which are a corollary of two fundamental maxims of the law), and treat it as a devise to testator\u2019s daughter, of an equitable estate for life, with remainder to her heirs, viz.: 1. To her lineal descendants, or in their absence, 2. To her other heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-7\">That the result arrived at, which in either case is the same, is the proper construction of this devise, is shown by the following reasons:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-8\">1. That a comparison of this with other parts of the testator\u2019s will shows that he used the words \u201cheirs and assigns\u201d designedly, and in a different sense from \u201cchildren,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-9\">2. That if Sarah Bache is held to have a mere life estate, the words \u201c heirs and assigns\u201d must be stricken out as meaningless.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-10\">3. That if her estate is merely for life, there would be an intestacy if she failed to make a will, in the event either of her not marrying, or of her not having children, or of there being no child or issue of a deceased child in being at the time of her death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-11\">4. That there was no \u201c child,\u201d &amp;c., in being at the time of testator\u2019s death: Doe <em>v. </em>Davies, 4 B. &amp; Ad. 43; and the words used, viz.: \u201cto her children (if she should marry and have children), and the issue of any of her deceased children,\u201d and \u201cif she should die without leaving any child or children, or the issue of a deceased child or children, then\u201d to her appointees by will, describe neither individuals nor a single class, but \u201c'evidently an entire line of succession:\u201d Haldeman <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 4 Wright 29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-12\">5. If the words \u201c children or issue of a deceased child\u201d are words of purchase, such issue would take by purchase the share which their parent \u201cwould have taken\u201d had he or she survived the said Sarah Bache; and in such event would take <em>per capita. </em>Eor example, if Henry Sergeant, who died in his mother\u2019s lifetime, had left two children and sixteen grandchildren (the issue of deceased children), the third which he would have had must be divided into eighteen parts \u2014 his children taking only an equal share with the grandchildren: Leigh <em>v. </em>Norbury, 13 Ves. 338. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>It is not to be presumed that such was the testator\u2019s intention. See Smith on Ex. Int., \u00a7\u00a7 510, 511, 512.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-7\">6. The gift being to Sarah Bache, her heirs and assigns, and these latter words being at least operative in the event of her not marrying and-not exercising the power of appointment if the children and issue, &amp;c., are to take as purchasers, and thus reduce her fee to a mere life estate, there would be a manifest inducement to her to remain single. Such construction makes the devise in restraint of marriage. The presumption, therefore, is against it: 2 Cruise, tit. xiii., ch. 1, \u00a7 61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-8\">This case is wholly different from the cases of Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 9, Chew\u2019s Appeal, Id. 24, Lantz <em>v. </em>Trusler, Id. 482, which will probably be cited by the complainant. In none of these was the estate in the first instance given to the first taker, \u201cher heirs and assigns.\u201d In all of them there were children, or the issue of a deceased child, in being when the will was made. The words describing the persons who were to take in remainder were much narrower in their meaning, and there were words of superadded limitation which are not found here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-9\">As to the cases of Harris <em>v. </em>McElroy, 9 Wright 216, and Ralston <em>v. </em>Wain, 8 Id. 279, should they be cited, it is sufficient to say, that they were cases of gifts by deed, in which of course no words but \u201cheirs\u201d or \u201cheirs of the body\u201d can be words of limitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-10\">The inheritance here, unless it was in the testator\u2019s daughter Sarah, was in abeyance when the devise took effect, and we submit that it would be in abeyance during her whole life; for until her death it would be impossible to say whether the persons who are to take would be the children or the issue of a deceased child (for the will says such issue are to take not the share of their parent, but the share which their parent would have had if he or she had survived), or the appointees of the first taker. Similar words to which were said, by his Honour Judge Read, in Harris <em>v. </em>McElroy, 9 Wright 216, to confer a contingent interest only during the life of the first taker.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-11\">The case of Haldeman <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 4 Wright 28, much more nearly resembles the present one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-12\">There the income was given during the life of testator\u2019s unmarried daughter, and after her death, then to descend and go to the child, and if children, share and share alike. If she should die and leave no lawful issue, then her share to fall into the residuary estate. It was held that the daughter was entitled to an estate tail, enlarged by Act of 1855 to a fee. It was admitted that in the case of a \u201c gift for life, remainder to children, and in default of issue of tenant for life, over,\u201d the words \u201cin default,\u201d &amp;c., are referable to the designated objects of the last limitation, <em>i. e., </em>the \u201c children\u201d (Hayes on Estate Tail, *29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>30), but the decision was put on the ground that it appeared by the whole will, that the word \u201c children\u201d was \u201c evidently intended to define an entire-line of succession.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-6\">In our case it clearly appears that the words used are equally extensive; and we have, besides, the gift to the \u201cheirs and assigns\u201d of the first taker, in so many words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-7\">In the interpretation of this will, the testator\u2019s daughter is to be considered as .still unmarried. She is Sarah Bache, not Mrs. Sergeant. The events which have taken place since the testator\u2019s death cannot, of course, aid us in reaching his intention at the time.of the execution of the instrument, and we are to view the circumstances precisely as they then were.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-8\">Still less are we to-be affected by the character of the will which Mrs. Sergeant has made; whether it is in accordance with our views of what it should be, or whether her selection of objects for the bestowal of her charities has been judicious or otherwise, is wholly irrelevant to the question before the court, and we must take care, therefore, lest any seeming case of hardship should divert attention from the true point, and lead to one of those \u201cbad precedents\u201d which such cases are proverbial for giving rise to.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-9\"><em>Henry Wharton </em>'and <em>William Henry Ilawle, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7K\">The argument for the appellant is an attempt to revive the theory which, suddenly developed in Williams <em>v. </em>Leech, 4 Casey 89, and Price <em>v. </em>Taylor, Id. 95, was as suddenly exploded in Guthrie's Appeal, 1 Wright 9, viz.: that as in England, a gift to A. for life, remainder to his heirs, differs only in words from a gift to A. and.his heirs (for in either case A. is the stock of inheritance), so in Pennsylvania, a gift to A. for life, remainder to his children in fee (or to his children living at his death, and the issue of those then dead), should not differ from a gift to A. and his heirs, because under our Intestate Law his children or their issue are in fact his heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-10\">The fallacy of this reasoning, in mere matter of logic, is plain on its face, for a man\u2019s children and their issue are not his heirs, but only some of his heirs. The substantial answer given in Guthrie\u2019s Appeal wras twofold:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-11\">1. If the fact were so, it would be immaterial, for the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case does not apply to designated persons, though they be in fact heirs. Thus, a gift to A. for life, remainder to his first, second, and other sons in tail successively, remainder to his daughters as tenants in common, remainder over (which would be exactly the course of descent of an estate tail in A.), does nevertheless not give him an estate tail, but only a life estate: Goodtitle <em>v. </em>Herring, 1 East 164; Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>2. But'the fact is not so. The persons who would take, under the Intestate Law, as the \u201c heirs\u201d of A., are not necessarily the same as those who would take under a gift to A. for life, and after his death to his children, and the issue of those then dead. When they are identical it is by accident, for they refer to a different stock of descent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-6\">In the present case, one-seventh of the testator\u2019s estate is given to trustees in trust for his daughter Sarah Bache, her heirs and assigns. This fulfils in general terms the testator\u2019s purpose of equal division \u2014 then comes the expression of the other intention, to give only a life interest, &amp;c., \u2014 \u201cin manner following, that is to say,\u201d to permit her to receive the rents, &amp;c., during her life (which gave her the legal estate), and after her decease, to convey and transfer the share to her children (if she should marry and have children, w'hicli she did), and the issue of any of her deceased children. This would give a vested estate in fee simple to the children respectively, as they came into being, subject only to be divested in case of their respective deaths leaving issue, which has not happened: Smith on Executory Interests, \u00a7 282; Chew\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 24. The words after her decease do not import any contingency: see Boraston\u2019s Case, 3 Coke 21 a; Chew\u2019s Appeal, <em>ut supra;. </em>Hawkins on the Construction of Wills 237.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-7\">Lastly comes the provision, that if she should die without leaving any child, children, or the issue of a child or children, then in trust to convey, &amp;c., to such persons as she should appoint by will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-8\">Why is not all this perfectly valid as it stands ? It certainly is plain enough.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-9\">The argument on the other side is, that these limitations do not differ in legal effect from the prior limitation to her heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-10\">We answer, first, they do materially differ in order of descent or succession, as we have shown above. Second, the previous words \u201cheirs and assigns,\u201d as qualified by the phrase \u201cin manner following, namely,\u201d mean such \u201cheirs and assigns\u201d as are thereinafter spoken of, to wit: \u201c children, or issue of deceased children\u201d on the one hand, and on the other devisees who would be her \u201c assigns.\u201d This is made still more clear by the express power to devise in case of her death without children or issue, which shows that the testator did not mean by the word \u201cheirs\u201d her heirs general. That the word \u201cheirs,\u201d or \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d may be by subsequent words explained to mean sons, daughters, or children, is one of the best established and most familiar exceptions to the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case: 2 Jarman on Wills 300; Lowe <em>v. </em>Davies, 2 Ld. Raym. 156, s. c. <em>per nom. </em>Law <em>v. </em>Davis, 2 Strange 849, 1 Ba-rnardiston 238; Goodtitle <em>v. </em>Herring, 1 East 264; Smith on Executory Int. \u00a7 479. See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Doe d. Woodall <em>v. </em>Woodall, 3 Com. B. 349 ; Jordan <em>v. </em>Adams, 9 Id. N. S. 483.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-6\">The whole case is clear and simple. The first apparent gift in fee to Sarah Bache is cut down by the subsequent words (which if there were a conflict would govern in a will), to an estate for life, with a gift by way of remainder in fee to her children, and the issue of any of those who might be dead at her decease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-7\">At the time of Mrs. Sergeant\u2019s death she had two children: one the complainant, the other the defendant Thomas Sergeant. They now ask for the estate devised to them by their grandfather.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-8\">The relief prayed by the bill is twofold: \u2014 First. To have the real estate which was devised by the testator in trust for Mrs. Sergeant and her children, conveyed to the latter by the present trustee under his will. About the right to this there can be no doubt, as is above shown. The proper parties are before the court. The complainant and her brother are also the heirs at law of Mrs. Sergeant. Her legatees are represented by her executor, Mr. Miller, who having a power and trust for sale, is a sufficient party on their behalf under the present equity rules. There can be no objection to the decree in this respect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-9\">Second. To have the personal estate of Mrs. Sergeant applied to repay the amount for which the twrenty-four shares of stock of the American Fire Insurance Company were sold, with interest. At the time this stock was transferred, as alleged in the bill, the original trustees in whose name the stock stood were dead, and none others had then been appointed in their place. The transfer was effected under a power of attorney executed by herself, a copy of which is annexed to the bill, in which it was alleged that the trust was at an end, and that she was entitled to an absolute interest therein. Induced thereto by this allegation, the company permitted the transfer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-10\">Mrs. Sergeant had no right thus to annihilate the interest of her children in this stock. Even if the remainder to them had been a contingent one it could not be destroyed by her, the subject being personal estate, and her interest therein only an equitable one: Ralston <em>v. </em>Waln, 8 Wright 279; Harris <em>v. </em>McElroy, 9 Id. 220; Hill on Trustees 522, and note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-11\">The fact that the company would also be liable for permitting such a transfer, is not material. If we should sue them they would in turn recover back the like amount from Mrs. Sergeant\u2019s executor. To avoid circuity and expense this is the simpler and at the same time the fairest course, for the company was misled, and received no benefit from the breach of trust, while Mrs. Sergeant did. The complainant was 'therefore entitled, first, to a conveyance of the moiety of the real estate mentioned in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>pleadings; second, to elect either to have replaced specifically the one-half of the twenty-four shares of stock, or to receive half of the proceeds of their sale, with interest from her mother\u2019s death; and, if necessary, she was entitled to ask that the Clinton street house (in whose purchase a part of such proceeds was invested), be sold by her mother\u2019s executor fpr that purpose.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AacQ\">May 15th 1865,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b495-6\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL0\">The simple question in this case is, what estate did Mrs. Sergeant take under the will of her father Richard Bache, she leaving two children, the plaintiff and the defendant Thomas .Sergeant ? If only a life estate, then the decree below is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Richard Bache, by his will dated January 2d 1810, and proved on the 2d of August in the same year, gave to three trustees in fee simple a seventh part of his estate in trust for Sarah Bache, afterwards intermarried with Judge Sergeant, whom she survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The trust was for her life, and after her decease to convey the said seventh part to her children (if she should marry and have children) and the issue of any of her deceased children, to be equally divided among them as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants; but all the issue of a deceased child shall only take the share and proportion to w'hich their parents would have been entitled, had he or she survived the said Sarah Bache, and no more. This undoubtedly would give Mrs. Sergeant only an equitable'life estate. Then follows a provision which is inoperative under the circumstances, and which might for the purposes of the present case be stricken out of the will, giving her power, in case she left no children or issue as aforesaid, to appoint the said seventh part by her last will, or writing in nature of a last will, to such persons and for such estates as she should think proper. The trustees were given power to sell the said premises, and it is conceded that the whole legal estate in the same was vested in them. It is clear, also, from the examples given by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that this will under certain contingencies would produce different results as to the persons entitled to take from the Intestate Law, supposing Mrs. Sergeant to have had a fee simple, and to have died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The only argument against the construction giving only a life estate to Mrs. Sergeant, under the present rulings of the court, and which I do not think it necessary to repeat or discuss, is founded upon these words introductory of the clauses which have been mentioned: \u201c In trust, nevertheless, for the use and benefit of my daughter Sarah Bache, her heirs and assigns, in manner following \u2014 that is to say \u2014 to my said daughter Sarah Bache, to have and enjoy the rents, issues, profits, income, and interest of the said last-mentioned one full seventh part or share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of the premises <em>for and during her natural </em>life, <em>and after her </em>deceaseThe trustees are then directed to convey to the children as before stated, or in case of the other contingencies to convey to her appointees by will.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">It is clear, therefore, that these words have no effect in enlarging Mrs. Sergeant\u2019s life estate to a fee simple, when the will of her father directly and positively negatives any such intention on his part. Richard Bache intended Mrs. Sergeant\u2019s children and his grandchildren should have his property, and, therefore, Mrs. Sergeant in her lifetime could not legally convey more than her life interest, and her will so far as regarded this seventh had no operation, except so far as either of her children might elect to take under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">As Mrs. Sergeant had only a life interest, Mrs. Perry takes directly under the will of her grandfather-one-half of the one-seventh, and as the decree below was made on this assumption, and with a view to the special circumstances of the case, all we have to say is that</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
