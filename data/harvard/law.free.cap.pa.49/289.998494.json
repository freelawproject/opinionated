Martin, the defendant in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">Mrs. Chambers died in March 1860, seised in fee of said ground-rent of $225, having first made her will, the executors named in which, by virtue of certain powers therein given, granted and assigned said ground-rent to John L. Martin, the defendant, in fee, whereby the same merged and became extinguished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-12\">The bill, after setting out the title of the respective properties, alleged that complainant, as the owner, by title from Alexander Henry, of the dwelling-house and lot adjoining the said corner premises on the south, was entitled to the full benefit and privilege of said restriction; that his back buildings face north, and the maintenance of the restriction was absolutely necessary for proper enjoyment of his property, since, if the restriction be infringed or broken, the health and comfort of the occupiers of said property will be irreparably injured; that, by means of the restriction, the light and air have access from Locust street, across the corner lot, to complainant\u2019s premises. That, on the western side of said ten-feet wide alley the wall of the Musical Fund Hall rises to the height of a three-story dwelling-house; and, unless the restriction is enforced upon the corner lot it may be built upon the full width to its entire depth to said alley, and without limit as to height, and thus complainant\u2019s property be shut in, leaving only a narrow well for access of light and air, and the health and comfort of the occupants, and the property itself be greatly injured; that it was the intention of defendant to build on the corner lot, without regard to the restriction, under pretence of a right so to do, and prayed an injunctioir to restrain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>defendant, his agents, &amp;c., from infringing said restriction, and. for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\">The answer admitted the allegations of the bill as to the title to said two lots of ground and dwelling-houses now vested in the complainant and defendant respectively; but alleged that in the deed from Henry to Drosddorf and Roberts for the corner property, there is no remedy or penalty prescribed for breach of said condition, nor any covenant on the part of the grantees to perform it; that said Alexander Henry laid out the large lot mentioned in the bill prior to the conveyance to Drosddorf and Roberts, according to a plan given in the answer; that said Henry did not, by his will or otherwise, give and devise to the trustees, to whom he devised the premises adjoining the corner, any right, title, or interest, in or to the condition in the deed to Drosddorf and Roberts ; that the grant and assignment from Henry\u2019s executors to Mrs. Chambers conveyed the said ground-rent of $225 to her, \u201ctogether with the reversions and remainders of the premises, and all the estate, right, title, interest, property, claim, and demand whatsoever, which was of the said Alexander Henry, as well at law as in equity, of, in, and to the same, and of, in, and to the lot of ground whereout the said rent is issuing and payable;\u201d that said surviving trustee did not in any way grant or convey to complainant any right, title, or interest, in or to said condition in the deed to Drosddorf and Roberts; that the executors of Mrs. Chambers, by their deed to the defendant, conveyed to him the said ground-rent, \u201c and the reversions and remainders thereof, and all covenants for payment thereof, and all the estate, right, title, interest, property, claim, and demand whatsoever, which was of the said Martha H. Chambers, at and immediately prior to the time of her decease, of, in, and to the same, and of, in, and to the said lot of ground whereon the same was so as aforesaid charged;\u201d denied that complainant is entitled to any benefit or privilege of said restriction in the deed to Drosddorf and Roberts; or that the enforcing of said restriction is necessary for the proper enjoyment of complainant\u2019s property, or that the health and comfort of its occupants or the value of the property would be injured and damaged, if the restriction be not maintained; and admitted that he intended to build without regard to said restriction, as follows, to wit: \u201c At the rear end of said dwelling, and attached thereto, a piazza, extending in height from the ground to the eave of the roof of said dwelling, enclosed on the south side With a nine-inch brick wall and open to the west, and extending about eight feet westward; and also, at the distance of about fifteen feet westward from said dwelling, a back building, to be connected with said dwelling by a stairway on the side next to Locust street, and to be in width from said Locust street nineteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>feet four inches, and in depth westward 'forty-four' feet, to the ten-feet wide alley, and nearly as high as .the eave. of said dwelling, leaving on the south, along the\" entire length of said hack building, a space of three feet two inches between its face and his party line 'on the south, and a clear space, between said back'building and complainant\u2019s back building, of ele.ven feet;\u201d and alleged that at the time of the deed to Dr\u00f3sddorf and Roberts, that part of the city was almost exclusively occupied- by dwellings ; that since then, places of business have been advancing into that neighbourhood, and he desired to improve his property in such manner as'to conform to advances of business, that he might enjoy its just fruits, and not be deprived of: them by the diminution of its value as a mere place of residence.' \u25a0 ' \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">It appeared, from the proofs, that complainant had known of the restriction before he purchased the property adjoining the corner from the surviving trustee under Henry\u2019s will; that the trustee had no doubt but that the purchaser of that property would be entitled to the benefit of the restriction upon the corner property; but at the same time was unwilling, as the will made no mention of the' restriction, and he was acting in a fiduciary character only, to execute a deed containing an express grant of. the benefit of the restriction; that, in 'consequence of this unwillingness, complainant, at the joint expense of himself and said trustee, obtained the opinion of eminent counsel (the late Thomas I. Wharton, Esq.), that the purchaser would be entitled to the benefit of the restriction as appurtenant to the property, of which benefit he could not be deprived by any act on the part of any other representative of Henry; and that upon this opinion complainant took his deed from the surviving trustee, without any express grant of the benefit of the restriction. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">A motion for a preliminary injunction upon the bill, affidavits, and counter affidavits having been denied prior to the filing of the answer, the defendant immediately went on and erected a building in violation of the restriction, after the intended plan set out in his answer. When the case came up for hearing on bill, answer, and proofs, the bill was dismissed without argument, and the 'complainant took this appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-8\"><em>S. Q. </em>and <em>S. H. Perkins, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARR\">The restriction must have been imposed for the benefit of the property now held by complainant. There is no other purpose for which it can be supposed it was intended. Complainant knew of its. existence, was careful to be assured of his right to it before purchasing; and its advantage must have entered into the consideration he paid. Defendant never paid for its release or extinguishment. The general terms of the release of the ground-rent must be restricted by the recitals: Rapp <em>v. </em>Rapp, 6 Barr 48; Kirby <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Taylor, 6 Johns. Chanc. 251; Jackson <em>v. </em>Stackhouse, 6 Cowen 122; Cole <em>v. </em>Gibson, 1 Vesey, Sr. 504. It was the estate in the ground-rent alone which became merged; and even if it be conceded that the restriction is annexed to the estate in the rent it is not merged: Preston on Merger 454.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">The clause imposing the restriction, notwithstanding the words <em>\u201c </em>upon condition,\u201d is not necessarily to be treated as a condition. It is a covenant, or agreement; or, if not a covenant, creates an easement for the benefit of the adjoining property; and the only property which it adjoins is that now owned by complainant. A clause will never be construed as a condition when its language can be resolved into a covenant: Paschall <em>v. </em>Passmore, 15 P. S. R., 3 Harris 307. See also Cromwell\u2019s Case, 2 Co. 71 a; Touchstone, p. 122. Any w;ords which import an agreement will make a covenant: 3 Com. Dig. 263, <em>Covenant </em>A. 2. And see Hoyt <em>v. </em>Carter, 19 Barb. S. C. Rep. 212. The complainant, even if unable to bring an action of covenant, is yet entitled to the aid of a court of equity to enforce the covenant or agreement made for the benefit of the estate which he now owns: Blecker <em>v. </em>Bingham, 3 Paige Ch.

It is a case of <em>estoppel in </em>pais: Pickard <em>v. </em>Sears, 6 Ad. <em>&amp; </em>El. 469; Gregg <em>v. </em>Wells, 9 Id. 97; Freeman <em>v. </em>Cooke, 2 Exch.

It follows immediately after the grant without dependence on any other sentence of the deed; the words are the words of the grantor, and not of the grantees; and are compulsory on the grantees not to do an act: Co. Lit. 201 a. The condition is repugnant to the grant, and therefore void. Smith on Real and Personal Property 62; 2 Crabb\u2019s Law of Real Property 795, sec. 2132; Littleton, sec. 360; Co.

There was a reservation of a ground-rent; and a covenant on the part of the grantor for quiet enjoyment so long as the grantees paid the ground-rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">If not void, the condition was extinguished by the verbal permission given to Cash to build in disregard of it.

Nor is there anything in the deed creating it, to show that it was intended for the benefit of the adjoining property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-9\">There was no general plan of building and mutual agreement and obligation, as in Talmadge <em>v. </em>East River Bank, and Cole <em>v. </em>Sims.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMPB\">In 1814, Drosddorf and Roberts bought the corner lot from Alexander Henry subject to a perpetual rent, and with the condition written in this deed, that they, their heirs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>and assigns, should not erect any building on the hack part of it higher than ten feet; Henry being then the owner of the lot adjoining on the south. The corner lot afterwards passed successively to five different owners, the last of whom is the defendant Martin, and in all the deeds the same condition is repeated; so that Martin himself in 1858 purchased on these express terms. Of the adjoining lot, Alexander Henry died seised, and in 1851, his testamentary trustee conveyed it to the plaintiff Clark ; and the rent reserved on the corner lot by Henry was purchased by Martin in 1860. Our question is, has Clark as owner of the adjoining lot, any such right to the condition or terms imposed upon Martin\u2019s title as entitles him to claim in equity that Martin shall he compelled to observe them ? We think he has.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In a proceeding in the common law form it would be necessary to inquire into the form in which the right is reserved, in order to decide whether it should be sued for as a condition, or a covenant, or as a simple contract; but in the equity form of proceeding we inquire only into its substantial elements; what duty does it assure, and to whom ?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Here the duty of the defendant is so plain that one may read it running ; it is clearly inscribed on every link of the chain of his title to the lot. He took his title expressly on the terms already briefly mentioned. He was not to erect on the back part of his lot any building higher than ten feet, afterwards changed to eleven. To whom then does he owe the duty ? No one doubts that it is to the grantor who reserved or imposed the duty, and to his heirs and assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">But did the grantor reserve this duty to himself, his heirs and assigns, as a mere personal duty, and thus retain in himself, or them, the vain right of saying that lot is not mine, but the owner is subject to my pleasure in the mode of building upon it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Common sense forbids this, and the law would not allow itself to be troubled with such vain engagements. It is not pretended that this restriction was intended for the benefit of the ground-rent reserved by Henry. And such a pretence would be entirely unreasonable ; for a restriction that diminishes the value of the lot and of the houses that may be erected on it, cannot increase the security of the rent issuing out of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">We have no other resource, therefore, than to attribute the restriction to the purpose of benefiting the adjoining lot, then owned by Henry.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Common sense cannot doubt its purpose, and thus it becomes plain that the duty created by the condition and restriction is a duty to the owner of the adjoining lot, whoever he might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Very plainly, also, it is a duty that admits the right of the owner of the adjoining lot to have the privilege or appurtenance of light and air over the defendant\u2019s lot, and that admits this to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>be so far subject or servient to that, that the buildings on this must, for the benefit of that, be so limited in height, according to the condition in the deeds. :</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">So such stipulations are always regarded when a form of remedy is selected and allowed, which can admit of treating the case according to the very substance of the contract. '</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The remedy asked for here is just such a one, under the law authorizing the courts in equity form, to prevent or restrain \u201cthe commission or continuance of acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the interests of the community or the rights of individuals.\u201d And so abundant are the instances in the administration of equity wherein this very duty has been specifically enforced, that a reference to the cases may very well stand instead of a discussion of' the question: 2 Ashmead 221, 335; 2 Harris 186; 3 Paige 246, 254; 2 Phillips 774; 15 Simons 377; 7 Jurist (1861, Rolls Court), 11; 2 Mylne <em>&amp; </em>K. 552; 11 Paige 414; 8 Id. 351; 2 Duer 614-23; 23 Barb. 153; 23 Law Reporter 401 (Whitney <em>v. </em>Union Railway Co. 1860, Superior Court of Mass.); 23 Eng. L. <em>&amp; </em>Eq. R. 584 ; 9 Simons 196.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax-\">It wasjobjected at the argument that this remedy applies only as a means of compelling an observance of the 'terms involved in a general-plan of lots;' and this element actually exists in about half of the cases1 just cited ; yet they are not decided on that\u2019 consideration; \u25a0 It .is not because a plan is deranged that the court interferes, but because rights are invaded, or about to be; and this fact may exist in a plan of two'lots, as well as in one of two hundred. The plan often furnishes the proof of the terms on which sales were made; but the fact of the alleged terms is as effective when proved by a single deed as when proved by a plan.</p>\n<p id=\"ASV\">It is objected, also, that the restriction relied on here, is in the form of a condition, and that it was released by the release of part of it. But this, if true, in such a case, would apply only where a forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s estate for a breach of the condition is-demanded; Equity does not so treat the case where mere obedience is demanded. And here, at the very time when part of the right Avas released, the right to the remainder was expressly continued or renewed. The right is very clearly defined,\"and it is no more inconsistent with the grant of the fee simple than any other right of easement is, and the plaintiff is entitled to a decree in his favour. The breach of the contract and the amount of iniury done are plainly sufficient for this: 12 Harris 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">It appears by the evidence that, since this suit was brought, the defendant, in disregard of the suit, has gone on and erected the building. This was very Avrong, and puts the court into a very painful position. Our decree in equity is not so severe as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>a judgment at law would be in ejectment for a breach of a valid condition in such a case, for it does not forfeit, the house and lot: 8 Pick. 284. But the abatement of part of a house is so unusual, and so seldom \u25a0 that persons put themselves into such a position as to make such a decree necessary, that we have great reluctance in so decreeing, and have hopes that the parties may come to some reasonable terms. However, our duty is very plain,- and the defendant, by disregard of his contract, and by recklessness building, pending the suit, has brought the evil on himself. Under the general relief clause, the plaintiff can have a decree of abatement, without any amendment to his bill, by reciting the fact of the erection pending the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Let the decree be drawn in favour of the plaintiff, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b301-7\">Read, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
