He appealed the Department\u2019s action to the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review. The Board affirmed. At appellant\u2019s request, the full Commission reviewed the discharge. It affirmed. He then sought a declaratory judgment in the District Court that he had been improperly removed and was entitled to reinstatement. The District Court, on cross motions for summary judgment, granted judgment for the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-22\">Appellant claims (1) that he is a veteran entitled to the protections of Section 14 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) that he was not afforded those protections. The Government, in its briefs here and before both the Board of Appeals and Review and the Civil Service Commission, argues that appellant is not a veteran within the meaning of that Act. The record shows that appellant was drafted into the Army as an enlisted man in May of 1942. On August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>10, 1943, he received an \u201chonorable discharge\u201d in order to accept, on the next day, appointment as an officer. During his active service as an officer certain charges were filed against him, and in January of 1944 he was separated from the Army under conditions other than honorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"> The Veterans\u2019 Preference Act is applicable to \u201cthose ex-servicemen * * * who have served on active duty in any branch of the armed forces of the United States, during any war, * * * and have been separated therefrom under honorable conditions.\u201d See 58 Stat. 387 (1944), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 851. Appellant did not meet this last requisite. His service was continuous, and he was separated from it under conditions other than honorable. The \u201chonorable discharge\u201d which he received in August of 1943 did not mark the termination of his active duty, and is not controlling here. See Kohlberg v. Gray, 1953, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 207 F.2d 35. It should be noted further that the regulations of the Veterans\u2019 Administration, the executive agency most expert in the problems arising after military service, are in harmony with the construction here adopted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, we hold that appellant was not entitled to the shelter of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. Furthermore, the particular post he occupied was one which was excepted from the classified civil service. Accordingly, he cannot claim privileged status under the Lloyd-LaFollette Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor is the Performance Rating Act of 1950<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> applicable, since he was discharged on specific charges of incompetence. Thomas v. Ward, 1955, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 302, 225 F.2d 953, certiorari denied 1956, 350 U.S. 958, 76 S.Ct: 348, 100 L.Ed. 833; Jones v. Hobby, 1955, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 53, 223 F.2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">We should not be understood as holding that appellant and persons similarly situated are completely without protection against arbitrary discharge. We think it well to point out that appellant\u2019s discharge was effected in a basically fair manner: the Department of Justice afforded him a reasonable opportunity to defend himself against carefully articulated written charges. And a reading of the record convinces us that the Appeals Examining Office of the Civil Service Commission held a fair hearing. Cf. Baughman v. Green, 1956, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 150, 229 F.2d 33; Washington v. Summerfield, 1955, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 105, 228 F.2d 452; Williams v. Cravens, 1954, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 380, 210 F.2d 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Appellant\u2019s other allegations of error, including alleged interference by the Department of Justice with the Civil Service Commission\u2019s deliberations, are irrelevant under our approach to the case. However, we do not wish to be understood as having overlooked these allegations, or as considering them to be other than serious and important. We simply do not reach them in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-12\">. 08 Stat. 390 (1944), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 803: \u201cNo permanent or indefinite preference eligible * * * shall bo discharged * * * except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service and for reasons given in writing, and the person whose discharge * * * is sought shall have at least thirty days\u2019 advance written notice * * * stating any and all reasons, specifically and in detail, for any such proposed action; such preference eligible shall be allowed a reasonable time for answering the same personally and in writing, and for furnishing affidavits in support of such answer, and shall have the right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission from an adverse decision of the administrative officer so acting, such appeal to be made in writing within a reasonable length of time after the date of receipt of notice of such adverse decision * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-5\">.

The entire service in such case constitutes one period of service, and the conditions of final termination of active service will govern and determine basic eligibility to compensation or pension.\u201d The Civil Service Commission, charged with the administration of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, takes the view that this appellant and persons similarly situated are entitled to the benefits of the Act. We accord much weight to the view taken by that agency, but cannot agree with it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b178-13\">. 37 Stat. 555 (1912), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 652: \u201cNo person in the classified civil service of the United States shall be removed or suspended without pay therefrom except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of such service and for reasons given in writing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b178-15\">. 64 Stat. 1098 (1950), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2001 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
