Gertz. It is alleged in the government\u2019s libel of information that these coins are likenesses of the hapa haneri coin of the former Kingdom of Hawaii. Their unauthorized possession by Gertz, the government contends, is unlawful under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 489, and the coins are subject to forfeiture under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">The district court held, after trial, that possession of the coins by Gertz was not unlawful, because 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 489 applies only to likenesses of the coins of currently-existing countries and governments. United States v. 3,827 Coins, D.C.D.Hawaii, 144 F.Supp. 740. Judgment was therefore entered dismissing the libel of information and ordering return of the coins to Gertz. The United States appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">Hawaii had status as a sovereign nation from October 8, 1840, when King Kamehameha III proclaimed the first constitution, until the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii to the United States on July 8, 1898. The Hawaiian Organic Act, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 491 et seq., enacted in April, 1900, established a territorial form of government in Hawaii, which continues to this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">The hapa haneri coins were minted by the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1847, and were then placed in circulation as genuine money of the Kingdom. These coins, which had a face value of one cent, have not been in general circulation since 1900.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-16\">It is therefore established that the seized coins, if assumed to be likenesses of the hapa haneri, are not likenesses of the coins of a currently-existing country or government. The question for determination here is whether this circumstance precludes application of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-17\">This statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6Y\">\u201cWhoever, within the United States, makes or brings therein from any foreign country, or possesses with intent to sell, give away, or in any other manner uses the same, except under authority of the Secretary of the Treasury or other proper officer of the United States, any token, disk, or device in the likeness or similitude as to design, color, or the inscription thereon of any of the coins of the United States or of any foreign country issued as money, either under the authority of the United States or under the authority of any foreign government shall be fined not more than $100.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-18\">If this section is to be given the-construction contended for by appellant, it would make unlawful the unauthorized possession of replicas of the stater of ancient Carthage, the denarius of ancient Rome, and the shekel of the ancient Kingdom of Judea. This is a result so startling that such a construction ought not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>to be accepted unless compelled by statutory language or legislative history. Appellant concedes that there is no helpful legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Turning first to the language of \u00a7 489, appellant points out that the section contains no language expressly limiting the terms \u201cforeign country\u201d or \u201cforeign government\u201d to currently-existing countries or governments, and that, on the other hand, each such term is preceded by the adjective \u201cany.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The lack of express limiting language in this section does not appeal to us as a good indication that countries and governments no longer in existence are within the scope of the section. One ordinarily thinks of a foreign country or a foreign government as a presently-existing territory, nation, or institution. Without qualifying language or special context, one would not ordinarily comprehend the term to include countries and governments long since extinct. It therefore seems to us that what is significant here is not the omission of language limiting those terms to currently-existing institutions, but the omission of language expanding those terms to include countries and governments which have passed into history.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Nor, in our opinion, does the presence of the adjective \u201cany\u201d provide the clear indication of an expanded meaning which appellant\u2019s reading of the section requires. The adjective \u201cany\u201d does not necessarily serve to enlarge the noun it modifies to include objects no longer in existence. For example, the use of the term \u201cany continent\u201d would not, except under some special context, make clear that the so-called lost continent of Atlantis was included in the reference. \u201cAny\u201d animal usually means any live animal, and \u201cany\u201d building would not ordinarily be taken to include buildings which had been torn down or destroyed by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Section 489 has some context, on the other hand, which quite definitely supports the construction adopted by the trial court. The term \u201cforeign country\u201d appears twice in this section. It is first used in this context: \u201cWhoever, within the United States, makes or brings therein from any foreign country * * * .\u201d Since the verb \u201cbrings\u201d is in the present tense, it must be that the term \u201cforeign country,\u201d used in this context, means a currently-existing country. One cannot, in 1957, bring a coin from a country which passed out of existence more than half a century ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\"> If the term \u201cforeign country,\u201d as first used in \u00a7 489, means a currently-existing country, it is probably intended to have a like meaning when again used at a later point in the same section. It is a familiar rule of statutory construction that, where the same word or phrase is used in different parts of a statute, it will be presumed, in the absence of anything clearly indicating a contrary intent, that the word or phrase is used in the same sense throughout. Under circumstances giving application to this rule, there is a corollary that, where the meaning of the word or phrase in one instance is clear, this meaning will be attached to it elsewhere. Schooler v. United State, 8 Cir., 231 F.2d 560, 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">Applying that rule and corollary here, it would follow that \u00a7 489 forbids only the unauthorized possession of coins of the United States or of any currently-existing foreign country.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">The parties have devoted much attention to the definition of \u201cforeign government,\u201d set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This definition, which is concededly applicable to \u00a7 489, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>\u201cThe term \u2018foreign government\u2019, as used in this title, includes any government, faction, or body of insurgents within a country with which the United States is at peace, irrespective of recognition by the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Appellee argues that the quoted section defines a foreign government as that of \u201ca country with which the United States <em>is </em>at peace * * * ,\u201d (emphasis supplied) and contends that the United States could only be at peace with an existing country.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Appellant points out, however, that this statutory definition is preceded by the words, \u201cthe term \u2018foreign government\u2019, as used in this title, <em>includes </em>* * *(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The word \u201cincludes\u201d is usually a term of enlargement, and not of limitation. As stated in Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U.S. 95, 100, 62 S.Ct. 1, 4, 86 L.Ed. 65, \u201c \u2018including\u2019 is not one of all-embracing definition, but connotes simply an illustrative application of the general principle.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The likelihood that \u201cincludes\u201d is used in this sense in \u00a7 11 is fortified by the fact that in one of the definitions set out in chapter 1 of title 18 (\u00a7 9) U.S.C.A., \u201cmeans\u201d is used instead of \u201cincludes,\u201d and in another such section (\u00a7 6) both \u201cmeans\u201d and \u201cincludes\u201d are used. It would therefore appear that in chapter 1,. \u201cmeans\u201d is used when the term and its-definition are to be interchangeable-equivalents, and \u201cincludes\u201d is used when it is desired to eliminate any doubt as to the inclusion in a larger class of the particular class specifically mentioned.2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">It is reasonable to conclude from this that \u00a7 11 is not intended to limit the term \u201cforeign government\u201d to that of a country \u201cwith which the United States is at peace,\u201d but, as appellant argues, is broad enough to also embrace the government of a country with which the United States is at war.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But it is not readily apparent how this conclusion destroys the force of appellee\u2019s argument based on this definition. If \u201cforeign government\u201d includes not only that of a country \u201cwith which the United States is at peace,\u201d but also that of a country with which the United States is at war, the inference still remains that it is only presently-existing countries to which reference is being made. The United States could no more be at war than at peace with a nonexistent country.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-15\">Adoption of appellant\u2019s construction of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 489 as applying to countries and governments no longer in existence would present a grave constitutional question. In United States v. Arjona, 120 U.S. 479, 7 S.Ct. 628, 30 L.Ed. 728, the power of Congress to enact statutes making it unlawful to forge or counterfeit the securities \u201cof any foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number><em>government\u201d </em>was challenged. The Supreme Court held that Congress had such power under Art. I, \u00a7 8, clause 3, conferring power \u201cto regulate Commerce with foreign Nations * * and Art. I, \u00a7 8, clause 10, conferring power \u201cto define and punish * * * Offenses against the Law of Nations.\u201d The rationale of that decision is that, in thus protecting the securities of other nations with which the United States maintains intercourse, it is serving its own best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">No such rationale, of course, can be applied with regard to countries and governments no longer in existence. Making or possessing replicas of the hapa haneri of the former Kingdom of Hawaii does not pertain to commerce \u201cwith\u201d foreign nations, and violates no law of nations.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> It is a principle of constitutional adjudication that, where there is a choice of fair alternatives, that construction of a statute should be accepted which will avoid serious doubts as to its constitutionality. United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 45, 73 S.Ct. 543, 97 L.Ed. 770.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The construction of \u00a7 489 contended for by appellant is not required by the express language used. The canon of statutory interpretation to which reference has just been made thus argues strongly for acceptance of that construction which will avoid the constitutional problem which has been suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">Appellant argues that, if Congress had intended to limit the application of \u00a7 489 to governments and countries currently in existence, it could have used express language to that effect. In support of this view, our attention is called to certain other statutes dealing with likenesses of foreign coins, in which, it is said, such a limitation of this kind is set out in express language.6 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">These other statutes, are, in so far as they relate to foreign coins, expressly limited to coins in current use as money. In comparison, \u00a7 489 relates to likenesses of the coins of any foreign country \u201cissued as money.\u201d It may be persuasively argued from this that it was not the intention to limit \u00a7 489 to coins in current use as money, but that it applies to coins of a foreign country which were issued as money, whether or not they are now in current use as money.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">We see no reason, however, for drawing from these differences in statutory language the further inference that \u00a7 489 was intended to apply to coins issued as money by a foreign country or government, whether or not such country or government is now in existence. On the other hand, if the comparison between these sections is thought to have a tendency in the direction of such an inference, it is our opinion that it is more than offset by the other considerations, noted above, which point to an opposite conclusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>In its reply brief, the government, citing 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 513, 514, advances the argument that the coins of the former Kingdom of Hawaii are still legal tender and redeemable in American currency. It is argued from this that Congress must have intended that these coins should be protected from counterfeiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">In 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 513, it is provided that \u201csilver coins that were coined under the laws of Hawaii,\u201d when the same are not mutilated or abraded, shall be received at the par of their face value in payment of all dues to the government of the Territory of Hawaii and of the United States. This statute further provides that coins so received shall not again be put into circulation, but they shall be recoined in the mints as United States coins. In 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 514, it is provided that any collector of customs or of internal revenue of the United States in the Hawaiian Islands shall, \u201cif he is so directed by the Secretary of the Treasury,\u201d exchange standard silver coins of the United States that are in his custody with the government of Hawaii, or with any person desiring to make such exchange, for coins of the government of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Any person who would make a coin in the likeness or similitude of a coin of the former Kingdom of Hawaii, for the purpose of paying government dues or obtaining, in exchange, coins of the United States, would intend such coins \u201cfor use as current money,\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 486. The making of replicas of such coins with this fraudulent intent is therefore forbidden under the latter statute, and needs no protection from 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The innocent use of such replicas to pay government dues, or in exchange for coins of the United States, is not forbidden by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 486, or any other statute (unless it is 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 489). However, the likelihood of such an imposition seems quite remote, in view of the fact that the payments and exchanges-must be made through government officials. In any event, if there is an unguarded danger in this situation, a legislative and not a judicial problem is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">In our opinion, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 489 applies only to likenesses of the coins-of currently-existing countries and governments. It follows that Gertz did not. violate that statute in possessing likenesses of the hapa haneri ,of the former Kingdom of Hawaii, and that the coins in question are not subject to forfeiture under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. If the immediately preceding analysis is correct, it is immaterial whether or not the term \u201cforeign government\u201d includes governments no longer in existence, for it is still necessary for coins to he those of a currently-existing \u201cforeign country.\u201d This is especially true if \u201cforcign government\u201d and \u201cforeign country\u201d are not synonymous, as appellant contends. While appellee contends that the terms are synonymous, the use of the two terms in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11, next quoted in this opinion, tends to support the view that they are not synonymous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\">. See, also, Gray v. Powell, 314 U.S. 402, 416, 62 S.Ct. 326, 86 L.Ed. 301; Phelps Dodge Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 313 U.S. 177, 188-189, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271; American Surety Co. of New York v.

That this is not necessarily true in every statute where the two words are used, see Blankenship v. Western Union Tel. Co., 4 Cir., 161 F.2d 168. See, also, Helvering v. Morgan\u2019s, Inc., 293 U.S. 121, 125, 55 S.Ct. 60, 79 L.Ed. 232.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b718-11\">. An additional reason for reaching this conclusion is that the definition contained in \u00a7 11 is, with minor changes in phaseology, derived from \u00a7 4 of Title VIII of the act of June 15, 1917 (chapter 30, 40 Stat. 217, 226), known as the Espionage Act of 1917. (See historical note after 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11.) The Espionage Act of 1917 (see \u00a7 2(a) of 40 Stat. 217, 218), as well as its present-day counterpart (see 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794), expressly applies in time of war as well as in time of peace.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b718-17\">. It may be added that, if the term \u201cforeign government\u201d had been intended to-include not only that of a country with which the United States is at peace or war, but also a nonexistent government of a nonexistent country, it is probable that Congress would have taken as much pains to say so as it did to say, in \u00a7 11, that the term includes the government of a country with which the United States is at peace, \u201cirrespective of recognition by the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\">. Conversely, a restrictive interpretation should not be given a statute merely because giving effect to the express language employed by <em>Congress </em>might require a court to face a constitutional question. United States v. Sullivan, 332 U.S. 689, 693, 68 S.Ct. 331, 92 L.lEd. 297.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b719-9\">. The application of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 331, relating to the mutilation, diminution, and falsification of coins, is limited, in so far as foreign coins are concerned, to \u201cany foreign coins which are <em>by </em>law made current or are in actual use or circulation as money within the United States.\u201d Substantially the same language is used with regard to foreign coins affected by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 485, relating to falsely made, forged, or counterfeited coins. A section (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 486) dealing with the unauthorized uttering or passing of coins, is expressly limited to coins \u201cintended for use as current money, whether in the resemblance of coins of the United States or of foreign countries * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b719-15\">. We also find unconvincing appellant\u2019s further argument based upon the relatively greater severity of penalties imposed with respect to violations of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 331, 485, and 486, as compared to \u00a7 489. The difference in severity of penalties, which is very marked, is due, in our opinion, to the fact that offenses under \u00a7\u00a7 331, 485, and 486, unlike \u00a7 489, concern fraudulent use of replicas of coins in current use as <em>money. </em>This was regarded as a direct menace to the integrity of the monetary system. Section 489, on the other hand, was patently do-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>signed to cover unauthorized use of likenesses of coins (whether in current use or not) without fraudulent intent but under circumstances which might unintentionally deceive. The difference in penalty is not reasonably explainable, in our opinion, on the theory that \u00a7 489 was intended to cover unauthorized use of likenesses of coins of nonexistent countries and governments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
