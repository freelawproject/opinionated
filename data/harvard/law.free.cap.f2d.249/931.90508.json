Appellant was tried by a jury, convicted, and sentenced. On his appeal he urges numerous points. Principally he urges error in respect to instructions to the jury concerning testimony alleged by him to have been that of an accomplice, submission of the case to the jury, his return to Washington under a writ of <em>habeas corpus ad prosequendum, </em>and the denial of a speedy trial. Counsel appointed by this court has vigorously pressed upon us all of these points, but we find no error affecting substantial rights of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
