He admitted that he had formerly operated the place in which the lottery was conducted, but claimed that it had been five or six years since he had done so. His daughter undertook to assume responsibility for the operation. Under date of \u201c9-2, 1952,\u201d he had signed U.S. Treasury Department Form 11-C, an application to accept wagers covering a wagering business, giving his address as- Box 622, Lake City, Florida. For 1953 he had filed an income tax return listing the same address, showing his principal business activity as \u201cRetail-Cafe-Pool Room\u201d operated under the name of \u201cGurley\u2019s Place,\u201d 311 East Railroad Street, Lake City, Columbia, Flor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ida. He had made similar income tax returns for 1954 and 1955. There is no dispute that the place in which the officers found a lottery operating was known as \u201cGurley\u2019s Place\u201d and was in the 300 block of Railroad Street in Lake City, Florida. The appellant was not in the place when the officers witnessed the wagering. However, when they returned with a search warrant, he was outside near the front of the place; the search warrant was read to and served on him, and he told the officers, \u201cGo ahead, as far as I am concerned\u201d and \u201csearch around.\u201d Taking the view most favorable to the Government, the verdict of the jury was supported by substantial evidence and must therefore be sustained.
