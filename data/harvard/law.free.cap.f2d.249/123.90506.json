We adhere to those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">Appellants also ask us to determine whether the invasion of the bequest is contingent upon a showing that the beneficiary has refused to support his children and a showing that the funds so sought would be for the support of the children. We think these facts sufficiently appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">Appellants question whether the District Court could enter a judgment on an <em>in personam </em>claim in a support decree under the circumstances disclosed by the record in this case. Appellants\u2019 question is answered by the eases of Kephart v. Kephart, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 373, 193 F.2d 677, and Brown v. Brown, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 319, 205 F.2d 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">Finally, appellants object to that part of the decree subjecting to execution under garnishment proceedings the portion of the trust fund not immediately due. This is answered by \u00a7 15-312, D.C. Code 1951, providing that if credits attached shall not be immediately due and payable, execution shall be stayed until the same become due. This is what the District Court ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-18\">As we find no error, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b176-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-14\">. Seidenberg v. Seidenberg, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 87, 219 F.2d 769; Seidenberg v. Seidenberg, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 245, 225 F.2d 545. The facts regarding this unfortunate litigation sufficiently appear in the decisions of these two cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
