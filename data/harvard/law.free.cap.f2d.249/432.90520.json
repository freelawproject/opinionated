Commissioner (Ross v. Commissioner), 7 Cir., 241 F.2d 46, and Mesi v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 242 F.2d 558.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Respondent admits that, if this court follows its decisions in the above-mentioned cases, the decision of the Tax Court is reversible. Unless and until our decisions in the Sullivan, Ross and Mesi cases are reversed by the Supreme Court, we adhere to them. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Tax Court insofar as it failed to allow as deductions wages and rents paid by petitioners, as aforesaid. They are ordinary and necessary expenses of doing business, within the meaning of section 23(a) (1) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b485-28\">.
