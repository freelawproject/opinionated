The complaint charged negligence in failing to provide a safe place for the husband to work, and in failing to treat the husband\u2019s injuries with reasonable care after the accident. The District Court directed verdicts in favor of appellees at the conclusion of appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The record conclusively establishes that appellant\u2019s husband received and accepted the statutory compensation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the injuries sustained and appellant is therefore barred from a recovery for loss of consortium.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have examined the other contentions urged by appellant and find no error which would warrant disturbing the action of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A21\">.
