A subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to appear before a grand jury was served upon it by delivering a copy <em>to </em>a subsidiary corporation doing business in New York. EMI moved to quash the subpoena. This motion was denied by Judge Walsh by order dated June 27, 1957. The present petition seeks a writ commanding Judge Walsh to vacate his order and to refrain from asserting jurisdiction <em>in personam </em>over petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">The order attacked by the petitioner is interlocutory and non-appeal-able. Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 60 S.Ct. 540, 84 L.Ed. 783. As stated in 309 U.S. at page 328, 60 S.Ct. at page 542, whatever right the witness may have requires no further protection than that afforded by the district court \u201cuntil the witness chooses to disobey and is committed for contempt.\u201d The All Writs Statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1651, is to be used only in exceptional cases where abuse of discretion or usurpation of judicial power is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, 346 U.S. 379, 383-384, 74 S.Ct. 145, 148, 98 L.Ed. 106. See also Ex parte Fahey, 332 U.S. 258, 260, 67 S.Ct. 1558, 91 L.Ed. 2041; Ward Baking Co. v. Holtzoff, 2 Cir., 164 F.2d 34; Massey-Harris-Ferguson, Ltd. v. Boyd, 6 Cir., 242 F.2d 800, 803; Comfort Equipment Co. v. Stockier, 7 Cir., 212 F.2d 371. The issue is whether the court has usurped and is enforcing a nonexistent jurisdiction over the petitioner. This is not so \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d as to require issuance of <em>the writ.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
