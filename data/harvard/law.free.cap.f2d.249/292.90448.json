The respondent opposes enforcement upon the ground that the Union garage steward who was found by the Board to have caused the company\u2019s action was not such an agent of the Union as to bind it by his acts and that the evidence does not support the Board\u2019s findings. We have carefully considered these contentions but find them to be without merit. Respondent\u2019s by-laws make it clear that the steward was acting within the general scope of his authority. The respondent was, therefore, answerable for his conduct. While the evidence was conflicting there is ample support in the record for the Board\u2019s finding that the actions of the steward constituted a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
