It has not been licensed to conduct its corporate activities in Ohio. Its entire revenue is derived from dues paid by its more than four hundred and fifty members, who operate motels in states east of the Mississippi River. Operating no independent business of its own, the plaintiff corporation confines its activities to furthering the co-operative interests of its members, by national advertising, the distribution of guide books listing the names of members\u2019 motels, the operation of a clearing house in connection with payments to members for advance reservations, and by a variety of similar functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-19\">Membership in the plaintiff corporation is obtained only through election by its board of directors. Membership is restricted to individual persons and is not assignable. To acquire and maintain membership in the corporation, owners or operators must maintain motels of high qualitative standards. To this end a careful inspection is made of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>motel operated by each applicant for membership, and subsequent periodic inspections are made of members\u2019 motels. Approximately ten per cent of the members are expelled annually for failure to maintain the required standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The plaintiff is the owner of two registered trade marks for \u201ctravel guides issued periodically.\u201d These marks are affixed to the lists of motels distributed by the plaintiff. It also is the owner of two registered collective service marks for \u201cproviding lodging in tourist courts.\u201d Emblems displaying these latter marks are distributed without charge to each member for exhibition in connection with the advertising of his motel. One of the trade marks and one of the collective marks consists of the name of the plaintiff, \u201cQuality Courts United Inc.,\u201d upon a circular background of distinctive design. These marks have been continuously used by the plaintiff in commerce since 1939 and were registered in the United States Patent Office in 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">One of the plaintiff\u2019s members prior to March, 1955, was Raymond White, who operated the Motel Dorma Dell at Norwalk, Ohio. At that time Mr. White sold his motel to one of the defendants, an Ohio corporation, then named \u201cMotel Dorma Dell, Inc.,\u201d of which the other defendant, Lloyd B. Lyon, was an incorporator, director, and officer. At the time of the sale Mr. White advised the purchasers that under the by-laws of the plaintiff corporation membership automatically terminated upon the sale of the motel, and that the purchasers could not continue to use the plaintiff\u2019s name, unless a representative of the new management should be accepted as a member of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Shortly after the purchase of the motel the individual defendant\u2019s father, Lloyd Lyon, applied for membership in the plaintiff corporation on an application form supplied by it at his request. The application, signed by Lyon, acknowledged that membership in the plaintiff corporation had not been automatically acquired by purchase of the Motel Dorma Dell, and recited his agreement to remove the name and emblem of Quality Courts United Inc. from all advertising matter used by the motel in the event his application for membership should not be accepted by the plaintiff\u2019s board of directors at its next meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Mr. Lyon\u2019s application for membership was not acted upon at the next meeting of the plaintiff\u2019s board of directors, and was rejected at the following meeting in August, 1955. Mr. Lyon was promptly advised of this action in a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s secretary, which further requested him to eliminate from all Motel Dorma Dell advertising any material which might imply membership in the plaintiff corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Instead of complying with this request, Lyon and the other directors of the corporate defendant proceeded under the law of Ohio to change its name from Motel Dorma Dell, Inc. to Quality Courts United, Inc., the exact corporate name of the plaintiff. They further proceeded to qualify the corporation as thus renamed to do business in the neighboring states of Indiana, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and wrote letters to the plaintiff\u2019s members in those states, advising them to discontinue any use of the name Quality Courts United, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">The defendant corporation continued for a short time to use the plaintiff\u2019s collective service mark at the Motel Dorma Dell. Thereafter it substituted a sign which, like the service mark, displayed the name \u201cQuality Courts United, Inc.\u201d against a circular background, but which lacked the distinctive border of the plaintiff\u2019s registered mark. It also continued to use the name \u201cQuality Court\u201d on its stationery, business cards, match covers, and other advertising material.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">To enjoin this conduct the plaintiff brought the present action in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The complaint also prayed for an accounting and monetary damages. The defendants filed an answer and counterclaim. Upon these pleadings, together with depositions and exhibits subsequently filed, the court entered a sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>mary judgment granting the plaintiff injunctive relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The defendants\u2019 primary contention here is that the district court was in error in entertaining this action. Their argument runs as follows: this case was essentially an action <em>ex contractu; </em>federal jurisdiction could therefore rest only upon diversity of citizenship of the parties; since the plaintiff had carried on corporate activities in Ohio without having been licensed by Ohio to do so, it was barred from maintaining this action in the courts of Ohio, and therefore also barred from suing in the federal court there.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">If the defendants are correct in their position that the only valid basis for federal jurisdiction in this case is the diverse citizenship of the parties and the requisite jurisdictional amount, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332, there is substantial merit in their contention that the district court should have dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Ohio clearly requires a foreign nonprofit corporation to secure a license before exercising its corporate privileges in a continual course of transactions in Ohio.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Just as clearly Ohio has closed its courts to foreign nonprofit corporations which should have obtained such a license and have failed to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, if the courts of Ohio were closed to this plaintiff, so also was the federal court in that state in a diversity of citizenship ease. Woods v. Interstate Realty Company, 1949, 337 U.S. 535, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524. Thus, if the defendants\u2019 major premise is sound, the only doubtful issue would be the factual one of whether the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>tiff\u2019s activities in Ohio, including advertising and periodic inspections of the members\u2019 courts, constituted \u201ca continual course of transactions\u201d within the state. Cf. National Sign Co. v. Maccar Sales Co., Cuyahoga Cty. 1929, 33 Ohio App. 89, 168 N.E. 758; Clare &amp; Foster, Inc., v. Diamond S. Electric Co., Erie Cty. 1940, 66 Ohio App. 376, 34 N.E.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">If the defendants\u2019 major premise is invalid, however, their entire argument collapses. If the court\u2019s jurisdiction in this case rested not on diversity of citizenship, but rather on its function as a national court to enforce a substantive right created by Congress, then any limitations which Ohio imposes on its courts would be irrelevant. Lisle Mills v. Arkay Infants Wear, D.C.E.D.N.Y. 1950, 90 F.Supp. 676; see Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 1946, 327 U.S. 392, 66 S.Ct. 582, 90 L.Ed. 743. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint, although alleging diversity of citizenship and that the amount in controversy exceeded $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, explicitly stated that \u201cThis action is brought under the trade-name and trade-mark laws of the United States, U.S.C., Title 15. * * * \u201d It is of no moment that the complaint may also have stated a common law action for breach of contract, or that the plaintiff might have confined his- invocation of' federal jurisdiction to diversity of citizenship. \u201c * * * [T]he party who brings a suit is master to decide what law he will rely upon, and therefore does determine whether he will bring a \u2018suit arising under\u2019 the patent or other law of the United States by his declaration or bill.\u201d The Fair v. Kohler Die &amp; Specialty Co., 1913, 228 U.S. 22, 25, 33 S.Ct. 410, 411, 57 L.Ed. 716; see Bell v. Hood, 1946, 327 U.S. 678, 681, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">It thus becomes necessary only to determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint actually constituted a claim within the jurisdiction of the federal court, independent of its diversity jurisdiction. We turn to consideration of' that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s service marks for \u201cproviding lodging in tourist courts\u201d were registered as collective marks in 1955 under the provisions of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1053, 1054.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The marks were almost textbook. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>examples of collective marks within the meaning of the statute, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1127.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In order to state a claim for infringement, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to allege facts showing that the defendants had used the mark or a reproduction or imitation (1) in commerce; (2) without consent; (3) in connection with the sale, offering for sale or advertising of services; (4) in a manner likely to cause confusion or mistake or <em>to </em>deceive purchasers as to the source or origin of such services, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114(1). The allegations of the complaint were clearly sufficient to show that the defendants had used the plaintiff\u2019s marks, without consent, in connection with the advertising and sale of services, and in a manner likely to deceive purchasers as to the source or origin of the services.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The defendants insist, however, that the complaint showed that their alleged infringement was solely in connection with an intrastate activity, the operation of the Hotel Dorma Dell, in Norwalk, Ohio, and that such use was not \u201cin commerce,\u201d and therefore not within the reach of the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Under the provisions of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, however, it is not necessary that the infringing use itself be in interstate commerce. It is enough if the use has a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce. The Act provides that a mark shall be deemed to be used in commerce \u201cwhen it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1127. And, \u201cthe word \u2018commerce\u2019 means all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1127. Since as a matter of Constitutional law it is now beyond question that Congress may regulate intrastate activities which substantially affect interstate commerce, Mandeville Island Farms v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 1948, 334 U.S. 219, 232-237, 68 S.Ct. 996, 92 L.Ed. 1328, it is clear that intrastate infringing use is within the provisions of the Act if it has a substantial economic effect upon interstate use by the mark\u2019s owner. Iowa Farmers Union v. Farmers\u2019 Educational <em>&amp; </em>Coop. Union, 8 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 809, 815-816; Pure Foods v. Minute Maid Corp., 5 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 792, 795-796, certiorari denied 348 U.S. 888, 75 S.Ct. 208, 99 L.Ed, 697; Stauffer v. Exley, 9 Cir., 1950, 184 F.2d 962, 966-967; National Tuberculosis Ass\u2019n v. Summit County Tuberculosis <em>&amp; </em>Health Ass\u2019n, D.C.N.D.O.1954, 122 F.Supp. 654, 656-657; see also Commentary on the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C.A. pp. 268-269. Without question the plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged an infringing use \u201cin commerce\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Facts showing the plaintiff\u2019s own use of its mark in interstate commerce were clearly set out, as were facts alleging a substantial economic effect upon that use resulting from the defendants\u2019 intrastate infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">It is apparent therefore that the complaint stated a substantial claim under the federal trade-mark laws, conferring jurisdiction upon the federal court independent of diversity of citizenship. The complaint also stated a claim of unfair competition which was closely related to the trade-mark claim, and of which the federal court therefore also had jurisdiction, irrespective of the diverse citizenship of the parties, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1338(b) ; <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Iowa Farmers Union v. Farmers\u2019 Educational &amp; Coop. Union, 8 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 809, 819; Tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>chron, Inc., v. Parissi, 2 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 757, 759-761; Schreyer v. Casco Products Corp., 2 Cir., 1951, 190 F.2d 921, 923-924, certiorari denied, 1952, 342 U.S. 913, 72 S.Ct. 360, 96 L.Ed. 683. It follows that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to secure a license from the State of Ohio was not an impediment to the maintenance of this action in the federal court there.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">That being so, we do not reach the question whether the Lanham Act itself confers independent federal jurisdiction of a claim for unfair competition affecting interstate commerce \u2014 a question not argued in this case, and one about which there is disagreement. Compare Pagliero v. Wallace China Co., 9 Cir., 1952, 198 F.2d 339, 341 and Stauffer v. Exley, 9 Cir., 1950, 184 F.2d 962, with Royal Lace Paper Works, Inc., v. Pest-Guard Products, Inc., 5 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 814; L\u2019Aiglon Apparel, Inc., v. Lana Lobell, Inc., 3 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 649, 652, 654; and American Auto Ass\u2019n v. Spiegel, 2 Cir., 205 F.2d 771, 774, certiorari denied 1953, 346 U.S. 887, 74 S.Ct. 138, 98 L.Ed. 391. See Maternally Yours, Inc., v. Your Maternity Shop, Inc., 2 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 538, 540 footnote 1, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Finally, there is no merit in the defendants\u2019 contention that the district court was in error in entering a summary judgment. The depositions and exhibits filed in the district court left no genuine issues of material fact remaining as to the merits of this controversy. The defendants used a colorable imitation of the plaintiff\u2019s collective service mark, resulting in confusion as to the source of origin of the services offered by them. They were also guilty of unfair competition in holding out the Motel Dorma Dell as a member of the plaintiff corporation, by appropriating the name Quality Courts United, Inc. Both secondary meaning and actual deception were shown.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See Iowa Farmers Union v. Farmers\u2019 Educational &amp; Coop. Union, 8 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 809; Quality Courts v. Quality Courts, D.C.M.D.Pa.1956, 140 F.Supp. 341; National Tuberculosis Ass\u2019n v. Summit County Tuberculosis &amp; Health Ass\u2019n, D.C.N.D.O.1954, 122 F.Supp. 654, 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">In oral argument the defendants relied heavily upon American Auto Ass\u2019n v. Spiegel, 2 Cir., 205 F.2d 771, certiorari denied 1953, 346 U.S. 887, 74 S.Ct. 138, 98 L.Ed. 391. That decision is clearly differentiable. The court\u2019s opinion in that case does not indicate that collective marks or service marks were involved. Moreover, there was no showing there that the defendant used the plaintiffs\u2019 trade-marks on or in connection with goods sold, and no showing of a likelihood of confusion. See \u201cTrade-Marks and Unfair Competition,\u201d 68 Harv.L.Rev. 814, 850 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-20\">.
