D. Dean. It was alleged that Mrs. Dean tripped on a rubber mat placed on the public sidewalk by defendant in front of its premises and left there for seven years. It is conceded that plaintiff Sylvia Dean sustained serious injuries and the amount of the judgments is not questioned here.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">Defendant contends that the mat did not constitute an obstruction on the sidewalk nor a nuisance under Tennessee law and that negligence was not established on the part of defendant. All of these contentions, set forth at length in defendant\u2019s motion for new trial and motion for judgment notwithstanding verdict, relate to and depend upon the claimed insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">Defendant moved for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, but did not renew its motion at the close of the entire testimony. Defendant submitted the case to the jury without motion for directed verdict at the close of the evidence and thus waived its original motion made at the close of plaintiff\u2019s testimony. No exception was taken to the charge. Under these circumstances the question of the claimed insufficiency of the evidence is not before us and we must assume that the evidence supports the verdict.
