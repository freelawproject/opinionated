Appellee has no other funds of the patient. With irrelevant exceptions, the Veterans Act provides that payments of benefits \u201cto, or on account of, a beneficiary under any of the laws relating to veterans shall be exempt from taxation, shall be exempt from the claims of creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.\u201d 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 454a; 49 Stat. 609, as amended, 54 Stat. 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-23\">The District of Columbia brought this suit to require appellee to reimburse it for payments it formerly made to the Hospital for the patient\u2019s maintenance and treatment. With respect to payments made before the committee was appointed, the court denied the claim and the District appeals. The court was clearly right, despite the statutes, D.C.Code (1951) \u00a7 21-307, 33 Stat. 740 ;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>D.C.Code (1951) \u00a7 21-318, 53 Stat. 1298, that require a committee to pay the District for an incompetent\u2019s care. In the circumstances of this case the Veterans Act, which we have quoted, forbids recovery on the appealed claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">With respect to payments made by the District after the committee was appointed, the trial court granted the District\u2019s claim. The District\u2019s brief concedes that \u201cManifestly if, under the section quoted above, the funds in the patient\u2019s estate are exempt from the claim of the District of Columbia for reimbursement for money expended pri- or to the appointment of a committee, such funds are exempt from any such claim of the District of Columbia for moneys expended subsequent to the appointment of a committee.\u201d This concession is probably correct. However, the question is not before us for decision, because the committee failed to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-24\">. We doubt the correctness of an annotation in D.C.Code (1951) Supp. V to the effect that this section is repealed by 52 Stat. 631, \u00a7 16. We need not decide this question,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
