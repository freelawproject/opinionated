R. 8493, 84th Cong., was passed by the House of Representatives on March 26, 1956, and by the Senate on June 20, 1956. When approved by the President on July 2, 1956, as Private Law 737, 70 Stat. A108, the legislation declared that certain defined property of the respondent \u201cis hereby exempt from all taxation.\u201d While the intent of Congress is clear, the Act is silent as to liability for taxes which might have accrued prior to its approval by the President. On that account, the District of Columbia asserted tax liability in respect of respondent\u2019s real estate for the fiscal year 1957, which commenced on Sunday, July 1, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-25\">It is true that the fiscal year of the District of Columbia commences, annually, on the first day of July, D.C.Code, \u00a7 47-101 (1951), and that Congress has \u201clevied for each and every fiscal year, a tax * * D.C.Code, \u00a7 47-501 (1951). However the latter section expressly provides that the tax is levied only on such real and personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>as is \u201csubject to taxation,\u201d so that no tax is levied on exempt property. The statutory scheme clearly treats of real property \u201csubject to be listed for taxation in the District of Columbia,\u201d D.C.Code, \u00a7 47-706 (1951), subject to review, D.C.Code, \u00a7 47-708, and \u201cThe valuation of said real property made and equalized as aforesaid shall be approved by the Commissioners not later than July 1, annually, and when approved by the Commissioners shall constitute the basis of taxation for the next succeeding year * * D.C.Code, \u00a7 47-709 (1951). In like manner \u201cAnnually, on or prior to July 1 of each year, the board of assistant assessors shall make a list of all real estate which shall have become subject to taxation and which is not then on the tax list * * * \u201d D.C.Code, \u00a7 47-710 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Had the President signed the Act on June 30, 1956, there would have been no question here. Since the Commissioners were empowered to approve the list \u201con or before July 1st,\u201d it is clear that they might have done so on July 1st. Since July 1st was a Sunday they might have exercised their function on July 2. Sunday was a <em>dies non </em>\u201cand a power that may be exercised up to and including a given day of the month may generally, when that day happens to be Sunday, be exercised on the succeeding day.\u201d Street v. United States, 1890, 133 U.S. 299, 306, 10 S.Ct. 309, 33 L.Ed. 631; cf. Sherwood Bros. v. District of Columbia, 72 App.D.C. 155, 113 F.2d 162 (D.C.Cir.1940). Thus, throughout the entire day of July 2, 1956, the very day the President approved the legislation, the Commissioners could have acted to recognize the exemption from taxation which had been so accorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">It follows that the property of the respondent was not \u201csubject to taxation\u201d and the decision of the District of Columbia Tax Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">EDGERTON, Chief Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
