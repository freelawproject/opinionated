The appeal has nevertheless been docketed, counsel have been heard and the record has been examined by the Court. We find the appeal to be altogether lacking in merit, as defendants were given a fair trial and counsel have been unable to point to any error which could possibly warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"A6_\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
