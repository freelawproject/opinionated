The unit certified consisted of 233 admittedly professional employees, within the meaning of \u00a7 2(12) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(12), whom the Engineers Association had sought to represent; and 9 others, admittedly nonprofessional, whom the Board included, over objection of the Engineers Association, because they share a \u201cclose community of employment interest\u201d with the professionals and their inclusion would not \u201cdestroy the predominantly professional character\u201d of the unit. The District Court, however, agreed with the Engineers Association that inclusion of these non-professionals violated \u00a7 9(b) which provides, in pertinent part, \u201cthat the Board shall not (1) decide that any unit is appropriate for [purposes of collective bargaining] if such unit includes both professional employees and employees who are not professional employees unless a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit.\u201d Accordingly, on cross motions, the court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">On this appeal, as in the court below, the Board takes the familiar position that, under \u00a7 9(d), its determinations in representation proceedings are reviewable only in the courts of appeals and only when they have become the basis for a \u201cfinal order\u201d in an unfair labor practice proceeding under \u00a7 10, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160. It relies heavily on Switchmen\u2019s. Union v. National Mediation Board,, 1943, 320 U.S. 297, 64 S.Ct. 95, 88 L.Ed. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">\u201cBefore we can decide whether these proceedings are reviewable in an original equity suit in the District Court, there must be a showing \u2018of unlawful action by the Board and resulting injury * * * by way of departure from statutory requirements or from those of due process.\u2019 Inland Empire District, Council, etc. v. Millis, 1945, 325 U.S. 697, 700, 65 S.Ct. 1316, 1318, 89 L.Ed. 1877.\u201d DePratter v. Farmer, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 74, 76, 232 F.2d 74, 76. Equitable relief is clearly barred in the wide area of determinations which depend on the Board\u2019s expertise and discretion; as for example, in Switchmen\u2019s Union, that railroad yardmen should be included in a unit with certain other smaller groups of railroad employees, or, in DePratter, that full time production employees should be included in a unit with employees who devote only part time to production and the rest to other tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-16\">This case, however, presents \u201ca different \u2018type of problem.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 9(b) (1) expressly forbids inclusion of professionals and non-professionals in the same bargaining unit <em>\u201cunless </em>a majority of [the] professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit.\u201d It is. clear that this provision was intended to-protect the professionals; that the professionals\u2019 right to this benefit does not depend on Board discretion or expertise; and that denial of this right must be deemed to result in injury. Thus this case presents Board violation of a statutory requirement and resulting injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Whether, granting the availability of a \u00a7 10 remedy, the injury flowing from the violation of \u00a7 9(b) (1) would support equitable relief need not be decided. Here review by way of \u00a7 10 is too remote and conjectural to be viewed as providing an adequate remedy. Farmers v. United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers, 1953, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 178, 211 F.2d 36. Since the employer is not aggrieved by the Board\u2019s inclusion of the nine non-professionals, he cannot be relied upon to refuse to bargain and thus make it possible for the Association to bring a reviewable \u00a7 10 proceeding. Nor is it likely that an Engineers Association refusal to bargain for the nine non-professionals would induce the employer to seek review since he would then be free to deal with all employees individually. Nor could we expect such refusal to induce any of the nine nonprofessionals to seek review. They are hardly likely to insist upon placing their fate in the hands of a reluctant bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\">.
