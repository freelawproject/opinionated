On May 25, 1954, petitioner pleaded guilty to a count of housebreaking in each of three cases, Nos. 438-54, 439-54, and 440-54, a count of larceny in each indictment being thereafter dismissed. On June 18, 1954, Judge Curran imposed a sentence of imprisonment of from one to three years in No. 438-54. He imposed a sentence of imprisonment of one to three years in No. 439-54, the term of which was to run consecutively to the sentence in No. 438-54. Likewise, he imposed a sentence of one to three years in No. 440-54 to run consecutively to the sentence imposed in 439-54. The official transcript of the proceedings at the time of sentence discloses that the sentences were pronounced to run consecutively. The judge\u2019s notes on the probation report reflect one to three years in each case, sentences to run consecutively. The clerk\u2019s original notes on the face of the Criminal Court jacket read one to three years consecutively. The docket entries of the Court stated that on June 18, 1954, the petitioner was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of from one to three years in each case, sentences to run consecutively in Criminal Cases Nos. 489-54 and 440-54. The commitment papers, however, erroneously used the word \u201cconcurrently,\u201d in the last mentioned cases. Petitioner was released after completion of the sentence imposed on the first indictment, but because of the clerk\u2019s error in the preparation of the commitment, failed to serve the sentence pronounced upon each of the other indictments. When the mistake was discovered, the District Court, apparently in the absence of the petitioner, entered orders for correction of the judgment and commitment and issued a bench warrant leading to the arrest of the petitioner. Assigned counsel challenged the court\u2019s action, asserting the court lacked jurisdiction to correct the error. Relief having been denied, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">Had nothing else occurred we would have a different problem, but at the habeas corpus hearing the facts were fully developed. The petitioner offered as exhibits his \u201ccommitment papers\u201d showing, as the judge observed, \u201cThe original says \u2018concurrent.\u2019 There is no question about that.\u201d On cross exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ination the Government caused petitioner to read into the record a portion of the official reporter\u2019s transcript of the proceedings at the time of the original sentence, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">\u201cThe Deputy Clerk: Case of Lonnie Cameron and Frank Kennedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cThe Court: Kennedy, do you want to say anything before the Court imposes sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201cMr. McGean: Your Honor, may I say something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">\u201cThe Court: Do you like the pen ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">\u201cThe Defendant Kennedy: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-12\">\u201cThe Court: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-13\">\u201cThe Defendant Kennedy: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-14\">\u201cThe Court: Well, you have been down there on what? Three different occasions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-15\">\u201cThe Defendant Kennedy: Two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-16\">\u201cThe Court: Two? You may serve one to three years on each case, the sentence to run consecutively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-18\">\u201cMr. Caputy: We move to dismiss the remaining counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-19\">\u201cThe Court: Very well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-20\">The judge was asked to take judicial notice of docket entries and other material appearing in the court\u2019s records.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-21\">\u201cThe Court: I will also take judicial notice of my own notes that were made on the probation report which said one to three years in each case, consecutively; the clerk\u2019s original notes on the back of the jacket said one to three years consecutively; and the docket entry on the front of the jacket said one to three years, consecutively; and the commitment was written by a typographical error which said concurrently.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-22\">Petitioner\u2019s former counsel at the time of sentence also testified that petitioner \u201cgot the stiffer\u201d of the sentences imposed upon the two defendants, apparently because of petitioner\u2019s prior record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-24\">\u201cThe Court: You heard the sentence imposed by court, did you not ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-25\">\u201cThe Witness: I was in the court on the date the sentence was imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-26\">\u201cThe Court: What was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-27\">\u201cThe Witness: I am not exact as to the words used by Your Honor, but I do recall that Mr. Kennedy, my client, got the stiffer of two sentences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-28\">\u201cThe Court: So it would have to be consecutive to get the stiffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-29\">\u201cThe Witness: I know it was one to three.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-30\">\u201cThe Court: And the co-defendant got two to six. So if he got the stiffer sentence the one to three would have to run consecutively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-31\">\u201cThe Witness: That is my impression.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-32\">Following the habeas corpus hearing the District Judge made findings of fact as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-33\">\u201c5. That on June 18, 1954, petitioner appeared before this Court for sentencing. This Court in Criminal No. 438-54, sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of from one to three years. In Criminal Case No. 439-54, this Court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of from one to three years, said term to run consecutively to the sentence imposed in Criminal Case No. 438-54; and in Criminal Case No. 440-54, this Court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of from one to three years, to run consecutively to the sentence imposed in Criminal Case No. 439-54.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-34\">\u201c6. That the Court Reporter\u2019s official transcript of the proceedings disclose that the petitioner was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-35\">\u201c7. That the entries made on the face of the criminal court jacket, which reflect the notes taken by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>court clerk at the time the sentence was imposed, set forth that the petitioner was sentenced in each case as heretofore set forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201c8. That the docket entries of this court state that on June 18, 1954, the petitioner was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of from one to three years in each case, sentences to run consecutively in Criminal Case Nos. 439-54 and 440-54.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">* -* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201c10. That the petitioner\u2019s former counsel who had appeared on the day of sentence, testified that his recollection was that his client, the petitioner, received a sentence in excess of that of his co-defendant, who had received a sentence of two to six years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\u201c11. That a clerical error was made by a clerk in the office of the Clerk of the Court when transposing the Judge\u2019s sentence set forth in the transcript and the docket entries to the commitment papers, in that the aforesaid clerk inadvertently used the word \u2018concurrently\u2019 in criminal case Nos. 439 \u2014 54 and 440-54, instead of the word \u2018consecutively\u2019.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The pronouncement of sentence constitutes the judgment of the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2The authority for the execution of the court\u2019s sentence is that judgment. \u201cThe commitment is mere evidence of such authority and if the commitment is not in accord with the judgment, the latter may be resorted to on habeas corpus for the purpose of determining whether the detention of the petitioner is lawful.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the Supreme Court has held that \u201ca warrant of commitment departing in matter of substance from the judgment back of it is void.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Justice Cardozo has pointed out<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that a mittimus spends its force when the prisoner shall have been delivered; indeed even if it be lost or destroyed, detention may be justified by the underlying judgment. Thus, the courts in habeas corpus proceedings explore the foundations for the mittimus and \u201cpronounce them false or true.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-21\">Here, the District Court explicitly went back to its own judgment. Overwhelmingly established on the record were the sentences of one to three years on each indictment to run consecutively. There was no lack of \u201cmaterials\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to establish the exact fact. Surely the court is not required \u201cto blind its eyes to clear evidence of its own intention,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as we have recognized in applying the Daugherty case standard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We see here no room for doubt, either as to the intention of the sentencing judge, or as to the fact of his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-22\">Of course, the court at a succeeding term has power to sentence where a void sentence had been previously imposed. \u201cTo hold otherwise would allow the guilty to escape punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>through a legal accident.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are not dealing with an excessive sentence,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> nor an illegal sentence,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> nor a later increase in a lawful sentence, service of which had been commenced or completed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is no question of the time of sentence as distinguished from the actual entry of the written evidence of the judgment of sentence<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rather, the District Judge undertook in his December 20, 1956, orders merely to correct the court\u2019s record of what had been the validly and timely pronounced sentence. The prisoner, as the court\u2019s findings disclose, had been sentenced to serve three consecutive sentences of one to three years on each indictment, or in courtroom jargon three to nine, hence the \u201cstiffer\u201d of the two sentences pronounced. Petitioner\u2019s co-defendant received \u201ctwo to six,\u201d as the quoted colloquy, <em>supra, </em>disclosed. There was no \u201cincrease\u201d involved nor was the actual sentence changed. The plain fact is that, through error, the petitioner served only the sentence imposed on the first indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-16\">Rule 36<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-17\">\u201cClerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record * * * arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court <em>at any time </em>and after such notice, if any, as the court orders.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-18\">The power to correct the record is not to be doubted, quite apart from the Rule,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as this court has previously observed<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It follows that here the District Court clearly possessed the authority to cause appropriate correction to be made, for sentencing is not a game.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-19\"> While the Rule indicates that the court may act after such notice as it deems appropriate, we believe that except as to purely perfunctory aspects, the better practice should command the presence of the prisoner in circumstances such as are shown here. We have said as much before.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There may well be situations where factually there are lacking items of evidence essential to the ascertainment of the foundations for the imprisonment. Surely in so im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>portant a matter as restraint of a man\u2019s liberty, he should be permitted to attend, to be heard and to show cause, if proper cause there be, why further imprisonment is not to follow. Thus the correcting orders of December 20, 1956, should not have been entered in the absence of the petitioner.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">It does not follow that reversal is required in the light of the facts. \u201cThe District Court has power in a habeas corpus proceeding to \u2018dispose of the matter as law and justice require.\u2019 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2243.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Fed.R.Crim.P. 2 provides that \u201cThese rules are intended to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding. They shall be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We see no point in reversing only to require that the Government take fresh steps to correct the record<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> when that record has already been fully made in the presence of the petitioner and of his counsel although in the habeas corpus proceedings. Rather, in the circumstances here, it would seem that the irregularity is to be governed by Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) for no substantial rights of the prisoner have been affected.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Giving effect to Rule 2, we are satisfied that a just determination has been achieved, and we are bound to affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-13\">.

A judgment of conviction shall set forth the plea, the verdict or findings, and the adjudication and sentence. * * * The judgment shall be signed by the judge and entered by the clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-19\">Form 25 accompanying the Rules spells out a method of complying with Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>32(b) and reads as set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This form was used in these cases, so that the sentences appear in the Judgments and Commitments as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">In No. 438-54:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">\u201cIt Is Adjudged that the defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative for imprisonment for a period of <em>4</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201cOne (1) to Three (3) years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In No. 439-54:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">\u201cIt Is Adjudged that the defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative for imprisonment for a period of <em>4</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">\u201cOne (1) year to three (3) years said sentence to run <em>concurrently </em>with the sentence imposed in Criminal Case No. 438-54.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">In No. 440-54:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">\u201cIt Is Adjudged that the defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative for imprisonment for a period of <em>4</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">\u201cOne (1) year to Three (3) years said sentence to run <em>concurrently </em>with the sentence imposed in Criminal Case No. 439-54.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-24\">The opinion of the court refers to the Judgments and Commitments as the \u201ccommitment papers.\u201d I think they are not merely so. They are also judgments which under Rule 32(b) \u201cset forth the * * * sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-25\">After fully serving the period of concurrent terms Kennedy was at liberty on December 19, 1956. He could not be deprived of this liberty without due process of law. U.S.Const. Amend. V. He was arrested January 4,1957, on a bench warrant and reimprisoned after the Judgments and Commitments in Nos. 439-54 and 440-54 had been changed by the sentencing Judge on December 20, 1956, to describe the sentences as consecutive. These changes were made without notice to Kennedy or opportunity to <em>him to be </em>heard. <em>From </em>this it follows that he was deprived of his liberty without due process of law. Montgomery v. United States, 8 Cir., 134 F.2d 1. And see Pollard v. United States, 352 U.S. 354, 360, 77 S.Ct. 481, 1 L.Ed. 2d 393, and Downey v. United States, 67 App.D.C. 192, 196, 91 F.2d 223, 227, where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cProceedings in the absence of the appellant to correct the record would have been improper, since the ultimate question involved, the extent of valid imprisonment to which he might be subjected, was one of vital interest to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Accordingly, he should be released from detention unless and until he is validly deprived of his liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">To apply Rule 36, Fed.R.Crim.P.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> relied upon by the United States, so as to authorize these <em>ex parte </em>\u201ccorrection\u201d proceedings and consequent deprivation of liberty without notice and an opportunity to be heard would be plainly unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The court\u2019s opinion states that appellant was released after completion of the sentence imposed on the first indictment, but, because of the clerk\u2019s error in the preparation of the commitment, failed to serve the sentence pronounced upon each of the other indictments. I think this is an oversimplification and somewhat begs the question. In United States v. Patterson, C.C., 29 F. 775, Mr. Justice Bradley of the Supreme Court, sitting in Circuit, considered a case in some respects similar. The accused had pled guilty to three indictments for three separate offenses, as had the present appellant. He was sentenced \u201cfor the term of five (5) years upon each of the three indictments * * * said terms not to run concurrently * * <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He served one term of five years, was continued in detention, and sought release through habeas corpus proceedings. Describing the questioned language of the sentences as equivalent to \u201cthe said terms shall follow each other successively,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mr. Justice Bradley nevertheless held the sentences to be for a total of only five years because the language referred to was \u201cincapable of application to the respective terms, without specifying the order of their succession * * <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Justice explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">\u201c[I]f they are successive, which one? That which is first to be executed, or that which is secondly or thirdly to be executed? No intelligence is sufficient to answer the question. A prisoner is entitled to know under what sentence he is imprisoned. The vague words in question furnish no means of knowing. They must be regarded as without effect, and as insufficient to alter the legal rule that each sentence is to commence at once, unless otherwise specially ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">* \u00bb * * \u00edf *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\">\u201c* * * [A] s neither of them was made to take effect after the one or the others, they all took effect alike; that is, from the time of the rendering of judgment * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">Agreeing that a court has a right \u201cto extend its judgment and proceedings on the record in proper form, regardless of imperfections in the minutes of its clerk,\u201d the Justice went on to say that in the case before him,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-16\">\u201cthere are no materials in existence for altering the form of the judgment under consideration, \u2014 at least nothing but what may rest in the bosom of the judge; and for him to resort to his memory at this day to alter the judgment would be to render a new judgment.\u201d <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-17\">United States v. Daugherty, 269 U.S. 360, 46 S.Ct. 156, 70 L.Ed. 309, involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>sentences on three counts of the same indictment for five years on each count, to be consecutive and not concurrent. The Supreme Court implied the order of consecutiveness, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">\u201c[T]he judgment here questioned was sufficient to impose total imprisonment for 15 years, made up of three 5-year terms, one under the first count, one under the second and one under the third, to be served consecutively and to follow each other in the same sequence as the counts appeared in the indictment. This is the reasonable and natural implication from the whole entry.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The Court distinguished Patterson on the ground that in Patterson the sentences grew out of \u201cthree separate <em>indictments,\" </em>saying, \u201cthe question there was materially different from the one here presented, which concerns <em>counts </em>in one indictment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> [Italics in original.]</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">It seems to me, therefore, that under Patterson, thus distinguished but not disapproved, the sentences pronounced in open court in the present cases as \u201cconsecutive,\u201d without more, were satisfied when one of the specified terms had been served. I now assume that the \u201cconcurrent\u201d language of the Judgments and Commitments, though these were signed by the Judge, was due to a mistake. Yet the mistaken language, once the Judgments and Commitments had been satisfied by prison confinement in accordance with their terms, was a true reflection of the legal situation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thereafter the imprisonment could not be increased. The authorities are uniform in holding that a valid sentence once served, or even begun to be served, cannot be augmented. This is so because of the constitutional provision against double jeopardy. United States v. Benz, 282 U.S. 304, 51 S.Ct. 113, 75 L.Ed. 354; Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 85 U.S. 163, 21 L.Ed. 872; United States v. Rosenstreich, 2 Cir., 204 F.2d 321; King v. United States, 69 App.D.C. 10, 98 F.2d 291. See, also, Rowley v. Welch, 72 App.D.C. 351, 354, 114 F.2d 499, 502, and Clark v. Memolo, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 65, 174 F.2d 978. And see Bozza v. United States, 330 U.S. 160, 167, note 2, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818. It seems to me altogether unrealistic to say that appellant\u2019s sentence was not augmented but only made to conform on the record to what it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">If the distinction of Patterson drawn by the Supreme Court in Daugherty is not thought to be altogether persuasive\u2014 or if it is thought that Patterson is too technical \u2014 there are factors of substance here, not present in Patterson, which do persuade that the result reached in Patterson should be reached here. The formal Judgments and Commitments in the present cases actually read \u201cconcurrent\u201d and were so signed by the Judge as required by Rule 32(b). The concurrent terms, which thus prima facie state the sentences,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> were fully served and appellant was actually at liberty. This was not the situation either in Patterson, in Daugherty, or in any case relied upon by the court in its present opinion, with the possible exception of Watkins v. Merry, 10 Cir., 106 F.2d 360.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>think the court had lost jurisdiction<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> over appellant\u2019s imprisonment. Jurisdiction in the court to correct its records would not in the present circumstances extend to jurisdiction over the liberty of the individual affected by the mistake after he had adjusted his life to accord with the terms of the formal Judgments and Commitments and had been given his freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The opinion of the court is concerned to a large degree with demonstrating the undisputed fact that in imposing sentence in open court the Judge meant the sentences to be consecutive. There is, however, also no doubt that the order of consecutiveness was not stated, and that when the Judge signed the formal papers the sentences were set forth therein as \u201cconcurrent.\u201d There is an \u2022entire omission of anything in the record as to whether the Judge read the papers. If they were read he accepted the change from \u201cconsecutive\u201d to \u201cconcurrent.\u201d If they were not read I think the error cannot be corrected without notice or opportunity to be heard accorded to the one vitally affected by the changes. A Judge, though in the utmost good faith, might not carry in mind for years the details of all he thought \u2022or did in the consideration or signing \u2022of particular papers. If he read and accepted these as written their content should govern, regardless of what he had previously said in open court. If he did not read the papers the mistake \u2014 and mistakes cannot always be avoided \u2014 was not one within his discretion to correct under Rule 36 \u2014 without notice. Indeed, in Downey v. United States, supra, where, as in Patterson, the truth in part lay in his mind it is said that the sentencing judge should not conduct the correction hearing, but be heard as a witness. Be that as it may, a hearing was essential, and is not supplied after <em>eso parte </em>changes have been made and the prisoner himself has instituted habeas corpus proceedings to attack those which made his imprisonment illegal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-24\">.
