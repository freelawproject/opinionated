In 1938 the petitioner set up a new textile division, and during the remainder of its base period it had an overall net loss on the business of this new division. The income from its other activities in the last two years of its base period, however, substantially exceeded its income from such business in the first two years of its base period. The Commissioner conceded that the setting up of the textile division was a \u201cchange in the character\u201d of the petitioner\u2019s business under \u00a7 722(b) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. Excess Profits Taxes, \u00a7 722(b) (4), and that if the change had occurred two years earlier, the petitioner would have realized a constructive average base period income from the textile division of $179,136.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-21\">The Tax Court held that the petitioner was not entitled to the benefits of the \u201cgrowth formula\u201d used in computing its \u201caverage base period net income\u201d under \u00a7 713(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. Excess Profits Taxes, \u00a7 713(f) in arriving at its \u201cconstructive average base period net income\u201d under \u00a7 722(a) of the Code. Upon the reasoning of the Tax Court\u2019s opinion, 1956, 26 T.C. 389, and the authority of this court\u2019s decision in Dowd-Feder v. Commissioner, 1948, 173 F.2d 673 the decisions of the Tax Court are'affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
