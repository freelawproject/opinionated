In his thorough and thoughtful opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reviewing the proceedings which culminated in the referee\u2019s order and the petition for review, the district judge carefully and correctly set out the facts and as carefully and correctly canvassed the authorities and stated the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In complete agreement not only with the disposition made by the district judge but with the reasons given in his opinion therefor, we find it unnecessary to further labor the matter, and, upon the considerations and for the reasons given in his opinion, we order his judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A25\">.
