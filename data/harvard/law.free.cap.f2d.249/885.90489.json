Rule 41(b) provides for dismissal of actions for non-compliance with the rules of Civil Procedure and, unless otherwise specified in the dismissal order, such dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-23\">After due consideration of the record, oral arguments and printed briefs of counsel, this Court holds the District Judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to reinstate this action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Mooney v.
