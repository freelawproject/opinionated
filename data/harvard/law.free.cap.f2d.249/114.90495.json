Miller and Bast\u00edan concur, Circuit Judge Fahy concurring in the result and stating his views separately: Appellants, Sunshine Book Company and Solair Union Naturisme, Inc., sought in the District Court to enjoin the Post Office Department from refusing to transmit by mail the February, 1955, issue of \u201cSunshine &amp; Health\u201d Magazine and the January-February, 1955, issue of Sun Magazine. A Hearing Examiner in the Post Office Department had decided that the named issues are nonmailable because obscene as that term is used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 (1952).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review of the appellants\u2019 exceptions to the Initial Decision and recommendations of the Hearing Examiner and the Department\u2019s reply thereto, the Solicitor of the Post Office Department affirmed. Concluding that the magazines contained photographs of naked men, women and children, are \u201cobscene and indecent when judged by the ordinary community standards of the vast majority of citizens of this country,\u201d and noting that advertisements in the magazines indicate that they are <em>offered </em>freely for sale <em>to the </em>general public who are not members of a nudist organization, the Solicitor directed that the postmaster at Mays Landing, New Jersey, be instructed to treat the named issues as nonmailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-18\">In the District Court, appellants asked a declaration that the determination and order of the Department as applied be declared invalid as unconstitutional; that the Department be restrained permanently from withholding from dispatch in the United States mails the named issues of the magazines, and future numbers of these publications said to be substantially similar to the named issues here involved and to the magazines con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>sidered as exhibits in an earlier action <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; a preliminary injunction to the same effect pending final relief; and that the named issues be declared not to be obscene. Judge Kirkland denied relief, ruling that there was a substantial basis in fact and in law to support the Department\u2019s determination and, independently as trier, he concluded that the named issues, being obscene, are nonmailable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the appeal had here been argued, the court ordered rehearing <em>en banc. </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOb\">Facts alleged, found and appearing of record may be succinctly summarized. About December 23, 1954, appellant Sunshine completed the printing of approximately 40,000 copies of the February, 1955, issue of the publication, \u201cSunshine &amp; Health\u201d of which 10,000 copies were to be circulated through the mails. Approximately 30% of the total circulation of the second publication, \u201cSun Magazine,\u201d was to be distributed through the mails. Appellants alleged that they receive a larger percentage of return on copies disseminated by mail to subscribers than from the sale of copies distributed by other means such as sales at news-stands. Between December 24, 1954, and December 31, 1954, appellant Sunshine Book Company caused some 400 copies of its February 1955 issue to be offered for mailing as third class matter through the post office at Mays Landing, New Jersey. The postmaster under date of December 29, 1954, submitted a sample copy of the questioned issue to the Solicitor for the Post Office Department for instructions, pursuant to the applicable \u2022regulation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under date of December 30, 1954, he was advised by the Solicitor that the questioned copies \u201csubject to inspection\u201d should be withheld from dispatch and that the senders should be informed that they might have \u201copportunity to show cause within fifteen days why the article should not be disposed of as matter nonmailable under * * * 39 C.F.R. 36.2.\u201d Under date of December 31, 1954, the postmaster informed the senders as to the opportunity to be heard, but erroneously also wrote that the questioned issue \u201cis nonmailable and must be withheld from dispatch.\u201d The Solicitor under date of January 6, 1955, advised the senders as to the postmaster\u2019s error and pointed out that no ruling or determination as to mailability had been made either by the Solicitor or by any authorized person, that a hearing had been assigned for January 10, 1955, and that \u201cevery effort will be made to insure an expeditious consideration and ruling in this matter.\u201d Similar notice was given to Solar Universale Nudisme Magazine of a hearing assigned for January 11, 1955, to determine the mailability of its January-February, 1955, issue of Sun Magazine. On January 10, 1955, the Hearing Examiner \u201cat the request of counsel for the publisher and with the agreement of the Solicitor\u201d continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the hearings as to both magazines until January 17, 1955, when the hearings went forward. On appeal from the examiner\u2019s initial decision, the Solicitor affirmed January 28, 1955, reciting details as to the photographic contents of the questioned publications which he found were offered freely for sale to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Meanwhile, proceedings had been instituted in the District Court on January 6, 1955, and, on January 18, 1955, the motion for preliminary injunction was denied. It was then ordered that \u201cthe status quo\u201d be maintained until the completion of the administrative proceedings and that the case be advanced for trial to be heard January 31, 1955. Accordingly, the case was then heard and after argument, the court\u2019s oral ruling was pronounced. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were thereafter filed, and the judgment dismissing the appellants\u2019 amended complaint was entered February 16, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In court the Department stood upon the record of the papers and opinions which had been filed in the administrative proceeding which, without objection, were received. The trier offered to hear testimony. Appellants presented no \u201clive\u201d witnesses, and had none in court. In colloquy with the trial judge appellants\u2019 counsel outlined the nature of such testimony as might have been produced: as to community standards; that the photographs do not violate such standards ; that nudism is growing in American life, \u201cfor instance, in the home\u201d; and analysis, comparatively, of some nude photographs in certain magazines and of the sequence in \u201cLa Tuka,\u201d a motion picture of African tribal life. The trier ruled the proffer was irrelevant in terms of American community life measured by legal standards as applied to the magazine issues before the court. Counsel, in effect, concluded: \u201cThis brings us, then, far quicker than I thought we would get there to the issue of obscenity.\u201d It was the issue in the District Court, and is the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">The statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under which the proceedings went forward not only makes criminal the use of the mails for the transmission of proscribed matter, including obscene, lewd or lascivious pictures or publications of an indecent character, but all such matter is declared to be \u201cnonmailable\u201d and \u201cshall not be conveyed in the mails.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Appellants\u2019 contentions that the statute \u201cusurps powers impliedly and expressly reserved to the states in violation of the First, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\u201d have been answered by the Court in Roth v. United States,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where it was held expressly that \u201cobscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.\u201d The majority further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">\u201cRoth\u2019s argument that the federal obscenity statute unconstitutionally encroaches upon the powers reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the States and to the people to punish speech and press where offensive to decency and morality is hinged upon his contention that obscenity is expression not excepted from the sweep of the provision of the First Amendment that <em>\u2018Congress </em>shall make <em>no law </em>* * * abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press * * (Emphasis added.) That argument falls in light of our holding that obscenity is not expres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>sion protected by the First Amendment. We therefore hold that the federal obscenity statute punishing the use of the mails for obscene material is a proper exercise of the postal power delegated to Congress by Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 7.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The command of the statute is such that if the issues of the magazines in question are nonmailable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461, the Post Office Department is bound to deny access to the mails.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> *Arguing that a conclusion of \u201cobscenity\u201d is a matter of <em>opinion, </em>appellants insist that the Postmaster General\u2019s order was invalid as a matter of law. The Court tells us however that, while there may be marginal cases, obscenity is recognizable and may be distinguished from the portrayal of sex in art, literature and scientific works. \u201cObscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.\u201d The Court observed that the trial court \u201csufficiently followed the proper standard,\u201d having applied the test \u201cwhether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u201d Thus, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">\u201cIn summary, then, we hold that [the federal statute] applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, do[es] not offend constitutional safeguards against convictions based upon protected material, or fail to give men in acting adequate notice of what is prohibited.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Here, the trial judge carefully reviewed the authorities and applied the test<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>we had laid down in Parmelee v. United States <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and which was quoted verbatim in the Roth charge, approved by the Court. Supplied by the trial judge were extensive, particularized descriptions of the offending and offensive material which need not here be repeated, as they speak for themselves. We deem the conclusions reached by the trial judge to be amply sustained. Appellants argue to us that the issue of obscenity is \u201cnot foreclosed by the finding of the trial court and is to be independently reviewed and determined by this court.\u201d Were we, as is urged, to go beyond the trier and to reach our own conclusion, we would have no hesitancy in deciding that what is before us is \u201cmaterial which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest,\u201d and hence is obscene, as Roth tells us.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">Appellants ask us to say that our earlier decision <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is <em>res judicata. </em>Quite apart from the fact that the many issues of the publications there involved differ from the exhibits before us in no substantial particular so far as their common pattern of nudity is concerned, some of them were more, and some less offensive in their portrayal of sexual indicia than the photographs in the exhibits with which we are now concerned. Most important, however, we did not in the earlier case reach or decide any such issue. On the contrary, we were concerned solely with the scope of the order of the Postmaster General which, we concluded, exceeded his authority. Indeed, we ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>-pressly authorized him to amend his orders to conform to the limitations we de.fined, and we found it unnecessary to inquire into or to pass upon his finding as to obscenity. Since we did not decide that the orders lacked a predicate of obscenity, appellants\u2019 reliance upon <em>res judicata </em>is totally without basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Were we, as appellants asked, to refer to the many issues received as exhibits in the earlier cases, we might readily spell out a continuous pattern of dissemination of nude photographs, a pattern in existence for many years. We would not ignore Sunshine Book Co. v. McCaffrey<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> where the court at page 483 said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201cWhere the dominant purpose of nudity is to promote lust, it is obscene and indecent. The distribution and sale of the magazines in this case is a most objectionable example. The dominant purpose of the photographs in these magazines is to attract the attention of the public by an appeal to their sexual impulses. The sales of these magazines is not limited to any mailing list of members or subscribers. They are sold and distributed indiscriminately to all who wish to purchase the same. Men, women, youths of both sexes, and even children, can purchase these magazines. They will have a libidinous effect upon most ordinary, normal, healthy individuals. Their effect upon the abnormal individual may be more disastrous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Nor do we see in the circumstances here a \u201cprior restraint\u201d against which to inveigh. The statute declares certain matter to be nonmailable which \u201cshall not be conveyed in the mails.\u201d It may be supposed that the Post Office Department is not bound to sit idly by if instruments of crime, proscribed as nonmailable, are nonetheless offered for mailing. We may assume that the Department is not bound to permit the crime to be committed and only thereafter to proceed against one who mails the offending material. Here, pursuant to the departmental regulations, the postmaster sought instructions. An administrative hearing was ordered which proceeded expeditiously, both before the Department and the District Court. After application of the pertinent and appropriate standard, the questioned exhibits were found to be nonmailable. Here, there was no interference with some 30,000 copies of the questioned issue of \u201cSunshine &amp; Health,\u201d and with some 70% of the questioned issue of \u201cSun Magazine,\u201d distributed otherwise than through the mails. Here was no injunction restraining the contemplated distribution of the publications to the public at large. Rather, only after hearing in accord with procedural safeguards antecedent to a determination of nonmailability, the Postmaster General has ruled that the facilities of the Post Office Department are not to be utilized, and the offending material \u201cshall not be conveyed In the mails.\u201d There was no seizure, there was no restraint upon \u201cthe dissemination of future issues of a publication because its past issues had been found offensive.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">We are satisfied that it has been correctly determined that the issues of the magazines here in suit comprise nonmailable matter within the meaning of the statute. There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-11\">.

Thus, as it seems to me, the statute is not solely a criminal one but is also one which closes the mail to obscene matter. This is not inconsistent with the First Amendment, Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 or beyond the federal power; so that even though there has been no conviction of crime, there is reached the question whether the matter is of the kind the statute describes as nonmailable. The standards for determining this have been laid down by the Supreme Court, and the Department was here governed by equivalent standards; the Department applied the standards of the \u201cdominant theme\u201d and of the \u201ccontemporary community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">I do not disagree with the conclusion reached. Pictures permeate the magazine and the pictures are dominated by those which the contemporary community deems indecent. If this is so it cannot be but immaterial that much innocent text also appears in the magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">This leaves the question whether the departmental procedure met the requirements of due process. In Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, 354 U.S. 436, 77 S.Ct. 1325, 1326, 1 L.Ed.2d 1469, the Court sustained the New York \u201climited injunctive remedy\u201d under the Fourteenth Amendment, applicable to state statute. I think the prompt and speedy administrative process accorded in the present case cannot be distinguished on a Fifth Amendment level, applicable to federal statute, from the procedure sustained in Kingsley Books. After the magazine was held, a longer time elapsed here than in that case before the nonmailable decision was reached; but the Department moved expeditiously \u2014 in fact appellant requested additional time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Further congressional attention to procedure might be desirable, but this is not to say that the courts should hold invalid the procedure here followed, unless it is to be held that only a court or jury is capable under the Constitution of determining in the first or preliminary instance the question of obscenity.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">.

Regents of University of State of New York, 1957, 3 N.Y. 2d 237, 246, 165 N.Y.S.2d 42, 49. \u201cThe validity of the obscenity laws is recognition that the mails may not be used to satisfy all tastes, no matter how perverted.\u201d Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc., 1946, 327 U.S. 146, 158, 66 S.Ct. 456, 462, 90 L.Ed. 586. Well established though these propositions may be, they do not answer the hard questions of an individual case. Has the publication been found \u201cobscene\u201d by a proper tribunal, applying proper standards ? Has the punishment or remedy been authorized by proper legislation?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">In the instant case, these questions have not yet been adequately answered. In the first place, it is not at all clear that the Post Office Department possesses any power to censor any class of mail, sealed or unsealed. Certainly Congress, has never given such a power in so many words, nor has the Supreme Court ever expressly recognized the existence of such a power. The authority under which the Department is said to be operating in this field is a criminal statute passed in 1873 r<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It contains no language which directs the Department to refuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>to transport and deliver newspapers and magazines pending final decision on its part as to whether their content is acceptable to it. \u201cSome day Congress may perhaps give that authorization in specific terms, with proper guidance for and restrictions on administrative action, and with such safeguards as the Constitution may require. But Congress has not done so here.\u201d Summerfield v. Sunshine Book Co., 1954, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 169 at page 175, 221 F.2d 42 at page 48<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cAll that Congress meant by this [1873] act was, that the mail should not be used to transport such corrupting publications and articles, and that any one who attempted to use it for that purpose should be punished.\u201d Ex parte Jackson, 1877, 96 U.S. 727 at page 736, 24 L.Ed. 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">The postal power permits the Federal Government to impose criminal sanctions for using the mails to distribute obscene materials. Roth v. United States, supra. Such sanctions, of course, are accompanied by the safeguards of a jury trial. See Brennan, J., dissenting in Kingsley Books, Inc., v. Brown, 1957, 354 U.S. 436, 447, 77 S.Ct. 1325, 1 L.Ed.2d 1469. Prior restraint is another story. A state staute has been upheld which permitted a limited form of judicial prior restraint against materials alleged to be obscene, through temporary injunction followed by prompt trial. See Kingsley Books, Inc., v. Brown, supra. It may be that the postal power would provide a basis for a Federal statute authorizing a similar form of judicial control. But an administrative prior restraint, not plainly authorized by statute and not subject to specified standards and safeguards, is of highly doubtful validity, to say the least. Compare Holmby Productions, Inc., v. Vaughn, 1955, 350 U.S. 870, 76 S.Ct. 117, 100 L.Ed. 770; 350 U.S. 919, 76 S.Ct. 193, 100 L.Ed. 805, reversing 1955, 177 Kan. 728, 282 P.2d 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">It may be argued that the duty of the Postmaster General \u201cto execute all laws relative to the Postal Service,\u201d 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 369, gives him some measure of authority over materials deposited in the mail in alleged violation of the criminal statute. It may be said, too, that the statute makes the materials non-mailable, and forbids their handling. These arguments hardly suffice. Congress has always \u201czealously watched and strictly confined\u201d any proposal to empower the Postmaster General to refuse to handle mail because of its content. See Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc., supra, 327 U.S. at page 156, note 18, 66 S.Ct. at page 461. Surely the courts must take a like attitude, even if they conclude that the present statute does give the Postmaster General some part of the authority he now claims.2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Certainly, under any view, the courts must intervene if improper standards have been applied in making a determination of obscenity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That has occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">The test of obscenity is \u201cwhether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the <em>dominant </em>theme of the material <em>taken as a whole </em>appeals to prurient interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Roth v. United States, supra, 354 U.S. at page 489, 77 S.Ct. at page 1311.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wo expressed a similar thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>in Walker v. Popenoe, 1945, 80 U.S.App. D.C. 129, 130, 149 F.2d 511, 512, where we said: \u201cThe statute [now 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461] does not bar from the mails an obscene phrase or an obscene sentence. It bars an obscene \u2018book, pamphlet * * * or other publication * * *. \u2019 If a publication as a whole is not stimulating to the senses [i. e., does not \u201carouse the salacity\u201d] of the ordinary reader, it is not within the statute. * * * The <em>dominant </em>effect of an entire publication determines its character.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) See also Parmelee v. United States, 1940, 72 App.D.C. 203, 113 F.2d 729; United States v. Dennett, 2 Cir., 1930, 39 F.2d 564, 76 A.L.R. 1092; United States v. One Book Entitled Ulysses, 2 Cir., 1934, 72 F.2d 705; United States v. Levine, 2 Cir., 1936, 83 F.2d 156. In these cases, works which the courts found to be of genuine sociological, medical, or literary merit were held not obscene, although portions of them, taken from context, might appear otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In the instant case, the magazines \u201cadvocate and explain nudism and the nudist mode of living.\u201d Summerfield v. Sunshine Book Co., 95 U.S.App.D.C. at page 170, 221 F.2d at page 43. One of the-magazines has been published for over-twenty years. Their texts were found by the Post Office Department and the District Court not to be obscene. But both the Department and the District Court-thereupon proceeded to deal with the illustrations in the magazines merely as such. The Examiner of the Post Office Department and the District Court explicitly recognize in their opinions that-the publications must be considered as a whole.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet an examination of their opinions, as well as that of the Solicitor of the Post Office Department, shows no effort to weigh the material considered objectionable against the rest of the contents, or to weigh the risk in permitting the former to circulate against the limitations on freedom of the press implicit in halting circulation of the latter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Another aspect of the case is equally disturbing. More than a decade ago we held in Walker v. Popenoe, supra, that a hearing must precede the barring of published matter from the mails. Here, the Department refused to accept the magazines for mailing, and held a hearing after its refusal had become effective.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>We expressly condemned such an interference with freedom of the press in the Walker case, where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">\u201cWe are not impressed with the argument that a rule requiring a hearing before mailing privileges are suspended would permit, while the hearing was going on, the distribution of publications intentionally obscene in plain defiance of every reasonable standard. In such a case the effective remedy is the immediate arrest of the offender for the crime penalized by this statute. Such action would prevent any form of distribution of the obscene material by mail or otherwise. If the offender were released on bail the conditions of that bail should be a sufficient protection against repetition of the offense before trial. But often mailing privileges are revoked in cases where the prosecuting officers are not sure enough to risk criminal prosecution. That was the situation here.\u201d 80 U.S.App.D.C. at page 132, 149 F.2d at page 514 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"APM\">For these reasons the order of the Post Office Department should be held invalid. Under all the circumstances \u2014 the passage of time and the disregard by the Post Office Department of our ruling in the Walker case \u2014 further administrative proceedings with respect to the magazine issues here involved should not be permitted. The case should be remanded to the District Court with instructions to issue an injunction permanently restraining enforcement of the Department\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-14\">.

The District Judge found that the refusal of the Post Office Department to transmit the magazines in question began on or about December 23, 1954. By letter of December 30, 1954, the Solicitor of the Post Office Department acknowledged a letter of December 29, 1954, from the Postmaster of Mays Landing, New Jersey, which set forth the action taken. The Solicitor advised that the magazines \u201cshould be withheld from dispatch,\u201d except for copies submitted for first class mailing, and that the senders \u201cshould be informed that they may have an opportunity to show cause within fifteen days why the article should not be disposed of as matter nonmailable ... by offering through appearance at this [the Solicitor\u2019s] office in person or by attorney, or through submission of a statement in writing, whatever evidence or arguments they care to submit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKv\">The Postmaster of Mays Landing transmitted this information to appellant by letter of December 31, 1954. He added that the magazines in question were \u201cnonmailable and must be with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>held from dispatch.\u201d By letter of January 6, 1955, to appellant, the Solicitor acknowledged that the Postmaster\u2019s statement as to nonmailability was in error, \u201cno ruling or determination either of mailabilily or non-mailability having yet been made. . . . \u201d He also gave notice of a hearing on the question to be hold on January 10, 1955. But no action was taken to transmit the magazines in the mail. At appellant\u2019s request, the hearing was postponed to January 17, 1955. At the hearing, the Examiner ruled, correctly, we think, and without objection by the Post Office Department, that the burden of proof rested on the Post Office Department rather than appellant. An initial decision was handed down by the Examiner on January 20, 1955, and affirmed by the Solicitor on January 28, 1955. It is thus evident that appellant\u2019s magazines were barred from the mails for almost a month before the hearing and the initial administrative decision that they were unmailable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"AVk\">.
