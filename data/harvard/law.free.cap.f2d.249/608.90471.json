H. Johnson had mailed $14.00 of his own marked money to Paul Herring, of the \u201cDelinquent Accounts Branch\u201d of the Internal Revenue Service in Nashville; that the envelope containing this marked money was included in other mail which was picked up by other employees of the Internal Revenue Service, in the course of their employment, at the Post Office box used by the Director of Internal Revenue in that city; that the said employees, in the execution of their duties, delivered such mail to the said Cashier\u2019s Office; that, thereafter, postal inspectors searched several postal employees and found the marked money in appellant\u2019s pocketbook when they searched him.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The evidence clearly shows that appellant was specifically assigned by his superiors to the duty of distributing mail from the Cashier\u2019s Office to the other offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The federal statute and decisions are here controlling. The embezzlement statutes of the State of Tennessee, relied upon by appellant, apply only to employees and property of State, County, and Municipal Governments, and to employees of private individuals, corporations, and partnerships. Embezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of property by a person to whom such property has been entrusted or into whose hands it has lawfully come. Moore v. United States, 160 U.S. 268, 16 S.Ct. 294, 40 L.Ed. 422. From the evidence, it appears that appellant was an employee of the Internal Revenue Service of the United States; that money, belonging to another, came into his possession in the execution of his office, or course of employment, as a distributor of mail in the office of the Internal Revenue Service; and that he wrongfully converted it to his own use.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">\u201cWhoever, being an officer or employee of the United States or of any department or agency thereof, embezzles or wrongfully converts to his own use the money or property of another which comes into his possession or under his control in the execution of such office or employment, or under color or claim of authority as such officer or employee, shall be fined * * * or imprisoned * * * or both * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">No error appearing, and the judgment being sustained by the evidence, it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-9\">.
