This is made clear by 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1524 providing that the \u201chousing may be <em>sold </em>and disposed of as expeditiously as possible\u201d and further providing for the transfer of such housing \u201cas may be considered to be <em>permanently </em>useful to the Army, Navy or Air Force.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">No rule of strict construction can conceivably make a mere leasehold of the land the limits of the power of condemnation in the situation here, as it is clearly one for acquisition of the fee as we held in our decision in Lewis v. United States, 200 F.2d 183, 185, certiorari denied 345 U.S. 907, 73 S.Ct. 647, 97 L.Ed. 1343. Even if it were not so clear, the Administrator had the right to choose to take the fee by analogy to the rule announced in Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 75 S.Ct. 98, 99 L.Ed. 27. There a similar statute was construed as giving an agency of the District of Columbia such a conclusive power of choice, stating 348 U.S. at page 36, 75 S.Ct. at page 104: \u201cIf the Agency considers it necessary in carrying out the redevelopment project to take full title to the real property involved, it may do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Appellants rely on our decision in Warm Springs Irrigation Dist. v. Pacific Live Stock Co., 9 Cir., 270 F. 560 where we gave a strict construction to an Oregon statute providing for the condemnation of lands and water rights for an irrigation district, and upheld the district court in limiting the taking to an easement applying the rule of strict construction in eminent domain- proceedings. The Oregon statute had no provision for the sale of the property condemned as in Section 1524 here. It is pertinent to our holding here that we stated at page 563:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-11\">\u201cThis is not to say that a fee-simple title to land may in no instance be taken by irrigation districts in condemnation proceedings under the Oregon laws, nor to say that for a dam site it may not become necessary to condemn the title to land. But for a reservoir site there can be no question that the demands of necessity are met by the condemnation of an easement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
