It seems to me to be inconsistent with the terms of section 9(c) of the Labor Relations Act, as amended, and therefore to constitute unlawful action by the Board, for it to refuse to assume jurisdiction over any representation case involving any hotel, notwithstanding \u201ca question of representation affecting commerce exists.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Act says that the Board shall take jurisdiction of questions of representation affecting commerce. The verb \u201cshall\u201d was incorporated into section 9(c) by the Taft-Hartley Act in place of \u201cmay\u201d in the older Wagner Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The language is also to be contrasted with that relating to unfair labor practice cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> where the Board is not required to file a complaint but is \u201cempowered\u201d to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-18\">There is no intimation in the Act that the public <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or employees or employers should be denied the benefits of the representation provisions simply because a hotel is involved. We need not decide whether the Board as a matter of discretion or policy can validly decline jurisdiction of some representation questions involving hotels, though commerce should be affected within the meaning of the Act. See N. L. R. B. v. Denver Bldg. Council, 341 U.S. 675, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For in the present case the refusal of the Board to go forward was on the basis of a decision to exclude all questions of representation involving hotels. I think this is inconsistent with Office Employes v. N. L. R. B., 353 U.S. 313, 77 S.Ct. 799, 1 L.Ed.2d 846, in which the opinion was handed down after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>present case was decided by our District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Jurisdiction in the District Court to entertain the action I think is amply sustained by our decision in Air Line Dispatchers Ass\u2019n v. National Mediation Bd., 89 U.S.App.D.C. 24, 27, 189 F.2d 685, 688; see, also, Leedom v. Kyne, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 398, 249 F.2d 490, and cases cited.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\">. 49 Stat <em>453 </em>(1935), as amended 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-12\">.

Of the four labor cases on which the District Court below relied for its decision on this point, three, N. L. R. B. v. Denver Bldg. Council, 341 U.S. 675, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284; N. L. R. B. v. Stoller, 9 Cir., 207 F.2d 305; N. L. R. B. v. Townsend, 9 Cir., 185 F.2d 378, dealt with unfair labor practices. The fourth, Optical Workers v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 227 F.2d 687, though a representation case, was a denial of jurisdiction by the Board \u201cin that case,\u201d see note 6, infra, because of the small amount of interstate business done by the company involved. There was no declination of jurisdiction over an entire industry. In fact, in none of the cases relied upon below was there such a declination. The only case in which the Board\u2019s refusal to exercise jurisdiction over an entire industry has been reviewed is Office Employes v. N. L. R. B., infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b559-21\">. The public character of the rights involved has been noted often by the Supreme Court. National Licorice Co. v. N. L. R.
