The plaintiff filed his remittitur for this amount but unfortunately neither the judge\u2019s memorandum nor the remittitur stated whether the $13,000 was to be subtracted from the verdict of $61,000 or from the verdict plus interest of $12,677.83 which totalled $73,677.83. The clerk of the district court issued an execution which deducted the $13,000 from the verdict plus interest. Defendant subsequently moved for a new judgment which would subtract $13,000 from the verdict and an amended judgment was so ordered by the trial judge, who stated that the remittitur was meant to be deducted from the amount of the verdict and not from the verdict plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-19\">In the absence of language by the trial judge in his original memorandum expressly stating that the remittitur was to be subtracted from the verdict plus interest, this court considers that the remittitur was to be subtracted from the verdict only. Here interest was not an element of damages considered by the jury. It is an item which was added to the verdict by the clerk. It was the verdict of the jury for $61,000 that the trial judge considered excessive. \u2022 It was his judgment that a verdict for more than $48,000 should not have been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-20\">A judgment will be entered affirming the amended judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
