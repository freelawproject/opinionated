Guthrie, 345 U.S. 918, 73 S.Ct. 727, 97 L.Ed. 1351, rehearing denied 345 U.S. 971, 73 S.Ct. 1110, 97 L.Ed. 1388. For many years and in a variety of ways she has asserted that the Town of Suffield, The Suffield Savings Bank, and a \u201cpool\u201d of lawyers, brokers, and others have conspired to deprive her of her patrimony in the Miller\u2019s Beach farms in Suffield; but her vague charges, however vigorously asserted, have always lacked substance and substantiation. Judge Smith has dismissed her present complaint because she did not comply with his earlier order that she file a bond for costs and because the complaint fails to state a claim for relief. We agree with the dismissal and the grounds on which it was placed. The order for a moderate bond for costs was surely justified in view of the background of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>prior litigation. And the ambiguous allegations here show no legal wrong or impairment of interstate commerce or injury to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
