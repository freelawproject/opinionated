United States, 4 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>237 F.2d 228. The point here presented is the same as that presented by the former appeal and nothing need be added to what was there said. There is nothing uncertain about the sentence, as argued by appellant; and, as we pointed out in our opinion in the former appeal, a general sentence of ten years would be upheld, where there was a plea of guilty to four counts of an indictment, each of which warranted a five year sentence, or a total of twenty years for the four counts. See, also, Hamilton v. United States, 4 Cir., 204 F.2d 927, 928; Neely v. United States, 4 Cir., 2 F.2d 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
