The questions raised by the petition are the same as those passed upon by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in State ex rel. Nathan Johnson v. Skeen, 140 W.Va. 896, 87 S.E.2d 521, certiorari denied 351 U.S. 956, 76 S.Ct. 854, 100 L.Ed. 1478, where the facts are fully stated. We are bound by the interpretation placed by the courts of West Virginia upon the statutes of that state; and in the light of the interpretation placed by that court upon the statutes involved, there is no merit in the contention that appellant has not been thrice convicted of crimes punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary and therefore punishable under the Habitual Criminal Act of West Virginia, Code, 61 \u2014 11-18, 61-11-19. The District Judge properly refused to issue a writ of habeas corpus when appellant\u2019s contentions had been adequately considered and authoritatively decided by the Supreme Court of the state. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 465, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469. The appeal must be dismissed for lack of the certificate of probable cause required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253; but we may add that, for the reasons here stated, appellant was not and is not entitled to such certificate as his appeal is entirely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-18\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
