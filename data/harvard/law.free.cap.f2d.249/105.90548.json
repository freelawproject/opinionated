JENKINS, Appellant, v. UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b157-6\">No. 13781.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b157-7\">United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b157-8\">Argued June 27, 1957.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b157-9\">Decided Aug. 22, 1957.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-20\">Mr. Cecil A. Beasley, Jr., Washington, D. C., with whom Mr. R. J. Shortlidge, Jr., Washington, D. C. (both appointed by this Court) was on the brief, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-21\">Mr. Nathan J. Paulson, Asst. U. S. Atty., with whom Messrs. Oliver Gasch, U. S. Atty., and Edward P. Troxell, Principal Asst. U. S. Atty., and Lewis Carroll, Asst. U. S. Atty., were on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b157-22\">Before EDGERTON, Chief Judge, and FAHY and BURGER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b157-23\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b157-24\">Appellant moved under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate and set aside the judgment and sentence in Criminal Case No. 1031-53. The District Court denied this motion without a hearing, on the ground that \u201cThe motions, the files and the records of the case conclusively demonstrate that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-25\">We think appellant\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel required a hearing, particularly because it may appear that appellant\u2019s interests conflicted with the interests of co-defendants who were represented by the same counsel. Cf. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 75-76, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680. Moreover, when appellant appeared for sentencing no one was afforded an opportunity to make a statement in his behalf as required by Rule 32(a), F.R.Crim.P. [18 U.S.C.]. It is immaterial that counsel said he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201cnothing further to add\u201d to what he had previously said, in appellant\u2019s absence, at the time co-defendants were sentenced. The appellant was entitled to have a statement \u201cmade in open court and in his presence.\u201d Gadsden v. United States, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 166, 223 F.2d 627, 631. Appellant must therefore be resentenced even if the hearing discloses no ground for further relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b158-5\">BURGER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_2q\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">I would remand this case only for re-sentencing, since it appears that appellant was not present when his counsel made the only comprehensive statement presented in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The majority justifies its order for a hearing under Section 2255 on the ground that we must accept as true petitioner\u2019s statement that he was \u201cinduced\u201d by his counsel \u201cto plead guilty to a crime I didn\u2019t commit with the understanding by the attorney and the judge that I wouldn\u2019t get much time\u201d and \u201cled me to believe that because of my close relationship with the defendant Julia Fields that I was equally as guilty as she * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">I agree that the <em>ultimate </em>facts alleged in such a petition must be accepted as true, but these are not such facts, for in the same petition petitioner acknowledges that he <em>voluntarily </em>agreed to plead guilty in the hope that his co-defendant who was his wife might receive probation. Thus the essence of his claim for relief is contradicted by his own admission, negating his earlier statement on which the majority relies. Therefore the ultimate facts asserted in the petition, taken With the motions, files and records, conclusively demonstrate, as the experienced trial judge held, that petitioner is not entitled to the relief sought. United States v. Sturm, 7 Cir., 180 F.2d 413, 414, certiorari denied, 1950, 339 U.S. 986, 70 S.Ct. 1008, 94 L.Ed. 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Nor is there, to me, any basis for surmising that counsel\u2019s representation of petitioner\u2019s wife and another co-defendant may have resulted in \u201cineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The trial court\u2019s action \u201cmade on the trial court\u2019s responsibility and conscience as a judge\u201d is entitled to controlling weight where the very facts on which a hearing is requested are contradicted by the petitioner in a single document. Adams v. United States, 1955, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 357, 222 F.2d 45, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">This action goes beyond granting the accused his \u201crights.\u201d It is an unrealistic emphasis on empty form wholly unrelated to substance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
