The position of the Tax Court, in denying tax exemption, was that belief in and teaching of the existence of a Divinity is \u25a0essential to qualify under the statute. Acknowledging \u201cthat the conclusion [denying tax exemption] * * * is not entirely free from doubt or one of which the Court has a firm conviction * * * \u201d the Tax Court held the petitioner was not a religious society and not entitled to exemption under D.C.Code, \u00a7 47-801a.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Petitioner and other affiliates of the Union, which dates back to 1876, hold regular Sunday services and Sunday School classes for children; it has \u201cLeaders\u201d who preach and minister to the members, conducting services for naming, marrying and burying members. The \u201cLeaders\u201d testified in terms of \u201cspiritual values\u201d and \u201cspiritual guidance\u201d for members; one pamphlet speaks of the people\u2019s \u201cgreat need for a sense of direction in their lives,\u201d and \u201ca faith attuned to our times,\u201d and describes the group as \u201cconceived by its founder as itself a deeply religious Movement * * * to [which] it has remained faithful. * * To our believers, Ethical Culture is a way of life \u2014 an enriching, vital and meaningful force contributing to the moral and spiritual advancement of our times.\u201d Another of its early leaders declared: \u201cFor it is the inward peace which we must gain: so to live that we feel in touch with the divine purpose which permeates the world.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2Dr. Muzzey, one of its early spokesmen, wrote: \u201cEverybody except the avowed atheists (and they are comparatively few) believes in some kind of God.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">The services of the organization held at regular hours each Sunday have the forms of worship service with Bible readings, sermons, singing and meditation familiar in services of many formal or traditional church organizations. Its program bears the words \u201cWhere Men Meet to Seek the Highest is Holy Ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">\u201cLeaders\u201d of the petitioner, who are trained graduates of established theological institutions are authorized by the District of Columbia to perform marriages and they regularly <em>conduct </em>funeral services and naming ceremonies. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia acting under D.C.Code, \u00a7 30-106 has extended to \u201cLeaders\u201d or ministers of petitioner the power to perform valid marriage ceremonies by reason of being designated and authorized by a \u201cchurch or religious society for that purpose.\u201d This authority is not granted as to judicial officers or other functionaries empowered to perform a civil marriage ceremony. It is granted to petitioner by virtue of recognition as a \u201creligious society.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The opinion of the Tax Court does not suggest any doubt about the good faith belief by petitioner\u2019s members that their beliefs and practices are for them a religion and a religious belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"> Reference to standard sources of definitions discloses that the terms \u201creligion\u201d and \u201creligious\u201d in ordinary usage are not rigid concepts. Indeed, the definitions in these standard works <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> taken together are by no means free from ambiguity. Some definitions would include only the Christian religion. Some call for belief in and worship <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of a divine ruling power or recognition of a supernatural power controlling man\u2019s destiny. But also included in these definitions is the idea of \u201cdevotion to some principle; strict fidelity or faithfulness; conscientiousness, pious affecting or attachment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Congress in granting tax exemption under this statute, like most of the states, was giving expression to a broad legislative purpose to grant support to elements in the community regarded as good for the community. In the exercise of its undoubted power Congress has extended tax immunity not only to sincere and bona fide religious activities but also to various educational and patriotic societies and groups whose programs are thought to be in the public interest and welfare. The exemption of buildings belonging to \u201creligious corporations or societies\u201d is in a context of exemption to art galleries, libraries, public charities, hospitals, schools and colleges, and many named organizations. To construe exemptions so strictly that unorthodox or minority forms of worship would be denied the exemption benefits granted to</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">those conforming to the majority beliefs might well raise constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The question before us now is not broadly whether petitioner is in an ecclesiastical sense a religious society or a church, but narrowly whether under this particular statute it is qualified for tax exemption.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">We hold on this record and under the controlling statutory language petitioner qualifies as \u201ca religious corporation or society\u201d and that the building \u201cis one primarily and regularly used by its congregation for public religious worship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">. Wolff, Twenty Years of the Ethical Movement 1876-1896 (1896).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-10\">. While petitioner does not command or require of its followers that they believe in a Supreme Being or supernatural power but lets each member dedicate himself to the highest ideal his faith can reach, it is interesting to note that every \u201cLeader\u201d who appeared on petitioner\u2019s behalf testified of his own personal belief in God as a Supreme Being.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-16\">. For example the District Court on July 30, 1947, issued an authorization in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-17\">\u201cThe Rev. George Beauchamp of the American Ethical Union, having produced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>proof, to the satisfaction of the Court, that he is duly appointed, or ordained, as such and that he is in regular communion with the Religious Society of which he ho is a member, he hereby is, this 30th day of July, 3947, authorized to celebrate the rites of marriage in the District of Columbia so long as he remains appointed or ordained by the above-named Religious Society.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b181-21\">.

Among the definitions of the verb \u201cto worship\u201d is the following: \u201cto perform religious services.\u201d Webster\u2019s Now International Dictionary, 2nd Ed. It is in this sense that petitioner qualifies, not in the sense of paying homage to a supernatural being.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"ASz\">. Cf. Fellowship of Humanity v.
