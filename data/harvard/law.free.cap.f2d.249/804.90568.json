The first count charged a violation of the Harrison Narcotics Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2553 and 2557 (illegal selling); the second count was dismissed; the third and fourth counts charged appellant with violations of the Harrison Narcotics Act and the Jones-Miller Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (illegal concealment) occurring on a different day from the violation in count one; count five charged the appellant with conspiracy to violate the narcotics law in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. After a jury verdict of guilty on the four counts remaining in the indictment (that is counts one, three, four and five) the appellant was sentenced to serve four years in prison on each count the sentences on counts one and three to run concurrently and the sentences on counts four and five to run concurrently but consecutively with the sentences on counts one and three (that is a total imprisonment of eight years). There was a fine of one dollar on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-17\">Appellant contends that the maximum sentence which the trial court had jurisdiction to impose upon him was four years since count four is identical with count three and count one is identical with count five. He further contends that the sentences constitute double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-18\">The Government\u2019s reply brief argues the merits of the case. Neither brief discloses the facts appearing at the beginning of this opinion, that Toliver was serving his first sentence of uncontested validity when he invoked 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2255 to have his succeeding sentence declared invalid. That section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-19\">\u201c\u00a7 2255. Federal custody; remedies on motion attacking sentence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-20\">\u201cA prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress <em>claiming the right to be released </em>upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, <em>may move the court </em>which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-21\">\u201cA motion for such relief may be made at any time. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-22\">Of this we held that :<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>\u201cObviously, the motion must be made <em>by a </em>prisoner \u2018claiming the right to be released\u2019. As stated by the Supreme Court the \u2018sole purpose\u2019 in enacting this section \u2018was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum.\u2019 United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 219, 72 S.Ct. 263, 272, 96 L.Ed. 232. In habeas corpus the applicant has no right to have adjudicated the validity of a sentence where, if adjudicated in his favor, he would still be confined in the same penitentiary under another existing sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Since Toliver does not claim the right to be released Section 2255 was improperly invoked and the district court was without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The judgment is reversed and the district court is ordered to dismiss the motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-13\">.
