We have carefully considered the defendant\u2019s contentions that the district court committed reversible error but find them to be without merit. There was ample evidence to support the finding of the trial judge that the automobile involved was stolen within the meaning of the Dyer Act, compare United States v. Turley, 1957, 352 U.S. 407, 77 S.Ct. 397, 1 L.Ed.2d 430, and that the defendant knew this to be so and nonetheless aided and abetted the principal defendant, Rice, who pleaded guilty, in transporting it from Maryland to Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-22\">The judgment of the district coui\u2019t will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
