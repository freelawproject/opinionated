Therefrom appear the following relevant facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-17\">Defendant\u2019s Haynes Stellite division<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> entered into Department of Defense contracts for production of an item for Army Ordnance. To perform these contracts, defendant bought about 972,000 lbs. of tungsten, all but 173,205 lbs. of which was used in the production for Army Ordnance.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-18\">A certain provision contained in each of these contracts is, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-19\">\u201c(b) Upon the making of any partial payment under this contract, title to all parts, materials, inventories, * * * theretofore acquired or produced by the Contractor for the performance of this contract, -x- -x- * shall forthwith vest in the Government; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-21\">Another provision contained in each of these contracts provided for termination of the contract for the convenience of the government upon notice to the contractor. Also provided therein was the obligation of the contractor to use its best efforts to sell, in the manner, at the time, to the extent, and at the price or prices directed or authorized by the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>contracting officer, all such material produced as a part of, or acquired in connection with the performance of the work terminated by the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Specifically there were the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201c * * * Provided, that after receipt of notice of termination, any such property that is a part of termination inventory may be acquired or disposed of only in accordance with the provisions of the clause of this contract entitled Termination for Convenience of Government and applicable laws and regulations. # *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\u201c(b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall * * * (6) transfer title and deliver to the Government, * * * (i) * * * material produced as a part of, or acquired in connection with the performance of the work terminated by the Notice of Termination, * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Prior to March 9, 1953, the government made partial payments, under these contracts, of over $3,000,000. All of the tungsten acquired thereunder -'as physically segregated. The tungsten under the said government contracts was also segregated in its use and in records in regard thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Prior to completion of these contracts, the government contracting officer, Henry C. Laskin, served upon defendant notice that the government, effective March 11, 1953, terminated these contracts for its convenience. Thereafter, Laskin directed defendant to dispose of all materials acquired by defendant under these contracts, including the 173,000 pounds of tungsten, to advertise for and solicit bids for the sale thereof, and to sell, to the high bidder, with the approval of the United States government, all such materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Early in February 1954 defendant advertised three times in the Waste Trade Journal, soliciting bids for the 173,000-odd pounds of tungsten, among other items. This advertisement appeared under a bold face caption reading \u201cGovernment Contract Cancellation.\u201d The advertisement further stated, \u201cThe Government reserves the right to reject any and all bids. Terms Cash, F.O.B. Kokomo plant.\u201d Plaintiffs saw this advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">February 11, 1954, Haynes Stellite wrote a letter to Surplex Sales inviting bids on all the materials listed in the advertisement. This letter in part provided, \u201cTerms of payment will be our option. (Cashier\u2019s check, certified check, or sight draft),\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">February 23, 1954, plaintiffs submitted their bid on the tungsten, among other items, expressly pursuant to the advertisement and the letter. This bid, in part, stated, \u201cTerms of payment per your letter at your option.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">Haynes Stellite advised plaintiffs that Surplex Sales was high bidder on the tungsten \u201cand that report would be made to the government and the plaintiffs would be notified orally and in writing if their bids were approved by the United States Government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-18\">March 4, 1954, plaintiff Joseph Andalman telephoned New York Ordnance where the bid was subject to approval. He called again on March 5, 1954 and was told that plaintiffs\u2019 bid was approved. He and plaintiff Maxwell Andalman the next day went to Kokomo, Indiana, where the tungsten was stored, and met with the Haynes Stellite office manager. Here they gave him a check for one barrel of the tungsten, and commented that they needed it for use as sales samples. At the same time the office manager handed them a letter stating that they had been awarded the tungsten in accordance with their February 23 bid. Plaintiffs later received written notification from New York Ordnance confirming acceptance. Laskin and the Army Board of Awards approved the bid without submitting or offering the tungsten to the General Services Administration, which gave no release or authorization for the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>. March 10, 1954, New York Ordnance wired Haynes Stellite, in substance, that the sale of tungsten to Surplex Sales was \u201csuspended,\u201d and that \u201cno deliveries are to be made whatsoever pending further instructions.\u201d Defendant notified plaintiffs thereof the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">By letter dated March 17,1954, Laskin directed defendant to turn over to the government, in accordance with forthcoming shipping instructions, the tung.sten in question, giving as a reason that General Services Administration had not approved the disposition of the property to plaintiffs, that it was being stock-piled by the government and the interests of national defense required that it be delivered to the government and the aforesaid approved disposition (to plaintiffs) canceled or rescinded. The material was thereupon delivered to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Defendant, which in this litigation is represented by government attorneys-, argues that the parties in this case are presumed to have assented to- applicable federal law existing at the time they entered into their contract, which prohibited the sale of the tungsten powder and directed it to be stockpiled as material strategic and critical to the national defense and that defendant\u2019s performance of the contract with plaintiffs was therefore excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">To meet this argument, plaintiffs say that defendant is attempting to go behind the sale to show what the government did and did not do prior to refusing to take possession and title and ordering the property sold, defenses which (they say) actually have no place in this case and require no reply by them. Be that as it may, plaintiffs argue that these defenses are overcome by the law. They contend that a federal act (40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 484 et seq.) basically underlies the sale of government surplus and contract termination inventory and that \u00a7 484(d) thereof made the routine acceptance and approval of plaintiffs\u2019 bid, on which the Written award in this case was based, conclusive evidence of compliance with the law insofar as it concerns their title as purchasers. Plaintiffs further contend that the army could have taken possession, if it saw fit to do so, when it terminated the \u201cclassified\u201d contract with defendant. The contract gave the government that right and option, but not having exercised such right and option, the material became exempt and saleable free of governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">We shall now consider all acts of congress and all directives, orders and regulations, bearing upon the respective contentions of the parties.

In addition, \u00a7 487(a) authorizes the Administrator to report any excessive stocking of property to the Congress and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-17\">In this court, <em>the </em>keystone in plaintiffs\u2019 case is \u00a7 484(d), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-18\">\u201cA deed, bill of sale, lease, or other instrument executed by or on behalf of any executive agency purporting to transfer title or any other interest in <em>surplus </em>property under this sub-chapter shall be conclusive evidence of compliance with the provisions of this subehapter insofar as concerns title or other interest of any bona fide grantee or transferee for value and without notice of lack of such compliance.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-19\">When the army\u2019s New York Ordnance suspended the sale to plaintiffs, one barrel of tungsten had been delivered to them, for which they paid cash. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>never paid or tendered any part of the purchase price on the balance of tungsten which they had agreed to buy. The circumstances under which they made their bid show that they knew they were dealing with material subject to government contract cancellation, and that the terms of their bid were cash, f. o. b. defendant\u2019s plant. They were specifically informed in Haynes Stellite\u2019s letter soliciting bids that the terms of payment would, at the option of Haynes Stellite, be cashier\u2019s check, certified cheek or sight draft (which is equivalent to cash). Their bid expressly accepted these terms -of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes (1951), \u00a7 58-202 (relied upon by plaintiffs), is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\u201cProperty in specific goods passes when parties so intend. \u2014 (1) Where 'there is a contract to sell specific or ascertained goods, the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">\u201c(2) For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties, regard shall be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, usages of trade and the circumstances of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">'The circumstances above set forth indicate that the parties to the contract intended that the title to the tungsten would be transferred to plaintiffs at Kokomo, Indiana, when they paid for it. Therefore, when Laskin called the attention of defendant to the fact that General Services Administration had not approved the disposition of the property to plaintiffs, which fact required that the .sale to plaintiffs be canceled, the contract between defendant and plaintiffs was still unconsummated and no title had passed, except as to one barrel of tungsten. Inasmuch as, prior to the government\u2019s intervention, the time had not arrived when the parties to the contract intended the property in the remaining tungsten to be transferred to plaintiffs and there never was any instrument executed purporting to transfer the title, \u00a7 484(d) does not sustain plaintiffs\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">It will be noted that \u00a7 484(d) of the Government Property Act, upon which plaintiffs rely, limits its application to <em>surplus property </em>under <em>that </em>act. Having thus taken the position that they are buying surplus property, plaintiffs are unable <em>to </em>point to any action by the Administrator directing or supervising the sale of the tungsten to them, as required by \u00a7 484(a), nor can they show that this surplus property was disposed of by the Administrator or by an executive agency which the Administrator determined should so dispose of it, as provided in \u00a7 484(b). Moreover, inasmuch as \u00a7 484(f) deals with the disposal of property constituting a part of a contractor inventory, plaintiffs point to no regulation of the Administrator under which the sale herein relied upon by plaintiffs was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">The tungsten in this case was contractor inventory. By virtue of the partial payments clause of the contracts between the government and defendant, title to it was in the government. Even if title was not in the government, under termination clauses of the contracts the government had an option to take title, so that the tungsten was nevertheless \u201ccontractor inventory\u201d, and was subject to stock piling.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">The contract was unenforcible, for want of compliance with the Government Property Act. What we have said requires affirmance of the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">Because the facts in United States v. Jones, 9 Cir., 176 F.2d 278, relied upon by plaintiffs, are fundamentally different from those in the case at bar, that case, with its able opinion, is not persuasive here. Among the differences in facts are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\">(1) In the Jones case the government relied on an error made by its employees which led to the consummation of a sale of surplus property. There was no assertion of lack of authority to make the sale (p. 283) as there was here; (2) after agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ing to buy the material, Jones paid for all of it and sales memoranda were issued to him accordingly; (3) a receipt for his payment as well as bills of sale (form W.A.A. \u2014 1(a)) were mailed to Jones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">All of the items sold except a lot of universal gear joints, were delivered to Jones but the government refused to deliver the latter joints. Instead it sued to rescind the sale. The court recognized that in the Jones case \u201cthere were proper instruments acknowledging transfer of title to the purchaser\u201d. Of course the court held, at page 289, that, in view of \u00a7 25 of the Surplus Property act of 1944, 58 Stat. 780 (which is relevantly the same as \u00a7 484(d) of the General Property Act, here relied on by plaintiffs) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201c * * * <em>the very parties with whom the agencies dealt and to whom the instruments were made out, </em>should be protected if they paid value. No other condition was attached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u201cJones is in this class. He paid value, the price asked. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The Strategic Materials Act</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Equally fatal to plaintiffs\u2019 action is the Strategic Materials Act, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 98 et seq. Enacted to further the common defense of the country, this act provides for the acquisition and retention of stocks of strategic and critical materials in order to supply the industrial, military and naval needs of the country. It authorizes the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization to determine what materials are strategic and critical. This act provides that, pursuant to regulations issued by the General Services Administration, material owned or contracted for by the United States or any agency thereof, when determined by such agency to be surplus, shall be transferred to stock piles, provided that any material in contractor inventory is to be exempt from stock piling if the owning agency shall not have taken possession of such inventory. \u00a7\u00a7 98a, 98b, and 98e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Plaintiffs argue that, because regulation No. 1 was not published and because they did not learn of it, their purchase from defendant is not subject to the act itself. It is not denied by plaintiffs that regulation No. 1 was adopted. They say that it was not published. They cite no authority requiring publication. They do not charge that knowledge of the adoption of the regulation or its contents was kept from them by any act or conduct of General Services Administration or any other governmental body or officer. This regulation,, in part, listed tungsten as a strategic and critical material. This listing had. the effect of applying the Strategic Materials Act to the tungsten later bought, by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">We hold that, on the facts in this case and the applicable provisions of the Strategic Materials Act and regulation No. 1, the tungsten here involved was stock-piled as a strategic and critical material and therefore the sale of it to plaintiffs was and is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">By reply brief plaintiffs for the first time made the contention that there is no evidence in the record that the \u201cMunitions Board [sic]\u201d ever determined that tungsten was critical and in what quantities it deemed it critical. They say, in effect, that General Services Administration\u2019s so listing it, does not make it so. This matter was not discussed in either plaintiffs\u2019 main brief or the defendant\u2019s brief herein, and, as pointed out by defendant in oral argument, the introduction of this matter belatedly in the reply brief is in violation of rule 17' (e) of this court, 28 U.S.C.A. We do not, therefore, express any opinion as to that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">Conclusion as to Validity of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">The approval of General Services Administration is an integral part of the authority essential to the creation of the alleged contract upon which plaintiffs sued. Without that approval the contract does not exist any more than a three-legged stool can stand when it is built with one leg missing. We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that, under federal law, the contract between plaintiffs and defendant was unauthorized and, therefore, was and is unenforcible.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Plaintiffs urge that the facts in this case show that their property was taken for public use without due process or just compensation, relying upon amendments Y and XIV of the constitution of the United States. We do not agree with this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">For the reasons hereinbefore set forth, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-11\">.
