Jenkins was sentenced to 54 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether Jenkins\u2019 sentence is reasonable. Jenkins was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so, and the Government elected not to file a responding brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Jenkins contends his sentence is unreasonable. However, the district court appropriately treated the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, properly calculated and considered the advisory guideline range, and weighed the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). Jenkins\u2019 54-month sentence, which is no greater than the applicable guideline range and below the statutory maximum, is therefore presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (approving presumption of reasonableness accorded sentences within properly calculated guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
