California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Ortiz has filed a response. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Ortiz\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Ortiz\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
