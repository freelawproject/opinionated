(\u201cFACS\u201d) appeal from the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting trustee Christopher B. Mead\u2019s motion for authority to request a subsidiary of the debtor to schedule a shareholders\u2019 meeting. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Modanlo and creditor Michael Ahan were business partners who owned a company called Final Analysis, Inc. (\u201cFAI\u201d); FAI, in turn, wholly owned FACS. After the business relationship between Modanlo and Ahan deteriorated, Ahan, certain FACS shareholders, and FAI\u2019s Chapter 7 trustee brought a state court action against Modanlo alleging fraud and related claims. While this litigation was pending, three FAI creditors filed an involuntary petition for bankruptcy against FAI. FAI\u2019s Chapter 7 trustee then proceeded to sell certain assets of FAI, including its FACS shares. In response, Modanlo formed New York Satellite Industries, LLC (\u201cNYSI\u201d), a single-member Delaware limited liability company, which purchased FAI\u2019s assets, including FACS\u2019 shares. Thus, NYSI, under the control of Modanlo, controlled FACS by owning all of its shares of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In 2003, a jury in the state court action brought by Ahan, FACS shareholders, and FAI\u2019s trustee returned verdicts against Modanlo and in favor of FAI and FACS for several million dollars. A second jury later awarded over $100 million to Ahan for related fraud claims. While these awards were pending on appeal in state court, Modanlo filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. The primary asset of Modanlo\u2019s estate is his ownership of NYSI. In turn, the primary asset of NYSI is its ownership of FACS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under Delaware law, because Modanlo is the sole member of NYSI, his bankruptcy automatically \u201cdissolved\u201d NYSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">While Modanlo was in bankruptcy, NYSI obtained a loan from a Swiss company, Prospect Telecom AG (\u201cProspect\u201d). After NYSI defaulted on its loan, Prospect filed a replevin action in Maryland state court. As a result of this action, NYSI was forced to surrender its FACS stock certificates to Prospect.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">In November 2005, Ahan, Modanlo\u2019s principal creditor, filed a motion for appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee over Modanlo\u2019s estate, arguing that Modanlo was not managing the estate for the benefit of his creditors. The bankruptcy court granted the motion and appointed Mead trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Mead ascertained that FACS had obtained several loans at very unfavorable terms and had pledged security interests in a judgment that FACS had obtained against General Dynamics Corp. to certain lenders. As a result, Mead determined that it was necessary to take control of FACS to prevent a further deterioration of its value and, thus, the Modanlo estate\u2019s value. Mead therefore amended NYSI\u2019s LLC agreement and appointed himself, as Modanlo\u2019s trustee, as manager of NYSI. Pursuant to his appointment as manager, Mead filed a Chapter 11 petition on behalf of NYSI and commenced the NYSI bankruptcy case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mead then sought to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>FACS call a shareholders\u2019 meeting to remove Modanlo and an associate from FACS\u2019 board of directors and to have himself put on the board. FACS\u2019 secretary requested that Mead seek authorization from the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Mead then filed an emergency motion seeking authorization to request that FACS\u2019 secretary call a shareholders\u2019 meeting. Prior to a hearing on the motion, Mead executed an LLC consent agreement which purported to appoint himself, as personal representative of Modanlo, sole member of NYSI and which declared that NYSI was to continue in operation, its prior dissolution upon Modanlo\u2019s filing for bankruptcy notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The bankruptcy court granted Mead\u2019s motion for authorization to request that FACS\u2019 secretary call a shareholders\u2019 meeting, and the district court affirmed. Both courts concluded, first, that an adversary proceeding was not required under the bankruptcy code. Both courts then found that Mead could act as Modanlo\u2019s personal representative under Delaware law to revive NYSI after it was dissolved upon Modanlo\u2019s bankruptcy. Finally, both courts held inapplicable certain provisions of Delaware law which would seemingly prevent Mead\u2019s appointment as a member of NYSI and his revival of NYSI. Modanlo and FACS now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In a bankruptcy appeal, we review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision directly, applying the same standard of review as did the district court. <em>Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. v. Frushour, </em>433 F.3d 393, 398 (4th Cir.2005); <em>Schlossberg v. Barney, </em>380 F.3d 174, 178 (4th Cir.2004). Under this standard, we review legal conclusions de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>Schlossberg, </em>380 F.3d at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">We have reviewed the decision of the bankruptcy court pursuant to the standard set forth above, and we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment based substantially on the reasoning of the bankruptcy court. <em>In re Modanlo, </em>No. 05-26549-NVA, 2007 WL 2609470 (Bankr.D.Md. May 19, 2006); <em>In re New York Satellite Indus., LLC, </em>No. 06-10158-NVA, 2007 WL 2609470 (Bankr.D.Md. May 19, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us and argument would not aid the decisional process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\">. When this case was litigated below, FACS was a valuable asset because of a judgment it held against General Dynamics Corporation. However, on appeal, that judgment was vacated, rendering FACS a judgment-debtor of General Dynamics. <em>See Final Analysis Commc\u2019ns Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., </em>253 Fed.Appx. 307 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b297-15\">. Modanlo contends Mead had no authority to appoint himself as manager of NYSI and therefore that the NYSI bankruptcy filing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>invalid. This issue is being litigated separately and is not currently before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b298-21\">. We previously deferred ruling on Appellees' motion to dismiss this appeal as moot. We now deny that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
