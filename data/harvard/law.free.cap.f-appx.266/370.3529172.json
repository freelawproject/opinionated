He argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that he was not a minor participant under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b). He further argues that, as a result of the district court\u2019s error, a presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his sentence and his case must be remanded for resentencing. The district court\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Polanco-Ballesteros was not a minor participant was plausible in light of the record as a whole and, thus, not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
