Tunstalle appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in not considering the inherent inequity of the 100:1 ratio for crack offenses and powder cocaine offenses as the basis for a variance in his case, and that his sentence is consequently unreasonable. We vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">At sentencing, Tunstalle requested a variance on the ground described, but acknowledged our decision in <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 634 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that 100:1 ratio may not be used as basis for variance), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2008). The district court declined to impose a variance sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence within a correctly calculated advisory guideline range is accorded a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness on appeal. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-guidelines sentence). However, after the parties\u2019 briefs were filed, the Supreme Court decided, in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575. <em>Kimbrough </em>thus abrogated <em>Eura.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-23\">Because the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Kimbrough </em>when it determined Tunstalle\u2019s sentence, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>On remand, the amended guidelines for crack offenses, effective November 1, 2007, will apply. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-24\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-15\"> In his plea agreement, Tunstalle waived his right to appeal the reasonableness of any sentence within the guideline range. Because the government has not asserted the waiver as a bar to this appeal, we do not consider it. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
