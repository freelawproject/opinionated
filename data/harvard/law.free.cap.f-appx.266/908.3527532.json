Second, he argues that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion to re-plead his amended complaint because: (1) the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal failed to auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>matically give him an opportunity to re-plead; (2) he wanted to incorporate newly acquired state court transcripts into the complaint; and (3) he wanted clarification of the court\u2019s prior instructions regarding shotgun pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">We liberally read briefs filed <em>pro se. Finch v. City of Vernon, </em>877 F.2d 1497, 1504 (11th Cir.1989). However, even in the <em>pro se </em>setting, if an appellant fails to brief or argue an issue on appeal, he abandons any challenge regarding the issue. <em>Spaulding v. Nielsen, </em>599 F.2d 728, 730 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">The district court dismissed Abimbola\u2019s amended complaint primarily because he failed to follow the court\u2019s instructions on re-pleading, and his amended complaint constituted a shotgun pleading that did not comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8 \u2014 the same deficiencies from which his original complaint suffered. Abimbola fails to challenge this finding. Instead, he only argues that the district court should have clarified its meaning of \u201cshotgun pleading\u201d before he re-pleaded. He does not argue that the court\u2019s finding that his amended complaint was a shotgun pleading was insufficient to support dismissal of the amended complaint. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">If a party\u2019s motion to vacate would be untimely under Rule 59(e) because it came more than ten days after the judgment, then we may construe it as a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Rice v. Ford Motor Co., </em>88 F.3d 914, 918 (11th Cir.1996). We so construe Abimbola\u2019s post-judgment motion for relief in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">The district court has broad decision in ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y for the Dept. of Corr., </em>366 F.3d 1253, 1271 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cAn appeal of a ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion ... is narrow in scope, addressing only the propriety of the denial or grant of relief,\u201d and not issues regarding the underlying judgment. <em>American Bankers Ins. Co. of Fl. v. Nw. Nat. Ins. Co., </em>198 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">To the extent that Abimbola\u2019s arguments relate to the district court\u2019s underlying dismissal of his amended complaint, they are not proper grounds for review of a Rule 60(b) motion. \u201c[T]he law is clear that Rule 60(b) may not be used to challenge mistakes of law which could have been raised on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from a final order based on several different reasons, including: \u201c(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence ...; or (6) any other reason justifying relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">When a party alleges that it misunderstood a district court order as the basis for a Rule 60(b) motion, that motion is properly treated under Rule 60(b)(1) as alleging \u201cmistake.\u201d <em>Transit Cas. Co. v. Security Trust Co., </em>441 F.2d 788, 792 (5th Cir.1971). Abimbola\u2019s argument that the district court should have clarified its meaning of \u201cshotgun pleading\u201d before he re-pleaded is thus properly characterized as a \u201cmistake\u201d under Rule 60(b). The district court, however, did not abuse its discretion in denying Abimbola\u2019s Rule 60(b) argument regarding a mistake in pleading. It granted him \u201csubstantial leeway in re-pleading,\u201d and he \u201cfailed to comply with the various deadlines and instructions\u201d of the court. (R.l-12 at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">In his Rule 60(b) motion, Abimbola claims to have obtained \u201cofficial court transcripts from the state court proceedings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>and documents from the Broward Sheriffs Office that can further support the amended complaint....\u201d (R.l-11 at 3.) A party alleging newly discovered evidence as a basis for a Rule 60(b) motion must demonstrate that (1) the evidence is newly discovered since the district court\u2019s decision; (2) he exercised due diligence to discover the evidence; (3) the evidence is not cumulative or impeaching; (4) the evidence is material; and (5) the evidence would produce a new result. <em>Willard v. Fairfield Southern Co., Inc., </em>472 F.3d 817, 824 (11th Cir.2006). Even assuming, arguendo, that these documents were newly discovered, non-cumulative, and material, Abimbola failed to demonstrate that their existence would have produced a new result. <em>See id. </em>Because the district court\u2019s dismissal did not relate to his failure to include specifics from the state court transcripts in the complaint, it is unlikely that their inclusion would have affected the court\u2019s underlying decision. The district court accordingly did not abuse its discretion in denying Abimbola\u2019s Rule 60(b) argument regarding newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-12\">. We note, initially, that we have jurisdiction over the dismissal of Abimbola\u2019s amended complaint and the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion because his notice of appeal was timely regarding these decisions and it adequately referenced them. Although he filed the notice of appeal over thirty days after entry of the order dismissing his amended complaint, the district court failed to set forth that order in a separate judgment, which extended the deadline for a timely notice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
