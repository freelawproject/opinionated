Hall appeals the dismissal of the complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">This court reviews dismissals as frivolous for an abuse of discretion. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). However, a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Retroactive application of laws requiring sex-offender registration and notification do not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 103-04, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003). The district court properly dismissed Hall\u2019s ex post facto challenge as both frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Berry, </em>192 F.3d at 507. Further, because he is currently incarcerated for failure to register, Hall\u2019s constitutional challenge to the registration requirement also is an indirect challenge to his incarceration. Hall\u2019s claims are thus not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 until he proves that the incarceration has been reversed or declared invalid. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
