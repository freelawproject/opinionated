Gardner appeals his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-22\">Gardner argues that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the predicate convictions were neither admitted by him nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. As Gardner concedes, we have rejected this argument in previous decisions. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>461 F.3d 441, 452 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 616, 166 L.Ed.2d 457 (2006); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 354 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-24\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
