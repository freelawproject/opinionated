Included in the sentencing package was an order requiring appellant to pay restitution to the Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the total sum of $571,049.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">On November 10, 2005, after appellant had been released from prison, the probation officer monitoring his term of supervised release petitioned the district court to revoke his supervised release on the ground that he had failed to comply with conditions of his release, in that (1) he filed false monthly reports, (2) answered untruthfully the probation officer\u2019s inquiries, and (3) failed to make required restitution payments. The court referred the matter to a magistrate judge, who held an evidentiary hearing at which the probation officer, a deputy district court clerk, appellant and his wife testified. <em>See </em>magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d). The judge credited the testimony of the probation officer and the deputy clerk, found appellant\u2019s testimony false \u201cin all material respects,\u201d and concluded that appellant had \u201cviolated each of the three conditions of supervised release set-forth in the [petition for revocation.]\u201d. <em>Id. </em>The district court affirmed and adopted the R&amp;R, revoked appellant\u2019s supervised release, sentenced appellant to prison for three months, and imposed a new thirty-three months term of supervised release. Appellant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">Appellant asks us to set aside the court\u2019s judgment on the ground that there was no evidence that he intentionally violated the conditions of supervised release; in fact, the evidence was that he made a good faith attempt to comply with those conditions. Citing his own testimony and that of his wife, he contends that (1) it is uncontroverted that he purchased money orders to make all of his restitution payments; (2) he made additional payments when he learned that all of his money orders had not been received by the court clerk\u2019s office; and (3) he did not bring his account current merely to avoid an adverse deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>sion in his revocation proceeding. Put another way, the magistrate judge had no basis for discrediting his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">A district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994). A court may revoke a term of supervised release if it \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 n. 6 (11th Cir.1993) (quotation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Robinson, </em>893 F.2d 1244, 1245 (11th Cir.1990) (holding that in a probation revocation proceeding, \u201call that is required is that the evidence reasonably satisfy the judge that the conduct of the probationer has not been as good as required by the conditions of the probation; evidence that would establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is not required\u201d (quotation omitted)). Moreover, \u201c[a] district court\u2019s findings of fact are binding on this [CJourt unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Almand, </em>992 F.2d at 318 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The magistrate judge found appellant\u2019s testimony unworthy of belief. The evidence fully supported that finding, and the district court properly adopted it. Appellant violated the conditions of his supervised release. The judgment of the district court is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
