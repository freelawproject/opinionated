Lee contended in that petition that the Florida district court that tried and convicted him for possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction. According to Lee, his continued confinement therefore amounts to involuntary servitude in violation of his constitutional rights. The reason that he is attempting to circumvent 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is that his conviction and sentence were affirmed seven years ago, <em>see United States v. Lee, </em>208 F.3d 1306 (11th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 907, 121 S.Ct. 1232, 149 L.Ed.2d 141 (2001), and he is prevented from having his claim decided in a \u00a7 2255 motion by the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). The district court dismissed Lee\u2019s petition, adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, which concluded that Lee could not satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">Lee argues on appeal that the district court had jurisdiction to review his \u00a7 2241 petition because it was properly addressed to the warden of the prison facility in which he is incarcerated. He further maintains that his petition does not challenge the validity of his conviction or sentence and that the district court erred by failing to consider the merits of his \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">\u201cThe availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that this Court reviews <em>de novo.\u201d Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). A petitioner typically mounts a collateral attack on the validity of his federal conviction or sentence by filing a motion under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>at 1365. However, the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 permits federal prisoners to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 in some limited circumstances. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-4\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2255(e). Accordingly, a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to the savings clause if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">This Court has held that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective within the meaning of the savings clause when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-7\">(1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A05\"><em>Wofford v. Scott, 177 </em>F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). If all three of these criteria are met, \u201cthe savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">After careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Lee\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. His petition does not claim that he was convicted of a crime that a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision has made nonexistent. <em>See id. </em>at 1244. Instead, it claims that the district court that convicted Lee lacked subject matter jurisdiction, a claim that he had ample opportunity to raise at trial, on direct appeal, and in a \u00a7 2255 petition. Indeed, Lee previously contested the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction by filing a Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss the indictment and then by appealing the court\u2019s denial of that motion. Because Lee cannot satisfy the <em>Wofford </em>test, the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 does not apply and Lee cannot open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Despite his inability to satisfy the <em>Wofford </em>test, Lee argues that his petition was properly before the district court because he directed it to the warden of the prison facility in which he is incarcerated. That argument is frivolous. Our <em>Wofford </em>decision establishes that naming the proper official as the respondent is not enough. <em>See id. </em>at 1244. The prisoner must be able to open the portal to \u00a7 2241 by establishing that the savings clause applies. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-10\">. Although the district court\u2019s order also noted that Lee's petition \"actually falls within the ambit of \u00a7 2255, and is an unauthorized successive motion,\" the court\u2019s dismissal of the petition was actually based upon its conclusion that Lee failed to satisfy \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. Despite the court\u2019s statements equating Lee\u2019s petition to a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, its order ultimately adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge \"as the opinion of this Court.\u201d If the court had construed Lee\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it as successive, he would be required to obtain a certificate of appealability in order to appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). However, \"a federal prisoner who proceeds under \u00a7 2241 does not need a COA to proceed.\" <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003). Lee may, therefore, proceed before this Court without a COA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-15\">. Lee also contends that the district court improperly construed his \u00a7 2241 petition as a successive motion under \u00a7 2255. He argues that his initial \u00a7 2255 motion cannot be considered a first motion because the court had failed to give him the warnings required by <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 792, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). Having raised this issue for the first time in his reply brief, it is not properly before this Court. <em>See Lovett v. Ray, </em>327 F.3d 1181, 1183 (11th Cir.2003). In any event, we have already noted that the district court's dismissal of Lee's petition was based on his failure to satisfy the savings clause, not on the court\u2019s characterization of his petition as a \u00a7 2255 successive motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
