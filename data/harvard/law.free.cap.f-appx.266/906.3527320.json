Smith argues the district court erred in dismissing his suit under the doctrine of res judicata. For the reasons stated below, we agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">Smith, a DeKalb County Georgia jail inmate, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against M.L. Mercer, a Dekalb County police officer, and the Dekalb County Police Department. Smith claimed Mercer\u2019s actions relating to the issuance of the arrest warrant, Smith\u2019s arrest, and the failure to provide him with a timely probable cause hearing violated his constitutional rights under the 4th, 6th, 8th, and 14th Amendments. The court dismissed his suit as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A because barred by res judicata owing to a the dismissal of Smith\u2019s previous similar complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">Smith appealed on the grounds that res judicata does not bar his suit since the prior action was dismissed without prejudice. In granting Plaintiffs motion to appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the district court acknowledged that its previous dismissal on res judicata grounds was in error. The court expressed its willingness to revisit its prior decision, but noted that Plaintiffs filing of a notice of appeal deprived it of jurisdiction to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b931-17\">This court reviews dismissal of a complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for abuse of discretion. <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). The application of res judicata is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo. Norfolk Southern Corp. v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., </em>371 F.3d 1285, 1288 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-18\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b931-19\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, federal courts conduct an initial screening of complaints filed by prisoners to determine whether the claim is, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cfrivolous or malicious.\u201d The district court dismissed the instant case as frivolous because it was barred by res judicata. Plaintiff had filed a previous suit on the same or similar issues, and that case had been dismissed. The earlier case, however, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>dismissed without prejudice on the basis of <em>Younger </em>abstention during the pendency of criminal proceedings against Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The doctrine of res judicata bars a subsequent action if the following four elements are present: (1) the prior decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) there was a final judgment on the merits; (3) the parties were identical in both suits; and (4) the prior and present causes of action are the same. <em>Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">A dismissal without prejudice does not constitute a \u201cfinal judgment on the merits\u201d and thus has no res judicata effect. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1161 (11th Cir.2003). A dismissal pursuant to the <em>Younger </em>doctrine is without prejudice, and does not preclude later re-filing of the complaint. <em>See Maymo-Melendez v. Alvarez-Ramirez, </em>364 F.3d 27, 32 n. 4 (1st Cir.2004). As Plaintiffs claims were dismissed without prejudice pursuant to <em>Younger, </em>they are not barred by res judicata, and the dismissal on that basis was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the dismissal of Smith\u2019s complaint is VACATED, and the action is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
