On appeal, Crawford argues that Sections 245(a) and 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a), (i), permit him to adjust his status and that he meets the requirements of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(h) for an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), rather than the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), to consider his application for an adjustment of status. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">REGULATORY BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">\u201cThe status of an alien who was inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States ... may be adjusted by the Attorney General, in his discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe, to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). To be eligible for adjustment of status, an applicant must meet two statutory requirements: the alien must be \u201celigible to receive an immigrant visa,\u201d and an immigrant visa must be \u201cimmediately available\u201d at the time that the application for an adjustment of status is filed. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">In April 2006, we invalidated 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1(c)(8), which barred arriving aliens in removal proceedings from applying for adjustments of status. <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>445 F.3d 1311, 1319-1320 (11th Cir.2006). We found that the statute enabling the regulation was ambiguous as to whether the Attorney General could regulate the eligibility of aliens to apply for adjustments of status. <em>Id. </em>at 1321. The enabling statute, however, indicated that parolees, who qualify as arriving aliens, would be eligible to apply for adjustments of status. <em>Id. </em>We held that this intent, that aliens in removal proceedings be eligible to apply for adjustments of status, was negated by the Attorney General\u2019s regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 1322. Agreeing with the Third Circuit, we stated that \u201cwhile the statute may be ambiguous enough to allow for some regulatory eligibility standards, it does not so totally abdicate authority to the Attorney General as to allow a regulation ... that essentially reverses the eligibility structure set out by Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we stated that the Attorney General\u2019s regulation was based on an impermissible construction of the governing statute because it barred almost all paroled aliens from eligibility. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">On May 12, 2006, the Attorney General amended 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(h) to state that in the case of an arriving alien who is placed in removal proceedings, the IJ does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status unless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-15\">(A) The alien properly filed the application for adjustment of status with US-CIS while the arriving alien was in the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-16\">(B) The alien departed from and returned to the United States pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>the terms of a grant of advance parole to pursue the previously filed application for adjustment of status;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-5\">(C) The application for adjustment of status was denied by USCIS; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">(D) [The Department of Homeland Security] placed the arriving alien in removal proceedings either upon the arriving alien\u2019s return to the United States pursuant to the grant of advance parole or after USCIS denied the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(ii). We recently upheld this regulation. <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir. 2008) <em>(\u201cScheerer II </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Further, the Attorney General\u2019s amended rule is applicable to all cases pending administrative or judicial review on or after May 12, 2006, as is the case here. Eligibility of Arriving Aliens in Removal Proceedings to Apply for Adjustment of Status and Jurisdiction to Adjudicate Applications for Adjustment of Status. 71 Fed.Reg. 27,588 (May 12, 2006); <em>Scheerer II, </em>513 F.3d at 1248-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AoFL\">Crawford is a native and citizen of Jamaica who was at one point apparently a legal permanent resident of the United States. He abandoned that status when he returned to Jamaica in 1992 but was paroled into the United States some years later to pursue an adjustment of his status pursuant to an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative filed by his first spouse, a United States citizen. Crawford claims that the 1-130 petition was approved and that an immigration officer approved the adjustment of his status. He claims, however, that when he checked in on the progress of his petition, he was told that his file had been lost. At the final of several follow-up meetings, he apparently informed an immigration officer that he was no longer married to his first wife, at which point his application for an adjustment of his status was denied. He was subsequently placed in removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">On June 9, 2003, Crawford was served with a Notice to Appear, charging him under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) as being an immigrant at the time of his application for admission whose visa had been issued without compliance with the provisions of Section 203 of the INA. On February 27, 2004, Crawford\u2019s daughter, a United States citizen, filed an 1-130 petition on his behalf. At a hearing on April 29, 2004, Crawford denied that he was removable on the basis of the allegedly approved application for adjustment of his former wife. The Department of Homeland Security allowed Crawford to conditionally concede that he was removable, subject to a later determination that he had in fact been approved for an adjustment. On the basis of that admission, the IJ found Crawford removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">The petition of Crawford\u2019s daughter was approved on February 11, 2005, and on May 12, 2005, Crawford filed an application to adjust his status with the USCIS. He then appeared before an IJ for a hearing on the merits of his application wherein he asked the IJ to renew his application for an adjustment of his status on the basis of the newly filed 1-130 petition. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer argued that Crawford was not eligible to argue for an adjustment of his status because he was an arriving alien in a removal proceeding and that the 1-130 petition filed by his daughter was separate from that filed by his first wife. The IJ agreed on the basis of the bar on such applications by arriving aliens which we later held invalid and which was later amended by the Attorney General. Crawford filed a notice of appeal with the BIA. On December 11, 2006, after the Attorney General amended the relevant regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>as discussed above, Crawford, not having filed an appellate brief, asked the BIA to remand his case to the IJ for consideration of his application in light of the regulatory amendment. The BIA declined to do so, concluding that Crawford did not fit within the narrow exception that had been added to the regulation that originally barred Crawford\u2019s application. He appeals from that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">When, as here, the BIA issues its own opinion without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007). To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, we review <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial-evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-1284 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Ortega v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>416 F.3d 1348, 1350 (11th Cir.2005). Failure to raise an issue before the BIA leaves us without jurisdiction to hear the issue. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-1251 (11th Cir.2006) (finding that the petitioner failed to challenge adverse credibility finding in both his notice of appeal and his brief to the BIA). \u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Section 242(a)(2)(B)(i) of the INA \u201cprecludes appellate review of discretionary decisions, but does not preclude review of non-diseretionary legal decisions that pertain to statutory eligibility for discretionary relief.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). Further, we have jurisdiction to consider questions of law raised in petitions challenging removal orders. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">The BIA did not err in determining that Crawford is ineligible for an adjustment of status under the Attorney General\u2019s amended regulation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(h). Crawford was paroled into the United States and later placed into removal proceedings in 2003 and is, therefore, an arriving alien in removal proceedings. The IJ, and thus, the BIA, do not have jurisdiction to consider Crawford\u2019s application for an adjustment of status unless he fits within the narrow exception to the Attorney General\u2019s regulation under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(h).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Crawford does not fit within the exception because he had not been paroled into the United States to pursue the application for adjustment initiated by his daughter\u2019s 1-130 petition. Rather, he had been pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>roled in to pursue the petition for adjustment initiated by the 1-130 petition filed by his former wife, which was denied when he informed an immigration officer that he was divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Crawford alternatively argues that he was the recipient of an 1-130 petition filed before April 30, 2001, and therefore that he should have been \u201cgrandfathered-in\u201d under Section 245(i) of the INA, which provides a separate avenue for certain aliens to petition for an adjustment of status. The government responds that we lack jurisdiction to consider the argument as Crawford abandoned it by failing to raise it before the BIA. Crawford\u2019s notice of appeal to the BIA properly raises the argument. <em>See, e.g., Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250 (\u201cIn the instant case, Amaya failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in both his <em>notice of appeal </em>and brief before the BIA.\u201d) (emphasis added). Jurisdiction is therefore proper; however, the BIA did not expressly address the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The Supreme Court has explained that in cases on appeal where the BIA has not addressed a particular issue that a petitioner put before it, \u201cthe proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u201d <em>INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Calle v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2007), we found that \u201crare circumstances\u201d were present in an appeal because the issue the BIA failed to address was legal in nature and required an \u201cobjective, procedural inquiry\u201d concerning whether the petitioner specified errors of law and supported them with pertinent authority or did not. Thus, we felt comfortable deciding an issue left unresolved by the BIA in the first instance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">We feel similarly comfortable here. Although the BIA did not expressly determine whether Section 245(i) of the INA affords relief to Crawford, it did in essence decide as much. It concluded that Crawford is barred from applying to adjust his status before an IJ because he is an arriving alien in removal proceedings who does not fit within a narrow exception to the bar. We see no reason why that legal bar to his application for an adjustment of status, which the BIA applied to his claim under Section 245(a) of the INA, does not also bar his application under Section 245(i), which is simply an alternative method for aliens to seek similar relief. Although Crawford treats Section 245(i) as a separate form of relief, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii) applies to arriving aliens in removal proceedings who attempt to apply for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Finally, Crawford abandoned any argument relating to his motion to remand by failing to raise it in his initial brief. Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-7\">. In light of our affirmance of the BIA's determination that Crawford does not fit within the exception of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii), it appears that Crawford, in order to have his application for an adjustment properly considered, must file it with the USCIS, which \u201chas jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status filed by any alien, unless the immigration judge has jurisdiction to adjudicate the application under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1).\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(1). It is of note, however, that Crawford has been found removable on the basis of his conditionally offered admission of removability. Presumably the appropriate authorities will stay Crawford\u2019s removal pending the USCIS\u2019s consideration of his application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
