The district court dismissed Batiste\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 and (ii). The district court denied Batiste\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Batiste is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Batiste also moves for appointment of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-19\">Batiste\u2019s IFP motion addresses only his indigence. He does not brief any argument regarding the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint as barred by the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-20\">Batiste has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification that an appeal would not be taken in good faith was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Batiste\u2019s requests for IFP status and appointment of counsel are denied, and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Batiste is cautioned that the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit by the district court pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Batiste is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
