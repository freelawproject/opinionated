On appeal, Hinton challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of the within-guidelines sentence of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-21\">This court will affirm a sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). A sentence that falls within the properly calculated advisory guidelines range is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-24\">Hinton\u2019s sentence was driven by his designation as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007) (\u201cACCA\u201d). Hinton does not challenge this designation. Rather, he claims the district court committed procedural error by automatically applying the guidelines enhancements applicable to armed career criminals without considering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). See <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.4(b) (2006). Hinton further claims his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the enhancement of his sentence pursuant to the ACCA resulted in excessive punishment that is cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. The district court must first calculate the appropriate advisory guidelines range, making any necessary factual findings. <em>More-land, </em>437 F.3d at 432. The court should then afford the parties \u201can opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Then, the sentencing court should consider the resulting advisory guidelines range in conjunction with the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and determine whether those factors support the sentence requested by either party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">In Hinton\u2019s case, the district court correctly calculated the advisory guidelines range of 188-235 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, Hinton\u2019s counsel requested the lowest sentence possible under existing law, but made no specific argument regarding any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In imposing the low-end of the applicable guidelines range, the district court noted that it had considered the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a). This court has held that a district court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. This is particularly true when the district court imposes a sentence within the applicable guidelines range. <em>Id.; see Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468. Because the district court imposed a sentence within the guidelines range, no detailed statement of reasons was required. We find no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">We review the substantive reasonableness of Hinton\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 598. Hinton acknowledges we have repeatedly held that sentencing under the ACCA is neither disproportionate to the offense nor cruel and unusual punishment, and thus does not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Presley, </em>52 F.3d 64, 68 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Etheridge, </em>932 F.2d 318, 323 (4th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Crittendon, </em>883 F.2d 326, 331 (4th Cir.1989). We find his request for a change to existing law without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">The Supreme Court has long recognized the propriety under the Eighth Amendment of subjecting recidivists to enhanced penalties. <em>See Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 284-85, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980). \u201cSevere, mandatory penalties may be cruel, but they are not unusual in the constitutional sense, having been employed in various forms throughout our Nation\u2019s history.\u201d <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 994-95, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Accordingly, we affirm Hinton\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
