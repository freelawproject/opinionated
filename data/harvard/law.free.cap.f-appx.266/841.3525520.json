Harris contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not state that the sentence it imposed was \u201cnot greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-23\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A] sentence may be reviewed for procedural or substantive unreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). When reviewing the sentence for procedural reasonableness, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. --, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Generally, when sentencing inside the advisory guideline range, the district court is required neither to state explicitly that it has considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in open court, nor to give a lengthy explanation for its sentence. <em>See United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Rita, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 127 S.Ct. at 2468-69); <em>see also United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) provides that the district court \u201cshall impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the need for the sentence imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-12\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-13\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-14\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-15\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Other factors that the sentencing court should consider under \u00a7 3553(a) include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guidelines range, and policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-18\">Harris contends that his sentence was proeedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to state that the sentence it imposed was \u201cnot greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In deciding to sentence Harris to 188 months imprisonment, at the bottom of the guidelines range, the district court specifically stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the advisory guidelines range, and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements. The court then announced that it had \u201ctailored the sentence to take into account the facts and circumstances surrounding this particular case.\u201d The court\u2019s failure to explicitly mention the \u201cnot greater than necessary\u201d language in \u00a7 3553(a) alone does not demonstrate that the court imposed a sentence in a proeedurally unreasonable manner. <em>See Agbai, </em>497 F.3d at 1230; <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329. Harris has therefore failed to show that the sentence was not the product of reasoned decision making, and we affirm the sentence as proeedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-16\">. Harris also mentioned in his brief that his sentence was \u201csubstantively unreasonable,\u201d but provided no support for this argument. A party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must raise it \u201cplainly and prominently\u201d or the issue is deemed abandoned. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003). Since Harris makes only a passing reference to the substantive unreasonableness of his sentence, we deem the issue abandoned and will not address it here. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
