The district court construed the action both as a mandamus petition and as a suit against Warden Cain under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. It dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Parker\u2019s motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-21\">Parker asserts that he intended to name John Doe, an FBI agent, rather than Warden Cain as the sole defendant in his lawsuit. He further alleges that the district court erroneously refused to allow him to amend his complaint to add John Doe as the defendant. Parker, however, did not identify John Doe. Moreover, even if Parker had identified John Doe and added him as a defendant, Parker has not shown that mandamus relief was appropriate. <em>See In re Stone, </em>118 F.3d 1032, 1034 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-22\">Parker also asserts that the district court erred in alternatively construing his suit as a \u00a7 1983 action. Parker, however, does not challenge the district court\u2019s reason for dismissing the claim under \u00a7 1983. Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant has not appealed the issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Therefore, Parker has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-23\">Finally, Parker argues that his complaint seeks a \u201ccriminal judicial intervention\u201d and that his case is not civil in nature. Because the case is not civil in nature, he contends that the district court erred in dismissing the case under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e and \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). An individual, however, does not have a constitutional right to have another person criminally prosecuted. <em>Oliver v. Collins, </em>914 F.2d 56, 60 (5th Cir.1990). Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>FBI\u2019s decision to investigate a complaint is a discretionary rather than mandatory action. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 535(a). Therefore, the district court does not have authority to institute a FBI investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Parker has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Parker\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Parker\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Parker accumulated another strike in <em>Parker v. Tarver, </em>No. 3:06-CV-00298 (M.D.La. Aug. 16, 2006). As Parker now has accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
