Counsel filed an <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) brief and raised the issue of whether Torres\u2019 sentence was erroneous. Torres was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. The Government declined to file a reply brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-22\">As recently determined by the Supreme Court, \u201c[r]egardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Appellate courts remain charged with reviewing sentences for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 597. Reasonableness review requires appellate consideration of both the procedural and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>stantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In determining whether a sentence is procedurally reasonable, this court first assesses whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 596-97. This court must then consider whether the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) factors, selected a sentence based on \u201cclearly erroneous facts,\u201d or failed to sufficiently explain the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597; <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). Finally, this court reviews the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctaking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). This court affords sentences that fall within the properly calculated Guidelines range a presumption of reasonableness, a presumption permitted by the Supreme Court. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Our review of the record reveals that the Guidelines range was properly calculated, and therefore the one-month sentence imposed by the district court on the false statement count is afforded a presumption of reasonableness. The district court was obligated by statute to impose the consecutive 24-month sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1028A (West Supp. 2007). After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the twenty-five month total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Torres\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
