Boysaw appealed his convictions and sentence, challenging, <em>inter alia, </em>his armed career criminal classification on the grounds that the predicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>convictions should not have been considered due to their age and that the district court violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by enhancing his sentence with convictions that were neither charged in the indictment nor admitted by him and by sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines system. Although this court held that \u201c[t]he district court properly determined that Boysaw qualified as an armed career criminal\u201d and that there was no Sixth Amendment error in the district court\u2019s reliance on the prior convictions, we concluded that the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error by sentencing Boysaw under a mandatory guidelines scheme, vacated Boysaw\u2019s sentence, and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Boysaw, </em>198 Fed.Appx. 321, 324-26 (4th Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cBoysaw </em>I\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 521, 169 L.Ed.2d 363 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">On remand for resentencing, Boysaw renewed his objections to the armed career criminal designation, asserting that he was convicted of simple possession of cocaine. Boysaw also contended that the district court did not follow <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), in determining that his prior convictions qualified as serious drug offenses for purposes of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), because the court did not require the government to provide certified copies of the state court judgments. The district court overruled Boysaw\u2019s objections, departed below the advisory sentencing guideline range of 188 to 235 months of imprisonment, and sentenced Boysaw to 180 months in prison, the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. Boysaw appeals the 180-month sentence imposed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In this appeal, Boysaw challenges his armed career criminal designation on the ground that the court relied on information not approved by <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Shepard. </em>The Government asserts that Boysaw\u2019s claim is foreclosed by the decision in <em>Boy-saw I. </em>We agree with the Government. In <em>Boysaw I, </em>we held that the district court properly designated Boysaw as an armed career criminal. Thus, we find that Boysaw\u2019s claim is barred by the law-of-the-case doctrine and that none of the exceptions applies. <em>See United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999) (discussing doctrine and exceptions thereto); <em>see also Volvo Trademark Holding Aktiebolaget v. Clark Machinery Co., </em>510 F.3d 474, 481 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201c[A] remand proceeding is not the occasion for raising new arguments or legal theories.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993) (stating that mandate rule \u201cforecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court,\u201d as well as \u201cissues decided by the district court but foregone on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Boysaw\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
