Olis, </em>429 F.3d 540, 545 (5th Cir.2005). Bakas argues that the district court erred in assigning him a criminal history score based on three offenses that did not occur until after the counterfeiting offense to which he pleaded guilty. Bakas\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lara, </em>975 F.2d 1120, 1129 (5th Cir.1992). The controlling sequence of events is not the order in which the crimes are committed but the order in which the sentences are imposed. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1). Bakas also argues that the district court\u2019s assessment of a criminal history score violates the goals of the Sentencing Guidelines. However, he does not support his conclusional argument with a citation to any persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
