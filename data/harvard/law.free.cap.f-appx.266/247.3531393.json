Surratt\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether Surratt\u2019s sentence violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. Surratt has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-23\">During the pendency of this appeal, Surratt has been discharged from federal custody. Moreover, his sentence did not include a term of supervised release, and there are no continuing collateral consequences from the district court\u2019s judgment on revocation of supervised release. Accordingly, the appeal is moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 10, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and found no meritorious issues for appeal. We there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>fore dismiss Surratt\u2019s appeal as moot. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition to the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
