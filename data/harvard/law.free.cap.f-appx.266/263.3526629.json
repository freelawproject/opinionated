Powell qualified as a career offender by having had two prior Maryland state felony convictions \u201cof a controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3). A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is a federal or state offense, punishable by more than one year imprisonment, that \u201cprohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or <em>the possession of a controlled substance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>... <em>with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) (emphasis added). Thus, we have held that a conviction for mere possession of controlled substances does not qualify as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1 because it is not accompanied by the intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense, as required by the language of \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See United States v. Neal, </em>27 F.3d 90, 92 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In March 2005, some four years after Powell\u2019s judgment of conviction, Powell\u2019s counsel discovered that because of a clerical error in the state court, one of Powell\u2019s predicate offenses did not qualify as \u201ca controlled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3). Counsel was reviewing the guilty pleas and sentencing transcripts from Powell\u2019s 1989 state drug conviction and discovered that due to a clerical error, the state court\u2019s docket entry for Powell\u2019s 1989 drug conviction was incorrect. Although Powell had entered a guilty plea to Count 3 of his 1989 indictment, charging conspiracy to <em>possess </em>a controlled dangerous substance, the state court\u2019s docket entry erroneously recorded that Powell was convicted of Count 4 of his indictment, charging conspiracy to violate the controlled dangerous substance laws, a broader offense. As a result of the error, Powell was improperly sentenced as a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines because he did not have two qualifying predicate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In the then pending proceeding before the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Powell\u2019s counsel filed a \u201cSupplement\u201d to his \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that on the basis of the clerical error, Powell was improperly sentenced as a career offender. While that motion was pending, Powell\u2019s counsel filed a parallel motion in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, where the conviction had been recorded, to correct the erroneous docket entry for his 1989 state conviction, and the state court granted Powell\u2019s motion on June 10, 2005, showing that he pleaded guilty to Count 3, not to Count 4 as had been recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The government agrees that the actual state court offense to which Powell pleaded guilty was not a qualifying offense and that Powell in fact did not qualify to be sentenced as a career offender. The government contends, however, that Powell is too late in seeking to correct the error now because of the one-year statute of limitations included in \u00a7 2255. Thus, it maintains that Powell must serve his 360-month sentence even though it agrees he could not legally have been sentenced to that time. The legal sentence, it agrees, would have been one between 188 to 235 months, which is more than 10 years shorter than the sentence he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The district court denied Powell\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence, finding it to be time-barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s statute of limitations, and Powell filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">It is no doubt true that the important interest of finality in judicial proceedings requires that judicial and substantive errors in cases be laid to rest after specified time periods. Thus, even though \u00a7 2255 authorizes motions to attack sentences on the grounds that they were imposed (1) in violation of the Constitution, (2) in violation of federal laws, (3) without jurisdiction, (4) in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or (5) as otherwise subject to collateral attack, the provision requires that any such motion be filed within <em>one year </em>after the judgment of conviction becomes final or after other dates specified in \u00a7 2255, which are not governing here. The same policy of finality is also manifested in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a), which authorizes a court to correct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>sentence within <em>seven days </em>after it is entered for \u201carithmetical, technical, or other clear error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">But when an error is purely a \u201cclerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record,\u201d the policy of finality is trumped and a court is authorized to correct the error <em>at any time. See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 36. Such an error, however, may not be a judicial or substantive error but must be purely clerical. The errors most commonly subject to correction under Rule 36 are thus recording or scrivener\u2019s errors that make a difference. <em>See generally </em>3 Charles Alan Wright, Nancy J. King &amp; Susan R. Klein, Sarah N. Welling, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 611 (3d ed.2004). Thus, Rule 36 has been employed to amend a judgment to include an obviously omitted forfeiture order, <em>see United States v. Yeje-Cabrera, </em>430 F.3d 1, 13-16 (1st Cir.2005); or to correct a judgment that erroneously cited the controlling statute, <em>see United States v. Chapman, </em>345 F.3d 630, 637 (8th Cir.2003); or to correct the amount of a restitution ordered by the court, <em>see United States v. Ervasti, </em>201 F.3d 1029 (8th Cir.2000); or to correct a judgment to refer to a lesser included offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty, rather than to the charge contained in the indictment, <em>see United States v. Blackwell, </em>515 F.2d 125,127 (4th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In this case, the error was much like that in <em>Blackwell </em>where the clerk recorded the wrong offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty. Powell pleaded guilty in state court to Count 3, which charged him with conspiracy <em>to possess </em>a controlled dangerous substance, and not to Count 4, but the clerk erroneously recorded him as pleading guilty to Count 4. Accordingly, Powell\u2019s sentence in federal court, imposed on the basis of the state court clerk\u2019s recording error, was over 10 years longer than it otherwise would have been. While the clerical error was not made by employees of the federal court, it nonetheless became part of the federal court\u2019s record for purposes of sentencing in this case. As the state court has now corrected the clerical error, we too will order a correction of the same error in the federal court record.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court to correct the error in reporting Powell\u2019s predicate offenses under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36 and then to resentence him in accordance with the corrected record.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
