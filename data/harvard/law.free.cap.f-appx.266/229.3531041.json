Moore\u2019s advisory guideline range with respect to Counts One, Two, Four, and Five, was 46-57 months, reflecting an offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of I. Moore also was subject to a consecutive five-year sentence on Count Three. The district court concluded that the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) warranted a sentence below the advisory guideline range. The court imposed concurrent sentences of thirty-six months on Counts One, Two, Four, and Five, to be followed by sixty months on Count Three, for an aggregate sentence of ninety-six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Moore now appeals. Her attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that the sentence is unreasonable but stating that there are no meritorious issues for review. Moore has filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting that counsel was ineffective. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">We review a sentence imposed after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to determine whether it is \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range\u201d and reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). Here, Moore\u2019s sentence was statutorily authorized. Reasonableness review requires us to consider whether the chosen sentence constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007). In making this decision, we first examine the sentence \u201cfor significant procedural errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There were no such errors in this case; we note that the sentencing court: correctly calculated the advisory guideline range; heard from the parties regarding an appropriate sentence; considered the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007); and articulated compelling reasons <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for imposing a variance sentence. <em>Id.; see Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Our reasonableness review also requires us to consider the substance of the sentence taking into account \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d- <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. We conclude that the variance sentence, which falls roughly twenty percent below the lowest end of the advisory guideline range, was also substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">Moore\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not cognizable on direct appeal because ineffectiveness does not conclusively appear on the face of the record. Moore should raise the claim, if at all, in a motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ments of <em>Anders, </em>and we find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\"> The district court measured the nature and seriousness of the crimes against Moore\u2019s \u2018\u2018horrific background and history of psychiatric care and suicide attempts, in combination with a crack addiction.\" These factors, the court found, placed her in a different position than many defendants who appear before the court for sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
