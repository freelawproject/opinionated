He appeals the concurrent 27-month sentences imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Hernandez argues that the district court clearly erred in determining that he was not a minor participant, given that his only activity in the offense was to drive a vehicle across the Mexican border into the United States. Hernandez argues that there were other people involved in the offense with a higher degree of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Deavours, </em>219 F.3d 400, 404 (5th Cir.2000). To be eligible for a minor role adjustment, a defendant \u201cmust have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 447 (5th Cir.2001). In light of Hernandez\u2019s actual involvement in importing and possessing a distributable quantity of marijuana, the district court did not clearly err in denying an adjustment for a minor role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Atando, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 712-13 (5th Cir.1989). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
