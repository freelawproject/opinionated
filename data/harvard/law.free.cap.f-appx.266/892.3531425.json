He contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for modification of sentence because the November 1, 2000, amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, specifically Amendments 599 and 600, retroactively apply to bar sentence enhancements he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-29\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to grant a sentence reduction under 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). The law-of-the-case doctrine provides that \u201can issue decided at one stage of a case is binding at later stages of the same case.\u201d <em>United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir.1997). Under the doctrine, a \u201clegal decision made at one stage of the litigation, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal when the opportunity existed, becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation, and the parties are deemed to have waived the right to challenge that decision at a later time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We may deviate from the law-of-the-case doctrine when: (1) a subsequent trial involves substantially different evidence, (2) controlling law has been changed by an intervening decision that is binding precedent, or (3) the decision was clearly erroneous and a manifest injustice would result from not changing it. <em>Id. </em>at 1561.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Lee\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on the same arguments he unsuccessfully made in an earlier \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in this same underlying criminal case. The district court denied Lee\u2019s first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on December 21, 2004, and Lee never filed an appeal from that denial. He has not presented any new evidence, identified a new legal decision, or persuaded us that the district court\u2019s decision on his earlier motion was clearly erroneous and resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>See Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d at 1560.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Alternatively, Lee\u2019s motion lacked merit anyway. Amendment 600, as the district court noted, is not retroactively applicable. <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907-08 (11th Cir.2003); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a) &amp; (c). Lee argues that Amendment 599, which is retroactive, makes a difference because it would preclude him from receiving the four-level increase in offense level for using or possessing a firearm in connection with his felony offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). However, that enhancement was not applied to calculate Lee\u2019s offense level anyway, because he was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the application of which Lee does not challenge. In this situation, because \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) had no effect Amendment 599 is not implicated. <em>See Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Lee\u2019s argument that he should win because the government and probation officer failed to comply with the district court\u2019s briefing deadline is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
