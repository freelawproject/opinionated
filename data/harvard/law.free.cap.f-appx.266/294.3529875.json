Stoyanov and Yuri J. Stoyanov appeal the district court\u2019s orders dismissing their claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2000), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 to 634 (2000), and the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302 (2000). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Stoyanov v. Winter, </em>No. 1:05-cv-01567RDB (D. Md. July 25, 2006; 2007 WL 2359771, Aug. 15, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
