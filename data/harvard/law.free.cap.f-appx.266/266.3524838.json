Dewer appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in declining to consider the disparity in sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses and the pending guideline amendment intended to reduce the disparity as grounds for a variance below the guideline range. For the reasons explained below, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">At the time Dewer was sentenced, our circuit precedent did not permit the sentencing court to impose a variance sentence based on the disparity in sentences prescribed under the guidelines for crack and powder cocaine offenses. <em>See United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 634 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that 100:1 ratio could not be basis for variance), <em>vacated, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2008). Since the parties\u2019 briefs were filed, the Supreme Court decided, in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the erack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575. <em>Kimbrough </em>thus abrogated <em>Eura.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-22\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence within a correctly calculated advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-guidelines sentence). However, in deciding not to vary below the guideline range in this case, the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough. </em>To give the district court an opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>we conclude that resentencing is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>On remand, the amended guidelines for crack offenses, effective November 1, 2007, will be applicable. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
