After granting Smith\u2019s motion for a downward departure, the district court sentenced him to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the advisory guidelines range. Smith appeals his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>We review the sentence to determine whether it is reasonable, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 590, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We find that the district court properly applied the advisory guidelines and considered the relevant sentencing factors before imposing the 41-month sentence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). Additionally, we find that the sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness accorded within-guidelines sentence). Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
