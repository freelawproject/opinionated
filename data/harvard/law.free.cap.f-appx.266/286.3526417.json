We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s order and conclude the Board did not abuse its discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.2(a) (2007); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Nibagwire v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 153, 156 (4th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>Wang v. Mukasey, </em>No. A77-977-545 (B.I.A. June 14, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
