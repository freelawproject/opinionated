Williams asserts the district court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions, and also appeals the amount of sanctions. The district court did not abuse its discretion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Williams asserts the district court erred by imposing Rule 11 sanctions on him because there was \u201cabsolutely no violation of the Rule,\u201d and thus, there was no justification for imposing sanctions. Further, Williams asserts the Firm did not contend \u2014 and the district court did not find\u2014 that the claims brought by him in his complaint were frivolous, unreasonable, without foundation, or brought in bad faith. He asserts the district court did not conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, and the court\u2019s order did not provide any specific grounds for sanctions. Finally, he contends he was denied a hearing because of an \u201cinadvertent default,\u201d and there was \u201cno testimony nor proof taken of any violation of Rule 11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">We review a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions under Rule 11 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Riccard v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>307 F.3d 1277, 1294 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination, or bases an award upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>ACLU of Ga. v. Barnes, </em>168 F.3d 423, 427 (11th Cir.1999) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">Rule 11 sanctions are warranted when a party files an action that: (1) has no reasonable factual basis; (2) has no reasonable chance of success based on the legal theory used, or that cannot be advanced as a reasonable basis to change existing law; or (3) is filed in bad faith for an improper purpose. <em>Anderson v. Smithfield Foods, Inc., </em>353 F.3d 912, 915 (11th Cir.2003). In determining whether to impose sanctions, the district court determines \u201cwhether the party\u2019s claims are objectively frivolous \u2014 in view of the facts or law \u2014 and then, if they are, whether the person who signed the pleadings should have been aware that they were frivolous; that is, whether he would have been aware had he made a reasonable inquiry.\u201d <em>Worldwide Pri</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number><em>mates, Inc. v. McGreal, </em>87 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing sanctions because the claims that Williams asserted had no reasonable factual or legal basis. <em>See Anderson, </em>353 F.3d at 915. On remand, the magistrate judge examined each of Williams\u2019 claims and found that none of the claims was legally tenable, and Williams would have discovered this if he had conducted any research at all. The magistrate judge separated out the three types of claims that Williams alleged \u2014 state tort claims, state criminal claims, and federal claims \u2014 and considered each separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Regarding the state tort claims, the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding these claims were precluded by Florida\u2019s litigation privilege, which afforded absolute immunity to the Firm for the acts that it took during the deposition because they occurred during a judicial proceeding and were related to the proceeding. <em>See Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., </em>372 F.3d 1250, 1274-75 (11th Cir.2004) (finding the litigation privilege applied to actions taken in the course of settlement negotiations because they were \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the ongoing litigation, and stating, \u201cFlorida\u2019s litigation privilege affords absolute immunity for acts occurring during the course of judicial proceedings\u201d). Regarding the state law criminal claims, the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in finding the Firm did not impermissibly intercept any oral communication because Williams\u2019 statements were not made under circumstances justifying an expectation of privacy. <em>See Stevenson v. State, </em>667 So.2d 410, 412 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996) (finding that men conversing in a public parking lot did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, and factors used to determine whether an expectation of privacy is justified include the location where the communication occurred, the manner in which it was made, and the kind of communication at issue). Finally, the magistrate judge considered the federal civil rights claims, and did not abuse his discretion in finding that Williams\u2019 claims were based upon the same set of facts as the unviable state law criminal claims, and there was no evidence to support the notion that the Firm could be deemed a state actor or that there was state coercion involved. The magistrate judge also did not abuse his discretion in determining Williams could not present a conspiracy claim because he did not allege any agreement among the defendants to violate his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Under these circumstances, Williams should have been aware his claims were frivolous because a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d would have revealed this. <em>See Worldwide Primates, 87 </em>F.3d at 1254. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion because it determined that: (1) Williams\u2019 claims were objectively frivolous in view of the facts and the law; and (2) Williams should have been aware that his claims were frivolous because a reasonable inquiry would have alerted him of this. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Contrary to Williams\u2019 assertions, the district court stated it had conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, as well as Williams\u2019 objections and the record as a whole, and on remand, the magistrate judge provided \u2014 and the district court ratified and supplemented\u2014 very detailed and specific grounds for imposing sanctions in this case. Finally, despite Williams\u2019 contention he should have been provided with a hearing on the issue of sanctions, he was provided with a hearing, but he did not attend it. Further, there were no contradictory factual issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>regarding the conduct of the parties on which the sanctions were based, and the district court did not err in relying on the Firm\u2019s affidavits and billing records. <em>See Mesa Petroleum Comp. v. Coniglio, </em>629 F.2d 1022, 1080 (5th Cir.1980) (finding no error when a district court used affidavits as a basis for determining reasonable attorneys fees).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Next, Williams contends the district court abused its discretion by awarding a \u201cgrossly excessive amount\u201d of sanctions to the Firm, despite the fact there were no Rule 11 violations found. He further alleges the Firm did not support its motion for sanctions, and it was not entitled to sanctions simply because it prevailed on its motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The sanctions that a district court chooses to impose can include \u201cpart or all of the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses directly resulting from the violation.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c)(2). \u201c[T]he starting point in any determination for an objective estimate of the value of a lawyer\u2019s services is to multiply hours reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Norman v. Housing Auth. of Montgomery, </em>836 F.2d 1292, 1299 (11th Cir.1988). Although the district court enjoys wide discretion in determining a reasonable fee, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s order on attorney\u2019s fees must allow meaningful review \u2014 the district court must articulate the decisions it made, give principled reasons for those decisions, and show its calculation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">The magistrate judge conducted a \u201cmeaningful review\u201d during his first review of the Rule 11 motion, which he then incorporated into his R&amp;R on remand, concluding that attorney\u2019s fees in the Southern and Middle Districts of Florida typically range from $225-$300 per hour, and in accordance with this range, $160 per hour for one attorney and $140 per hour for a second attorney were reasonable. Further, the magistrate judge determined both attorneys used by the Firm had the \u201cexperience and background\u201d to support their respective hourly rates. Regarding the amount of hours expended, the magistrate judge stated he had conducted a careful review of the Firm\u2019s time entries, and the number of hours expended was reasonable because the Firm was \u201cforced to defend itself and brief the Court on the complex issues that arose from the filing of the action,\u201d and those issues \u201cnecessitated extensive research and writing.\u201d Moreover, Williams did not submit expert affidavits or other evidence to challenge the amount of hours expended, or the hourly rate charged. Accordingly, because the magistrate judge articulated the decisions that he made, gave principled reasons for those decisions, and showed his calculation, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See Norman, </em>836 F.2d at 1299,1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding reasonable sanctions to the Firm. Williams\u2019 claims were objectively frivolous in view of the facts and the law, and a reasonable inquiry would have informed him that his claims were frivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>lous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-10\">. In his complaint, Williams alleged that oral statements he made at a scheduled deposition were covertly recorded by the Firm and then used in a motion to compel his deposition and to obtain sanctions against him, which Judge Carney granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 </em>F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b925-18\">. We do not address the remainder of issues Williams argues on appeal \u2014 namely, that he did not have an expectation of privacy in the statements that he made, and the Firm was protected by Florida's litigation privilege\u2014 because those issues were decided in Williams\u2019 earlier appeal to this court and our earlier decision is the law of the case. <em>See Flint Elec. Membership Corp. v. Whitworth, </em>68 F.3d 1309, 1312 (11th Cir.1995). Because Williams has not presented new and substantially different evidence, contrary controlling authority has not been rendered, and the earlier ruling was not clearly erroneous, we will not consider these issues again. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
