On appeal, Lopez maintains that (1) the district court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims, as the court erred by applying \u00a7 1983\u2019s two-year statute of limitation instead of \u00a7 1350\u2019s ten-year statute of limitation; and (2) the plain language of Article 36 of the VCCR creates an individual right to consular communications, which is enforceable through a private cause of action under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). <em>Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1279 (11th Cir.2001). A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Fla. Ass\u2019n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Health and Rehab. Servs., </em>225 F.3d 1208, 1216 (11th Cir.2000). Additionally, we review questions concerning the application of a statute of limitations <em>de novo. Harrison v. Digital Health Plan, </em>183 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, holding them to a less stringent standard than attorney-drafted pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). If a district court does not address an argument, we can remand the issue for the district court to consider in the first instance. <em>See Bartholomew v. AGL Resources, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 1333, 1342 n. 6 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">In his complaint, Lopez alleged that he suffered substantial harm because the defendants failed to notify the Columbian Consulate of his arrest, in violation of his rights under Article 36 of the VCCR. (Compl. 6) Article 36 of the VCCR states that signatory States shall inform an alien\u2019s consulate when he is arrested or imprisoned, and the arresting State shall inform the alien of his right to consulate contact. Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, art. 36(l)(b), Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77,101, T.I.A.S. No. 6820. We, like most of our sister circuits, have not squarely addressed whether Article 36 grants individual rights, enforceable under \u00a7 1983 or \u00a7 1350, though we have suggested that it does not. See <em>e.g., Maharaj v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>432 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[0]ur precedent ... supports the idea that the Vienna Convention does not confer judicially enforceable <em>individual rights.\u201d </em>(emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">The district court dismissed Lopez\u2019s complaint <em>sua sponte, </em>finding that Lopez \u201chas no \u2018judicially enforceable\u2019 right to consular assistance under the VCCR\u201d and that even if he had such a right, the allegations in his complaint were too speculative to state a claim. (D. Ct. Order and Op. 5, 2007 WL 2080307 (July 12, 2007)) In so finding, the district court only discussed the requirements for stating a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In Lopez\u2019s motion for reconsideration, he argued that the district court \u201cshould conclude that Lopez can proceed with his civil action pursuant to 42 \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>\u00a7 1350 for damages.\u201d (Mot. for Recons. 3) The district court denied Lopez\u2019s motion, again finding that \u201cPlaintiff does not have, in this Circuit, an individually enforceable right to consular assistance under the VCCR,\u201d but even assuming he did, he would not be entitled to relief because his complaint did not reveal any actionable harm and any such claim would be time-barred based on Georgia\u2019s two-year statute of limitations clause for \u00a7 1983 actions. (D. Ct. Order 4-5 (Sept. 20, 2007)) Once again, the district court did not consider Lopez\u2019s cause of action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We agree with the district court that even if we assume that Article 36 does grant individual rights enforceable under \u00a7 1983, any such claim would be time-barred by Georgia\u2019s two year statute of limitations. <em>Uboh v. Reno, </em>141 F.3d 1000, 1002 (11th Cir.1998) (Georgia\u2019s two-year personal injury statute of limitations applies to actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983). Thus, the district court did not err in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing Lopez\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The district court did, however, abuse its discretion in failing to consider Lopez\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1350. Section 1350 states that district courts have jurisdiction to hear actions brought by aliens for torts committed in violation of treaties, and we have held that the Act has a ten-year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350; <em>Cabello v. Femandez-Larios, </em>402 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 1350 is jurisdictional, but it recognizes that there is a set of common law norms that may be enforced through the grant of jurisdiction. <em>Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 729, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Neither the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>order dismissing Lopez\u2019s complaint, nor its order denying his motion to reconsider, addressed whether, liberally construed, the complaint asserted an action under \u00a7 1350, or if \u00a7 1350\u2019s ten-year statute of limitations should have been applied. Because the district court did not consider Lopez\u2019s argument in his motion for reconsideration that he had raised a \u00a7 1350 claim, we remand this case for the district court to address in the first instance whether Lopez\u2019s complaint actually raised a \u00a7 1350 claim, and, assuming that it did, whether the claim could survive \u00a7 1915A review. Accordingly, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
