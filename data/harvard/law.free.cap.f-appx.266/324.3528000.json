Chavez-Sifuentes argues that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because his prior Texas conviction for aggravated assault is not a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. He contends that the Texas crime of aggravated assault has a broader definition than most other definitions of aggravated assault because it may be committed by threatening the victim with a weapon. The Texas statute, Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.02, is substantially similar to the definition of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under the Model Penal Code and thus qualifies as the enumerated offense of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 418, 169 L.Ed.2d 293 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-24\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>(2000), Chavez-Sifuentes challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 </em>U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pinedas-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
