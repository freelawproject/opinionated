Smith appeals the district court\u2019s order finding a change of beneficiary form ineffective and granting judgment for Sandra Tinsley in this civil action. We have reviewed the record, including the trial, and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Sun Life Assurance Co. v. Tinsley, </em>No. 6:06-cv-00010-NKM, 2007 WL 1052485 (W.D.Va. Apr. 4, 2007). To the extent Smith alleges the district court was biased against him, he has failed to show grounds for relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144, 455 (2000); <em>Sine v. Local No. 992 Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>882 F.2d 913, 914-15 (4th Cir.1989) (giving standard for affidavit of recusal); <em>Shaw v. Martin, </em>733 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1984) (providing basis for recusal on grounds of prejudice and bias). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
