The district court denied Thompson\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Thompson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-28\">Thompson asserts that he is indigent, although indigence was not an issue in the district court\u2019s denial of his IFP motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Thompson also asserts that his complaint is not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because his claim rests on \u201cstrictly jurisdictional grounds.\u201d Thompson has not alleged or demonstrated that the sentence for which he is currently incarcerated has been reversed, declared invalid, or called into question. <em>See id. </em>His bare assertion that his claim is \u201cstrictly jurisdictional,\u201d without citation to authority or argument, is not adequately briefed. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Thompson has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint pursuant to <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Thompson has not briefed a challenge to the district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants enjoy immunity. Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">Thompson has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Thompson\u2019s request for leave to appeal IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Thompson is cautioned that the dismissal of his suit by the district court pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Thompson is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
