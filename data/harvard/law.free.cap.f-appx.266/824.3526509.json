On appeal, Jacques argues that (1) the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction, (2) the district court abused its discretion in admitting hearsay that violated Jacques\u2019s right to confrontation, (3) the district court abused its discretion in denying Jacques\u2019s requested jury instruction on reasonable doubt and lack of evidence, (4) the district court abused its discretion in denying Jacques\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis that a juror considered extrinsic evidence, and (5) the district court violated Jacques\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when it increased his sentencing range based on his status as a career offender, where his prior convictions were not alleged in the indictment or decided by a jury. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">On April 4, 2006, Jacques was arrested in a room at the Harbor Inn Motel in Stuart, Florida. Investigating officers testified that as Jacques walked from his vehicle to the motel room, he carried an object with a protruding handle covered by a white towel. A few seconds after Jacques entered the room, officers who had been waiting in the bathroom detained Jacques. When Jacques was arrested he was standing within inches of a cooking pot that, according to the investigating officers\u2019 testimony, had not been in the room before Jacques\u2019s arrival and contained 31.6 grams of crack cocaine. Jacques testified as the sole witness in his defense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">\n<em>1. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">\u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>whether there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>318 F.3d 1030, 1036 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). We will affirm the jury\u2019s verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>\u201cif a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). On review, we view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal according to the same standard. <em>United States v. Descent, </em>292 F.3d 703, 706 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The elements that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the government in order to establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) are that the defendant: (1) knowingly and intentionally (2) possessed a controlled substance (3) with intent to distribute it. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); <em>see also United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1391 (11th Cir.1989) (per curiam). All three elements can be proven by direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Poole, </em>878 F.2d at 1391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Viewing the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the government, a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Jacques knowingly possessed cocaine base with the intent to distribute it. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in denying Jacques\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">\n<em>2. Hearsay and the Confrontation Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">\u2018We review a district court\u2019s hearsay ruling for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1359 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1149, 166 L.Ed.2d 998 (2007). \u201cAn erroneous evidentiary ruling will result in reversal only if the resulting error was not harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Hands, </em>184 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.1999) (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a)). \u201cAn error is harmless unless there is a reasonable likelihood that [it] affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We review de novo whether a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated. <em>United States v. Yates, </em>438 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d is inadmissible hearsay. Fed.R.Evid. 801(c), 802. Statements to officers generally, however, may be admitted as non-hearsay for the limited purpose of explaining the background of the officers\u2019 actions if the admission of such statements is not overly prejudicial. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1209 n. 17 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">The Sixth Amendment provides, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. \u201c[I]f hearsay is \u2018testimonial,\u2019 ... the Confrontation Clause prohibits its admission at trial unless (1) the declarant is unavailable, and (2) and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant\u201d. <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1203 (citation and footnote omitted). Non-hearsay aspects of out-of-court statements do not raise Confrontation Clause concerns. <em>See Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 2081-82, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985) (holding that admission of non-hearsay aspects of a confession, to prove what happened when an individual confessed, did not raise Confrontation Clause concerns); <em>United States v. Peaden, </em>727 F.2d 1493, 1500 n. 11 (11th Cir.1984) (noting that the principles underlying the Confrontation Clause are not implicated by statements admitted for their non-hearsay value). In <em>Peaden, </em>we fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>ther noted that \u201c[t]he value of a statement offered for nonhearsay purposes lies in its being said rather than in its content. The only person the defendant needs to cross-examine, therefore, is the person who heard it, and is testifying to its utterance from personal knowledge.\u201d <em>Peaden, </em>727 F.2d at 1500 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Jacques challenges testimony at trial by government agents concerning what they learned from a cooperating source who was not available to testify. The testimony was non-hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Furthermore, because the testimony was offered for a non-hearsay purpose, the Confrontation Clause was not implicated. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged testimony, and that such testimony did not violate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">\n<em>3. Requested Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">We review the district court\u2019s refusal to use a proposed jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dean, </em>487 F.3d 840, 847 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 25, 2007) (No. 07-553). For the denial of a requested jury instruction to be reversible error a defendant must show that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-7\">(1) the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law, (2) its subject matter was not substantially covered by other instructions, and (3) its subject matter dealt with an issue in the trial court that was so important that failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-8\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In deciding whether a defendant\u2019s requested instruction was substantially covered by the actual charge delivered to the jury, we \u201cneed only ascertain whether the charge, when viewed as a whole, fairly and correctly states the issues and the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>975 F.2d 1514, 1517 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">The record shows that the subject matter of Jacques\u2019s requested instruction was substantially covered by the court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt and by the court\u2019s instruction that the jury consider all of the evidence in the case. Furthermore, the failure to give the requested instruction did not seriously impair Jacques\u2019s ability to defend himself because the court allowed Jacques to argue the lack of evidence to the jury. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to give Jacques\u2019s requested jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">\n<em>I. Motion for New Trial and Extrinsic Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial based on the jury\u2019s exposure to extrinsic evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rondo, </em>455 F.3d 1273, 1296 n. 33 (11th Cir.2006), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1327, 167 L.Ed.2d 86 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">The government has the burden of establishing a defendant\u2019s guilt \u201csolely on the basis of evidence produced in the courtroom and under circumstances assuring the accused all the safeguards of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Farese v. United States, </em>428 F.2d 178, 179 (5th Cir.1970). This theory \u201cgoes to the fundamental integrity of all that is embraced in the constitutional concept of trial by jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rowe, </em>906 F.2d 654, 656 (11th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). Jurors \u201chave no right to investigate or acquire information relating to the case outside of that which is presented to them in the course of the trial in accordance with established trial procedure.\u201d <em>Farese, </em>428 F.2d at 179. Nevertheless, \u201cdue process does not require a new trial every time a juror has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>placed in a potentially compromising situation.\u201d <em>Rowe, </em>906 F.2d at 656 (internal quotation marks omitted). A new trial is required if the jury\u2019s consideration of extrinsic evidence resulted in a reasonable possibility of prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">An apparent conflict exists among our prior decisions regarding whether prejudice is presumed when a juror receives extrinsic information about the case. We have so far declined to resolve the conflict because it has had no bearing on the result in later cases, and as discussed below, we need not do so in the present case. <em>See Ronda, </em>455 F.3d at 1299 n. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">We addressed a trial court\u2019s duty to investigate juror misconduct in <em>United States v. Cousins, </em>842 F.2d 1245 (11th Cir.1988), stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">[W]hen a defendant makes a \u201ccolorable showing\u201d that jurors have been exposed to extrinsic influences, the district court, in the exercise of its discretion, must make sufficient inquiries or conduct a hearing to determine whether the influence was prejudicial. However, there is no <em>per se </em>rule requiring an inquiry in every instance. The duty to investigate arises only when the party alleging misconduct makes an adequate showing of extrinsic influence to overcome the presumption of jury impartiality. In other words, there must be something more than mere speculation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1247. If a defendant establishes prejudice, the burden shifts to the government to establish that the consideration of extrinsic evidence was harmless. <em>See Ronda, </em>455 F.3d at 1299. To determine whether the government has met its burden, we consider the totality of the circumstances, including \u201c(1) the nature of the extrinsic evidence; (2) the manner in which the information reached the jury; (3) the factual findings in the district court and the manner of the court\u2019s inquiry into the juror issues; and (4) the strength of the government\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299-1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">Jacques complains about a juror who allegedly drove past the motel where the offense took place. Under the totality of the circumstances, including the limited nature of the extrinsic evidence, the way in which it reached the juror, and the strength of the government\u2019s case, we conclude that any exposure to extrinsic evidence by the juror was harmless. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jacques\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">\n<em>5. Prior Convictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">We review properly preserved constitutional claims de novo, but reverse only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). A district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a district court may consider prior convictions and use them to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence even if those convictions were not alleged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 244 \u2014 16, 118 S.Ct. at 1231-32. Subsequent Supreme Court decisions, namely <em>Apprendi,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Blakely,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Booker;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> have not disturbed that holding. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>at 1329. Accordingly, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The government made an adequate showing of the necessary convictions for the sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Thus, the district court did not violate Jacques\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when it enhanced his sentence based on his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Jacques\u2019s conviction and sentence as to the sufficiency of the evidence, the admission of out-of-court statements concerning the background of the investigation, the refusal to give Jacques\u2019s requested jury instruction, the denial of Jacques\u2019s motion for new trial, and the use of prior convictions to enhance Jacques\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\">. <em>Apprendi v.
