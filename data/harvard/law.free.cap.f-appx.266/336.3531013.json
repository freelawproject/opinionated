Reed, Mississippi prisoner # 08798, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for lack of jurisdiction. In his complaint, Reed sought the production of documents related to the grand jury proceedings which led to his indictment, conviction, and subsequent life sentence for armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Because Reed essentially sought federal district court review of the Mississippi state court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of mandamus, the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker/Feldman</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005); <em>Liedtke v. State Bar of Tex., </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">This appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal of the instant appeal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Reed is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-19\">. <em>See Rooker v.
