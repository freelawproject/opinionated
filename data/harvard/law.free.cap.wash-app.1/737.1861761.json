J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIz\">The City of Kent (Kent) brought condemnation proceedings to acquire a portion of respondents\u2019 residence property for the widening and improvement of James Street. The trial court, after a hearing in which the respondents were represented by counsel, entered the required order adjudicating public use and necessity. Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>spondents then obtained a writ of certiorari to review the order so entered. Respondents appear pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Kent is a city of the third class. (RCW 35.24.) The condemnation proceeding was brought pursuant to RCW 8.12-.030 reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">Every city and town and each unclassified city and town within the state of Washington, is hereby authorized and empowered to <em>condemn land and property, </em>including state, county and school lands and property <em>for streets, avenues, alleys, highways, </em>bridges, approaches, culverts, drains, ditches, public squares, public markets, city and town halls, jails and other public buildings, and for the opening and widening, widening and extending, altering and straightening of any street, avenue, alley or highway, and to damage any land or other property for any such purpose or for the purpose of making changes in the grade of any street, avenue, alley or highway, or for the construction of slopes or retaining walls for cuts and fills upon real property abutting on any street, avenue, alley or highway now ordered to be, or such as shall hereafter be ordered to be opened, extended, altered, straightened or graded, or for the purpose of draining swamps, marshes, tidelands, tide flats or ponds, or filling the same, within the limits of such city, <em>and to condemn land or property, or to damage the same, either within or without the limits of such city for public parks, drives and boulevards, </em>hospitals, pesthouses, drains and sewers, garbage crematories and destructors and dumping grounds for the destruction, deposit or burial of dead animals, manure, dung, rubbish, and other offal, and for aqueducts, reservoirs, pumping stations and other structures for conveying into and through such city a supply of fresh water, and for the purpose of protecting such supply of fresh water from pollution, and to condemn land and other property and damage the same for such and for any other public use after just compensation having been first made or paid into court for the owner in the manner prescribed by this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">(Italics ours.) Purporting to act under RCW 8.12.030 and RCW 35.24.310,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the City of Kent enacted ordinance 1550. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Section 1 states that condemnation is \u201cfor the purpose of obtaining the necessary property and property rights for the improvement of James Street in the City of Kent . . .\u201d The condemnation petition alleges: \u201cThe property and property rights sought to be taken or damaged are situated in the City of Kent, King County, Washington <em>99</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">James Street is presently a 2-lane street. The city\u2019s project contemplates widening that street on both sides thereof to a 4-lane facility from East Valley Highway on the west to Benson Road on the east. At some intersections there will be a fifth lane designated a \u201cstorage\u201d lane. The court found that respondents\u2019 property abuts James Street on the south; that the center line of that street at that point is the boundary line between the City of Kent and King County; that respondents\u2019 property actually lies outside the City of Kent in King County; that in order to widen James Street on the south in front of respondents\u2019 property it is necessary that respondents\u2019 property outside the city limits be acquired, and that the City of Kent has the requisite statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The controlling issue is whether the City of Kent has the requisite statutory authority to condemn respondents\u2019 property outside the city limits for the contemplated improvement of James Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In construing RCW 8.12.030 for the purpose of ascertaining the scope of the power of eminent domain conferred upon cities, we apply commonly understood rules of construction, including (1) the power conferred is to be strictly construed; such power must be delegated in express terms or exist by clear implication <em>(Des Moines v. Hemenway, </em>73 Wn.2d 130, 437 P.2d 171 (1968)); (2) the words of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the statute must be understood in their usual and ordinary sense in the absence of statutory definition <em>(State v. Roadhs, </em>71 Wn.2d 705, 430 P.2d 586 (1967)); (3) they must be read in context <em>(Mercer Island v. Kaltenbach, </em>60 Wn.2d 105, 371 P.2d 1009 (1962)); (4) they must be construed to make the statute purposeful and meaningful <em>(Davis v. Washington Toll Bridge Auth., </em>57 Wn.2d 428, 439, 357 P.2d 710 (1960) ); (5) they must be construed to give effect to all the language used <em>(Danley v. Cooper, </em>62 Wn.2d 179, 381 P.2d 747 (1963)); (6) they must be construed to give effect to each word if possible <em>(Chelan County v. Fellers, </em>65 Wn.2d 943, 400 P.2d 609 (1965)); (7) they must be construed so that each part is given effect with every other part or section <em>(Tacoma v. Cavanaugh, </em>45 Wn.2d 500, 275 P.2d 933 (1954)); and (8) the words should not be read in isolation <em>(Markham, Advertising Co. v. State, </em>73 Wn.2d 405, 439 P.2d 248 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">RCW 8.12.030 (Laws of 1915, ch. 154 \u00a7 1, p. 446) amended Laws of 1907, ch. 153 \u00a7 1, p. 316 in respects not here material. It is instructive to examine the substantially contemporary dictionary meanings of the terms \u25a0 \u201cboulevard\u201d, \u201cstreet\u201d and \u201cdrive\u201d. Thus, in The Oxford Dictionary, A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles 1020 (1888) the word \u201cboulevard\u201d is defined as \u201cA broad street, promenade, or walk, planted with rows of trees. Chiefly applied to streets of this kind in Paris, or to others which it is intended to compare to them.\u201d In Kinney\u2019s Law Dictionary &amp; Glossary 118 (1893) \u201cboulevard\u201d is defined as \u201cA broad avenue set apart for ornament and for purposes of amusement and exercise. While a carriage way is a feature, a boulevard is not technically a street or highway.\u201d Subsequent dictionary definitions of the word \u201cboulevard\u201d emphasize the more pretentious character of a boulevard as compared with an ordinary street or avenue. Anderson\u2019s Dictionary of Law 133 (1889); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 147 (1910); The Oxford English Dictionary 1020 (1961); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) 260 (1961). Anderson\u2019s Dictionary of Law 981 (1889) defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>the word \u201cstreet\u201d as \u201cStrictly, a paved way or road, but how used for any way or road in a city or village.\u201d Kinney\u2019s Law Dictionary &amp; Glossary 635 (1893) defines the word \u201cstreet\u201d as \u201cA public way in a city or village, including sidewalks as well as carriage way.\u201d Subsequent dictionary definitions of the word \u201cstreet\u201d emphasize the fact that it is a public thoroughfare in a city, town or village, including all 'area within the right-of-way and narrower than an avenue or boulevard. Law Dictionary\u2014English A Dictionary of Words &amp; Phrases Used in Ancient &amp; Modern Law 750 (1899); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1113 (2d ed. 1910); The Oxford Dictionary, A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles, 1002 (1919); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) 2259 (1961); The Oxford English Dictionary 1102 (1961). The Oxford Dictionary, A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles, 673 (1897) defines \u201cdrive\u201d as \u201cA carriage road; esp. the private road leading to a house.\u201d Definitions similar in content are found in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) 692 (1961); The Oxford English Dictionary, 673 (1961). See also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2259 (1969); 10 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7\u00a7 30.03, 30.04 (3d ed. 1966); 39 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Highways, Streets and Bridges </em>\u00a7 8, 33 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">It is evident that both lay and law dictionaries and legal treatises have in the past and have continued to make a distinction between \u201cboulevard\u201d, \u201cstreet\u201d and \u201cdrive.\u201d The distinction between streets, drives and boulevards is emphasized by the fact that the words \u201cdrives\u201d and \u201cboulevards\u201d are used in the context of the phrase \u201cpublic parks, drives and boulevards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In light of the rules of statutory construction above reviewed, it is to be presumed that the legislature intended by RCW 8.12.030 that streets, drives and boulevards each meant something different for purposes of the statute. It is true that all three terms describe a thoroughfare which provides a means of transportation for persons and property; yet each term is different and capable of different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>meanings. In the instant case there are no findings or evidence or claim that the proposed 4-lane facility is intended primarily for use as a pleasure thoroughfare or intended to have specific qualities or characteristics of a \u201cdrive\u201d or \u201cboulevard\u201d as those terms have been above defined. It is no answer to say, as does Kent, that the statute should \u201cnot be construed so strictly as to defeat the evident purpose of the grant.\u201d <em>Tacoma v. Welcker, </em>65 Wn.2d 677, 683, 399 P.2d 330 (1965). The quoted language is inapplicable here. The grant of the eminent domain power made by RCW 8.12.030 itself makes a distinction between streets \u201cwithin the limits of\u201d the City of Kent and drives and boulevards \u201cwithin or without the limits of such city.\u201d Were we to ignore the distinguishing characteristics of \u201cstreet\u201d, \u201cdrive\u201d and \u201cboulevard\u201d we would defeat the intent and purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The order of public use and necessity is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Utter and Stafford, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">\u2018Whenever it shall become necessary for the city to take or damage private property for the purpose of establishing, laying out, extending and widening streets and other public highways and places within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>city, or for the purpose of securing rights-of-way for drains, sewers and aqueducts, and for the purpose of widening, straightening or diverting the channels of streams and the improvement of waterfronts, or any other public purpose, and the city council cannot agree with the owner thereof as to the price to be paid, the city council may proceed to acquire, take or damage the same in the manner provided by chapter 8.12 RCW or by chapter 8.20 RCW.\u201d (RCW 35.24.310)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
