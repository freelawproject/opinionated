J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARM\">Charles W. Travis was charged with negligent driving<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and resisting arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was found guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>resisting arrest but acquitted of the negligent- driving charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">The -evidence would permit the. jury to find that the following occurred: - .</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Travis was -driving his car in an. easterly direction on the Lake Washington Floating Bridge. When he- reached the point -at which the roadway curves around the drawspan, he lost control of his car. As the car emerged from the draw-span section, it went into a. skid, spun around once, skidded along the bridge, and struck the curb on the north side of the roadway.\u2019 There it stopped momentarily and then lurched forward, went into a double spin, crossed four lanes and struck the curb on the south side of the roadway, and finally stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Two King'County sheriff\u2019s deputies who were approaching the drawspan from the east observed this startling performance. Both officers stopped their patrol cars, and one of them, Captain Pingrey, went immediately on foot to Travis\u2019 car. When asked of his condition, Travis responded that he was not hurt. Pingrey noticed a moderate odor of alcohol while talking to. Travis, and he asked Travis if he had. been drinking. The answer was, \u201cYeah, I had four beers in town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Pingrey then instructed. Travis to drive his car off the bridge and park it on the exit road at the old toll plaza. The second officer, Engstrom, who had been directing traffic, followed Travis. Engstrom parked his car immediately behind Travis\u2019 car. Upon request, Travis left his car and sat with Engstrom in the front seat of his patrol car. There followed a general discussion of the circumstances of the accident, during- which Engstrom noticed that Travis\u2019 speech was slurred and that Travis smelled of alcohol. When asked.if he had been drinking, Travis replied that he had had four beers on an empty stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">In a few minutes Trooper LaDoux of the Washington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>State Patrol arrived and parked his car in front of Travis\u2019 car. Trooper LaDoux noticed that the right front fender of Travis\u2019 car was damaged. He got into the back seat of Engstrom\u2019s patrol car and joined in the discussion. He noticed a moderate odor of intoxicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">Engstrom then left to examine the damage to Travis\u2019 car. When he returned, one of .the officers said that the car could not be driven safely and suggested that Travis telephone someone, perhaps his wife, to arrange transportation. LaDoux also told Travis that it was snowing in the Issaquah-North Bend area (Travis\u2019 destination), making driving hazardous.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">At this juncture, Travis\u2019 cooperative attitude changed abruptly. He first refused to make a telephone call. He then said he had no change. Officer Engstrom offered to stake him a dime. Travis argued with Trooper LaDoux, asserting that he did not believe it was snowing at his home in North Bend.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">A telephone booth was in plain view close to the trooper\u2019s car. Finally, Travis reached into his pocket and said that he had change and would make a telephone call. He left the patrol car, ostensibly for the telephone booth, but went instead to his car, started the engine, and attempted to maneuver his car from between the two police cars. LaDoux exclaimed, \u201cThere he goes!\u201d and Engstrom immediately moved his car forward to prevent Travis from leaving. Engstrom then went to Travis\u2019 car, reached through the open window by the driver\u2019s seat, and took the key from the ignition switch. Engstrom then told Travis that he was going to take him to the King County jail. Travis, using profanity, asserted that he was not going to be taken anyplace. As he emerged from his car, he said that he was going to fight and would chop or cut Engstrom down. Engstrom, observing Travis\u2019 Clenched right fist, and believing that Travis was about to strike him, sprayed Travis with mace. Aft\u00e9r a struggle, and with assistance from'Trooper LaDoux, Engstrom\" succeeded in placing handcuffs upon Travis. '</p>\n<p id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>Travis first assigns error to \u201callowing the jury to consider defendant\u2019s statement that he had consumed four beers as an admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Travis had originally been charged in the Mercer Island District Justice Court with driving while under the influence of alcohol, being drunk in public, and resisting arrest. The drunk driving charge was amended to charge reckless driving. The district court judge dismissed the drunk in public charge but found Travis guilty of negligent driving and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Anticipating the officers\u2019 testimony in superior court, Travis moved to exclude any reference to drinking. After a prehminary hearing pursuant to CrR 101.20W, the trial judge concluded that the statements concerning drinking were given voluntarily and were not elicited during an in-custody interrogation. See <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Travis\u2019 argument is that evidence of his drinking was not relevant either to the charge of negligent driving or to the charge of resisting arrest and that the state\u2019s only purpose in introducing the evidence was to prejudice his case before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">In a prosecution for reckless driving, the state may show that the defendant had been drinking before he was apprehended. <em>State v. Birch, </em>183 Wash. 670, 49 P.2d 921 (1935). And negligent driving is an included offense in a charge of reckless driving. RCW 46.61.525. Whether Travis\u2019 use of intoxicants influenced his driving was an issue for the jury to resolve. The trial judge did not err in permitting the jury to consider Travis\u2019 statements that he had drunk four beers.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">One of the burdens placed upon the state by the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction was that the jury had to be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt \u201c [t]hat on or about the 10th day of April, 1968, the defendant Charles W. Travis willfully resisted being placed under arrest.\u201d Travis contends that \u25a0the jury should have been required to find not only that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>Travis willfully resisted arrest but that he did so <em>knowingly </em>as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The judge instructed the jury that \u201c \u2018willfully\u2019 means intentionally and purposely and not accidentally.\u201d A complete answer to Travis\u2019 contention is found in the following quotation from <em>State v. Bixby, </em>27 Wn.2d 144, 160, 177 P.2d 689 (1947):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-6\">\u201c \u2018Willfully,\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018knowingly.\u2019 \u2018Willfully,\u2019 as used when saying that an act was willfully done, implies that the act was done by design; done for a set purpose; and it would follow that it was knowingly done. The term \u2018willfully\u2019 implies that the act is done knowingly. The word \u2018willfully\u2019 implies, on the part of the wrongdoer, knowledge, and a purpose to do the wrongful act. \u2018Willfully,\u2019 as used in connection with an act forbidden by law, means that the act must be done knowingly or intentionally, and that the act was committed with knowledge, and that the will consented to, designed, and directed the act. In common parlance, \u2018willfully\u2019 is used in the sense of \u2018knowingly,\u2019 as distinguished from \u2018accidental\u2019 or \u2018involuntarily.\u2019 <em>Hutchman v. State, </em>Okl. Cr. App., 66 P.2d 99, 102.\u201d 45 Words and Phrases 218.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">We have considered Travis\u2019 remaining assignments of error and find them all to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Farris 'and Swanson, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">Petition for rehearing denied March 30, 1970.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-16\">RCW 46.61.525: \u201cIt shall be unlawful' for any person to operate a motor vehicle in a negligent manner over and along the public highways of this state.
