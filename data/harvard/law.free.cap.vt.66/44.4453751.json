Plea the general issue, with notice of special matter. . Trial by jury at the December term, 1892, Bennington county, Start, J., presiding. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant excepts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">The note was for one hundred and seventy-five dollars, was signed by the defendant, made payable to the order of Patrick Nash and endorsed by Patrick Nash and H. E. Burgess. The note in suit was given in renewal of another note for two hundred dollars between the same parties, which had been originally given by the defendant in payment of an interest in a livery stock purchased by him. This trade was negotiated by H. E. Burgess. A part of the stock sold consisted of two wagons in the state of New York, which could not be inspected by the parties. Burgess represented that these wagons were worth one hundred and seventy-five dollars and seventy-five dollars respectively, and agreed that if they were not, a corresponding deduction should be made from the note. The defendant claimed on trial that the wagons were really worth very much less, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>amount of the recovery on the note should be diminished accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">The plaintiff insisted that his only interest in the property sold was that of a mortgage, and that this defence could not be made as to him. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff was the real owner, and that H. E. Burgess acted as his agent in the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">The jury found specially that the plaintiff was the real owner, and that the wagons were worth fifty dollars less than represented. Notwithstanding this finding the court gave judgment for the full amount of the note, to which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-7\"><em>C. H. Mason </em>and <em>Batchelder &amp; Bates </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-8\">The property was sold in effect by the plaintiff to the defendant, and the note given in payment for it. The fact that the plaintiff\u2019s name does not formally appear on the note renders him none the less a party to it.

L., s. 911. As held in <em>Hoyt </em>v. McNally, 66 Vt. 38, heard and decided this terra, the plaintiff is not an original party to the note in suit within the meaning of the statute, and, therefore, this defence cannot be interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
