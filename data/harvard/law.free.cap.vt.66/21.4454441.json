The demanded premises were set off to Mrs Hurd for life, and she possessed them till her death, and the defendant has possessed them since; and the question is, whether he is entitled to them under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">In the first place, the testator gives life estates to his children that survive him, remainders to their children. Had he stopped here, none of his grandchildren would take except the children of his surviving children. But he goes on to say, that \u201cif any child shall have died previous to my decease, leaving children, the share of such child shall go to his or her children in equal shares.\u201d It is claimed that the words, \u201cany child,\u201d as here used, relate equally to the testator\u2019s descendants of either degree named in the previous clause, and include grandchildren as well as children, and therefore include the defendant\u2019s mother; that the words, \u201cthe share of such child shall go,\u201d etc.,- mean, that the share such child would have taken if living, \u201cshall go,\u201d etc.; that the words of the proviso, \u201cif any of my said children shall die after my decease, without children,\u201d favor this con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>struction, as the words, \u201cwithout children,\u201d should be construed to mean without having had children, or, without issue; and that therefore the defendant takes.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We recognize the rule that in construing wills the word <em>children </em>is deemed to have been used in its popular sense, that is, as signifying descendants in the first degree, and that this sense is not to be enlarged so as to include more remote descendants unless it appears that such was the intention of the testator. But this rule must be considered with due regard to the other rules of construction applicable to the case, and such construction adopted as will best effectuate the testator\u2019s purpose as disclosed by the will when read in the light of the attendant circumstances. Another rule is, that although an intention to disenherit an heir, even a lineal descendant, when it clearly appears, must be carried out, yet that such intention will not be attributed to a testator when he uses language capable of a construction that will not so operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">A majority of the court thinks that the words, \u201cany child,\u201d in the clause next before the proviso, mean any child of either class of children previously named, that is, any of the testator\u2019s own children or any of the children of his children, that is, any of his grandchildren. It is true that the verb, \u201cshall have died,\u201d being in the second future tense, gramatically considered, points, not to what had taken place when the will was made, as the death of the defendant\u2019s mother had, but to what might take place thereafter and before the testator\u2019s death; but we do not think that the verb was here used in its strict gramatical tense, but as referring to what had already taken place when the will was made as well as to what might take place thereafter and before the testator\u2019s death, and that the words, \u201cthe share of such child shall go,\u201d etc., mean, the share such child would have taken if living shall go, etc. This enlarged sense of the word \u201cchild\u201d is favored by the word \u201cheirs,\u201d used in regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>disposition of whatever might remain of what was given to the widow, which, it is provided, \u201cshall go to the heirs,\u201d etc., \u201caccording to the provisions hereinafter stated for the disposition of the remainder of my estate.\u201d Indeed the whole tenor of the will on this subject is to the effect that it was the intention of the testator that the remainders limited upon the respective life-estates to his children should go to the children of each life tenant or to their descendants, as the case might be, and on failure or for want of both, to his own children. This construction lets the defendant in while any other construction disenherits him; and besides this is equality, <em>at </em>which the testator seems to have aimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and judgment for defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
