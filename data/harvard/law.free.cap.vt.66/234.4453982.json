The defendant contends that the execution and delivery of the note and lien described in the referee\u2019s report precludes the plaintiff from showing by parol what the contract of exchange in fact was. The contention is not sound. The lien note was intended only as security, and not as a repository of the terms of the contract. It does not even allude to the contract in regard to the brown horse, and as to the black mare it only says she was \u201cconditionally sold.\u201d The maker of a promissory note' may always show the terms and conditions on which it was delivered, and that the payee or holder had no right to hold it except for the accomplishment of a particular purpose. <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>32 Vt. 318; <em>Park </em>v. <em>McDaniels, </em>37 Vt. 594; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>49 Vt. 266; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Hasson, </em>56 Vt. 449; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>56 Vt. 569. The defendant recognized and acted under the contract after receiving the lien note as security. He took back the black mare, surrendered the note to the plaintiff, and it would now be a strange anomaly in the law if he could stand behind the note to prevent a recovery for the brown horse which he has converted to his own use. Such is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
