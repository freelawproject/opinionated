The plaintiff\u2019s evidence also tended to show that the pauper did not intend to make his home in Jericho, but that he intended to return to Bashaw\u2019s in Burlington when his employment was ended in Jericho, but there was no agreement between himself and Bashaw that he might return to the house of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The main question is whether upon this evidence the court was warranted in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The pauper testified that when he was about leaving Bashaw\u2019s with' his trunk, he said to Mrs. Bashaw, <em>\u201c </em>When I get through at Cook\u2019s this is my home and I shall comeback again,\u201d and that he said to Cook, who was moving him, \u201cYou will bring me back, will you?\u201d Cook replied that he would; Mrs. Bashaw made no reply. Her husband was not present. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that it was the pauper\u2019s intention at that time to remain through the winter in Jericho and board with Cook if he succeeded in finding work. It appeared that one Wright had charge of the construction of sewers in the defendant city and that the pauper had worked under him four seasons, including that of 1891. It was proposed by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to inquire of Wright what arrangement or conversation, if any, he had with the pauper about returning to work on the sewers the following season. The questions were excluded. It was not offered to be shown that Wright did employ the pauper for the season of 1892, or that he had authority to employ him. If he - had had authority and employed him it would have shown a mere intention on the part of the pauper to return to Burlington to labor, and the evidence would have been immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s case, including the testimony of Wright had it been admitted, would only have shown an intention on the part of the pauper to return to Burlington at some indefinite time when he should get out of employment in Jeri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>choj of when he should obtain employment again in Burlington. When he . moved his trunk and all his possessions except his saw and hat from the defendant city, he had no place there to Which he had a right to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The reasoning of Aldis, J., in <em>Barton </em>v. Irasburg, 33 Vt. 159, applies directly to this case :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cA hoilse holder who has a family and a house to return to; a single person who has an accustomed home, or personal effects and worldly goods to go back to, may well be supposed to have the intention of returning. Hence in many cases the place where one keeps his effects,, his chest, etc., is said to be his home. If he takes his all with him and leaves no home behind him, then he may be thought more reasonably to carry his home with him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">It was further said in that case that while intention is an important element in determining the question of residence, yet it is not the only element, and is modified by the character, habits and business of the party, and the character of his old home, and of his new residence. In that case the pauper, having no family and no property except his clothes and two axes, and no particular place which he called his home, worked at different places in Barton from 1850 to 1859, with the exception that from July, 1852, to the spring \u00f3f 1853, and from January, 1855, to the following spring, he worked in three other towns, to which, he took all his property. His engagements to labor, both in Barton and elsewhere, were not made for any particular period, but his only purpose seemed to be to stay as long as he could wherever he could find employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">In <em>Jamaica </em>v. <em>Townshend, </em>19 Vt. 267, the pauper had resided in the plaintiff town ; he purchased some land in another part of the town, cleared a part of it and cut some timber preparatory to the building of a house upon it. He then moved to Londonderry with his family, taking with him all his furniture excepting a few articles of little value or use, and resided in the latter town twenty-nine days, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>he moved back to Jamaica. It was held that though he intended speedily to build a house in Jamaica and return to live in it, yet if he left no dwelling or shelter in that town to which he intended to return, and intended to remain in Londonderry until he built his house, his removal interrupted his residence in Jamaica.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In <em>Berlin </em>v. Worcester, 50 Vt. 23, the pauper, when suddenly taken sick, was at work in the plaintiff town under a contract to work during that season. Her father being dead, she had at intervals and when not away at work made her home with her mother in defendant town, and in like manner with her sister in another town. She had no right by contract or otherwise to a home either with her mother or sister, nor had she a room or furniture at either place, but when she stayed with her mother or sister it was through their courtesy. Ross, J., said that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201c Home, or domicile, is a place where the person has a right to be. The idea of a right to be and remain at a particular place is inseparable from the conception of home or domicile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">It was held that, as there was no place in defendant town to which the pauper had a right to return, and had not the <em>animus </em>revertendi, she had come to reside within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The doctrine in the case last cited is in consonance with the general course of decisions in this state. See the cases cited in the opinion. The law laid down in <em>Rockingham </em>v. Springfield, 59 Vt. 521, is at variance with our other decisions. That decision was by a divided court; its soundness has often been questioned and it must now be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">It was held in the well considered case of <em>No. Yarmouth </em>v. <em>West </em>Gardiner, 58 Me. 207, that when a person leaves his place of residence with everything he has, without any intention as to returning, he has abandoned bis residence,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>whether he has established another or not; that the interruption of a residence does not depend upon the fact whether he did or did not return. <em>Holmes </em>v. Greene, 7 Gray 299; <em>Whitney </em>v. Ashland, 12 Allen 11; <em>Wilbraham </em>v. Ludlow, 99 Mass. 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Intention to return, such as the law recognizes, must be something more than a mere feeling or sentiment, a desire, some ultimate purpose not having a present fixed object. This has been repeatedly held; also, that mere intention does not constitute a residence. It must be a present, fixed, continuous intention, and have relation to a definite place to which the person has a right to return. The plaintiff\u2019s case lacked these elements and there 'was no error in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-7\">Start, J., did not sit, being engaged in county court.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
