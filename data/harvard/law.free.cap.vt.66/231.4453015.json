Heard upon motion to dismiss the appeal for that no bond had been filed, at the September term, 1893, Orleans county, Taft, J., presiding. The appeal was dismissed and the appellant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">The decree was made March 28, 1893, and an appeal at once taken. No bond was then filed, but the appellant offered to show that one E. A. Cook proposed to become bail in the probate court and was accepted by the court; that later an arrangement was made between Cook and one Baldwin that other surety should be furnished and that a satisfactory bond was filed September 6, 1893. Cook and Baldwin were the attorneys of the respective parties. The court rejected the evidence and the appellant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-6\"><em>E. A.

Bodwell, to be a person incompetent and unsuitable to have the custody, care and education of the minor, and appointing L. M. Hibbard, his guardian, to have the custody of his person and the care of his education. The application for an appeal from this decree was made to the probate court within twenty days from the date of the decision appealed from, as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>quired by R. <em>L., s. </em>2270, but within the twenty days the appellant did not give a bond to the satisfaction of the probate corzrt, conditioned that she would prosecute her appeal to effect, and pay the intervening damages and costs occasioned by the appeal. After the expiration of the twenty days she gave such a bond to that court. On motion, the court below dismissed the appeal. The appellant now assigns this action of the county court as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">This question was before this court in <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Mer</em>rill, 55 Vt. 464, and it was there held that under the provisions of R. L., s. 2270 and 2273, the requisite bond must be given within twenty days <em>from </em>the decision appealed from, or on motion the appeal would be dismissed in the county court. We think this is the correct construction of the statute. This appeal was, therefore, properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">II. The parol evidence offered to vary the record of the probate court was properly excluded. <em>Beech </em>v. Rich, 13 Vt. 595; <em>Eastman </em>v.
