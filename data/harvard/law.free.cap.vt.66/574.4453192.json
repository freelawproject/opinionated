Trial by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>court at the December term, 1893, Caledonia county, Row-ell, J., presiding. Upon the facts found and certified by the court judgment was rendered for the plaintiff to recover the sum of six hundred twelve dollars and seventy-eight cents. The defendant excepts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-3\">Previous to February 26, 1892, the defendant had been-engaged in the mercantile business at Concord, Vermont, and in the course of that business had received from his customers certain notes which he had endorsed and discounted at the plaintiff bank, which then amounted to about nine hundred dollars, and which were overdue. The defendant being requested by the plaintiff to take up such overdue paper, represented to the plaintiff that his farm in Concord was free from incumbrance, and that he would secure the plaintiff by a mortgage upon said farm, whereupon the plaintiff surrendered to the defendant this trade paper, took his note for the amount and a mortgage upon the defendant\u2019s said farm securing the note. At that time the defendant\u2019s farm was in fact mortgaged for one thousand dollars, and the defendant knew this when he made the above representations to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff did not know it until afterwards. The defendant\u2019s homestead was not included in said mortgage, and the court found that there was no equity in the property above said one thousand dollars mortgage and said homestead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-4\">In December, 1892, the defendant was adjudged an insolvent by the court of insolvency for the district of Essex and his estate was duly settled and he received a discharge. In that proceeding the plaintiff presented the above note as a claim against his estate and the same was allowed and a dividend of three hundred seventy-seven dollars and seventy-eight cents was paid the plaintiff thereon. Aside from this dividend no payment had ever been made upon the note. The court found that the value of the farm free from encumbrance at the time the mortgage was given was one thousand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>five hundred dollars, and that such had continued to be its value since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-3\">The amount of the damages for which the plaintiff recovered judgment was the amount due on the note at the date of judgment, less the dividend received from the insolvent estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-4\"><em>Bates &amp; May </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-5\">The debt created by the fraud of the defendant was barred by the discharge in insolvency. <em>Re </em>Rathbone, i N.

The defendant, by false and fraudulent representations in respect to his farm being free and clear from all incumbrances, induced the plaintifF to surrender to him about $900 worth of \u2018 \u2018trade paper\u201d upon which he was liable to the plaintiff, and which was then overdue, and to take in lieu thereof his note for nine hundred dollars secured by a mortgage on the farm. Either the surrender of the \u201ctrade paper,\u201d or the forbearance of the plaintiff by virtue of this arrangement, was a sufficient consideration, to bind the defendant by his representations, when thus acted upon by the plaintiff. <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>64 Vt. 387. The plaintiff did not rescind this contract on account of the fraud, but elected to affirm it. It thereby had two causes of action against the defendant, the one on the contract evidenced by the note, and the other in tort for the false and fraudulent representations. Both actions must proceed upon the part of the plaintiff, on the theory of an affirmance of the contract. Although differing in lorm, one would not allege what the other would deny. But while consistent, they are not identical; the one proceeds upon the theory of a tort, and the other upon contract. A party may prosecute as many remedies as he legally has, if they are consistent and concurrent, and a recovery in one does not constitute a bar to the other. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Worden, </em>47 Vt. 457; <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>54 Vt. 101; <em>Bean </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>1 Bradwell 177; Goldberg <em>v.

Y. 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>It is urged that this action cannot be maintained by reason of the defendant\u2019s discharge in insolvency, plaintiff having proved the note against the insolvent estate, and received a dividend thereon in the insolvency proceedings. But any legitimate proceeding to collect the note, as we have already seen, does not bar plaintiff\u2019s right to its action for the tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\">R. L., s. 1800, defines what claims may be proved against an estate in insolvency, but the cause of action in this suit is not among those which may be proved. By the provisions of R. L., s. 1856, the debtor\u2019s certificate of discharge is only to discharge him from debts proved or provable. This cause of action was neither proved nor provable in the insolvency proceedings, and, therefore, was not discharged thereby. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Worden, </em>and <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Woodward, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">II. The defendant urges that in any event, the plaintifi can recover only nominal damages, but this contention cannot prevail. The plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery stands as if there had been no insolvency proceedings. If the farm had been free from incumbrances as represented, it was of sufficient value to pay the plaintiff in full. It has received $377.88 from defendant\u2019s assignee on the note. The court below rendered judgment for the plaintiff to recover a sum equal to the balance unpaid on the note after deducting the amount received from the assignee. Under the facts found by the court, this was the correct measure of damages. <em>Whittier </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>15 R. I. 90; 2 Am.
