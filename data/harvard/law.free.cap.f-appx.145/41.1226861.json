Cooper contends that the district court erred by not ordering the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to award credit for that portion of Cooper\u2019s state sentence that was served prior to the imposition of his federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-27\">The Attorney General, through the BOP, determines what credit, if any, will be awarded to prisoners for time spent in custody prior to the commencement of their sentences. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 331-32, 334, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992). The BOP correctly determined under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) that it may not award Cooper credit toward his term of imprisonment for any time he spent in official detention pri- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>or to the commencement of his sentence that was credited against another sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b67-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
