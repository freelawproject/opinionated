Sifuentes contends for the first time on appeal that the district court erred by characterizing his state conviction for pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>session of a controlled substance as an aggravated felony because a prior conviction must qualify as a felony under federal law in order to be an aggravated felony under the guidelines. He further contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d sentencing-enhancement provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are facially unconstitutional because <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), has been undercut by later Supreme Court opinions. Sifuentes concedes that his contentions are foreclosed by this court\u2019s case-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Sifuentes\u2019s contentions are foreclosed. First, Sifuentes\u2019s prior state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance qualifies as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b) despite the fact that the same offense is punishable only as a misdemeanor under federal law. <em>See United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 705-11 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). Second, this court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
