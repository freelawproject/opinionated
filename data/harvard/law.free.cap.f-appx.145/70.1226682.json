New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), his imprisonment term violated due process because it exceeded the statutory maximum for the charged offense; that under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court plainly erred by increasing the maximum authorized Guidelines sentence based on facts neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; and that under <em>Booker, </em>the district court plainly erred when it sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>tenced him under a mandatory Guidelines sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Because Acosta preserved his objection to the enhancement before the district court, this court reviews the enhancement de novo. <em>United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 256 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 932, 160 L.Ed.2d 817 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In 1988 Acosta was convicted of violating Cal. Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11360(a) (West 1988). This 1988 conviction forms the basis for the district court\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) enhancement. The language of the California Health and Safety Code section that Acosta violated is broader than the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking conviction\u201d set forth in the Guidelines and thus reaches conduct that may not fit the definition of a drug trafficking conviction. <em>Compare </em>Cal. Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11360(a) (West 1988), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), comment. (n.l(B)(iv)).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Although the probation department in the Presentence Report (PSR) set forth facts from which the probation department concluded that the offense was a drug trafficking offense that warranted the enhancement, the \u201cdistrict court was not permitted to rely on the PSR\u2019s characterization of the offense in order to make its determination of whether it was a drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-74 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Additionally, under the analysis set forth in this court\u2019s recent decision of <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352 (2005), the documents submitted by the Government do not provide the requisite information. Neither the indictment nor the judgment relating to Acosta\u2019s 1988 conviction was provided to the district court. None of the documents submitted by the Government are the product of judicial function, such as a judgment, that \u201cmanifests a conscious judicial narrowing of the charging document rather than a shorthand abbreviation of the statute of conviction.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 357-58 (internal quotation marks omitted). The documents also are not \u201c \u2018explicit factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, <em>quoting Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">At most, the documents submitted by the Government cite the statute and state that Acosta\u2019s crime was \u201csale of marijuana.\u201d This type of citation and shorthand reference to the statute of conviction, which encompasses a broader range of conduct than a drug trafficking conviction as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), is insufficient to support the enhancement. <em>See Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d at 355, 358-59. Finally, nothing in the record suggests that the documents submitted by the Government in Acosta\u2019s case are any more reliable than the California abstract of judgment that in <em>Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d at 358, was found to have a \u201clow level of reliability.\u201d Thus, the district court erred in imposing the 16-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">Acosta also contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2), which provide that a defendant\u2019s sentence may be increased for a prior \u201cfelony\u201d or \u201caggravated felony,\u201d are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Acosta recognizes, this issue is controlled by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>see also United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court does not have the authority to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>rule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984. This argument is therefore foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Finally, because this court is vacating Acosta\u2019s sentence due to a misapplication of the then-mandatory Guidelines, it is not necessary to address Acosta\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claims. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 275 n. 2; <em>United States v. Southerland, </em>405 F.3d 263, 270 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We therefore VACATE Acosta\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing consistent with this opinion and the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b97-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47,5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
