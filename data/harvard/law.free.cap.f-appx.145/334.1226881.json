Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by treating the United States Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory. Pinch\u00f3n argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions, and that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We address the appellants\u2019 arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">I. Anderson</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">As to Anderson\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument, plain error review applies. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, 398 </em>F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">As we have noted, there are two types of <em>Booker </em>error: Sixth Amendment error and statutory error. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1300-31 (11th Cir.2005). Sixth Amendment, or, \u201cconstitutional,\u201d <em>Booker </em>error occurs when a district court uses extra-verdict enhancements to increase a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range and then treats this range as mandatory. <em>Id. </em>Because the district court did not use extra-verdict enhancements to increase Anderson\u2019s sentence, there was no Sixth Amendment error. However, statutory <em>Booker </em>error occurs every time a district court treats the range as mandatory, regardless of whether it imposes any extra-verdict enhancements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">Turning to the alleged statutory error, the first prong of the plain error analysis is satisfied because the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>407 F.3d 1170, 1173 (11th Cir.2005). Similarly, the second prong is fulfilled because it is enough for the error to be clear at the time of appellate review. <em>Id. </em>The third prong is satisfied because the district court imposed concurrent sentences of 121 months each, the lowest sentences permitted by a mandatory reading of the Guidelines, and expressed a desire to sentence Anderson to a \u201cmuch lighter sentence\u201d than the Guidelines permitted. <em>See id. </em>at 1173-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">Lastly, we have repeatedly held that the fourth prong is satisfied where a district court evinced a desire to impose a lower sentence than that permitted by the Guidelines, but sentenced the defendant within the Guidelines range based upon the mistaken belief that this range was mandatory. <em>United States v. Henderson, 409 F.3d </em>1293, 1307-08 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 689 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Martinez, </em>407 F.3d at 1174; <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1333-334.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">We therefore reverse and remand for resentencing as to Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>II. Pinch\u00f3n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\n<em>A. Sufficiency of the evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">As to Pinchon\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions, we review \u201cchallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Futrell, </em>209 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th Cir.2000). The jury has the exclusive power to determine the credibility of witnesses. <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u201cIn order to obtain a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the Government must establish the existence of three elements: (1) knowledge (of one\u2019s possession); (2) possession of a controlled substance; and (3) intent to distribute that substance.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>183 F.3d 1291, 1299 n. 13 (11th Cir.1999). To obtain a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the government must \u201cshow (1) the existence of an agreement, (2) an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, (3) possession, (4) intent to distribute, and (5) a controlled substance.\u201d <em>United States v. Boldin, </em>772 F.2d 719, 727 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In the instant case, the government presented a videotape depicting the drug transaction that resulted in Pinchon\u2019s convictions. On appeal, Pinch\u00f3n and the government make contrary arguments about whether the seller\u2019s identity could be ascertained from this tape. But it was within the province of the jury, after reviewing the videotape itself, to accept the government\u2019s version and reject Pinchon\u2019s. Even assuming that the videotape did not establish Pinchon\u2019s guilt, however, the trial testimony alone was sufficient to support knowing possession with intent to distribute under \u00a7 841, conspiracy under \u00a7 846, and a guilty verdict. Because the government presented testimony that, if credited, would justify Pinchon\u2019s convictions, the evidence was sufficient to justify the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. <em>Chastain, </em>198 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">\n<em>B. Motion for a new trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">As to Pinchon\u2019s argument that the district court erred by denying his motion for a new trial, we review the denial for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ettinger, </em>344 F.3d 1149, 1161 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">A defendant must meet five requirements to be entitled to a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-13\">(1) the evidence must be discovered following trial; (2) the movant must show due diligence to discover the evidence; (3) the evidence must not be merely cumulative or impeaching; (4) the evidence must be material to issues before the court; and (5) the evidence must be of such a nature that a new trial would probably produce a new result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-15\"><em>United States v. Di Bernardo, </em>880 F.2d 1216, 1224 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-16\">Pinch\u00f3n cannot satisfy the first requirement for obtaining a new trial because he claims to have discovered the new evidence, i.e., that two witnesses were associating, <em>during </em>the trial. Because the evidence upon which Pinch\u00f3n relies was not discovered \u201cfollowing trial,\u201d he has not met the first requirement for obtaining a new trial, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to grant his motion. We therefore affirm Anderson\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-17\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-13\">. Pinch\u00f3n also argues, for the first time in his reply brief, that his sentence should be vacated and remanded in light of <em>Booker. </em>Because Pinch\u00f3n did not raise this argument in his initial brief, we decline to review it. <em>See United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1338 n. 18 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
