RamirezNoyola was sentenced to seventy-six months\u2019 imprisonment. We find no error and affirm Ramirez-Noyola\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-23\">Ramirez-Noyola first contends that the trial court erred when it admitted, over defense objection, testimony regarding pri- or possession of the firearm at issue. Ramirez-Noyola asserts the testimony was offered to show general bad character and was therefore inadmissible under Fed. R.Evid. 404(b). He further asserts that even if the testimony was permissible under Rule 404(b), it should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403 as its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-24\">\u201cDecisions regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence are committed to the sound discretion of the district court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Lancaster, </em>96 F.3d 734, 744 (4th Cir.1996). \u201cWe will find that discretion to have been abused only when the district court acted \u2018arbitrarily or irrationally.\u2019 \u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number><em>States v. Moore, </em>27 F.3d 969, 974 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Ham, </em>998 F.2d 1247, 1252 (4th Cir.1993)). To preserve a claim of error predicated upon a ruling which admits evidence, a party must make a timely objection \u201cstating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 51(b). In the context of Rule 404(b), this court has broadly interpreted the rule, holding that it \u201c \u2018is an inclusive rule that allows admission of evidence of other acts relevant to an issue at trial except that which proves only criminal disposition.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>964 F.2d 295, 298 (4th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Watford, </em>894 F.2d 665, 671 (4th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Ramirez-Noyola objected to admission of testimony regarding his possession of the firearm on prior occasions. The district court found this evidence admissible under Rule 404(b) for the purpose of determining who had the right to exercise dominion and control over the firearm. The issue was significant as the firearm was retrieved by police officers from Ramirez-Noyola\u2019s companion. After determining that the testimony was admissible for something other than criminal disposition, the district court performed the Rule 403 balancing test and found the probative value substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. We find the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Ramirez-Noyola next contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). In reviewing a sufficiency challenge, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). \u201c[W]e have defined \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 in the context of a criminal action, as that evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, this court does not \u201cweigh the evidence or review the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>118 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.1997). Where \u201cthe evidence supports different, reasonable interpretations, the jury decides which interpretation to believe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>35 F.3d 143, 148 (4th Cir.1994)). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has admonished that we not examine evidence in a piecemeal fashion, but consider it in cumulative context.\u201d <em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 863 (citations omitted). \u201cThe focus of appellate review, therefore, of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction is on the complete picture, viewed in context and in the light most favorable to the Government, that all of the evidence portrayed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">To prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the Government must establish that \u201c(1) the defendant previously had been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year; (2) the defendant knowingly possessed ... the firearm; and (3) the possession was in or affecting commerce, because the firearm had travelled [sic] in interstate or foreign commerce at some point during its existence.\u201d <em>United States v. Langley, </em>62 F.3d 602, 606 (4th Cir.1995) (en banc). After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Ramirez-Noyola\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
