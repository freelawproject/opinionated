See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-27\">Jacqueline Quinn appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2000) (\u201cTitle VII\u201d) complaint. On August 26, 2004, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>district court dismissed Quinn\u2019s complaint on jurisdictional grounds. The court, adopting the reasoning set forth in Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, determined that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5(f)(3), Title VU\u2019s venue-laying provision. When a plaintiff files an action in the wrong venue, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) (2000) directs courts to \u201cdismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case\u201d to the proper venue. Because the record did not reflect such a determination,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the ease was remanded for a determination of whether a transfer to an appropriate jurisdiction would be in the interest of justice. On March 15, 2005, the district court again dismissed Quinn\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">We note that the choice to transfer or dismiss a case afforded by \u00a7 1406(a) lies within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>See Minnette v. Time Warner, </em>997 F.2d 1023, 1026 (2d Cir.1993) (citations omitted). In its order of dismissal, after acknowledging its authority to transfer the case in the interest of justice, the court concluded that based on a review of the merits, in addition to the jurisdictional issues, transfer was not warranted. Quinn, despite repeated opportunities to provide a response, failed to address the jurisdictional issues raised. As a result, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Quinn\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court granting Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and dismissing Quinn\u2019s complaint. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\"> We note that Quinn would now be time-barred from initiating a new action. A Title VII action must be brought within 90 days of receipt of a right-to-sue letter issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l). In instances where a complaint is timely filed and later dismissed, the timely filing of the complaint does not \"toll'' or suspend the ninety-day limitations period. <em>See Minnette v. Time Warner, </em>997 F.2d 1023, 1026-27 (2d Cir.1993) (citations omitted). Thus, even a dismissal without prejudice will not benefit Quinn.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
