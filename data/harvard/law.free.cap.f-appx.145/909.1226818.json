Herrera-Torres argues that the district court erred in imposing his sentence under the then mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines that were held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">We review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). The district court\u2019s application of the guidelines in them mandatory form constituted error that is plain. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). Herrera-Torres concedes that he cannot meet the third prong of plain-error analysis as a review of the record gives no indication that the judge would have sentenced him any differently had he known the guidelines were only advisory. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522. Therefore, Herrera-Torres has not shown that the district court\u2019s imposition of his sentence constituted reversible plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 520-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-16\">This court has rejected the argument that a <em>Booker </em>error or the application of the then mandatory guidelines is a structural error or is presumptively prejudicial. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520; <em>see also United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005)(same), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297). Therefore, Herrera-Torres\u2019s argument that the plain error standard does not apply is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b936-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
