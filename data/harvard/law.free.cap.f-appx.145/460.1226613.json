He argues that the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Conde acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">For the first time on appeal, Conde argues that the district court erred in imposing his sentence under a mandatory guideline scheme, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He asserts that this court should review his claim de novo and that the error is \u201cstructural,\u201d but he concedes that under circuit precedent this court reviews the argument for plain error because he did not raise it below. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, \u2014 L.Ed.2d. - (2005). Conde concedes that he cannot show, as required by <em>Valenzuelar-Quevedo, </em>that the district court would likely have sentenced him differently under an advisory sentencing scheme. Similarly, there is no indication from the court\u2019s remarks at sentencing that the court would have imposed a sentence below the appropriate guideline range. Thus, Conde has not met his burden to show that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence under a mandatory guideline scheme was plain error. <em>See ValenzuelaQuevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733; <em>see also United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 264, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). Accordingly, Conde\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
