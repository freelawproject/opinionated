Rich was ordered to pay $5,015,500 in restitution. Rich gave timely notice of <em>his appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-22\">Rich contends that the district court erred in failing to prevent an Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) agent from giving his opinion on ultimate issues and in stating his legal conclusions in his testimony. Rich concedes that this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Rich contends that the IRS agent\u2019s use of the words \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201cfraudulent,\u201d and \u201cmoney laundering,\u201d in describing the definition of \u201cmoney laundering\u201d and in stating why Rich\u2019s conduct constituted money laundering, violated Fed.R.Evid. 704(b). Plain error has not been shown. <em>See United States v. Pettigrew, 77 </em>F.3d 1500, 1516 <em>&amp; </em>n. 14 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Aggarwal, </em>17 F.3d 737, 743 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Rich complains that, in defining the money-laundering offense, the IRS agent failed to explain the intent element of the money-laundering statute. Assuming error, Rich\u2019s substantial rights were not affected because counsel cross-examined the IRS agent on this issue and because the jury was instructed by the district court about the elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Rich contends that the IRS agent should not have been permitted to state his legal conclusions as to ultimate issues \u2014 that the conduct underlying the money-laundering counts was bank fraud and money laundering. Rule 704(a) \u201cdoes not allow a witness to give legal conclusions ... [and] determinations of guilt or innocence are solely within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Izydore, </em>167 F.3d 213, 218 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). The IRS agent answered affirmatively when he was asked whether the transactions constituted money-laundering under the federal statute. Because these responses involved legal conclusions, the district court plainly erred in permitting this testimony. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>343 F.3d 423, 435 (5th Cir.2003). This court does not have discretion to reverse the conviction, however, because in light of the testimony provided by Connie Rocha regarding the money laundering counts and the court\u2019s instruction regarding the law, Rich has not shown that his substantial rights were affected. <em>See id. </em>at 435-36; <em>see also Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Rich contends that his sentence was imposed in violation of the rule in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Rich concedes that this court\u2019s review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Although Rich can show that there were <em>Booker </em>errors and that the errors were plain, he cannot show that the errors affected his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 520-21. There is no support in the record for concluding that the district court felt constrained by the then mandatory guideline-imprisonment range. <em>See id. </em>at 521. Accordingly, Rich\u2019s substantial rights were not affected. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
