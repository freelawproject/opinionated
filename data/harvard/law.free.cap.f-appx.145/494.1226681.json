We must examine the basis of our jurisdiction sua sponte if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is necessary for this court to exercise jurisdiction. <em>Robbins v. Maggio, </em>750 F.2d 405, 408 (5th Cir.1985). The magistrate judge, proceeding with the consent of the parties, entered final judgment in the instant case on September 14, 2004. Carr admits that he did not mail his notice of appeal until October 19, 2004. Carr\u2019s notice of appeal was therefore not filed within the 30 days for filing an appeal in a civil case. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). This court is thus without jurisdiction to consider Carr\u2019s case. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Carr\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
