On April 28, 2000, he was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. In February 2005, Bearden filed with the district court pleadings labeled \u201cNotice of Appeal Pursuant to 3742\u201d and \u201cReview of Sentence Title \u00a7 3742(a)(2)(3)(c),\u201d which the court properly construed as notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">In a criminal case, defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed within ten days after the entry of judgment or order being appealed. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). Because the time for appealing his sentence has expired, we dismiss this appeal as untimely. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
