Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-- -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.2005). Hip\u00f3lito makes no showing, as required by <em>Martinez-Lugo, </em>that the district court would likely have sentenced him differently under an advisory sentencing scheme. Similarly, there is no indication from the district court\u2019s remarks at sentencing that it would have reached a different conclusion. Thus, Hip\u00f3lito has not met his burden of persuasion to show that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence under a mandatory guideline scheme was plain error. <em>See Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-21\">Hip\u00f3lito also argues for the first time on appeal that the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Hip\u00f3lito acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
