This court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>217 F.3d 842 (4th Cir.2000) (unpublished). Seeking a second direct criminal appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2000), Moore filed a notice of appeal on May 3, 2005. We lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal, however, because it is untimely. Criminal defendants have ten days from the entry of the judgment or order at issue to file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Because Moore filed his notice of appeal nearly six years outside the appeal period, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-23\">To the extent that Moore seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order entered on October 17, 2002, accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denying his motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Moore\u2019s notice of appeal also is untimely as to that order. When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). Furthermore, this court has previously reviewed that order on appeal, denied a certificate of appealability, and dismissed the appeal. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>56 Fed.Appx. 182 (4th Cir.2003) (unpublished), cer<em>t. denied, </em>540 U.S. 842, 124 S.Ct. 110, 157 L.Ed.2d 76 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Finally, to the extent that we construe Moore\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief as an application to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>see United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003), we deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion because Moore\u2019s claims do not satisfy the conditions set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244, 2255 118 (2000). We deny Moore\u2019s motion to review sentence enhancements and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
