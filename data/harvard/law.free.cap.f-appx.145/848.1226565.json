Aguirre argues that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court clearly erred in increasing his sentence by finding by a preponderance of the evidence that he was responsible for an amount of marijuana beyond the 461 kilograms for which Aguirre admitted responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-25\">It is not necessary to consider Aguirre\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument because, as the Government argues, Aguirre\u2019s sentence should be vacated and the matter remanded for re-sentencing based on our holdings in four of Aguirre\u2019s co-indictees\u2019 appeals that the district court clearly erred in basing its findings of drug quantity on the statements of an informant who the Government had identified as unreliable. <em>See United States v. Ayala, </em>107 Fed.Appx. 410 (5th Cir.2004)(unpublished); <em>United States v. Trevino, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 549 (5th Cir.2005)(unpublished). There is no reason to reach a different result in Aguirre\u2019s case, and Aguirre\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the matter REMANDED remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Because we have vacated Aguirre\u2019s sentence, we do not consider Aguirre\u2019s arguments pertaining to the denial of a reduction in his offense level for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>acceptance of responsibility or that his sentence should be reversed because the Government breached its plea agreement. We GRANT the appellee\u2019s unopposed motion to seal the appellee\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">SENTENCE VACATED AND THE MATTER REMANDED; MOTION TO SEAL APPELLEE\u2019S BRIEF GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
