Mendoza argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by erroneously characterizing his state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). Mendoza\u2019s argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943), does not affect the binding precedential value of these opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-21\">Mendoza also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve his argument for further review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003). Mendoza further asserts that, if <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is overruled and if <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applies to the federal sentencing guidelines, his sentence could not be enhanced based on his prior convictions, unless they were submitted to a jury or admitted by him. As noted, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has not been overruled. This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d at 470 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Finally, Mendoza argues that the district court committed reversible error by imposing a sentence pursuant to the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines system that was held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Mendoza did not raise this objection in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The district court committed error that is plain by sentencing Mendoza under a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines scheme. <em>See id.; United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). However, Mendoza has not carried his burden of showing that the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733-34; <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b914-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
