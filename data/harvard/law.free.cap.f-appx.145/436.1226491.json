He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. We find there has been no undue delay in the district court. Gordon also challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s interpretation of North Carolina law. However, mandamus relief is not available on this claim because Gordon may challenge the district court\u2019s decision upon entry of final judgment on his \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See, e.g., In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the mandamus petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
