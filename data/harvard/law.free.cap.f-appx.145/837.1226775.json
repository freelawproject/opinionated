We have reviewed the record and the immigration judge\u2019s order and find that the immigration judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that Abedin failed to establish that counsel rendered ineffective assistance. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (setting forth standard of review). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
