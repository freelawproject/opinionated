The sentence was increased under the now-advisory sentencing guidelines based on the district court\u2019s finding that Williams possessed the firearm in connection with the felony of illegal discharge of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-21\">Williams fails to show that the district court plainly erred by applying the \u201cpreponderance\u201d standard, or by finding that Williams illegally discharged the firearm, or by declining to conclude sua sponte that the discharge of the weapon was justified by self-defense. <em>See United States v. Partida, </em>385 F.3d 546, 565 (5th Cir.2004) (plain error review), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Vigil v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1616, 161 L.Ed.2d 289 (2005). The judgment of the district court therefore is</p>\n<p id=\"b114-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b114-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
