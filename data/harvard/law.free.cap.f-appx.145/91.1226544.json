Zhang argues that the IJ erroneously concluded that he was not credible and ignored his substantial evidence that he faced persecution in China based on his religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">Zhang initially told immigration authorities in sworn statements that he came to the United States to work and that he did not fear persecution on religious grounds. The IJ determined that Zhang was not credible because the religious persecution claim was fabricated and developed only after Zhang arrived in the United States. The IJ concluded that Zhang\u2019s application for asylum was frivolous. The IJ rejected, as likewise unsupported, Zhang\u2019s claims for relief under the U.N. Convention against torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">\u201cWe give great deference to an IJ\u2019s decisions concerning an alien\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). In this regard, we have made it emphatically clear that we \u201cwill not review decisions turning purely on the immigration judge\u2019s assessment of the alien petitioner\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994) (quotation omitted). Based on the record, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and the record does not \u201ccompel! ]\u201d a contrary conclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-17\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b118-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
