California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel has also filed a motion to waive the requirements of Fed. R. App. P. 32(a)(4). This appeal is before the court following remand to the district court to address a jurisdictional issue. <em>See United States v. Alegria-Campa, </em>111 Fed.Appx. 266 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Alegria\u2019s original notice of appeal was not filed within 10 days of the entry of the judgment as required by Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). The district court determined that Alegr\u00eda failed to show good cause or excusable neglect justifying an extension of the time for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Golding, </em>739 F.2d 183, 184 (5th Cir.1984). Alegria filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s order, but counsel has not briefed whether that finding constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">We pretermit further briefing on the jurisdictional issue because we find that the appeal waiver contained in the plea agreement bars Alegria\u2019s appeal. <em>Cf. United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (dismissing for lack of jurisdiction, rather than remanding for determination of excusable neglect or good cause, because appeal was frivolous). An appeal precluded by an appeal waiver \u201cshould be dismissed.\u201d <em>United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 729 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION. Counsel\u2019s outstanding motions are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
