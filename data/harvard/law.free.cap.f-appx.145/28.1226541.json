The district court ordered that the prison term run consecutively to a 62-month federal prison term that had been imposed previously in the Middle District of North Carolina for unrelated convictions of illegal re-entry and possession of a false alien registration card.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Albarran argues that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. - , 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the consecutive sentence was \u201cunreasonable\u201d because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. He admits that this unpreserved allegation of error is reviewable for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2005 WL 816208 (2005). Albarran is not asserting a <em>Booker </em>error per se, because his contention does not involve a judicial determination of a \u201cfact ... which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by [Albarran\u2019s] plea of guilty.\u201d <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. The claim is effectively a challenge to the type of error made by the district court that sentenced the other respondent in <em>Booker, </em>Ducan Fanfan, i.e., the imposition of a sentence pursuant to a mandatory application of the Guidelines. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69; <em>see also Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 517-18, 520 n. 9 (noting the distinction between the two types of error asserted by the respondents in Booker). Sentencing a defendant pursuant to a mandatory guideline regime, standing alone, constitutes \u201cFanfan\u201d error, and such an error is \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69 (addressing preserved challenge in companion case); <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">In Albarran\u2019s case, the district court imposed a consecutive sentence pursuant to a discretionary statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a), and a guideline that was framed in discretionary terms, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) (Nov.1998). \u201cThere is no indication in the record from the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise,\u201d <em>see Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522, that the court wished to impose a concurrent sentence, either partially or completely. Because Albarran has not shown that the error affected his \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 521, he has not demonstrated plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-17\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
