She argues that (1) her base offense level was erroneously calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X4.1 at level 32; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>(2) her base offense level was erroneously enhanced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2003); and (3) her sentence contravened <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Tamayo did not object in the district court to the calculation of her base offense level on the basis urged on appeal, and, therefore, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), cert. <em>denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2005 WL 816208 (2005). Our review of the record does not reveal error plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">We review the district court\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). The record indicates that Tamayo\u2019s two-year flight to Mexico to avoid prosecution following her arrest was \u201cobstructive\u201d conduct and not an ordinary case of avoidance of arrest; therefore, the enhancement was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>210 F.3d 345, 348 (5th Cir. 2000); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.5(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Finally, Tamayo\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim, raised for the first time on appeal, does not survive plain error review because she cannot show that her substantial rights were affected. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-21. The district court\u2019s upward departure shows that it was not influenced by any factors argued in mitigation and that it chose the sentence it deemed appropriate under the circumstances. Furthermore, its decision to upwardly depart was discretionary. <em>See United States v. Warters, </em>885 F.2d 1266, 1275 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b57-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
