On appeal, Frank contends that the district court erred and violated her due process rights when it imposed a 24-month sentence in excess of the range established in section 7B1.4 of the sentencing guidelines because the court did not consider the Chapter 7 policy statements prior to imposing sentence. Frank notes that although the Chapter 7 guidelines are not binding, the district court must at least consider the Chapter 7 guidelines prior to imposing sentence after revocation of supervised release. Specifically, Frank maintains that court failed to consider the grade of the violation alleged in the revocation petition, as well as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4\u2019s sentencing range for violating supervised release, which, according to Frank\u2019s calculations, was 8 to 14 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Additionally, on appeal, Frank asserts the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence after revoking Frank\u2019s supervised release because the court failed to consider the Chapter 7 policy statements, and \u201cher criminal history [did] not establish her as being particularly deserving of harsh treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">\n<em>I. Frank\u2019s claim that the district court erred and violated Frank\u2019s due process rights by imposing a sentence above the presumptive guideline range, without allegedly considering the Chapter 7policy statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">Ordinarily, we review \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to exceed the Chapter 7 sentencing range for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 361 (11th Cir.1996). However, when a defendant fails to state clearly the grounds for an objection, her objection is waived on appeal and reviewed for plain error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Hayes, </em>40 F.3d 362, 364 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that when due process issues are not raised before the district court, this Court reviews due process claims for plain error). Also, when a defendant raises an argument for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Plain error exists when: (1) an error exists that, (2) is plain, (3) seriously affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Acevedo, </em>285 F.3d 1010, 1012 (11th Cir.2002). Here, we review Frank\u2019s claim that the district court erred by failing to consider the Chapter 7 policy statements before sentencing her under the plain error standard because she failed to raise this issue at the revocation hearing. <em>See Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Upon finding that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, a court, after considering factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7), may revoke a term of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include, in relevant part: \u201c(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed ... (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; ... (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for ... (B) in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission ...; and (5) any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The sentencing court \u201cshall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence, and, if the sentence ... is not of the kind, or is outside the range, described in subsection (a)(4), the specific reason for imposition of a sentence different from that described.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which governs violations of supervised release, contains policy statements. One of the policy statements, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, provides recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation. Policy statements are merely advisory and thus, non-binding. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSection 3553 requires a court only to <em>consider </em>[them] in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence\u201d upon revocation. <em>Id. </em>at 1302 (emphasis in original). It is enough if \u201cthere is some indication the district court was aware of and considered [the guidelines.]\u201d <em>Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In this case, a review of the transcript from the revocation hearing fails to reveal that there was, at a minimum, some indication that the district court was aware of and considered the sentencing guidelines. Although Frank advised the district court that the court could sentence her to (a) 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, with no supervised release to follow, or (b) a shorter term, with further supervision, there is nothing in the record to support the conclusion that the court implicitly considered and rejected the Chapter 7 guidelines. As such, the district court erred by failing to consider the applicable Chapter 7 sentencing range. <em>Cook, </em>291 F.3d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Nevertheless, assuming without deciding that Frank\u2019s applicable guideline range was 8-14 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court did not commit plain error in imposing Frank\u2019s sentence without considering the Chapter 7 range because her substantial rights were not seriously affected. In imposing a sentence for violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ing supervised release, a district court is not bound by the policy statements of Chapter 7 and is not \u201crestricted to the guideline range applicable at the time of the initial sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>See Cook, </em>291 F.3d at 1300. Here, the court\u2019s decision to sentence Frank to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment far exceeded the presumptive Chapter 7 sentencing range of 8 to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment, so it is unlikely that the court would have applied the Chapter 7 sentencing range had it explicitly considered it, especially given the district court\u2019s conclusion that Frank was \u201chopeless.\u201d Additionally, Frank was sentenced within the statutory maximum sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for the revocation of supervised release imposed for the violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, because (a) it is unlikely that the district court would have applied the Chapter 7 sentencing range, and (b) Frank was sentenced within the statutory maximum sentence, we hold that Frank\u2019s rights were not substantially affected by the court\u2019s failure to consider the Chapter 7 sentencing range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\n<em>II. Frank\u2019s claim that her sentence is unreasonable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing provisions <em>de novo </em>and the imposition of a sentence following revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Quinones, </em>136 F.3d 1293, 1294 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Thompson, </em>976 F.2d 1380, 1381 (11th Cir.1992)(held that a sentence of twenty-four months following the revocation of supervised release was not an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">A sentencing court, in imposing a sentence upon revocation of a defendant\u2019s supervised release, must consider the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the characteristics and history of the defendant, and the need to deter future criminal conduct and to protect the public. The Sentencing Commission expressly \u201cadopted [the] approach that ... at revocation the court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust, while taking in account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator.\u201d U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro, comment. (3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">In the instant case, Frank was sentenced to the statutory maximum sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for the revocation of supervised release imposed for the violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. The district court sentenced Frank to the maximum sentence because Frank had a previous forgery conviction, had three fraud convictions, and was currently on state probation for theft and forgery and theft by taking. Accordingly, the court determined that Frank\u2019s criminal behavior and similar course of conduct warranted the maximum sentence. Frank does not dispute the district court\u2019s findings regarding her criminal history. Nor does she contest the district court\u2019s finding that she violated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>conditions of her supervised release by (1) violating state law between April 1, 2002, and December 31, 2002, by making unauthorized credit purchases on company accounts without the prior knowledge or approval of her employer; (2) failing to make ordered restitution payments; (3) faffing to report to the probation officer as directed; and (4) associating with a convicted felon without the permission of the probation officer. While each of Frank\u2019s underlying violations may not have been severe individually, it is evident that she continuously ignored the explicit conditions of her supervised release. This pattern of disregard for the system demonstrates a breach of trust sufficient to support the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Frank to the statutory maximum of 24 months. U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro, comment. (3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Accordingly, we hold that (1) the district court\u2019s apparent failure to consider the presumptive sentencing range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 did not prejudice Frank\u2019s substantial rights as the sentence imposed far exceeded the presumptive range under \u00a7 7B1.4, indicating that consideration of the \u00a7 7B1.4 range would not have influenced the length of Frank\u2019s sentence; and (2) Frank\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable, given her violation of state law, and other non-compliance with the conditions of her release.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">. Frank was convicted of interstate transportation of stolen property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, an offense punishable by imprisonment of not more than 10 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. An offense is classified as a Class C felony if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is less than 25 years but 10 or more years. 18 \u00a7 3559(a)(3). The court may impose a term of imprisonment, not to exceed 2 years if the offense that resulted in the supervised release was a Class C felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-12\">. Because Frank\u2019s rights were not substantially affected by the court's failure to consider the Chapter 7 sentencing range, Frank's due process claims are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
