On April 24, 1995, pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pled guilty to Count One of the indictment which alleged a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The plea agreement contained a provision that called for the Government to move the district court pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 to impose a sentence below the Guidelines sentence range in the event appellant provided the Government with \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d prior to sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If appellant did not provide such assistance, the Government was required to recommend a sentence at the bottom of the sentence range. Appellant failed to provide the substantial assistance contemplated, so at sentencing, the Government recommended that the court sentence appellant to a prison term of 210 months, the bottom of the Guidelines sentence range of 210-262 months. The court followed the Government\u2019s recommendation and sentenced appellant to a prison term of 210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-16\">Appellant did not appeal his sentence. Instead, on June 10, 1999, he moved the district court to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on the ground that the Government had breached the plea agreement (1) by not recommending a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure at the time of sentencing and (2) by failing to move the court to reduce his sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. The court denied his motion. Appellant did not appeal the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-17\">On August 27, 2001, appellant moved the court to compel the Government to file a Rule 35 motion for sentence reduction. The court denied the motion, and appellant did not appeal the ruling. Appellant returned to the court with essentially the same motion on February 9, 2005, and the court denied it on February 14, 2005. Appellant filed a timely Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the February 14 ruling. The court denied the motion, and appellant took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-18\">In his brief, appellant contends (1) that the district court erred when, without holding an evidentiary hearing, it denied his motion to compel the Government to file a Rule 35 motion, (2) that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion prior to sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>tencing, and (3) that his guilty plea was involuntary because he did not \u201cknow the consequences of his plea in light of being deprived of the expected downward departure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Appellant should have raised the \u00a7 5K1.1 issue at sentencing, but did not. He did raise it along with the Rule 35 issue in the \u00a7 2255 motion he filed on June 10, 1999, which, as noted above, the court denied. What appellant alleges in the motion before us is essentially what he alleged in the \u00a7 2255 motion he filed on June 10, 1999. That motion sought the same relief his current motion seeks: the enforcement of a plea agreement allegedly containing the Government\u2019s promise to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion at sentencing or a Rule 35 motion post sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s current motion is, though brought under Rule 35 rather than \u00a7 2255, nothing more than a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion because appellant had not obtained this court\u2019s leave to file it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-12\">. Contrary to what appellant contends in the Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 matter now before us, the plea agreement did not obligate the Government (at some point after sentencing) to move the court pursuant to Rule 35 to reduce his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\">. We note in passing that appellant\u2019s overstates the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 promise and that the plea agreement is silent as to Rule 35, meaning that the Government has no obligation to file a Rule 35 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
