Williams argues that his sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court applied a sentence enhancement for possession of a firearm that was neither admitted nor found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court applied its holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to the federal sentencing guidelines and reaffirmed that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The Court also excised 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) of the Sentencing Reform Act, rendering the federal sentencing guidelines effectively advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-17\">Williams preserved a <em>Booker </em>issue for appeal by objecting in the district court based on <em>Blakely. See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285 (5th Cir.2005). The Government does not contest Williams\u2019s assertion that he did not admit the facts necessary for the firearm enhancement, and it concedes that error occurred because the sentence was based on a mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. The Government also concedes that it cannot meet its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that error was harmless. We agree and VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing. <em>See Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-18\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b872-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
