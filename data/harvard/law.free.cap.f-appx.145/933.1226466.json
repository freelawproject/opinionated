Bishop, </em>115 Fed. Appx. 217, No. 04-50014, 2004 WL 2913893 (5th Cir. Dec.16, 2004). The Supreme Court granted Bishop\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated our previous judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Bishop v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1937, 161 L.Ed.2d 763 (2005). We received supplemental briefs addressing <em>Booker\u2019s </em>impact, and Bishop\u2019s motion to file a supplemental reply brief is GRANTED. Having reconsidered our decision pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, we reinstate our judgment affirming the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-20\">Our review of the full record, in light of Bishop\u2019s supplemental reply brief, convinces us that Bishop challenged the constitutionality of his sentence on the principles of <em>Booker </em>for the first time in his petition for writ of certiorari. Absent extraordinary circumstances, we will not consider a defendant\u2019s Booker-related claims presented for the first time in a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 675 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-21\">Bishop has presented no evidence of extraordinary circumstances. Even if a showing of such circumstances were not required, because Bishop did not raise his <em>Booker </em>claim in district court, any review would be only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Bishop\u2019s claim fails the third prong of plain-error review because he does not show any error affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 521. That is, he makes no \u201cshowing that the error ... affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Bishop contends that the district court committed \u201cstructural error\u201d when it sentenced him under a mandatory guidelines system and that prejudice to his substantial rights should be presumed. We have rejected this contention as inconsistent with <em>Mares. See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 04-5297). Because Bishop fails plain-error review, he also falls short of showing the \u201cpossibility of injustice so grave as to warrant disregard of usual procedural rules,\u201d which is required to establish extraordinary circumstances. <em>See United States v. Ogle, </em>415 F.3d 382 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">We conclude, therefore, that nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case. We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence as set by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Bishop\u2019s motion to file a supplemental reply brief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL REPLY BRIEF GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b960-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
