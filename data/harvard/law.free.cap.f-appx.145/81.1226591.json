He contends, for the first time on appeal, that the district court\u2019s application of the formerly mandatory guideline sentencing scheme constituted per se reversible plain error, without consideration whether the district court might have imposed a lower sentence under the current, advisory sentencing scheme and that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional facially and as applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-25\">Reyna correctly concedes that both of his contentions are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedents, but he raises them to preserve them for further review. First, a \u201cFanfan\u201d error raised for the first time on appeal is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-26\">Reyna concedes that he cannot make a showing of prejudice because the district court did not indicate what it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>done under an advisory guideline sentencing scheme. Nothing in the record suggests that the district court might have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory guideline sentencing scheme. Reyna thus has not shown that his substantial rights were implicated. <em>See id. </em>at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Second, <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). The Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262-63, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 769, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), also did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1262-63 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5; <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (reaffirming <em>Apprendi); Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2536 (same). This court therefore must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b107-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
