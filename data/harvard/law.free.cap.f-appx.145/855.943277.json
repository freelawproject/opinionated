Because there is significant record evidence that Dupre knowingly failed to make a full and complete disclosure of his assets, we find no clear error in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings of fact supporting denial of discharge under both subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-14\">2. Specifically, we find the cumulation of Dupre\u2019s repeated schedule omissions and inconsistent testimony regarding the ownership and possession of certain assets to evidence a pattern of disregard for the truth that supports fraudulent intent. <em>See In re Sholdra, </em>249 F.3d 380, 382-83 (5th Cir.2001) (finding that the cumulative effect of a series of falsehoods in a bankruptcy proceeding indicates a pattern of \u201creckless and cavalier disregard for the truth\u201d supporting fraudulent intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-15\">3. We find no clear error in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s rejection of Dupre\u2019s reliance on counsel as a valid defense to his omission of assets from the schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-16\">4. Specifically, there is record evidence that Dupre did not make a full disclosure of all pertinent facts about his assets to his attorney. <em>See Dil-worth v. Boothe, </em>69 F.2d 621, 623 (5th Cir.1934) (stating that a reliance-on-counsel defense to asset omission requires full disclosure to the attorney). Further, Dupre\u2019s statements during the trustee\u2019s inventory and his trial testimony belie his claim of ignorance as to the ownership of marital assets. Finally, even after learning of his obligation to report certain property, Dupre failed to include property in his amended schedules. Because of Dupre\u2019s failure to fully inform his attorney, his inconsistent statements regarding asset ownership, his persistent omissions, and his previous experience with bankruptcy proceedings, Dupre\u2019s claim of reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>on counsel is neither reasonable nor credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1100-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
