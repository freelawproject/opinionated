Petitioners claim that the BIA violated its own regulations by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. As we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision and found no error, this argument is unavailing. <em>See Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 662-63 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Petitions also contend that the IJ erroneously concluded that Salazar was not credible and erroneously failed to find persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion. Petitioners\u2019 cursory argument challenging the credibility determination is conclusional, fails to cite to the record, and is inadequately briefed. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Further, we conclude from our review of the record that the IJ\u2019s decision denying relief is supported by substantial evidence and that the record evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Petitioners have not briefed separate claims for relief under the CAT, so those claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Finally, Petitioners insist that the requirement of INA \u00a7 240B(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b), that an alien be present in the United States for at least one year to be eligible for post-hearing voluntary removal, violates equal protection. We agree with the Government that one rational basis for the statute is to permit aliens with at least one year\u2019s presence in the United States to settle their affairs before departing because such aliens are more likely to have accumulated sufficient interests to warrant the time afforded by voluntary departure. <em>See Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
