On appeal, Orovio argues that the district court erred by denying him a role reduction because: (1) he was less culpable than most other participants and was not a leader, manager, or organizer; and (2) his relevant conduct was limited to one shipment of cocaine, and not the larger drug distribution conspiracy. Orivio also argues that the district court erred by simply imposing the minimum sentence in the guideline range, under a mandatory guidelines system, without considering the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as is now required under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">I. <em>Mittgating-Role Reduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The proponent of the reduction bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by four levels if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the criminal activity, or by two levels if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(a), (b). In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Because the record demonstrates that Orovio (1) was held accountable only for those drugs that he handled, and (2) failed to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his conduct in steering the boat and throwing the cocaine into the water rendered him less culpable than other identifiable participants, the district court did not clearly err by denying his request for a mitigating-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">II. <em>Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Because Orovio failed to lodge an objection to his sentence based on <em>Booker, </em>or any constitutional grounds, in the court below, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a right to a jury trial. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750-56. The Court ruled that sentencing courts nevertheless must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when imposing sentences. <em>Id. 125 </em>S.Ct. at 765. We have held that plain error exists where a district court imposes a sentence under the formerly binding, mandatory guidelines. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). We have further held, however, that, in order to prove that the error affected his substantial rights, the third prong of plain error review, a defendant must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion by the sentencing judge in this case.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). Where \u201c[t]he record provides no reason to believe any result is more likely than the other,\u201d a defendant cannot prevail under plain error review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Because Orovio has failed to show that there is a reasonable probability that the district court\u2019s error in sentencing him under a mandatory guideline system affected the outcome of his sentence, no reversible plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Orovio\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
