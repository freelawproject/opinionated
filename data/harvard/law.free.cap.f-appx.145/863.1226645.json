Bounds filed an application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging the manner in which the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) calculates the amount of good-time credits received during the term of incarceration. The district court dismissed the application. Subsequently, Bounds filed a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), arguing that he should be relieved from the judgment denying his application due to extraordinary circumstances. The district court denied the motion, and Bounds filed an appeal with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-24\">Bounds brief on appeal fails to address the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion, instead focusing entirely on the merits of his underlying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 claim. We lack jurisdiction to review the denial Bounds\u2019 underlying action because he failed to file a timely notice of appeal from that judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185, 186 (5th Cir.1994). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Our jurisdiction is limited to the question of whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Bounds\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). Because Bounds fails to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion, the court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Bounds also filed a motion to supplement the record with the BOP\u2019s program statement. Because Bounds has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 60(b) motion, it is unnecessary to supplement the record with the requested document. The motion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b889-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-25\">. We note, however, that we rejected a similar challenge to the BOP\u2019s method of calculating good time credit in the recent decision, <em>Sample v. Morrison, </em>406 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2005). We determined that the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) supports the BOP's method of calculating good time credit. <em>Id. </em>at 313. Alternatively, we concluded the statute is ambiguous and that the BOP\u2019s interpretation is entitled to deference pursuant to <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
