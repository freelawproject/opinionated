The district court sentenced Laffoon to 71 months of imprisonment on the bank-robbery conviction and to the statutory minimum sentence of 384 months (32 years) of imprisonment on the firearms convictions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00a9, 2113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Laffoon argues that the mandatory minimum sentences imposed on his firearms convictions violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because they fail to take into account his mental retardation. Citing <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002), which held that the Eighth Amendment protects against the execution of mentally retarded defendants, he argues that the Supreme Court has recognized that persons with reduced mental capabilities do not act with the same level of moral culpability as other offenders. He argues that the mandatory minimums set forth in \u00a7 924(c) are unconstitutional because they fail to account for the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded. He makes no other challenge to his sentence. We review the constitutionality of a federal statute <em>de novo. United States v. Rasco, </em>123 F.3d 222, 226 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-17\">With the exception <em>of </em>a capital sentence, the imposition of a mandatory sentence without consideration of mitigating factors does not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 994-95, <em>111 </em>S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991). As the Supreme Court has continually recognized a distinction between capital and noncapital sentences, <em>see Harmelin, </em>501 U.S. at 995, 111 S.Ct. 2680, Laffooris reliance on <em>Atkins </em>to extend its rationale to noncapital cases is unavailing. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b991-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
