As he concedes, this contention is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">Quezada also contends that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory application of the Guidelines prohibited by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -- -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 769, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). Although there was an error under <em>Booker, </em>Quezada fails to \u201cdemonstrate a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome ... that the district judge would have imposed a different sentence\u201d under advisory guidelines. <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Quezada therefore fails to show that the error affected his substantial rights as is necessary under the plain-error standard. <em>See id.; United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 502, 521-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-20\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b959-14\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
