An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 motion solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Cowles has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-19\">Finally, in accordance with <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003), we construe Cowles\u2019 notice of appeal and informal brief as an implied motion for authorization under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2245 (2000), to file a successive habeas corpus motion. To obtain permission to bring a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must show that his claim: (1) \u201crelies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable\u201d or (2) relies on newly discovered facts that tend to establish the movant\u2019s innocence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. We conclude that Cowles has not satisfied either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-20\">Accordingly, we deny Cowles\u2019 implicit application for leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, deny Cowles\u2019 motion for certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
