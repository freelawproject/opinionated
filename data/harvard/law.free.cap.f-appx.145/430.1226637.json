The district court correctly found that no provision exists that allows for the \u201creopening\u201d of \u00a7 2255 motions that have been addressed on the merits by the district court, and that the district court had no jurisdiction to consider a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">In accordance with <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003), we consider Davis\u2019 notice of appeal and informal brief as a motion for authorization under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000) to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. To obtain permission to bring a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must show that his claim: (1) \u201crelies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable\u201d or (2) relies on newly discovered facts that tend to establish the movant\u2019s innocence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000). We conclude that Davis has not satisfied either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny Davis\u2019 implicit application for leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-12\"> Because this was not Davis\u2019 first \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court was not required to notify Davis prior to construing the motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and we accordingly reject Davis\u2019 challenge to the district court's action in this regard. <em>See United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644, 650 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
