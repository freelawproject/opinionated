First, we note that we have jurisdiction over this appeal despite the fact that the district court did not enter a separate judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-23\">Citing Istre <em>v. Apfel, </em>208 F.3d 517, 519 (5th Cir.2000), Metoyer argues that the district court\u2019s remand order is not a proper remand under sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). This case is distinguishable from <em>Istre. </em>Here, the district court provided two substantive rulings on the ALJ\u2019s decision: determining that a later administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in not considering the evidence on which the prior ALJ had based his decision and that the later ALJ properly had discounted a vocational expert\u2019s testimony. Thus, the district court\u2019s remand is proper under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>Cf. Istre, </em>208 F.3d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Metoyer also argues that, because the Commissioner did not appeal the ALJ\u2019s May 1999 denial of SSI benefits, that decision, which made a step-four decision that she could not return to any of her past relevant work, is final. Therefore, she argues that the district court\u2019s decision should be reversed and remanded to the Commissioner for a step-five determination of whether any alternate jobs exist in the national economy in which Metoyer might realistically perform. Because the district court correctly found that the Commissioner had not reweighed the facts upon which the prior determination was based, the district court\u2019s determination that remand is necessary is correct, and Metoyer\u2019s argument that reversal is mandated fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Metoyer also asserts that the vocational and disability reports show that she was an advertising supplement inserter only on a part-time basis. Thus, she argues that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that she could return to her past work as an advertising supplement inserter is not supported by substantial evidence and violates Social Security Ruling 96-8p. Metoyer\u2019s argument is another challenge to the ALJ\u2019s step-four determination, which the district court has remanded for reconsideration of Metoyer\u2019s residual functional capacity and ability to return to past employment. In light of the fact that the ALJ\u2019s step-four determination has been vacated by the district court\u2019s order, her argument to this court about the incorrectness of the ALJ\u2019s step-four determination is moot. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
