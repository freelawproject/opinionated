DeBardeleben seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing as successive his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Jones v. Braxton, </em>392 F.3d 683, 688 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appeal-ability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>both that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that DeBardeleben has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certif\u00edcate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. No active judge of this court has voted to grant hearing en banc; therefore, we deny DeBardeleben\u2019s petition for initial hearing en banc. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
