Sanchez-Pena, </em>115 Fed.Appx. 710 (5th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Sanchez-Pena v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1953, 161 L.Ed.2d 768 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-23\">Sanchez contends that the district court illegally sentenced him pursuant to a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime, in violation of <em>Booker. </em>He concedes that such argument is raised for the first time and is reviewable for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2005 WL 816208 (2005). Sentencing a defendant pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme, standing alone, constitutes <em>\u201cFanfan\u201d </em>error, and such an error is \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69 (addressing preserved challenge in companion case); <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>To satisfy the third prong of the plain-error test, Sanchez must show that his \u201csubstantial rights\u201d were affected. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 732. \u201cThe pertinent question is whether [the appellant] demonstrated that the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one\u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521. This question requires us to assess whether \u201cthere is [an] indication in the record from the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise that gives us any clue as to whether [ ]he would have reached a different conclusion\u201d if sentencing under an advisory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 522. That the district court sentenced Sanchez at the bottom of his 33 to 41-month guideline imprisonment range, standing alone, is no indication that the district court would have reached a different result under an advisory guidelines regime. <em>United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317-18 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005). To the extent that Sanchez contends that application of the mandatory Guidelines regime is a \u201cstructural\u201d error that is not susceptible to a plain-error analysis, or that he alternatively contends that plain-error prejudice should be presumed, this court recently rejected such arguments. <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b73-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
