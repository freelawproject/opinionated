Ighodaro argues that the IJ erred in denying his application for cancellation of removal because 181 of the 211 days that he spent in jail in connection with his two assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>convictions constituted pretrial detention and did not therefore occur \u201cas a result of conviction\u201d as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(7). He further argues that the IJ erred in considering his criminal record when reviewing his application for adjustment of status and that the IJ erred in finding that he had filed numerous frivolous applications for immigration benefits. These arguments were not administratively exhausted and, thus, they are not considered by this court. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). Ighodaro\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated at the hearing before the IJ is also unexhausted and not adequately briefed. <em>See Wang, </em>260 F.3d at 452-53; <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In addition, we cannot glean from the petition for review whether Ighodaro is complaining that the IJ failed to rule on his application for a waiver of excludability under INA \u00a7 212(h) or that the IJ denied this application but failed to give reasons for its denial. He provides no legal authority for his assertion that the IJ was required to give reasons for denying an application for a waiver of excludability. Accordingly, we consider any challenge regarding his application for a waiver of excludability abandoned. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25; <em>Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833; <em>see also Westover v. Reno, </em>202 F.3d 475, 481 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Ighodaro argues that he has a statutory right to an administrative appeal in his deportation proceedings and that the BIA\u2019s ability to affirm without an opinion has resulted in mass production appellate review that is review in name only. This argument is without merit. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b); <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 376, 378-79 (1st Cir.2003). Ighodaro further argues that his case did not meet the BIA\u2019s requirements for issuance of an affirmance without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). Because Ighodaro has not shown any error by the IJ, he has failed to show that there was error with respect to the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance. To the extent Ighodaro argues that the summary affirmance violated his due process rights, the argument is without merit. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 832-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
