Ramirez contends that his prior state conviction for possession of a controlled substance is not a qualifying aggravated felony because it is not a felony under federal law. Although Ramirez acknowledges that the decisions in <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310 (5th Cir. 2001), and <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691 (5th Cir.1997), appear to foreclose this argument, he asserts that these decisions are not binding because they conflict with <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Our precedent is clear that Congress made a \u201cdeliberate policy decision to include as an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 a drug crime that is a felony under state law but only a misdemeanor under the [Controlled Substances Act].\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Avalos, </em>251 F.3d 505, 510 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, a prior conviction for a state drug offense will qualify as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) if it is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act and it is punishable by more than a year of imprisonment under the applicable state law. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 576-77 (5th Cir.2005). Ramirez does not dispute that his state offense was punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or that the offense was a felony under state law. This argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">Ramirez also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Ramirez\u2019s argument is, as he concedes, foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2005 WL 1786638 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">Ramirez also contends that his sentence is improper under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He concedes that the plain-error standard of review applies. Ramirez has not shown that the district court would have imposed a different sentence under an advisory sentencing scheme. Thus, Ramirez has not shown plain error in connection with his sentence. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600-01 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b82-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
