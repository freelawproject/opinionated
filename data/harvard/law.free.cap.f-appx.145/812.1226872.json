Lanham appealed. Prior to the submissions of briefs, Lanham sought remand to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). His motion to remand stated that his challenge to his sentence \u201cis the only-issue that Mr. Lanham would pursue on appeal.\u201d The Government filed its written consent to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">We have independently reviewed the matter and conclude that remand is appropriate. Accordingly, we grant Lanham\u2019s motion to remand for the limited purpose of resentencing under <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-9\">. We note that although there was an appellate waiver in Lanham\u2019s plea agreement, this case is distinguishable from our recent decision in <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162 (4th Cir.2005), because the Government here has not sought to enforce the waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-10\">. <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (applying Booker on plain error review). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
