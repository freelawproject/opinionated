R.Civ.P. 60(b). <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>- U.S. -,-, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2648, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 207 (4th Cir.2003). Rather than seeking to file new claims pursuant to \u00a7 2255, Zapata-Vicente argued in his letter that he filed his amended \u00a7 2255 motion within the time originally allotted to him by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-22\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for the court to consider Zapata-Vicente\u2019s letter pursuant to Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We express no opinion as to whether Zapata-Vicente is entitled to relief under Rule 60(b). We deny ZapataVieente\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-23\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-18\"> We note that a certificate of appealability was granted below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
