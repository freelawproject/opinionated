McKendall, Louisiana state prisoner # 234949, has filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) upon an appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action. By moving for IFP status, McKendall is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">McKendall has faded to challenge specifically the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his claim that the defendants have a duty to notify him regarding chemical releases at area chemical plaints. Although this court liberally construes pro se briefs, see <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), the court requires arguments to be briefed in order to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Because McKendall has failed to address this ruling, he has abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>See id. </em>He also has failed to show that the district court erred by dismissing his other four claims without prejudice for not having exhausted his administrative remedies relative to them. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997(e); <em>Wendell v. Asher, </em>162 F.3d 887, 890-92 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-18\">Therefore, McKendall\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). McKendall therefore has two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), including one based on the district court\u2019s dismissal. McKendall is warned that if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-19\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
