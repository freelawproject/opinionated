He renews his argument, preserved in the district court, that his constitutional rights were violated when the district court assessed a two-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (obstruction of justice), based on judicially determined facts, citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Pursuant to the recent decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), for sentencing errors preserved in the district court, \u201cwe will ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand,\u201d unless the error is harmless. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005). The two-level enhancement here violated Johnson\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Given the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing, the Government cannot carry its burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthat the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error.\u201d <em>Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Johnson\u2019s sentence is vacated, and this case is remanded for resentencing. <em>See Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
