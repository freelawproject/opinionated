Salgado-Avila argues that the district court plainly erred in applying the Sentencing Guidelines in a mandatory manner. He contends that, because this error was structural in nature, prejudice should be presumed, and we should exercise our discretion to reverse the sentence. He also argues that in the event that this court holds that <em>United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376 (5th Cir.2005), and <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517), control the outcome of his appeal, he wishes to preserve for possible future review his argument that those cases were wrongly decided and conflict with other circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">Here, the district court erred by imposing a sentence pursuant to a mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 768, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>see also Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-21 &amp; n. 9. However, Salgado-Avila has not established that this error affected his substantial rights because the record does not demonstrate that the sentencing court would have imposed a different sentence had it been proceeding under an advisory guideline scheme. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733-34 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>(5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005)(No. 05-5556).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Salgado-Avila also argues that, given <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible further review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b92-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
