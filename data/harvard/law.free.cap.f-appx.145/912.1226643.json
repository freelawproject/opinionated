For the first time on appeal, Mendoza argues that the district court erred in imposing a sentence under a mandatory guideline scheme, in violation of <em>United States v. </em>Booker; \u2014 U.S. -, ---, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He contends that the error is structural and that prejudice should be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-25\">We review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). To obtain relief under the plain error standard, Mendoza must show: (1) that there was an error; (2) that the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Even if these requirements are met, this court has the discretion to correct the plain error and will exercise that discretion only if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-26\">Mendoza\u2019s contention that the sentencing error was structural and that he thus need not show prejudice is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number><em>filed </em>(July 11, 2005)(No. 05-5297). Because there is no indication in the record, based on the district judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise, that provides any indication that the district court would likely have reached a different conclusion if sentencing under the <em>Booker </em>advisory regime, Mendoza has failed to satisfy his burden of establishing plain error. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Mendoza also argues, citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (2) are unconstitutional. He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. Apprendi, 530 U.S. </em>at 489-90,120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation and citation omitted); <em>see also Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.2000) (noting that the Supreme Court has admonished lower courts to follow directly applicable precedent even if it appears weakened by subsequent decisions). Mendoza\u2019s argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b938-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
