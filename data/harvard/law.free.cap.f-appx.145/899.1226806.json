Because Hernandez was convicted prior to deportation of attempted sexual abuse of a minor, he was sentenced, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), to a 50-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">Hernandez contends that his sentence should be vacated because it was imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional mandatory guidelines system, contrary to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 125 S.Ct. 738, 768-69, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a so-called <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.2005). Hernandez concedes that this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See id.; United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Under the third-prong of the plain-error analysis, Hernandez must show that the error affected his substantial rights in that it \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 600 (quotation marks omitted). Hernandez does not contend that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings and there is nothing in the record to suggest otherwise. <em>See United States v. Inman, </em>411 F.3d 591, 595 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 395 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-21\">Hernandez contends instead that prejudice should be presumed or that a showing of prejudice should not be required because the error was \u201cstructural and insusceptible of harmless error analysis.\u201d An identical argument was rejected in <em>Martinez-Lugo. See Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 601; <em>see also United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297). Hernandez has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>shown that the district court plainly erred by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory guideline scheme. <em>See Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Hernandez contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that he should be resentenced in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Hernandez recognizes that relief is foreclosed; he raises the issue to preserve it for further review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
