His argument that the Immigration and Naturalization Service failed to follow 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.3 in obtaining his signatures on the 1998 and 1999 voluntary departure agreements will not be addressed because it was unexhausted before the BIA. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">De Jesus argues, without any legal authority, that minors cannot enter into voluntary departure agreements. We deem this issue abandoned as it is inadequately briefed. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Villanueva v. CNA Ins. Cos., </em>868 F.2d 684, 687 n. 5 (5th Cir.1989). Additionally, De Jesus\u2019s argument that his voluntary departures resulted in a denial of due process because he was unfairly deprived of the benefit of applying for cancellation of removal is without merit. \u201cEligibility for discretionary relief from a removal order is not \u2018a liberty or property interest warranting due process protection.\u2019\u201d <em>See MirelesValdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 215, 219 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, De Jesus\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1004-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
