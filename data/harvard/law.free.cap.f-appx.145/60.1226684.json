Devita, </em>86 Fed.Appx. 738 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court granted DeVita\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari and for leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis; </em>vacated our previous judgment; and remanded the case for further consideration in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>DeVita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1032, 160 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-27\">We requested supplemental briefs from the parties addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>DeVita filed a supplemental brief, claiming reversible plain error; citing new authority, discussed below, the Government moved to reinstate the prior affirmance of DeVita\u2019s conviction and sentence, or, in the alternative, for an extension of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>time to file its supplemental brief. Other than advising the Government that she opposes its motion, DeVita did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">DeVita did not raise <em>Booker-error </em>until her petition for writ of certiorari. Absent extraordinary circumstances, we will not consider a defendant\u2019s Booker-related claims presented for the first time in a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). DeVita has not demonstrated the requisite extraordinary circumstances. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">IT IS ORDERED that Appellee\u2019s motion to reinstate prior affirmance of Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Appellee\u2019s alternative request for an extension of time of 14 days from the court\u2019s denial of the motion to reinstate prior affirmance of Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence to file its supplemental brief is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b86-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
