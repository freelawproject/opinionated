Grain Dealers\u2019s argued in its motion for summary judgment that the Steeds could not succeed on their breach of contract cause of action because the insurance policy was void due to material misrepresentations made by Joan Steed. It submitted evidence supporting its claim of material misrepresentations. It also argued that the Steeds could not succeed on their bad faith claims denial cause of action because they had no evidence that Grain Dealers acted maliciously in denying the claim. To survive summary judgment, the Steeds were then required to \u201csubmit or identify evidence in the record to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to each element of the cause[s] of action,\u201d Mal<em>acara v. Garber, </em>353 F.3d 393, 404 (5th Cir.2003), and articulate how that evidence supported their claims, <em>Smith v. United States, </em>391 F.3d 621, 625 (5th Cir.2004).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-15\">2. The Steeds\u2019 statement in their \u201cResponse to Summary Judgment Motion and Request for a Continuance\u201d that they \u201cdeny making any misrepresentations during the application or claims process and further believe that Defendant is guilty of wrongful post claims underwriting\u201d was insufficient to discharge their summary judgment burden. <em>See Duffy v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc., </em>44 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201c[Cjonclusory allegations unsupported by concrete and particular facts will not prevent an award of summary judgment.\u201d). Nor was that burden discharged by the fact that Grain Dealers\u2019s summary judgment evidence contained sworn testimony by Joan Steed denying having made misrepresentations. The Steeds did not identify that evidence to the district court. <em>Malacara, </em>353 F.3d at 405 (\u201cWhen evidence exists in the sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>mary judgment record but the nonmovant fails even to refer to it in the response to the motion for summary judgment, that evidence is not properly before the district court.\u201d). Because the Steeds failed to respond to Grain Dealers\u2019s summary judgment motion by identifying or submitting evidence establishing a genuine issue for trial, summary judgment was proper. <em>See id. </em>at 404.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b994-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
