In the district court, Aviles objected under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to sentencing increases based on the career-offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 was itself \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d This second allegation effectively raises the type of error raised by the other respondent in <em>Booker, </em>Ducan Fanfan, i.e., that imposition of a sentence pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines regime violated his rights. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69; <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, (5th Cir.2005). The Government concedes that it cannot show harmless error as to Aviles\u2019s \u201cFanfan\u201d-type claim. Because the Government admits that it cannot show that the district court would not have sentenced Aviles differently under an advisory Guidelines system, <em>see United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 (5th Cir.2005), we REMAND for the district court to decide if resentencing is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
