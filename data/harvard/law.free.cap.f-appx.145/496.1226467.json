We affirm for these reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-32\">1. None of the acts of defendants as alleged by Chapman in her complaint involved the violation of a constitutional right, and therefore, she has failed to state a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>Doe v. Rains County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>66 F.3d 1402, 1406 (5th Cir.1995). A violation of state law is not cognizable under section 1983. <em>Giovanni v. Lynn, </em>48 F.3d 908, 912-13 (5th Cir.1995). Chapman\u2019s conclusory allegation that her \u201ccivil rights\u201d were violated is an insufficient basis for a section 1983 claim. <em>Kinash v. Callahan, </em>129 F.3d 736, 738 (5th Cir.1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">2. In addition, Chapman does not allege in her complaint that (1) she is a member of a racial minority, or (2) defendants intentionally discriminated against her, necessary elements to support a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982. <em>Green v. State Bar of Texas, </em>27 F.3d 1083, 1086 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Bellows v. Amoco Oil, </em>118 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">3. Further, we cannot discern from the complaint the manner in which Chapman has been discriminated against based on a disability, nor can we tell what disability forms the basis of the alleged discrimination. Accordingly, Chapman\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
