See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b821-21\">PER CURIAM:</p>\n<p id=\"b821-22\">Ronald Fitch pled guilty to distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000). In his plea agreement and at the guilty plea hearing, Fitch admitted to no specific quantity of cocaine base distribution. At sentencing, the district court found, over Fitch\u2019s objection, that judicial factfinding was permissible after <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-23\">In assessing an alleged admission to police that Fitch sold an \u201ceight-ball\u201d of cocaine base per week for \u201ca couple of months,\u201d the district court found at the sentencing hearing that the arresting officer\u2019s testimony was more credible than Fitch\u2019s denial; when added to amounts of cocaine sold to a confidential informant and seized from Fitch\u2019s residence, the quantity of drugs for which the district court held Fitch responsible yielded a base offense level of twenty-eight. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Fitch possessed a firearm in connection with the drug trade, under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2003), and applied a two-level sentence enhancement accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">After being credited with a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), Fitch\u2019s offense level was set at twenty-seven. This offense level provides for a sentencing range of 70-87 months for Fitch\u2019s criminal history category. Fitch was sentenced to seventy-eight months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by six years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">On appeal, Fitch does not challenge his conviction. He does, however, argue that his base offense level was calculated, in part, based on judicial fact-finding in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree. While we affirm Fitch\u2019s conviction, we vacate his sentence because it was greater than that authorized by the facts he admitted in his guilty plea. We therefore remand the case for resentencing in accordance with Booker.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-9\">. Fitch preserved this issue for appeal by raising it in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-10\">. Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Fitch\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
