Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (Jan. 12, 2005). We vacate the sentence and remand for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-11\">1. Because Benavides preserved the <em>Booker </em>issue by objecting in the district court, we review under the harmless error standard. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376 (5th Cir.2005)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-12\">2. \u201cHarmless error is \u2018[a]ny defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights\u2019 of the defendant, and \u2018arises when the mistake fails to prejudice the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a)). In reviewing <em>Booker </em>issues for harmless error, the government must show that the <em>Booker </em>error was harmless by demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced differently absent the erroneous factor. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-17\">3. The district court erred in applying a one-level enhancement to Benavides\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(l)(A) based on the face value of counterfeit items involved in counts of the indictment to which Benavides did not plead guilty and that were dismissed by the Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-18\">3. The Government has failed to show beyond reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced differently absent the <em>Booker </em>error. The district court\u2019s only comments related to the Sentencing Guidelines reflect that the court considered a term of imprisonment in the middle of the guideline range to be appropriate for Benavides\u2019s crime. Absent the erroneous one-level increase, the applicable guideline range would have been decreased from 6-12 months to 2-8 months. A sentence in the middle of that range would have been lower than the nine-month sentence imposed. Further, the nine-month sentence imposed would have been outside the guideline range and there is no record evidence supporting such an upward departure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-19\">4. Because Benavides has already served the nine-month prison sentence imposed by the district court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>the only relief possible on remand is modification rather than reduction of the three-year supervised release term he is now serving. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>529 U.S. 53, 60, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000) (holding that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3624(e), courts may not reduce the length of a supervised release term by reason of excess time served in prison).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-5\">5. The statutory structure provides a means to address equitable considerations when an individual is incarcerated beyond the proper expiration of his prison term. <em>Id. </em>The trial court, as it sees fit, may modify an individual\u2019s conditions of supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2). <em>Id. </em>Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1), the court may also terminate an individual\u2019s supervised release obligations at any time after the expiration of one year, if the court considers such action warranted by the defendant\u2019s conduct and the interest of justice. <em>See id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-6\">6. On remand, Benavides may invoke \u00a7 3583(e)(2) in pursuit of relief. Because he was released from prison on June 10, 2005, Benavides must complete one year of supervised release prior to seeking relief under \u00a7 3583(e)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">SENTENCE VACATED; CAUSE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b998-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
