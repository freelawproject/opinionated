He argues that under <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court erroneously based his sentence on 2.86 kilograms of cocaine base and his role in the offense. He argues that he qualifies for the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because he is actually innocent of the non-existent offenses of (1) distributing 2.86 kilograms of cocaine base and (2) the two-point enhancement for his role as a manager or supervisor. He asserts that it would be inadequate and ineffective for him to seek permission from this court via a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347-48 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Owens\u2019s argument is unavailing in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-427 (5th Cir.2005) (No. 04-50567).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
