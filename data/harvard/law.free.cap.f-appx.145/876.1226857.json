Hewitt was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 76 months, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-22\">Hewitt argues that he is entitled to have his sentence vacated and to be resentenced because the Government breached its oral plea agreement by opposing his motion for a downward departure. He contends that the prosecutor who was present at his rearraignment stated that the Government would not oppose such a motion. The Government concedes that the plea agreement was unintentionally breached and does not oppose a remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-23\">Where, as here, there was no objection to the breach of the plea agreement, the issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>328 F.3d 787, 790 (5th Cir.2003). When reviewing for plain error, this court will consider if there was an error, the error was clear and obvious, and it affected a substantial right. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number><em>States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Further, because review of a plain error is permissive, rather than mandatory, this court will exercise its discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks, alteration, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">\u201cIn determining whether the terms of the plea bargain have been violated, [this] court must determine whether the government\u2019s conduct is consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable understanding of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>309 F.3d 882, 886 (5th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). The Government breached the plea agreement in this case by opposing the motion for a downward departure despite the initial prosecutor\u2019s acquiescence to defense counsel\u2019s oral and written statements that the Government had agreed not to oppose the motion. <em>Id. </em>This error was both clear and obvious and the Government\u2019s failure to fulfill promises made in the plea agreement affected the substantial rights of Hewitt and the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770; <em>see United States v. Goldfaden, </em>959 F.2d 1324, 1327-29 (5th Cir.1992). Hewitt\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Hewitt\u2019s argument that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied in his case in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) is without merit. Hewitt acknowledges that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) forecloses his argument but wishes to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003). This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d at 470 (internal quotation and citation omitted). Therefore, this court is bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and this argument must fail. <em>See Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b902-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
