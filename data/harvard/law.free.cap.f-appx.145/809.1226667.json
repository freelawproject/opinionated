Burrell contends that the district court should not have treated him as a career offender under the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, </em>because he did not plead guilty to a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(2003). We agree with the district court that a conviction of \u201cforcibly assaulting], resisting], opposing], impeding], intimidating], or interfering] with [a federal officer],\u201d under \u00a7 111(a)(1), \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Accordingly, the district court did not err when it concluded that Burrell pleaded guilty to a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Burrell also urges us to hold that the manner in which the district court calculated his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (holding that a district court violates the Sixth Amendment when, acting pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act and the Guidelines, it imposes a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant in a guilty plea). Because the district court relied on no facts, other than Burrell\u2019s prior and instant convictions, when calculating Burrell\u2019s sentence under the Guidelines, Burrell\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that the fact of a prior conviction need not be proven to a jury before it can be used to enhance a sentence); <em>see also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we affirm Burrell\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid our decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
