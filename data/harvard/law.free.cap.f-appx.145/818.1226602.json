Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Hernandez-Flores maintains that under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his offense level based on facts that were neither charged in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hernandez-Flores contends that the district court\u2019s sixteen-level increase in his offense level based upon a prior drug trafficking conviction that resulted in a sentence exceeding thirteen months, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) (2003), involved judicial fact finding that violated the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Hernandez-Flores did not raise this objection at sentencing, review is for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-,-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 746, 750, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-35, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which remains viable after <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence. We find that the application of the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>prior conviction exception to Hernandez-Flores\u2019 sentencing was proper and does not conflict with <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (holding that Sixth Amendment protections apply to disputed facts \u201cabout a prior conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">In <em>United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834 (4th Cir.2005), this court applied <em>Shepard </em>to find that the district court\u2019s reliance on disputed facts outside the indictment concerning whether Washington\u2019s prior conviction was a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. Unlike <em>Washington, </em>the district court enhanced Hernandez-Flores\u2019 sentence based on the term of imprisonment for a prior conviction, not upon extra-indictment facts to resolve a disputed fact about the nature of the prior conviction. Because Hernandez-Flores\u2019 four-year sentence imposed for his 1999 convictions is inextricably linked to the fact of those convictions, we conclude that the district court\u2019s enhancement of Hernandez-Flores\u2019 sentence based upon a prior conviction resulting in a sentence over thirteen months is not the type of fact found outside the indictment that is \u201ctoo far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>404 F.3d at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">Even if Hernandez-Flores\u2019 sentence exceeded \u201cthe maximum authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>by the facts established by [his] plea of guilty,\u201d it was nonetheless supported by facts otherwise \u201cadmitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Hernandez-Flores\u2019 counsel stated at sentencing that following Hernandez-Flores\u2019 last conviction \u201che was sentenced to four years,\u201d (JA 32), and as the Government notes, Hernandez-Flores never disputed the accuracy of the information in his PSR concerning his prior convictions and sentences. Because Hernandez-Flores admitted at sentencing that a sentence imposed following a prior drug trafficking conviction exceeded thirteen months, we find he could not establish for this reason alone that a Sixth Amendment error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Hernandez^ Flores\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-9\">. Based on this court's then-dispositive decision in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacated, - </em>U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005), the Government asserted that <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-16\">. Hernandez-Flores acknowledges that without this enhancement he would have still qualified for a twelve-level enhancement, as required by USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) if the defendant has a drug trafficking conviction resulting in a sentence of less than thirteen months. Thus, Hernandez-Flores effectively assigns error to the district court\u2019s factual finding that increased his offense level by four.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
