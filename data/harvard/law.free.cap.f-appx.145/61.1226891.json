Rodriguez argues for the first time on appeal and pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) that the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. He concedes that this issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and he raises it solely to preserve its further review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Rodriguez also argues that he was sentenced under the unconstitutional mandatory guidelines system and that the error constitutes plain error in light of <em>Booker. </em>Rodriguez further argues that he should not be required to show a reasonable probability of prejudice because a <em>Booker </em>error is structural and insusceptible of harmless error analysis. Rodriguez contends that even if the error was not structural, it affected his substantial rights and the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">We review for plain error. Sentencing a defendant pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme, without an accompanying Sixth Amendment violation, constitutes <em>\u201cFanfan\u201d </em>error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">The court has rejected the argument that <em>Fanfan </em>error is structural and presumptively prejudicial error, holding that it is instead subject to the same plain error analysis set forth in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005)(No. 04-9517). <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">Rodriguez has met the first two prongs of the plain error test because <em>Fanfan </em>error is \u201cerror\u201d that is \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). In order to meet the third prong of the analysis and show that the error affected his substantial rights, Rodriguez bears the burden of showing \u201cthat the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-21. Rodriguez has failed to make that showing and, thus, has failed to show plain error. <em>See United Stares v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 26, 2005) (No. 05-5535).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b88-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
