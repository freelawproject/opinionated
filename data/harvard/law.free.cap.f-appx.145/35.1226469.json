Under section 1326, the maximum sentence available was twenty years imprisonment and three years supervised release,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>United States Sentencing Guidelines, Avendano\u2019s individualized imprisonment range was determined to be seventy to eighty-seven months imprisonment and his supervised release range was determined to be two to three years. Avendano was ultimately sentenced to seventy-eight months imprisonment and three years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">On appeal, Avendano raises three challenges to his sentence, all of which were preserved in the district court. Avendano argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated under <em>United States v. Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>because his sentence (1) was enhanced sixteen levels under the Sentencing Guidelines based on a prior conviction for \u201ca crime of violence,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) was imposed under the mandatory sentencing regime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Avendano also challenges the constitutionality of the sentence-enhancement provisions in section 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2), which increase the statutory maximum prison term from two to either ten or twenty years based on a prior felony conviction or a prior aggravated felony conviction, re-</p>\n<p id=\"A2T\">spectively. As Avendano concedes, however, his latter argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and existing circuit precedent,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but the argument is raised to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">When a Sixth Amendment claim under <em>Booker </em>\u201cis preserved in the district court by an objection, [this Court] will ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless we can say the error is harmless under rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Government concedes, and we agree based on the record, that it cannot show harmless error as to Avendano\u2019s claim that the district court improperly sentenced him under mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. Because the Government cannot show beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced Avendano differently under an advisory sentencing regime,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we vacate and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-15\">Avendano asserts that the district court\u2019s sentencing discretion on remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>should be capped at the applicable Sentencing Guidelines maximum rather than the statutory maximum of twenty years imprisonment. Avendano claims that application of the remedial holding in <em>Booker, </em>rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> violates the ex post facto and due process clauses of the Constitution by exposing him to a harsher sentence under the advisory guidelines system than was available under the mandatory system. Avendano\u2019s claim is meritless because (1) at all pertinent times the statutory maximum prison term was twenty years, (2) before Avendano plead guilty and before his guideline punishment range was determined, the court explicitly notified him that he faced a statutory maximum prison term of twenty years, which is the same potential term he will face on remand, and (3) the court admonished him that his guilty plea would stand even if the ultimate sentence imposed was harsher than he expected.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, in <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>we recently rejected a similar argument, holding that it \u201cis at least implicitly contrary to the holding in Justice Breyer\u2019s <em>Booker </em>opinion that \u2018we must apply today\u2019s holdings-froi/i the Sixth Amendment holding and our remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act-to <em>all </em>cases on direct review.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore VACATED and REMANDED for re-sentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b61-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
