The district court correctly dismissed Sheffield\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim, because Sheffield failed to allege more than a de minim-is injury, which is necessary to support a claim of excessive force. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The district court also properly dismissed Sheffield\u2019s claim that his due process rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>were violated during a disciplinary proceeding on the basis that such a claim may not be brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">However, to the extent that Sheffield contends that he may bring a First Amendment claim that the disciplinary proceeding was brought in retaliation for his seeking to complain about Officer Twaddle\u2019s conduct, the dismissal was in error. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1995). Sheffield\u2019s complaint sufficiently alleges facts that support a claim that the filing of a disciplinary complaint against him was in retaliation for his seeking to complain about Officer Twaddle\u2019s conduct. <em>See id. </em>As we reverse the dismissal of the retaliation claim, we likewise reverse the dismissal of the supplemental state law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367; <em>City of Chicago v. International College of Surgeons, </em>522 U.S. 156, 164-65, 118 S.Ct. 523, 139 L.Ed.2d 525 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the dismissal of Sheffield\u2019s Eighth Amendment excessive force claim and his claims that the procedures employed during the disciplinary hearing violated his due process rights. We REVERSE the dismissal of his claim for retaliation. Because we reverse the dismissal of the federal retaliation claim, we likewise reverse the dismissal of the state law claims. <em>See Goodson v. City of Corpus Christy </em>202 F.3d 730, 741 (5th Cir.2000). We REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b70-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
