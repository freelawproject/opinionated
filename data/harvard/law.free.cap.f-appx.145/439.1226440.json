Stacey, however, did not file his notice of appeal until April 29, 2005,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which is outside the thirty day appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). The appeal period is \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">We construe Stacey\u2019s pro se notice of appeal, in which he indicated his intent to appeal and alleged that he did not timely receive notice of his action being dismissed, as a motion to reopen the time to note an appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). <em>See United States v. Feuver, </em>236 F.3d 725, 729 &amp; n. 7 (D.C.Cir.2001). Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court for it to determine whether Stacey satisfies the requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). <em>Ogden v. San Juan County, </em>32 F.3d 452, 454 (10th Cir.1994). The record, as supplemented, then will be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-11\"> This court has given Stacey the benefit of the \"prison mailbox\u201d rule, <em>Houston v.
