Majercik pled guilty<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to one count of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 (2000), and was sentenced to sixty-three months\u2019 imprisonment. Majercik\u2019s only issue on appeal is a challenge to the district court\u2019s upward departure on the basis of Majercik\u2019s likelihood that he would commit other crimes. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Although Majercik\u2019s appellate brief was filed several months after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), it does not assert any claim based upon that holding. Rather, it relies on <em>pre-Booker </em>authority to assert that the district court\u2019s decision to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines range constituted an abuse of discretion under <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). Following <em>Koon, </em>we had concluded that a district court may depart upward from a guidelines range if it identifies a factor that is an encouraged basis for departure and is not taken into account by the applicable guideline. <em>United States v. Brock, </em>108 F.3d 31, 34 (4th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3 (2002),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[i]f rehable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d Our review of the record demonstrates that an upward departure was well within the district court\u2019s discretion because Majercik\u2019s extensive criminal history reflects an overwhelming likelihood that he will commit other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">Even applying <em>Booker, </em>we find no basis to conclude that Majercik\u2019s sentence must be revisited. In imposing a sixty-three month sentence prior to <em>Booker, </em>the district court stated that it would impose an identical sentence even if the guidelines were treated as advisory. Because the alternative sentence assessed by the district court is identical to Majercik\u2019s actual sentence and reasonable under the facts, Majercik\u2019s sentence withstands review following <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-17\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-12\">. Majercik's plea agreement contained an appellate waiver provision, but because the Government has failed to assert the waiver, we address the substance of Majercik\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-13\">. If the departure is justified, the appeals court must review the extent of the departure deferentially. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>380 F.3d 183, 188 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 363, 160 L.Ed.2d 268 (2004); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(C) (West Supp.2004). However, Majercik did not argue at trial, nor does he argue on appeal, the reasonableness of the extent of the upward departure. Accordingly, we conclude Majercik has waived the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-21\">.
