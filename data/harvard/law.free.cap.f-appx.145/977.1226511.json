Moreno appeals her conviction and sentence of 37 months of imprisonment following her guilty-plea conviction for possession with intent to distribute \u201capproximately 44.52 kilograms\u201d of marijuana. The district court arrived at Moreno\u2019s sentence after determining that Moreno possessed an equivalent of 64.57 kilograms of marijuana, a fact neither admitted by Moreno nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-25\">Moreno challenged the drug quantity found by the court, arguing that such judicial fact-finding violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>Blakely </em>reaffirmed the rule that \u201c \u2018[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2536 (quoting <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-26\">After Moreno was sentenced, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number><em>States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applying its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. As the district court enhanced Moreno\u2019s sentence based on its factual determination, other than the fact of a prior conviction, the district court committed legal error under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Moreno preserved her argument by raising it in the district court. Ordinarily, when a defendant presents a preserved <em>Booker </em>issue, we vacate the sentence and remand, unless the government can demonstrate that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284-85 (5th Cir.2005). Here, the government has waived argument with respect to harmless error. Accordingly, the government cannot demonstrate harmless error, and Moreno\u2019s sentence must be vacated and remanded for resentencing. In light of this conclusion, we need not reach Moreno\u2019s claim that her sentence must be vacated because she was sentenced under a mandatory application of the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Moreno also argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>because the statute\u2019s structure treats drug types and quantities as sentencing factors. Moreno concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000), but raises the issue to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1003-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
