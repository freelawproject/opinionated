Wright, now federal prisoner # 14728-018, was convicted by jury verdict in the Middle District of Florida of federal criminal offenses and sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. Wright appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, in which Wright argued that his rights under the Vienna Convention had been violated when he was arrested without being informed of his right to contact the Jamaican consulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal was based upon its finding that Wright\u2019s Vienna Convention claim was not cognizable on federal habeas corpus review. However, Wright\u2019s petition was subject to dismissal because it challenged his conviction, rather than the execution of his sentence. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Pack v. Yusuff </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). Moreover, Wright\u2019s Vienna Convention claim would not qualify for application of the \u201csavings clause\u201d set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. This court may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis supported by the record. <em>See United States v. Real Property, </em>123 F.3d 312, 313 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
