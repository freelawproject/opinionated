Andrade, </em>96 Fed.Appx. 241 (5th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court granted Andrade\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari and for leave to proceed <em>in forma pawperis </em>(IFP); vacated our previous judgment; and remanded the case for further consideration in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Andrade v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1034, 160 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005). We requested, and received, supplemental briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>Having reconsidered our decision pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, we reinstate our judgment affirming the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-30\">For the first time in his petition for writ of certiorari, Andrade challenged the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>stitutionality of his sentence, based on the then-recent holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because he was sentenced based on facts neither pleaded to, nor found by, a jury. Absent extraordinary circumstances, we will not consider a defendant\u2019s Booker-related claims presented for the first time in a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Andrade has presented no evidence of extraordinary circumstances. Even if such circumstances were not required, because Andradeo did not raise his Hooker-claims in district court, any review would be only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005) (No. 04-9517). As Andrade concedes, his claims would fail the third prong of plain-error review because he does not show any error affected his substantial rights; he makes no \u201cshowing that the error ... affected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 521 (quotation omitted). (Along this line, Andrade contends: the district court committed \u201cstructural error\u201d when it sentenced him under a mandatory guidelines system; and prejudice to his substantial rights should therefore be presumed. As he recognizes, however, our court has rejected this contention as inconsistent with <em>Mares. See United States v. Malveaux, </em>128 Fed.Appx. 362, 363 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). He raises the Hooker-issue only in order to preserve it for possible review by the Supreme Court.) In sum, because he fails plain-error review, Andrade falls far short of showing the requisite extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
