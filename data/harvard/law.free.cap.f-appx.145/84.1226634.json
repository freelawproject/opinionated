Specifically, he argues that the Government failed to prove that he intentionally assaulted Correctional Officer Timothy LaBorde (Officer LaBorde).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence was sufficient to establish that Smith intentionally assaulted Officer LaBorde. Officer LaBorde, Senior Officer Specialist David Chapman (Officer Chapman), and Correctional Officer Scott Tommey (Officer Tommey) testified that Smith was upset with the outcome of the disciplinary hearing. Officer LaBorde testified that after he removed one of the cuffs, Smith immediately spun around \u201cso he could get more power into it\u201d and started jerking the handcuffs away from him. Officers Chapman and Tommey also testified that they saw Smith jerk Officer LaBorde\u2019s hand into the food slot. Finally, Officer LaBorde testified that he did not believe that the incident was an accident. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>958 F.2d 646, 648-49 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Smith also contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial when it excused a juror for cause when no bias on the part of that juror was demonstrated. Smith is not entitled to any relief on this claim because he does not challenge the impartiality of the panel that actually judged his ease. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>11 F.3d 1218, 1222 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Finally, Smith contends that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Specifically, Smith argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial when it enhanced his sentence based on the district judge\u2019s finding that he was a career offender because this fact was neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">Smith was sentenced after the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and pursuant to an advisory Guidelines scheme. Thus, the district court\u2019s determination, under an advisory Guidelines scheme, that Smith was a career offender did not violate his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th <em>Cm. </em>R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
