He argues that the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He also argues that considering his prior state conviction as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) was an erroneous application of the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">We review Prones\u2019s first issue de novo. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285 (5th Cir.2005). The government concedes that Prones preserved a <em>Booker </em>error but argues that because the district court expressly refused to run the appellant\u2019s 24-month guidelines sentence concurrently with his state court sentence, there could not have been harmful error. Under the circumstances of this case, the district court\u2019s conscious decision not to award a concurrent sentence persuades us that any <em>Booker </em>error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">We review Prones\u2019s second issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002). Prones concedes that his second argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent, and he raises it to preserve it for possible further review by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court. The argument is foreclosed. A state felony conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance is an aggravated felony for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 purposes, even though such a conviction is a misdemeanor under federal law. <em>See Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d at 693-94. <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943), does not affect this court\u2019s binding precedent. Accordingly, Prones\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
