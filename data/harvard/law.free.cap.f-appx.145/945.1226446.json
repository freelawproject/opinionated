He first contends that his sentence is invalid in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) because the sentencing judge applied the sentencing guidelines as if they were mandatory. Because Gonzalez-Renteria did not raise this issue in the district court, we review it only for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005). Although there was an error under <em>Booker, </em>Gonzalez-Renteria fails to demonstrate that the district court would have imposed a different sentence under advisory guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 733.. He therefore fails to show that the error affected his substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>rights as is necessary under the plain-error standard. <em>See id.; United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Gonzalez-Renteria argues that the district court plainly erred in calculating his criminal history points by refusing to treat his prior sentence for failure to identify as a \u201crelated case\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). Given that the failure-to-identify offense and the instant illegal reentry offenses did not occur simultaneously, they were not committed against the same victim, they were not identical offenses, and they were not committed at the same geographic location, it cannot be said that the district court erred in determining that these were separate offenses for purposes of calculating GonzalezRenteria\u2019s criminal history points. <em>United States v. Moreno-Arredondo, 255 </em>F.3d 198, 201, 207 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Gonzalez-Renteria argues pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), should be overruled. He concedes that his constitutional argument is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but he argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-- - &amp; n. 5, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262-63 &amp; n. 5, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), <em>Booker, </em>and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 2961, 124 S.Ct. 2531, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2004), also did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>We therefore must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b971-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
