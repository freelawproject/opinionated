Calvillo argues that trial counsel was ineffective because he advised her to sign a plea agreement that waived any right she had to have facts used in calculating her sentence charged in the indictment and proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. She argues that, given the legal landscape at the time of her plea, counsel should not have let her agree to this waiver in the plea agreement and that he should have objected at the sentencing hearing to the mandatory aspect of the sentencing guidelines and to the enhancements under the guidelines that were used to calculate her sentence. Finally, she argues that her sentence violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was enhanced based upon facts not proven to a jury or proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">The general rule in this circuit is that claims of ineffective assistance will not be considered on direct appeal \u201cwhen, as here, it was not raised in the district court, because there has been no opportunity to develop record evidence on the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 527 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). We conclude that a motion brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 would be preferable to direct appeal for deciding Calvillo\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>See Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Calvillo argues that the exception to her appeal waiver for upward departures applies to her <em>Booker </em>argument because the district court\u2019s finding that she transported 10 aliens increased her guidelines range, thereby constituting a departure. We have previously rejected a similar argument. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-747 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
