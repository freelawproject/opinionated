An appeal may not be taken from the district court\u2019s order unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Williams has not made the requisite show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Additionally, we construe Williams\u2019 notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir. 2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish that no reasonable fact finder would have found the movant guilty. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), 2255 (2000). Williams\u2019 claim does not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline to authorize Williams to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
