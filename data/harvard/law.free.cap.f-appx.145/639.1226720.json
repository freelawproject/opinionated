Defendant specifically argues the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained subsequent to a traffic stop. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">At approximately eleven o\u2019clock the night of 25 March 2004, Washington County Deputy Sheriff James Culbreath observed Defendant\u2019s vehicle and suspected that the vehicle\u2019s window tint violated Florida law because the Deputy\u2019s headlights reflected on it. He pulled alongside Defendant\u2019s car, rolled down his window, and determined he could not see the driver\u2019s silhouette nor the dashboard lights through the tinted windows although he was only five feet away. Based on these factors, the deputy stopped the Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">During the stop, the deputy became suspicious because Defendant behaved nervously and gave him two false names. The deputy searched Defendant\u2019s car, with consent, and continued to question him. Defendant ultimately gave the deputy a container hiding crack cocaine, at which point Defendant was arrested. The next morning, the deputy measured the light transmittance of Defendant\u2019s windows. The light transmittance was 19.5 percent, well below the lowest statutory allowance of 28 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-16\">Defendant plead guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). He reserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the drug evidence as fruit of an unlawful stop. Because Defendant had three prior felony drug convictions and was subject to the enhanced penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, the district court sentenced him to the statutory minimum of life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-17\">\u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 748-49 (11th Cir.2002). We review the district court\u2019s finding of fact for clear error but review the application of the law to the facts de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-18\">The Fourth Amendment protects persons from unreasonable search and sei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>zure. <em>United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 127 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amend. IV. If a police officer has probable cause to believe a violation of law has occurred, it is reasonable for him to make a traffic stop. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Probable cause must be supported by more than a mere suspicion, but does not require the same \u201cstandard of conclusiveness and probability as the facts necessary to support a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>345 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2003). Whether probable cause exists is \u201cviewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer[.]\u201d United States v. Chanthasouxat, 342 F.3d 1271, 1276 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Florida law prohibits driving motor vehicles on which the front or side windows have been treated with \u201cany sunscreening material or other product or covering which has the effect of making the window nontransparent or which would alter the window\u2019s color, increase its reflectivity, or reduce its light transmittance\u201d below the statutorily permitted level of \u201clight transmittance of at least 28 percent in the visible light range.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.2953.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Defendant argues that the statutory language shows that an officer cannot stop a vehicle solely on the basis of the window-tint statute without knowing the vehicle\u2019s exact light transmittance percentage. Defendant argues the statute\u2019s provision of a threshold that separates permissible from prohibited window tinting means an officer cannot have probable cause to stop a vehicle under the statute without knowing the vehicle\u2019s exact percentage of light transmittance. In effect, because no officer can know this percentage through observation, no officer could have probable cause to stop a vehicle solely under this statute. Instead, a violation could only be found incidental to a separate traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Defendant\u2019s arguments are not supported by the plain language of the statute. The statute in no way indicates that a police officer may not investigate further when he reasonably believes the statute is being violated. Likewise, the statute does not limit such investigations to situations when police have observed a separate traffic violation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">In addition, Defendant confuses the standards for probable cause with those for violation. The statute\u2019s prohibition of windows with light transmittance below 28 percent articulates when a vehicle violates Florida law. But probable cause requires less support than that necessary for a conviction. Dunn, 345 F.3d at 1290. Defendant\u2019s argument would force police to ascertain conclusively whether a violation had occurred before they would have the probable cause to investigate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">Furthermore, case law does not support Defendant\u2019s position. Indeed, the District Court of Appeal of Florida in <em>State v. Moore </em>seems to have determined that probable cause of a window-tint violation provided a basis for stopping a vehicle. 791 So.2d 1246, 1249 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2001). Defendant argues <em>Moore </em>is distinguishable because the police also had probable cause to stop the vehicle based on information that it was involved in a drug transaction. The court, however, stated that the probable window-tint violation \u201cindependently\u201d justified the stop. <em>Id. </em>at 1250. <em>Moore </em>thus opposes Defendant\u2019s argument that the window-tinting statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>may not be the sole basis for a traffic stop.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The only remaining issue is whether the deputy, in the circumstances, had probable cause to stop Defendant under the statute. We agree with the district court that probable cause existed. He observed his headlights reflecting off Defendant\u2019s car and could not see the dashboard lights or driver\u2019s silhouette through the windows at close range. For an officer to believe such specific observations indicated a likelihood that Defendant\u2019s vehicle violated the window-tint statute is reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Moore, </em>791 So.2d at 1248 (finding probable cause existed that the window tint statute was violated because officer was unable to \u201cmake out the [vehicle\u2019s] occupant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Because the police officer had probable cause to believe that the Defendant was violating the Florida window-tinting statute, we conclude that the district court denied properly Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\">. By contrast, the Florida legislature inserted plain language into the Safety Belt Law that police may only enforce it \"as a secondary action when a driver of a motor vehicle has been detained for a [separate] violation[.]\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.614(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\">. Defendant also relies on <em>United States v. Chanthasouxat, </em>342 F.3d 1271 (11th Cir.2003) and <em>Doctor v. State, </em>596 So.2d 442 (Fla.1992). Neither case is applicable, however, because each determined it was unreasonable for an officer to make a traffic stop pursuant to a mistaken belief about the law. <em>See Chanthasouxat, </em>at 1278-79 (officer mistakenly believed lack of interior rear-view mirror violated statute, although statute did not require mirror to be interior); <em>Doctor, </em>at 446-67 (officer mistakenly believed cracked plastic covering on taillight violated statute that only required the taillight be illuminated). In the present case, the deputy knew correctly that Florida law prohibited excessively dark window tint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
