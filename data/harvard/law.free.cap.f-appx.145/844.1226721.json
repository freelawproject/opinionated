Verastegui argues that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to move at sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>fencing for a two-level downward departure from the federal Sentencing Guidelines pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1; that his sentence must be vacated in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) because the district court was under the impression that the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory rather than advisory; and that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Verastegui concedes that his third argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent, but he raises the issue to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Because Verastegui did not object at sentencing to the Government\u2019s alleged breach of the plea agreement, we review his argument for plain error and find none. <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001). The district court was aware that the Government had recommended a departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1, and the court made it clear that it had no intention of granting such a departure under any circumstances. <em>Reeves, </em>255 F.3d at 210-11 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3; <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 164 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">We review Verastegui\u2019s challenge to his sentence under mandatory Sentencing Guidelines for plain error because he did not raise the issue in the district court. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005). We agree with Verastegui that the district court erred when it sentenced him pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69. Nevertheless, as the record does not suggest in any way that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had it been aware that the sentencing guidelines are merely advisory, Verastegui has not met his burden of establishing plain error. <em>ValenzuelaQuevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">We reject Verastegui\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348. This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless and until the decision is overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.2000)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b870-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
