The district court sentenced him to 46 months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">For the first time on appeal, GervacioAngel argues that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court must vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing because the mandatory guideline regime was in place at the time of his sentencing. An unpreserved challenge to the application of the formerly mandatory sentencing guidelines is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2005 WL 1811485 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The district court\u2019s application of the guidelines in their mandatory form constituted error that is \u201cplain\u201d for purposes of satisfying the first two prongs of the plain error analysis. <em>Id. </em>Gervacio-Angel also bears the burden of demonstrating \u201cthat the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2005 WL 816208 (2005). Gervacio-Angel has not made such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">Gervacio-Angel also argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As GervacioAngel concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 346 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b105-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
