Smith, Judge Linda Hunter, Judge Robert P. Mallis, Clerk Linda Carter, and Sheriff Thomas Brown (collectively referred to as \u201cDefendants\u201d) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>failure to state a claim. On appeal, Wallace challenges the district court\u2019s findings that (1) <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), bars a \u00a7 1983 damage claim for alleged pretrial Fourth Amendment violations followed by a valid conviction, (2) a prisoner cannot bring a class action on behalf of himself and past, present, and future inmates and seek appointment of counsel on his and the class\u2019s behalf, and (3) state judges enjoy absolute immunity from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Wallace first contends that under <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160-61 (11th Cir.2003), he may bring a \u00a7 1983 action for nominal damages for Fourth Amendment violations without implying the invalidity of his conviction, and the district court should have liberally construed his complaint to include a request for nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We review an appeal from a \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim <em>de novo. Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). Section 1915A requires a court to review a prisoner\u2019s civil complaint against a governmental entity or officer, or a governmental entity\u2019s employee, before or soon after docketing the case to determine whether the case is frivolous, fails to state a claim, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(1), (b)(2). A district court should not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the prisoner can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Harmon v. Berry, </em>728 F.2d 1407, 1409 (11th Cir.1984). We have noted that \u201c[t]his standard is clearly hostile to summary dismissal based on the face of a complaint, and becomes more so when a <em>pro se </em>complaint from a prisoner is considered, because such complaints are to be read very liberally.\u201d <em>Covington v. Cole, </em>528 F.2d 1365, 1370 (5th Cir.1976) (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">Courts do and should show a leniency to <em>pro se </em>litigants not enjoyed by those with the benefit of a legal education. Yet even in the case of <em>pro se </em>litigants this leniency does not give a court license to serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a party or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-9\"><em>GJR Investments, Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). Section 1983 imposes civil liability on any person who under color of law subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen to the deprivation of a constitutional right. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \u201cSection 1983 requires proof of an affirmative causal connection between the official act or omission complained of and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>956 F.2d 1112, 1124 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">We have held that \u201c[bjecause an illegal search or arrest may be followed by a valid conviction, a successful \u00a7 1983 action for Fourth Amendment search and seizure violations does not necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction. As a result, <em>Heck </em>does not generally bar such claims.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003) (citations and quotations omitted); <em>see also Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487 n. 7, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372 n. 7, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (\u201ca suit for damages attributable to an allegedly unreasonable search may lie even if the challenged search produced evidence that was introduced in a state criminal trial resulting in the \u00a7 1983 plaintiff\u2019s still-outstanding conviction. Because of doctrines like independent source and inevitable discovery, and especially harmless error, such a \u00a7 1983 action, even if successful, would not necessarily imply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>that the plaintiffs conviction was unlawful.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Here, the district court erred with respect to Wallace\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim. Because it does not necessarily imply that his conviction was invalid, Wallace\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim is not barred by <em>Heck </em>as the district court found. Therefore, the district court erred by dismissing this claim for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Next, Wallace submits that a <em>pro se in forma pauperis </em>litigant may bring a class action \u00a7 1988 complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. \u201c[I]t is plain error to permit [an] imprisoned litigant who is unassisted by counsel to represent his fellow inmates in a class action.\u201d <em>Oxendine v. Williams, </em>509 F.2d 1405, 1407 (4th Cir.1975); <em>see also Massimo v. Henderson, </em>468 F.2d 1209, 1210 (5th Cir. 1972) (affirming dismissal of the portion of petitioner\u2019s complaint seeking relief on behalf of fellow inmates). Therefore, the district court properly dismissed this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Wallace further asserts that his claims were unfairly prejudiced by the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal because he was not given the opportunity to amend his complaint, seek class certification, or have counsel appointed. \u201c[S]eetion 1915(e) (2) (B) (ii) [and \u00a7 1915A(b) ] only addresses procedures to be followed by the district court once an inmate\u2019s claim is presented before the court. In no way does the section restrict the ability of a prisoner to prepare and file complaints, thereby bringing them to a court\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Vanderberg v. Donaldson, </em>259 F.3d 1321, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (citing with approval <em>Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 n. 2 (5th Cir.1998) (noting that section 1915A, a statute instituting screening procedures similar to section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), functions similarly to Fed. Rs. Civ. P. 11 and 12(b)(6), and does not unconstitutionally restrict prisoner\u2019s access to federal courts)). We reject this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Finally, Wallace argues that the state court judges who denied his state habeas relief acted in the complete absence of all jurisdiction, stripping them of absolute immunity. \u201c[G]enerally, a judge is immune from a suit for money damages.\u201d Mir<em>eles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 9, 112 S.Ct. 286, 287, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). \u201c[J]udicial immunity is an immunity from suit, not just from ultimate assessment of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 112 S.Ct. at 288. \u201c[I]mmunity is overcome in only two sets of circumstances. First, a judge is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in the judge\u2019s judicial capacity. Second, a judge is not immune for actions, though judicial in nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-12, 112 S.Ct. at 288 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Wallace\u2019s description of the state judges\u2019 activities indicated that their actions were judicial acts within the scope of their jurisdiction, vesting them with judicial immunity to suit. Therefore, the district court did not err by dismissing this claim. Accordingly, we vacate and remand with respect to Wallace\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim and affirm with respect to his remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
