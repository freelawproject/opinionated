Counsel has filed an Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in sentencing Turner pursuant to a mandatory guideline scheme. Turner was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. The Government declined to file a brief. Because we conclude that Turner\u2019s sentence on Counts One and Two was enhanced based upon facts not charged in the indictment or admitted by Turner, we vacate his sentence and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court applied the rationale of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to the federal sentencing guidelines and held that the mandatory guidelines scheme that provided for sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 746-48, 755-56 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>remedied the constitutional violation by severing and excising the statutory provisions that mandate sentencing and appellate review under the guidelines, thus making the guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 756-57 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Subsequently, in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005), this court held that a sentence that was imposed under the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory sentencing scheme and was enhanced based on facts found by the court, not by a jury (or, in a guilty plea case, admitted by the defendant), constitutes plain error that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and warrants reversal under <em>Booker </em>when the record does not disclose what discretionary sentence the district court would have imposed under an advisory guideline scheme. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-56. The court directed sentencing courts to calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider that range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2004), and impose a sentence. If the district court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the court should state its reasons for doing so. <em>Id. </em>at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Because Turner did not object to the sentencing range of eighty-four to 105 months of imprisonment for Counts One and Two set forth in the presentence report and adopted by the district court, we review the district court\u2019s guideline calculation for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547. Under the plain error standard, Turner must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Even when these conditions are satisfied, this court may exercise its discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Turner\u2019s base offense level for Counts One and Two was properly determined and is supported by drug quantity alleged in the indictment and included in the factual basis stated at Turner\u2019s plea hearing, with which he explicitly agreed. Turner also received a two-level enhancement of his offense level for reckless endangerment during flight, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.2 (2003). We conclude that the imposition of this enhancement was error under the Sixth Amendment as applied in <em>Booker, </em>because the facts supporting this enhancement were not alleged in the indictment or admitted by Turner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Turner did not object to the presentence report, the district court was not required to resolve any factual disputes concerning this enhancement. If this enhancement were removed, Turner\u2019s total offense level would be twenty-three, and his sentencing range on Counts One and Two seventy to eighty-seven months. Because the 105-month sentence imposed as to Counts One and Two does not fall within the guideline range calculated without the two-level enhancement, Turner\u2019s sentence constitutes plain error that affects his substantial rights and requires resentencing pursuant to <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel asserts error in the application of the guidelines as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>mandatory sentencing determinant, but does not specify any facts or statements by the district court that indicated that it would possibly have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory scheme. Because Turner\u2019s sentence was affected by a Sixth Amendment error and he will be resentenced under an advisory guideline scheme, we decline to consider counsel\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Turner\u2019s conviction, vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-13\">. <em>Anders v.
