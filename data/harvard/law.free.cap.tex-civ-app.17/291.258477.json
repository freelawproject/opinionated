W. Harris &amp; Co. under the contract shown in our statement of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The appellee in his answer admitted the employment of appellant and the making of the contract through his agency with Harris &amp; Co., but averred that Harris &amp; Co. never intended to perform the contract for the purchase of the bonds, and that they made said contract to appellee with the expectation that they would be able to negotiate the bonds at a profit, and with this object in view they delayed taking the bonds, though the appellee at all times insisted that they should do so. That finally, on July 25, 1895, they declined taking the bonds at all. Appellee also alleged that it was <em>always </em>willing and anxious to deliver the bonds under the contract with Harris &amp; Co., and had complied with every objection and requirement on their part as to all formalities necessary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>issuance and delivery of the bonds, and would have long since issued and delivered same if Harris &amp; Co. had complied with their part of the contract and had not repeatedly informed appellee that they were not prepared.to receive and pay for the same; that appellee had not been able to compel Harris &amp; Co. to perform their contract to take the bonds; that they were nonresidents, and had no property in this State within the knowledge of appellee, and that it was powerless to enforce the contract with Harris &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">The appellant, by supplemental petition in reply to the answer, alleged that appellee was not able and never did offer to deliver to Harris &amp; Co., at any time it was bound to do, its legal bonds, but sought to deliver them its illegal bonds, issued in excess of its charter provisions, and which were null and void, and which, on account of said illegality and invalidity, Harris &amp; Co. refused to receive as a compliance by appellee with its said'agreement to deliver said bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The case was tried before a jury and a verdict rendered and judgment entered for the appellee, from which judgment this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The uncontroverted facts are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">1.

W. Harris &amp; Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-14\">\u201cForbes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">3. The contract first inserted in this opinion was in fact reduc\u00e9d to writing and executed subsequent to execution of the one made with H. W. Harris &amp; Co., but is expressive of an oral contract that existed between appellee and appellant at the time the latter contract was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">The contract with Harris &amp; Co. was negotiated by appellant with some minor modifications, which were not objected to by the last named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>parties, but ratified by the board of directors of appellee company on September 22, 1892.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">4. An examination of appellee\u2019s property upon which the bonds were issued and secured was made by an agent of Harris &amp; Co. shortly after the contract was executed, and from the examination they were satisfied with the sufficiency of the security. The appellee furnished Harris &amp; Co. all papers to enable their attorney to pass upon the legality of the issuance of the bonds. Upon investigation by the attorney, he objected to the legality of the bonds upon the ground that under the articles of corporation, and in view of the manner in which appellee\u2019s stock was increased, it was not authorized to issue bonds in the amount contracted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">5. The original capital stock of appellee company was $200,000; this was subsequently increased to $400,000, afterwards to $800,000, and finally to $1,000,000. This increase of stock was effected by amendments to the charter of the company filed with the Secretary of State prior to the execution of the contract with Harris &amp; Co. On account of the manner in which the capital stock was increased, the legality of the proposed issue of bonds was never satisfactory to the attorney of Harris &amp; Co., and for that reason they failed and refused to take the bonds and pay the price therefor, or any part of it agreed upon in their contract. But the appellee was ready and willing at all times after its execution to issue and deliver to Harris &amp; Co. the bonds in the amount specified and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the contract, and at the instance of Harris &amp; Co. was instrumental in procuring the passage by the Legislature of the Act of March 1, 1897, validating bonds in cases where the amount of capital stock of any corporation had theretofore been increased by more than one increase thereof to an amount in excess of double the amount of original capital, where such an increase had been made with the sanction of the Secretary of State under his construction of the law. Sayles\u2019 Civ. Stats, of 1897, art. 652a. After this act was passed, Harris &amp; Co. failed and refused to take the bonds on account of the general stringency in the money market, though they were financially able at that time as Well as ever since the execution of the contract to take and pay the price for the bonds agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The question from the undisputed facts is, was the objection urged to the bonds by the attorney of Harris &amp; Co. valid, or in other words, was the issuance of the bonds illegal? If they were legal, the appellant would have no cause for action, because the contract he made for the company left the determination of their legality to the attorney of the parties to whom the contract of sale was negotiated, and he having pronounced them invalid, and the sale not being consummated on that account, the fund from which appellant\u2019s commission was to be realized would never have come into the hands of the appellee. But the appellant in the absence of knowledge to the contrary had the right to assume that the bonds he was authorized by the appellee to negotiate were valid, and if 'they were not valid, it was not his fault, but appellee was solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>responsible for it, and appellant, having under the contract negotiated the sale upon which he was entitled to the commission, stipulated, would be- entitled to recover his compensation, notwithstanding the fact that the sale was never consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\">Article 576, Revised Statutes of 1879, provides: \u201cAny corporation may increase its capital stock to any amount not exceeding double the amount of its authorized capital, by a vote of the stockholders, in conformity with the by-laws thereof; and if a majority of the stockholders shall vote for the increase of the stock, the same may be increased by the board of directors, trustees, or other business managers of such corporation; and upon such increase of stock being made in -accordance with the by-laws, the date and amount shall be certified to the Secretary of State by the directors or trustees, and from the time such certificate is filed, the increase in stock shall become a part of the capital stock thereof. Such certificate shall be filed and recorded in the same manner as the charter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">And the next succeeding article provides as follows: \u201cCorporations shall have power to borrow money on the credit of the corporation, not exceeding its authorized capital stock, and may execute bonds or promissory notes therefor, and may pledge the property and income of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">These articles were in force at the time of the increase of appellee\u2019s capital stock, and when the contract negotiated by appellant with Harris &amp; Co. was entered into.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">By Act of the Twenty-third Legislature, article 576 was amended by inserting the words \u201cat any one time\u201d between the words \u201cexceeding\u201d and \u201cdouble\u201d in the second line of the original article, and by adding to the last sentence of the article the proviso, \u201cthat no stock shall be issued except for money paid, labor done, or property actually received.\u201d Section <em>2 </em>of the same act also provides, \u201cThat in all cases where the amount of the capital stock of any corporation has heretofore been increased by more than one increase thereof, to an amount in excess of double the amount of the original capital, and such increase has been made with the sanction of the Secretary of State, under his construction of the law, such increase shall be, and the same is hereby, validated and declared legal.\u201d This act was not passed until the expiration of the time for the performance of the contract between appellee and Harris &amp; Co. for the sale of the bonds. They, however, serve to show the construction placed by the Legislature upon article 576 as originally enacted; and. its construction was that a corporation could not, under the act, increase its stock beyond double the amount of its original capital stock, whether \u2019such increase was attempted to be made at one or more times. Practically the same construction has since been placed upon article 576 by the Supreme Court in the case of Kampmann v. Tarver, 87 Texas, 497, in which it is held that the object of the article was to place limitations .upon the increase of the capital stock of corporations organized under the general Jaw, both as to the amount of the increase and as to the manner in which such increase should be effected, and that any amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ment in reference to the amount of capital stock of a corporation should be subordinated to the limitations contained in the article. We must hold, therefore, that the amount of bonds contracted for exceeded appellee\u2019s authorized capital stock, and the opinion of the attorney of Harris <em>&amp; </em>Co., that the issue of the bonds was unauthorized and invalid, was correct. It follows, therefore, that if appellant was ignorant of the invalidity of the bonds at the time he effected the contract of sale, and the sale was not consummated because of their invalidity, he would be entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\">In its charge, the court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cYou are instructed that an agent employed to sell bonds, and he is ignorant of the legal status of said bonds, has a right to presume thait the bonds so offered for sale are valid bonds, and to proceed withy his negotiations with expected purchasers upon that assumption, and if he find a purchaser who is able, ready, and willing to buy said bonds at a price and on terms entirely satisfactory to the owner of such bonds, and said sale is not consummated, through no fault of the agent or proposed purchaser, but because of the invalidity of the bonds so offered for sale, then the agent procuring such proposed purchaser is entitled to his commissions precisely as if the sale had been fully carried out.\u201d The principles of law thus enunciated are, in our opinion, correct in their application to this ease; but the court further instructed the jury that, \u201cShould you find, however, from the testimony that plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement for the sale of said bonds by the terms of which plaintiff was to be paid a commission only in case the sale of said bonds was effected and the money realized therefrom by defendant, you will find for defendant, notwithstanding the invalidity of said bonds was the sole eause of the failure to consummate said sale.\u201d This portion of the charge is clearly repugnant to that part preceding which we have quoted, and precluded the appellant from a recovery. As is before stated, the appellant h\u00e1d a right to rely upon the bonds he was authorized to sell being valid, and if he was ignorant of their invalidity and performed his contract under the assumption1 that they were authorized, and the parties to whom he negotiated the sale refused to take them because they were invalid, and would otherwise have then purchased them, he would be entitled to his compensation although the sale was never consummated.

Rep., 388; 1 Warv. on Vend., sec. 26, p. 237; Mech. on Agency, sec. 966, p. 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">From this it follows that the trial court erred in giving that portion of the charge last quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">It was error to give the following special charge asked by appellee\u2019s counsel: c\\Even though the defendant was unable to issue and deliver the bonds contracted, a.t the time of the contract, by reason of the fact that said bonds would at that time have been illegal; yet if when such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>want of power and illegality were called to the attention of defendant, and objection made to taking them on that account, defendant with the knowledge and consent of plaintiff and of the proposed purchasers, took steps to and did procure said defect to be cured within a reasonable time, and that after said defect was cured, and the right to issue said bonds secured, the proposed purchaser still refused to carry out said contract and take the bonds and pay for same, the plaintiff can not recover, and you will find for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\">The question upon which appellant\u2019s right depended, was whether appellee could, within the time the bonds were contracted to be delivered, have legally issued them ? If it could not, the fact that it took steps to place itself in a position to issue valid bonds, with the knowledge and consent of appellant and the proposed purchasers, would not constitute a waiver of his rights which accrued from the performance of his contract with appellee. His rights were fixed when he negotiated the contract to sell valid bonds of appellee, and Harris &amp; Co. refused to take them on account of their invalidity, and no subsequent action taken by appelle after the time the contract should have been performed could deprive him of the right so acquired, notwithstanding he may have known of and consented to such action; nor were Harris &amp; Co. under any obligation to take bonds, though valid, after the time expired in which appellee, under the contract, was to deliver them. Upon this point the following portion of special charge number 4, asked by appellant\u2019s counsel, is expressive of our view of the law: \u201cYou are instructed that time is the essence of the memorandum of agreement between defendant company and Harris &amp; Co., dated September 3, 1893, and accepted with modifications by defendant company through its legal board of directors September 33, 1893, and that said contract provided for the sale and delivery by defendant company to said Harris &amp; Co. of legal bonds of defendant company; that owing to a want of power in its chanter, defendant company was unable to deliver to said Harris &amp; Co. $450,000 of its legal first mortgage bonds stipulated for in said agreement, and that said Harris &amp; Co. were not bound to receive or accept under said agreement other than legal bonds of defendant company, and were not bound to receive under said agreement any bonds of defendant company after the time fixed in said agreement for the delivery of such bonds.\u201d Such other errors as are assigned by appellant will probably not arise on another trial of thi\u00a7 cause, and we deem it unnecessary to discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">For the reasons of the errors indicated, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">on rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<author id=\"b324-7\">JAMES, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A6k0\">We are of opinion, upon a reconsideration of the case upon the motion for rehearing, that the case has been cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>rectiy disposed of. There is no uncertainty in the writing which defined appellant\u2019s right to commissions. He was to receive a compensation for making a sale of the bonds, to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale, as the proceeds were received.' Appellee\u2019s contention is substantially this: That it was a condition to the payment of his compensation that the sale should be consummated and proceeds of sale received; and that if for any cause not the willful or fraudulent act of the appellee the sale was not effected, or the purchase money not paid, appellant was not to be compensated. That the contract might have been worded to have this effect can not be doubted. Pryor v. Jolly, 40 S. W. Rep., 959; Flower v. Davidson, 46 N. W. Rep., 308; Peete v. Sherwood, 45 N. W. Rep., 85. Had the sale been made on deferred payments, the payments would clearly have been a condition to defendant\u2019s liability to pay appellant under this writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The cases cited by appellee (Pryor v. Jolly, 40 Southwestern Reporter, 959; Toombs v. Alexander, 101 Massachusetts, 255; Walker v. Tirrell, 101 Massachusetts, 257) are not authority for its position. In Hinds v. Henry, 36 New Jersey Law, 328, also cited, the cloud on the title which broke off the contract to sell was known to the agent when he received his power of attorney, and the opinion in that case states that the evidence showed that the defendant made no fraudulent concealment of the defect in his title, and that the plaintiff acted with the full knowledge that his efforts might prove abortive by the defendant\u2019s inability to convey as was stipulated. It is well settled that when a broker, ait the time he contracts or at the time he performs the work for which he asks compensation, knows of the matter which ultimately defeats his efforts, he is not entitled to recover. But when he does not know, the rule is that he has the right to assume and his principal impliedly warrants that the title to the property he deals with is free from infirmity. Gauthier v. West, 47 N. W. Rep., 656; Birmingham Co. v. Thompson, 5 So. Rep., 473; Sweeney v. Oil Co., 18 Atl. Rep., 612; Phelps v. Prusch, 23 Pac. Rep., 1111; Peete v. Sherwood, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In the case of Gauthier v. West, it is stated that if the broker agrees to wait for his commission until the sale is fully completed, there is an implied contract that the defendant had the ability and would confer upon the purchaser a perfect title to the property. We think this is sound. And we are unable to see any difference between cases where the owner agrees to pay the agent generally, and where there is a stipulation that he is to receive his pay when the sale is completed, or out of the proceeds when they are received. In the latter case it is true the agent would have to await the completion of the sale, or the receipt of the proceeds after the sale. So far his compensation would be conditional. In eases where he is to be paid upon the completion of the sale, the authorities are that the broker is nevertheless entitled to compensation, if the sale was not completed because of the owner\u2019s inability to give a good title. This being the case, how can it be said that a stipulation that he was to await the payment of the purchase money, or be paid out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>purchase money when received, relieves the owner from the implied warranty that he has a good title, when this sale is defeated and thereby the fund out of which the agent was to be paid is defeated, for such reasons? If the agent can recover in the one case, he should in the other.'</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">As a matter of course, an agreement might be made whereby the broker will not be entitled to compensation if the sale is defeated by reason of the title or for any other reason. There is nothing in the contract that can be so construed. It is plain and unambiguous. It was agreed that he should have for his services in selling appellant\u2019s bonds the excess over a fixed sum net, to be paid in cash as the same should be received from the purchasers. In other words, if he sold the bonds for a surplus over the fixed sum, he was to be paid this surplus, but as to deferred payments, having to await their payment, to this extent only his pay was conditional. There was no condition that if the sale failed for any reason he was to receive no commissions. If -such had been his agreement, it may be that it would have done away with all implied warranty, as was held in Flower v. Davidson, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">It may be proper to state in this connection that in a later case in Minnesota, Cromer v. Miller, 57 Northwestern Reporter, 318, the doctrine announced in Flower v. Davidson was, it seems, applied to a case where the agent\u2019s commission depended upon the payment of the purchase money, and the court held in that ease, citing Flower v. Davidson, in effect, that such a stipulation did away with the implied warranty concerning the title. There is no reference to Gauthier v. West, which seemed to hold the contrary, a case decided by the same court. We are of opinion that it requires more than the agreement shows in the present ease to be construed to exclude such warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The charge copied in the opinion and there stated to be correct was in accord with the views above expressed, and the portion in conflict with these views also set forth in the opinion, should not have been added.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">It is also claimed by appellee that plaintiff can not recover because the contract he procured to be made by the purchaser provided the title to appellee\u2019s properties and the legality of the issue of bonds should he satisfactory to the purchaser\u2019s attorneys, and this was a recognition that such adverse contingency might arise and was a sole condition made in view of possible defects liable to defeat it. If there is anything in the rule thait the broker has a right, in negotiating a sale, to assume that his principal has a good and marketable title to the property given him to sell, then there is nothing in the above contention. He may proceed with a sale, and if he is authorized to contract, he may enter into a contract, upon the theory that the property is in that condition. He can not have a right to rely on this and lose it merely by relying on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">We may add, in view of what is said in the motion, that the form in which Berg\u2019s commission was stipulated did not place him in any other attitude than that of a broker. He was to get all above a fixed sum as commission so stated, and the fact that this might be great or might he small does not effect a different relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>As already stated, if the facts or circumstances show that appellant had notice of the condition of the bonds at the time he did the work, he could not recover. Or if the defect in the issue was due to him, then he can not recover. Hor can he recover if, as a matter of fact, the purchasers would noit have completed the purchase had the bonds been without defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The other subjects referred to in the motion have been, we believe, correctly decided and sufficiently explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
