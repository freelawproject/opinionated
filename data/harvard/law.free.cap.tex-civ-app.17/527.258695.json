T. Parks instituted this suit against Charles Tippie and appellant Henry D. Lindsley, to recover for material and labor used in the construction of a residence on lots Fos. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>15 land 16 in block 136 in the Llano Improvement and Furnace Company\u2019s addition to the town of Llano, and to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien on said property.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Appellee\u2019s petition embraced two theories: one that he had a contract with both Tippie and Lindsley for the construction of the house; and the other, that, if Lindsley was not a party to the contract, he was estopped, by representations made to appellee, from denying that the lots belonged to Tippie and were free from any claim of his.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Tippie made no defense. Lindsley denied that he had made any contract with appellee, set up the fact that he had previously sold the lots to Tippie, retaining a vendor\u2019s lien secured by a deed of trust on the lots; that afterwards the trustee had sold the lots, and he, Lindsley, became the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The court rendered judgment in favor of appellee against Tippie for the amount of his debt, and against both Tippie and Lindsley for a foreclosure of his mechanic\u2019s lien and for costs. Lindsley has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The case was tried without a jury, and no conclusions of fact and law were filed. The testimony shows that in the summer of 1892 Parks and Tippie entered into a contract for the erection of a building as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition; that the plaintiff furnished the material and built the house in accordance with the contract, and that Tippie owed the plaintiff a balance due therefor of $613.43 at the time the ease was tried. 1't was also shown that the written contract remained 'in the possession of Tippie, and appellee was unable for that reason -to file it for record, but that he instituted this suit within four months after the debt was due. It was further shown that, about the time the contract was made, Lindsley, who had previously owned the lots, executed a deed conveying them to Tippie, reserving a vendor\u2019s lien to secure certain unpaid purchase money for the lots. That at the same time Tippie executed a deed of trust conveying the lots to Philip Lindsley as trustee, to secure said unpaid purchase money, which deed of trust, together with the deed from appellant Henry D. Lindsley to Chas. Tippie, the transcript shows was filed for record September 26, 1892; but it does not appear in what county nor in what office said instruments were filed for record. The testimony further shows that Lindsley was not a party to the contract for the erection of the building. There1 was testimony tending to show that before appellee built the house Lindsley stated to him that the lots belonged -to Tippie, and misled appellee -and caused him to believe that Tippie had the right t\u2019a make such contract in reference to building a house upon the lots as would create in appellee\u2019s favor -a lien upon the house and lots superior to any claim that Lindsley might have. In other word's, the representations referred to tended to produce the impression that Lindsley had no claim whatever upon the lots. The ease has been on appeal once before (Parks v. Tippie, 34 Southwestern Reporter, 676), and it was then held under the facts above stated that appellee was not required to record Ms contract in order to secure or preserve Ms lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The trial amendment filed by appellee, and lof the filing of which appellant complains, merely stated the value of the lots and of the house separately, and as the court held that both were subject .to appellee\u2019s'lien, and as that holding was correct, it was not necessary that the amendment should have been filed, and the ruling of the court in permitting it to he filed, after the parties had announced ready for trial, was harmless error, if error at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\">What has just been said concerning the amendment, answers the assignment of error which complains of the action of the court in overruling aippeliant\u2019s application for a continuance. The continuance was asked \u00a1to enable appellant to obtain testimony to meet the issues raised by the trial amendment. These issues being immaterial, the court did not err in overruling the application for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Appellant has no assignment of error, charging that the judgment is not supported by the testimony on the theory of estoppel, and as there is testimony tending to support that theory and the court filed mo conclusions of fact finding against appellee on that issue, we must decide the case upon \u00a1the theory that appellant concedes the evidence to he against him on that issue. Walker v. Cole, 89 Texas, 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Appellant d'oes charge, in his seventh assignment of error, that he was not shown to he a party to the contract for building the house, but he does not charge that the testimony fails to show \u00a1that he made such representations 'to appellee concerning 'the lots as will in law estop him from asserting a claim, thereto superior to the title held by Tippie <em>ait </em>the time appellee made his contract with Tippie. If the court below had filed conclusions of fact, and had not found upon the issue of estoppel, or had found against appellee upon that issue, the case would be different; but the appellant, being content to bring the case to this court without any findings of fact by the trial court, and not having charged in his assignments of errors that the judgment is not supported upon either issue presented by the appellee\u2019s pleadings and evidence, and there being testimony tending to support the allegations of estoppel, we must treat the judgment as sustained by the testimcmy.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Al-thoiTgh held not to be liable to appellee upon the issue of debt, \u00a1appellant was a proper party to -the suit upon the question of appellee\u2019s right to foreclose his lien, and the court having decided in his favor land against appellant upon that issue, it was proper to adjudge the costs against both Tippie and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">We (have considered all tine questions presented in appellant\u2019s brief, and finding no reversible error, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
