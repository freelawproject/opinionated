This charge did not submit to the jury the issue presented by the pleadings, -and inasmuch as the land claimed as homestead as well as that upon which it was agreed that the deed of trust should cover, was described in the trust deed, 'and this charge was calculated to and did mislead the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-6\">The court did not err in holding that the appellants\u2019 defense or -cause of action to reform 'the deed of trust according to the contract was not barred by the statute of limitations, -and it correctly overruled said exceptions to said answer.

Ann., 159.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-5\">The homestead designation and deed of trust could not have been reformed in this case, because appellants wholly failed to show the form to which these instruments ought to be brought in order that they might express what was intended, as fnllyappears from testimony of appellant Charles Pace. Railway v. Shirley, 45 Texas, 377; Moore v. Giesecke, 76 Texas, 547; Railway v. Burke, 1 White &amp; W., C. C., sec. 945; Williams v. Rand., 30 S. W. Rep., 509; Ins. Co. v. Wagner, 38 S. W. Rep., 214; Pom. Eq. Jur., sec. 859, and cases cited; 15 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 650, and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-6\">The court erred in overruling plaintiff\u2019s special exception to defendants\u2019 first amended original answer and cross-petition, because it seeks to cancel and reform a written contract on the ground -of fraud or mutual mistake. Said pleading alleges that said cause of action -or right to cancel and reform said instrument came into being on February 26, 1887, not quite ten years before said pleading, was filed and said cause of action or right first asserted. It shows upon \"its face t-hat no confidential relations existed between R. L. Brown and J. .Gordon Brown on the -one hand and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>said defendants on the other, and that their interests were adverse \u2018to each other and that they were dealing at arm\u2019s length. It further shows upon its face that the description of the 144 acres in the homestead designation and two deeds of trust, in regard to which the mistake or fraud is alleged, was of the simplest and- most easily understood nature possible, -and that defendant Charles Pace three times and defendant Jessie Pace twice in the most solemn manner executed the instruments containing such description, and that if they did not discover what was contained in the instruments they were signing and acknowledging, it was their own gross and inexcusable negligence that prevented. Said pleading does not show that any artifice to conceal said alleged fraud or mistake ivas practiced by plaintiff, or that the said homestead designation and deeds of trust and their recorded copies were concealed from said defendants, or that said defendants .examined the public records of Travis County or made any effort to discover the contents of said instruments which they alleged to have repeatedly signed without knowing What they were. It is not alleged that defendants, or either of them, were idiots or weak minded -and unable to read or incapacitated from performing the simplest functions of a property holder. Said pleading further shows that said defendants have been, during said time, living upon said property, that their means of discovering any mistake was as good, and in fact much better, than those -of plaintiff, and fall's utterly to give any excuse for their long delay and negligence, but shows that said attempt to reform said written contract is a stale demand, barred by the loches of said defendants and the four years statute of limitation, and can not he considered or acted upon by a court of equity.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b533-5\">FISHER, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ANMt\">This suit was brought by the appellee against Pace and his wife and one W. H. Richardson, on a note executed by Pace for the sum of $2500 and to foreclose a lien created by deed of trust against all of the appellants upon certain lands described in plaintiff\u2019s petition. Pace and wife in effect alleged, that the land described in the deed of trust in part embraces their homestead, and that at the time of the execution of the deed of trust and its subsequent renewal it was understood between the parties that certain lands set out and described in the defendants\u2019 answer should not be embraced in the deed of trust, and that by mutual mistake of the parties the land that was intended to he excepted from the operation of that instrument was included in the deed of trust: and further,- that, if it was not so included by mistake, it was so included by the wrongful and fraudulent acts of R. L. and J. Gordon Brown, to whom the notes were formerly executed and Who prepared the deed of trust, and who stated at the time of its execution and at the time at which it was subsequently renewed that the land intended to be excepted from its operation was not included. Appellant alleged that he had confidence in the integrity of Brown Bros, and relied upon their statements, and, believing those representations to be true, he and his wife executed the deed of trust, and that he never discovered the mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>take or fraud until long after these instruments h ad been executed; that the deed of trust did embrace the land that was intended to be reserved from its operation, and did include his homestead. Appellants asked that the deed of trust be reformed so as to exclude this land. Appellee addressed to this answer general and special demurrers, whie-h the court overruled. The case was tried before a jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and thereupon judgment was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\">There is some evidence in the record tending to establish the issues raised by the answer of appellants. The court, after submitting to the jury the issue of mistake and fraud, gave this charge: \u201cIn cases like this, wherein it is sought to prove by paroi evidence mutual mistake or fraud in a written contract for the purpose of having the written contract changed, the law requires that in order to authorize the change the 'evidence must be such as to leave no reasonable doubt in the mind of the jury as to the extent of the mistake or fraud, and if in this case yon do not believe, beyond a reasonable doubt, either that there was a mutual mistake, as pleaded by the defendants, or mistake on the part of the defendant Charles Pace and fraud on the part of the agents of plaintiff, as alleged by defendants, you will return a verdict for plaintiff on the issues as to reforming the deed of trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">This charge was clearly erroneous. We can not recall to mind any controversy of a civil nature between litigants which miay be instituted in the courts of this State, under -the rules of law and practice that obtain with us, where it would be proper to require either party to the controversy to establish the issues raised beyond a reasonable doubt. Sparks v. Dawson, 47 Texas, 138; Rider v. Hunt, 6 Texas Civ. App., 241; Wallace v. Berry, 83 Texas, 330; Baines v. Ullman, 71 Texas, 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We can not say that error is shown as complained of in appellants\u2019 second assignment of error. The charge of the court in submitting the issue of mistake and fraud was correct as far as it went, except in the particular just pointed out, and if the appellants had desired it to have embraced the question presented in the second assignment of error, they Should have asked a charge upon that question; and if the charge had been correctly framed in presenting the point suggested in the assignment the court should have given it, and doubtless would have done so if the appellants had made 'the proper request.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We do not think there is any merit in the points presented by the cross assignments of errors. The court correctly overruled the demurrers, and properly refused the special charge asked by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">For the error of the charge as pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
