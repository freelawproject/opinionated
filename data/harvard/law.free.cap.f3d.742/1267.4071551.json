State, </em>832 So.2d 730, 738-41 (Fla.2002). Facing imminent execution, Chavez has filed a lawsuit claiming that he may experience unnecessary pain when the State of Florida executes him by lethal injection. After conducting an evi-dentiary hearing, the district court denied Chavez\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or stay of execution. This is his appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AOB\">On January 2, 2013, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed Chavez\u2019s death warrant and his execution was set for 6:00 p.m. on February 12, 2014. After the death warrant was signed, Chavez filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit in district court challenging the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s recently revised lethal injection protocol, which substituted midazolam hydrochloride, a sedative in the benzodiazepine family of drugs, for pentobarbital, a barbiturate, as the first drug in the three-drug protocol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Florida\u2019s revised lethal injection protocol, adopted on September 9, 2013 (2013 Protocol), calls for the sequential intravenous administration of three drugs: (1) 500 milligrams of midazolam hydrochloride, which is meant to serve as an anesthetic; (2) 100 milligrams of vecuronium bromide, a neuromuscular blocking agent that paralyzes voluntary muscles, including the diaphragm, and stops respiration; and (3) 240 milliequivalents of potassium chloride, a naturally occurring salt that induces cardiac arrest by interfering with the heart\u2019s electrical activity. Chavez also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or stay of execution (omnibus motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">Although Chavez\u2019s amended \u00a7 1983 complaint raised a number of claims for relief from his impending execution, only one of those claims merits extended discussion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Chavez\u2019s principal claim is that the use of midazolam hydrochloride in the 2013 Protocol violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment because it creates a substantial risk of serious harm. In both his amended complaint and omnibus motion, Chavez alleged that when used by itself midazolam is not effective in inducing \u201ca surgical plane of anesthesia,\u201d which is a state of complete unconsciousness and insensitivity to pain or other \u201cnoxious stimuli\u201d that would prevent a condemned inmate from experiencing the asphyxiation and searing pain caused by the remaining two drugs in the lethal injection protocol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">Relying on the declaration of his retained expert, anesthesiologist Dr. David Lubarsky, Chavez asserted that midazo-lam is not typically used in clinical settings, nor FDA-approved for use, as a standalone anesthetic in major surgical procedures because it has no analgesic (pain-relieving) properties; that it can trigger \u201cparadoxical reactions\u201d which would prevent its sedative properties from taking effect, particularly in those, like himself, who suffer from extreme anxiety or certain other mental disorders; that there is no scientific evidence that 500 milligrams of midazolam would produce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>state of complete unconsciousness; and that the 2013 Protocol is not properly suited to addressing these concerns because it does not require the assistance of trained medical personnel and its mandated consciousness check does not adequately ensure that an inmate is unconscious before the final two drugs in the protocol are administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">Chavez also pointed to published news reports of three recent executions \u2014 the Florida executions of William Happ and Askari Abdullah Muhammad, and the Ohio execution of Dennis McGuire \u2014 each of which is said to have involved varying degrees of movement after the administration of midazolam. Chavez took these reported movements \u2014 a momentary head movement in case of Happ, the opening of an eye in the case of Muhammad, and McGuire appearing to gasp for air \u2014 as indicating that midazolam is not effective in rendering an inmate unconscious and insensate to pain. As a proffered alternative to the use of midazolam, Chavez advocated the use of a barbiturate, either in combination with other drugs or in a single fatal dose, as a more humane method of execution that \u201cwould significantly reduce the substantial risk of excruciating pain\u201d allegedly created by the 2013 Protocol. But the only specific barbiturates named anywhere in his amended complaint or omnibus motion were pentobarbital and sodium thiopental, both of which Florida had previously used as the first drug in its lethal injection protocol. Florida initially used sodium thiopental, but as Chavez explained in an appendix to his amended complaint, \u201cinternational pressure against the death penalty [ ] resulted in a shortage of sodium thiopental\u201d that forced states with capital punishment \u201cto scramble for an alternative drug.\u201d Florida then selected pentobarbi-tal, but as Chavez conceded in his amended complaint, pentobarbital is no longer available and the \u201c2013 Protocol was created in response to [its] unavailability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">After an evidentiary hearing marked by sharply conflicting testimony from Chavez\u2019s expert, Dr. Lubarsky, and the State\u2019s expert, Dr. Roswell Lee Evans, the district court denied Chavez\u2019s omnibus motion for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or stay of execution because he had not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claims, both on the merits themselves and as to the statute of limitations defense the State had asserted. The court rejected Dr. Lubarsky\u2019s testimony as \u201cessentially speculative and insufficient to meet [Chavez\u2019s] burden,\u201d and instead credited Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony that 500 milligrams of midazolam \u2014 forty times the dosage typically used in clinical settings \u2014 would not only induce a deep anesthetic state in which an inmate would be rendered insensate, unconscious, and incapable of feeling pain, but would ultimately result in respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and death. Doc. 50 at 22-25, 33, 35. Based on Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony, the court concluded that the \u201cmassive dose [of midazolam] required by the Florida protocol ... will render the individual insensate to noxious stimuli by placing the individual in an anesthetic state, unable to discern pain,\u201d that its effects would be \u201cquite similar to that of sodium thiopental or pento-barbital on consciousness,\u201d and that it \u201cwould result in a cascade effect with the whole body rapidly starting to shut down\u201d until an inmate\u2019s \u201cultimate[] death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">The court, again crediting Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony, also rejected Chavez\u2019s contention that midazolam, in the massive dose stipulated in the 2013 Protocol, carries a substantial risk of paradoxical reactions, and his contention that the bodily movements reported in the executions of Happ, Muhammad, and McGuire demonstrated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>significant likelihood of consciousness when midazolam is used in an execution protocol. Dr. Evans testified during the evidentiary hearing that the incidence of paradoxical reactions in normal therapeutic settings was \u201cless than 1 percent,\u201d and that a massive dose of midazolam would avoid any potential paradoxical reactions and directly render a person unconscious. The district court credited all of that testimony and discredited Dr. Lubarsky\u2019s contrary testimony. Dr. Evans also testified that body movement does not necessarily indicate consciousness. Crediting that testimony, the' court found that \u201cHapp\u2019s movement (and Muhammad\u2019s, if his eye opened) does not necessarily equate to pain or with consciousness,\u201d that the two-drug protocol used in Ohio to execute McGuire was not \u201csufficiently similar to Florida\u2019s execution protocol\u201d to call Florida\u2019s protocol into question, and that Chavez \u201cmay have only a 1 percent risk of a paradoxical reaction.\u201d Doc. 50 at 25 n. 24, 26-27, 30. Because Chavez had failed to show that Florida\u2019s current lethal injection protocol creates a substantial risk of severe pain, the district court found that he could not successfully challenge the protocol \u201cby contending that the one-drug protocol may be a better execution protocol for Florida to adopt.\u201d Id at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">Chavez timely appealed to us the district court\u2019s denial of his omnibus motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). He has also filed in this Court an application for a stay of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">A preliminary injunction is appropriate if the movant demonstrates all of these elements: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that the preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent irreparable injury; (3) that the threatened injury outweighs the harm the preliminary injunction would cause the other litigant; and (4) that the preliminary injunction would not be averse to the public interest. <em>Parker v. State Bd of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>275 F.3d 1032, 1034-35 (11th Cir.2001). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction only for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Valle v. Singer, </em>655 F.3d 1223, 1225 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">Capital punishment, including capital punishment by lethal injection, generally is constitutional. <em>See Baze v. Rees, </em>553 U.S. 35, 47, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 1529, 170 L.Ed.2d 420 (2008) (plurality opinion).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>Because \u201c[s]ome risk of pain is inherent in any method of execution,\u201d the Eighth Amendment \u201cdoes not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain in carrying out executions,\u201d particularly where the pain results \u201cby accident or as an inescapable consequence of death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 50, 128 S.Ct. at 1529, 1531. Nor does the Eighth Amendment prohibit procedures that create an \u201cunnecessary risk\u201d of pain without more. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 51, 128 S.Ct. at 1529, 1532 (rejecting the petitioners\u2019 contention that the \u201cthe Eighth Amendment prohibits procedures that create an \u2018unnecessary risk\u2019 of pain\u201d). Instead, to prevail on an Eighth Amendment challenge to a lethal injection protocol, a condemned inmate must establish \u201can objectively intolerable risk of harm that prevents prison officials from pleading that they were subjectively blameless for purposes of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 1531 (quotation marks omitted). To demonstrate that, an inmate must show two things: (1) the lethal injection protocol in question creates \u201ca substantial risk of serious harm,\u201d and (2) there are \u201cknown and available alternatives\u201d that are \u201cfeasible, readily implemented,\u201d and that will \u201cin fact significantly reduce [the] substantial risk of severe pain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 52, 61, 128 S.Ct. at 1531-32, 1537; <em>see also id. </em>at 52 n. 3, 128 S.Ct. at 1532 n. 3 (noting that a showing of a \u201csubstantial risk of serious harm\u201d is a \u201cthreshold requirement\u201d for asserting a viable Eighth Amendment challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">Chavez has not established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his Eighth Amendment claim that the use of midazolam hydrochloride in Florida\u2019s current lethal injection protocol amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. In light of the district court\u2019s thorough and detailed credibility determinations and the extensive factual findings that flowed from them, including the court\u2019s finding that the \u201cmassive dose [of midazolam] required by the Florida protocol ... will render the individual insensate to noxious stimuli by placing the individual in an anesthetic state, unable to discern pain,\u201d Chavez has not demonstrated that the use of midazo-lam in the 2013 Protocol creates a substantial risk of serious harm. The district court\u2019s findings, none of which are clearly erroneous, negate any contention that Chavez\u2019s evidence shows that midazolam is not effective as an anesthetic. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 574-575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511-12, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (explaining that factual findings may not be set aside on appeal unless clearly erroneous, and that \u201cwhen a trial judge\u2019s finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence, that finding, if not internally inconsistent, can virtually never be clear error\u201d); <em>United States v. Lebow-itz, </em>676 F.3d 1000, 1009 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cAppellate courts reviewing a cold record give particular deference to credibility determinations of a fact-finder who had the opportunity to see live testimony.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). As a result, Chavez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>cannot show that the use of midazolam would allow him to feel sensations of suffocation and searing pain caused by the other two drugs in the 2013 Protocol, vecuro-nium bromide and potassium chloride. This ground is a sufficient basis to find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Chavez failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">III. THE MOTION FOR A STAY OF EXECUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">The standard for granting a motion for a stay of execution mirrors that for granting a preliminary injunction which, in this specific context, is a stay of execution. A stay should not be granted unless the inmate establishes a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. <em>Valle, </em>655 F.3d at 1225. For the reasons we have already discussed, Chavez has failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claims. For that reason, his motion for a stay of execution is due to be denied without regard to the other three requirements for issuance of one. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\"><em>IV. </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">The district court\u2019s order denying a preliminary injunction is AFFIRMED. The motion for a stay of execution is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">. Chavez's unsuccessful attempts to have his conviction and death sentence set aside are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>reflected in <em>Chavez v. Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections, </em>No. 14-10486, 742 F.3d 940, 2014 WL 504720 (11th Cir. Feb. 10, 2014); <em>Chavez v. State, </em>No. SC14-35, - So.3d -, 2014 WL 346026 (Fla. Jan. 31, 2014); <em>Chavez v. State, </em>No. SC 12-1470, 129 So.3d 1067, 2013 WL 5629607 (Fla. Oct. 11, 2013); <em>Chavez v. Secretary Florida Department of Corrections, </em>647 F.3d 1057 (11th Cir.2011); <em>Chavez v. State, </em>12 So.3d 199 (Fla.2009); and <em>Chavez v. State, </em>832 So.2d 730 (Fla.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">. We do, however, pause to note our agreement with the district court's reasoning concerning Chavez\u2019s claim that the forcible administration of vecuronium bromide would violate his due process rights under <em>Sell v. United States, </em>539 U.S. 166, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003), because it serves no medical purpose in the execution process. As the district court explained, the liberty interest in avoiding involuntary medical treatment that <em>Sell </em>identified does not apply in the context of capital punishment because \"by its nature, the execution process is not a medical procedure, and by design, it is not medically appropriate for the condemned.\u201d Doc. 50 at 39. And \"[u]sing drugs for the purpose of carrying out the death penalty does not constitute medical treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">. Chavez's notice of appeal states that he appeals from \u201cthe decision\" of the district court on February 10, 2014. The decision of the court on that date was to deny his omnibus motion seeking a preliminary injunction, a temporary restraining order, and a stay of execution. Because notice was given to the party opposing the motion for a restraining order and an evidentiary hearing has been held, the motion for a restraining order is moot or, if one prefers, the issues involving it are merged into the motion for a preliminary injunction. Likewise, any attempted appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of a stay of execution is subsumed in Chavez's motion for a stay of execution in this Court. We would not hold that the district court abused its discretion in deciding not to stay the execution unless, at a minimum, we ourselves were going to stay the execution, which would in turn moot an appeal of the district court's denial of a stay. For those reasons, and for the sake of brevity and clarity, we will treat Chavez's appeal as challenging the denial of his request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">.

Letting that showing suffice \u201cwould embroil the courts in ongoing scientific controversies beyond their expertise,\u201d \u201cthreaten to transform [them] into boards of inquiry charged with determining \u2018best practices\u2019 for executions,\u201d and \u201csubstantially intrude on the role of state legislatures in implementing their execution procedures.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">An inmate obviously cannot begin to prove that there is an \u201cavailable,\u201d \u201cfeasible,\u201d and \u201creadily implemented\u201d alternative drug that will \u201cin fact significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 52, 61, 128 S.Ct. at 1532, 1537, without identifying a specific drug that meets those requirements. Chavez has failed to do that. While he attacks the use of midazolam in Florida\u2019s three-drug lethal injection protocol, and broadly advocates for the adoption of a single-drug protocol consisting of a fatal dose of a barbiturate, he has not specifically identified any particular barbiturate that is even allegedly \u201cavailable,\u201d \u201cfeasible,\u201d and can be \u201creadily implemented\u201d by the State of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">Chavez\u2019s filings in the district court did not contend that there is any specific alternative drug that is actually available for use by the State of Florida. In his amended complaint, the appendices to that complaint, and his omnibus motion, Chavez mentioned two barbiturates \u2014 pentobarbi-tal and sodium thiopental \u2014 that could be used in place of midazolam, but he admitted that neither drug was available for use in executions. Chavez conceded in his complaint that Florida\u2019s \u201c2013 Protocol was created in response to the <em>unavailability </em>of pentobarbital.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Doc.15 at 6 (emphasis added). And in an appendix to his amended complaint, Chavez admitted that sodium thiopental is not available for use in lethal injections either. The appendix contains a \u201cRequest for Additional Public Records from the Florida Department of Corrections Pursuant to Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.852(f),\u201d in which Chavez stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-8\">In 2010, international pressure against the death penalty resulted in a shortage of sodium thiopental and the states that employ capital punishment had to scramble for an alternative drug. On June 8, 2011, Florida followed the path of other states when it issued new lethal injection procedures substituting the barbiturate pentobarbital (Nembutal) for sodium thiopental.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">Doc. 20 at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">Instead of alleging that pentobarbital and sodium thiopental are \u201cavailable,\u201d \u201cfeasible,\u201d and can be \u201creadily implemented\u201d by the State of Florida in place of midazolam, Chavez represented to the district court in his filings that they are not available for use in lethal injections. Even if he had not made those concessions, however, his claim would still fail for the same reasons. An inmate must not only plead that a specifically named alternative drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>is \u201cavailable,\u201d \u201cfeasible\u201d and can be \u201creadily implemented\u201d in the challenged lethal injection protocol, he must also prove it. Chavez introduced not one jot, tittle, or iota of evidence that pentobarbital or sodium thiopental is available and can be readily obtained by the State of Florida for use in executing him or any other death-row inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">While Dr. Lubarsky\u2019s declaration generally touted the relative virtues of barbiturates and broadly asserted that there are \u201calternative drugs [that] can reliably and humanely cause death without [the] risk of excruciating pain,\u201d he conspicuously did not name a single barbiturate or any other drug that he believed Florida actually could obtain and use. And he did not testify that there was any such drug. While testifying, Dr. Lubarsky did make a passing reference to the anesthetic propo-fol as an alternative to midazolam, but neither he nor Chavez stated that it was actually available, feasible, and could be readily implemented by Florida in its lethal injection process. An alternative drug that its manufacturer, or its distributor, or the FDA will not allow to be used for lethal injection purposes is no drug at all for <em>Baze </em>purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Throughout the district court proceedings, the most Chavez did in the way of demonstrating an adequate alternative to the 2013 Protocol was asserting that a single-drug protocol was a \u201cfeasible, readily implemented alternative procedure.\u201d He accurately summarized the extent of his contentions at the evidentiary hearing when he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve offered the alternatives, the one-drug protocol.\u201d But he never identified that one drug nor even suggested how Florida could obtain it for use in executions. Chavez has not come close to satisfying his burden of proving the existence of an \u201cavailable,\u201d \u201cfeasible,\u201d and \u201creadily implemented\u201d alternative to mi-dazolam hydrochloride, let alone one that will significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain. This is another reason he has failed to establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his Eighth Amendment challenge to the use of mi-dazolam in Florida\u2019s 2013 Protocol.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">. Even in the absence of Chavez's concessions, it is clear that sodium thiopental and pentobarbital are not available and feasible alternatives to Florida\u2019s 2013 Protocol. Both drugs were once widely used in lethal injection protocols across the country, but they became unavailable for that use after their manufacturers, because of opposition to the death penalty, refused to let the drugs be used in executions. <em>See </em>Molly Hennessy-Fiske, <em>Prolonged Execution Raises Debate on Lethal Injections, </em>Balt.

After Missouri, in 2012, adopted a single-drug lethal injection protocol using propofol, the European Union threatened to limit the export of propofol to American hospitals if it were used in executions. <em>See Mo. to Proceed with Two Executions, </em>Bos. Globe, Oct. 8, 2013, <em>available at </em>2013 WLNR 25135924. In response to national pressure to avoid any interruption in the supply of propofol, Missouri abandoned its single-drug protocol. <em>See </em>Jim Salter, <em>Missouri Governor Stops Execution Using New Drug, </em>Bos.

Therefore, I concur in the majority opinion. I write separately to underscore that the question of whether a significant change has occurred to a state\u2019s lethal injection protocol is a fact-intensive inquiry for which an evidentiary hearing is especially important. The district judge in this case properly conducted an evidentiary hearing and thoroughly studied the parties\u2019 filings and exhibits and the governing legal principles. Indeed, while the district court concluded that expert anesthesiologist Dr. Lubar-sky\u2019s testimony was ultimately speculative and insufficient to meet Chavez\u2019s burden, nothing prevents a future inmate from presenting an anesthesiologist or expert to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>assert an opinion based on more conclusive and methodologically sound results. Further, in the event of a botched execution in this or a future case, such evidence may be relevant in a subsequent Eighth Amendment challenge to Florida\u2019s execution practices.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1302-4\">MARTIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALt\">concurring in judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">In Mr. Chavez\u2019s case, the District Court has made the factual finding that Florida\u2019s \u201cprotocol change substituting midazolam for the first drug in the three-drug protocol is not a substantial change to the protocol.\u201d This finding is not clearly erroneous based on the record before the District Court, so I am compelled to affirm the District Court\u2019s Order denying a preliminary injunction and stay of Mr. Chavez\u2019s execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">I write separately to emphasize the fact-intensive nature of the District Court\u2019s decision in this case and to commend the District Court for holding an evidentiary hearing <em>before </em>concluding that Mr. Chavez \u201chas not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claims because they are barred by Florida\u2019s four-year statute of limitations.\u201d Because I view the statute of limitations issue as dispositive to Mr. Chavez\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims, I agree with the decision to affirm the District Court. But because we review a record from the District Court which arose from a quickly assembled hearing based on a request for injunctive relief, I do not believe that record lends itself to a review of the merits of Mr. Chavez\u2019s underlying claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">Where, as here, the state raises a valid statute of limitations defense to a \u00a7 1983 lethal injection lawsuit, it is not necessary for us to consider the merits of the underlying constitutional claim. <em>See, e.g., Henyard v. Sec\u2019y, DOC, </em>543 F.3d 644, 647 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cWe need not, and do not, reach the merits of Henyard\u2019s constitutional claims [regarding the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s lethal injection procedures] because we conclude: (1) that the district court did not err in determining that the particular claims in Henyard\u2019s current \u00a7 1983 action are barred by the statute of limitations and that thus Henyard has not carried his burden to show a substantial likelihood of success on his \u00a7 1983 complaint....\u201d); <em>McNair v. Allen, </em>515 F.3d 1168, 1178 (11th Cir.2008) (finding a District Court abused its discretion in granting a stay in a \u00a7 1983 lethal injection case by determining the prisoner \u201chad a significant possibility of success on the merits of his claim when, in fact, the complaint was filed beyond the applicable ... statute of limitations\u201d). We review an evidentiary record in which Mr. Chavez was expressly limited by the district court, no doubt due in large measure to the timing of his lawsuit being filed only a couple of weeks before his scheduled execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">Mr. Chavez filed his \u00a7 1983 amended complaint in the District Court on Monday, February 3, 2014. The District Court entered an order that same day directing the parties to file expedited pleadings in the District Court the next day. Mindful of Mr. Chavez\u2019s imminent execution, the District Court also scheduled a \u201climited evi-dentiary hearing\u201d for Wednesday, February 5, 2014 at 9:00 a.m. The Order setting the hearing limited Mr. Chavez to a single witness, Dr. Lubarsky, whose testimony was also limited solely to the subject of his earlier filed affidavit. On February 4th, the state filed a response and motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and, alternatively moved for summary judgment, arguing that Mr. Chavez\u2019s claims were, among other things, barred by the statute of limitations. The state also filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>Court\u2019s order granting a limited evidentia-ry hearing, which the District Court took under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">At the beginning of the evidentiary hearing, the District Court heard arguments on preliminary matters, including arguments about the necessity of even having an evidentiary hearing. Mr. Chavez\u2019s counsel argued that his expert, Dr. Lubarsky would testify, consistent with his earlier filed affidavit, that Florida\u2019s September 2013 changes to its lethal injection protocol worked a \u201csubstantial change\u201d sufficient to overcome any statute of limitations bar. Mr. Chavez\u2019s counsel acknowledged at the time that \u201cif we do not prevail on a substantial change, then obviously the statute of limitations issue is foreclosed, but we will make the case today that this was a substantial change.\u201d Mr. Chavez\u2019s arguments prompted the District Court to ask the state the following question: \u201c[I]s not that determination a fact intensive determination as to whether or not there\u2019s been a substantial change? And as I understand [the state\u2019s] argument, the statute of limitations rests on whether or not there has been a substantial change?\u201d The state answered \u2018Tes\u201d and argued that \u201cmerely substituting\u201d \u201cone anesthetizing drug in the three-drug protocol does not restart your statute of limitations.\u201d After hearing additional argument, the District Court denied the state\u2019s motion for the Court to reconsider its order setting an evidentiary hearing, explaining that the issues raised by the state \u201care all fact dependent.\u201d I could not agree more with the District Court\u2019s decision that an evidentiary hearing was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">It is well-settled that \u201ca method of execution claim accrues on the later of the date on which state review is complete, or the date on which the capital litigant becomes subject to a new or substantially changed execution protocol.\u201d <em>McNair v. Allen, </em>515 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008). Mr. Chavez\u2019s state case became final in 2003 with the denial of certiorari review by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Chavez v. Florida, </em>539 U.S. 947, 123 S.Ct. 2617, 156 L.Ed.2d 637 (2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to overcome Florida\u2019s statute of limitations defense, Mr. Chavez \u201cmust show that he filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint within [four] years of a <em>significant change </em>in [Florida\u2019s] method of administering lethal injections.\u201d <em>Arthur v. Thomas, </em>674 F.3d 1257, 1259 (11th Cir.2012) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">Mr. Chavez\u2019s motion for temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and stay in the District Court alleged his \u00a7 1983 action was not barred by the statute of limitations because the midazolam protocol \u201cis a substantially changed execution protocol.\u201d Specifically, 'Mr. Chavez challenged Florida\u2019s substitution of mi-dazolam hydrochloride for pentobarbital as the first drug in Florida\u2019s three-drug protocol. Unlike pentobarbital, which is a barbiturate, Mr. Chavez\u2019s amended \u00a7 1983 complaint alleged with specificity that \u201cmi-dazolam is an ... inappropriate drug to use to achieve the purpose of the first drug in a three-drug lethal injection protocol because it is never used as the sole anesthetic for a painful procedure and has no analgesic properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">Significantly, Mr. Chavez supported his factual allegations with a declaration from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>Dr. David Lubarsky, an anesthesiologist with impressive credentials from the University of Miami, as well as an affidavit from James R. McDonough, former Secretary for the Florida Department of Corrections. In short, Mr. Chavez presented new and additional information to the District Court in support of his \u00a7 1983 claims that was not presented or considered in <em>Muhammad v. Crews, </em>No. 3:13-cv-1587-J-32JBT, 2013 WL 6844489 (M.D.Fla. Dec. 27, 2013), <em>aff'd sub nom., Muhammad v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>739 F.3d 683 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 894, 187 L.Ed.2d 700 (2014). That additional information included, for example, new allegations that Mr. Muhammad\u2019s \u201ceyes opened three minutes before he was declared dead.\u201d The opening of Mr. Muhammad\u2019s eye at this stage of Florida\u2019s midazolam protocol, Mr. Chavez alleged, \u201cindicates that he was not properly anesthetized and that he would have been experiencing the effects of the vecuronium and potassium chloride already administered.\u201d As I mentioned, the District Court limited Mr. Chavez to one witness, Dr. Lubarsky. The state was, in turn, permitted to call only one rebuttal witness of its choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">We have said that \u201c[wjhether a significant change has occurred in a state\u2019s method of execution is a <em>fact-dependent </em>inquiry, which we have treated as such in each of our recent cases addressing the lethal injection protocols of Alabama, Georgia and Florida.\u201d <em>Arthur, </em>674 F.3d at 1260 (emphasis added). As we emphasized in <em>Arthur, </em>any conclusion that the substitution of one drug for another in a lethal injection protocol does not constitute a \u201csignificant change\u201d is necessarily \u201cpremised on the specific factual allegations and/or evidence presented and <em>considered </em>\u201d in each case. <em>Id. </em>One \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs litigation of a particular lethal injection protocol cannot foreclose all further judicial inquiry into the matter. Were it otherwise, courts would be deprived of the ability to consider the significance of the use of new drug in new ways, as well as the experiences states have had in using the new drug protocols. This is important where, as here, states are experimenting with new drug protocols because of shortages in pentobarbital and other drugs, as well as our evolving scientific knowledge and experience with new drug protocols.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">All this is to say, the District Court should be commended for its cautious and deliberate approach to deciding the disputed factual issues concerning Florida\u2019s new midazolam drug protocol. Given the fact dependent nature of the District Court\u2019s ruling on the issue of whether Mr. Chavez demonstrated a significant change to the protocol, as well as the deference owed District Court fact findings made after an evidentiary hearing, I am compelled to defer to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Chavez has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of his claims because they are barred by Florida\u2019s statute of limitations. The District Court\u2019s fact finding on this issue was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">. Although not the subject of this Order, it is not disputed that Mr. Chavez never had federal habeas review of the merits of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, because he missed the deadline for filing set by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. <em>See Chavez v. Sec\u2019y Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>647 F.3d 1057 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Chavez v. Tucker, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1018, 181 L.Ed.2d 752 (2012). Indeed to my knowledge he is the first inmate in the state of Florida to be executed with no federal habeas review of the merits of his claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
