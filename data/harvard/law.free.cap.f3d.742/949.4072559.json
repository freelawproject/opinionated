Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2), is categorically a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). We previously affirmed Flornoy Smith\u2019s enhanced sentence on the ground that his prior conviction in a Florida court for fleeing and eluding an officer was a violent felony under the Act. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>518 Fed.Appx. 774 (11th Cir.2013). The Supreme Court granted Smith\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded for reconsideration in the light of <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). <em>See Smith v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 258, 187 L.Ed.2d 2 (2013). After reconsideration with the aid of supplemental briefs filed by Smith and the United States, we conclude that the rule in <em>Descamps, </em>which limited the use of the modified categorical approach to determine whether a prior conviction is a violent felony, does not affect the legality of Smith\u2019s sentence. Fleeing and eluding an officer is categorically a violent felony under the Act. <em>See United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290, 1301 (11th Cir.2013). We affirm Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">Smith, a convicted felon, pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing a firearm and ammunition, in and affecting interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Smith had three prior felony convictions: false imprisonment, burglary of an unoccupied dwelling, and fleeing and eluding a police officer. The district court ruled that Smith\u2019s prior convictions were violent felonies and sentenced him to an enhanced sentence of 180 months of imprisonment under the Armed Career Criminal Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">Smith objected to the classification of his prior conviction for \u201cwillfully fleefing] or attempt[ing] to elude a law enforcement officer in an authorized [and marked] law enforcement patrol vehicle ... with [its] siren and lights activated,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2), as a violent felony. He argued that the Florida statute prohibited not only vehicular flight but also flight on foot, which distinguished his prior conviction from <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), in which the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction for vehicular flight was a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act. The United States conceded that the Florida statute could conceivably prohibit both vehicular flight and flight on foot, but argued that the district court could consult the record of Smith\u2019s prior conviction, which established that Smith fled in a vehicle. The district court overruled Smith\u2019s objection and classified his prior conviction for fleeing and eluding a police officer as a violent felony \u201cbased upon the Information to which he pled guilty,\u201d which charged that Smith fled while operating a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-18\">We affirmed Smith\u2019s sentence. <em>Smith, </em>518 Fed.Appx. at 776. We rejected Smith\u2019s argument that the United States failed to prove that he committed vehicular flight as opposed to flight on foot, and we concluded that the district court \u201ccorrectly relied on the certified documents to determine the nature of Smith\u2019s offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775. We also rejected Smith\u2019s argument that our decision in <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that section 316.1935(2) did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>qualify as a violent felony), controlled the outcome of his appeal because we had since held that <em>\u201cHarrison </em>[had] been undermined to the point of abrogation by <em>Sykes\u201d </em>when Smith\u2019s appeal was pending. <em>Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1299. In <em>Petite </em>we held that a \u201cprior conviction for vehicle flight in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) qualified] as a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. We affirmed Smith\u2019s sentence and held that \u201cthe district court did not err in treating Smith\u2019s prior conviction [under section 316.1935(2)] as a predicate offense.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>518 Fed.Appx. at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">One month after we issued our decision, the Supreme Court held in <em>Descamps </em>\u201cthat sentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach when the crime of which the defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of elements.\u201d 133 S.Ct. at 2282. The Court explained that its precedents allowed a sentencing court to consult extra-statutory documents only when a statute contained \u201cmultiple, alternative elements\u201d that \u201ceffectively created] several different crimes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2285, \u201cnot all of which qualify as an [Armed Career Criminal Act] predicate,\u201d and the sentencing court had to \u201cdetermine which crime formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2284. \u201cThe modified approach ... ha[d] no role to play in [Descamps\u2019s] case,\u201d the Court concluded, because Descamps was convicted of burglary under a California statute that did not contain alternative elements. <em>Id. </em>at 2285-86. That statute provided that \u201c[e]very person who enters [specific locations] with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\u201d Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 459. Because the statute omitted the element of breaking (that is, an unlawful entry), an element essential to the generic federal offense of burglary, Descamps\u2019s prior conviction did not qualify as a violent felony and could not \u201cserve as an [Armed Career Criminal Act] predicate.\u201d <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2286. On remand, the United States concedes that the district court erred, under <em>Descamps, </em>when it applied the modified categorical approach to determine whether Smith\u2019s prior conviction for fleeing and eluding a police officer was a violent felony, but the parties disagree about whether we must vacate Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">We review de novo whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>See Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1292. When we employ the categorical approach to conclude that a crime is a violent felony under the Act, we \u201cdisregard the facts of the underlying conviction\u201d and review the decision of the district court \u201clookfing] only to the elements of [a defendant\u2019s] prior conviction.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.2011). We may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>714 F.3d 1270, 1271 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">We agree with Smith and the United States that <em>Descamps </em>established that the district court could not employ the modified categorical approach and consult additional documents to determine that Smith\u2019s prior conviction was a violent felony, <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281-82, but we nevertheless may affirm Smith\u2019s sentence because fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer is categorically a violent felony under the residual clause of the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). In <em>Petite, </em>we held that fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer, which we described as \u201csimple vehicle flight,\u201d is a violent felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>under the Act. 703 F.3d at 1292-93, 1301. Smith attempts to distinguish <em>Petite </em>on the ground that an offender could violate the Florida statute by fleeing on foot. The United States conceded in the district court that an offender could violate the statute by fleeing on foot, but now argues that <em>\u201cPetite </em>left no room for doubt that the statute criminalizes vehicular, not pedestrian, flight.\u201d We are not bound to accept any concessions of the United States not supported by the record or the law of our Court, <em>see United States v. Lee, </em>586 F.3d 859, 866 (11th Cir.2009), and we conduct our own analysis affirming Smith\u2019s enhanced sentence. We conclude that, based on the text of the Florida statute and other authorities, section 316.1935(2) prohibits vehicular flight, but, in any event, fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer, whether on foot or in a vehicle, is categorically a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The whole text of the Florida statute supports our interpretation in <em>Petite </em>that section 316.1935(2) prohibits vehicular flight. <em>See </em>Antonin Scalia <em>&amp; </em>Bryan A. Garner, <em>Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts </em>167 (2012) (\u201cThe text must be construed as a whole.\u201d). Section 316.1935(2) is the lesser-included-offense of aggravated vehicle flight defined in section 316.1935(3). Both subsection (2) and subsection (3) prohibit \u201cwillfully fleeting] or attempt[ing] to elude a law enforcement officer in an authorized law enforcement patrol vehicle.\u201d But subsection (3) imposes a harsher penalty for any person who, while fleeing or attempting to elude the officer, \u201c[d]rives at a high speed, or in any manner which demonstrates a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3). A violation of subsection (3) necessarily requires \u201c[d]riv[ing]\u201d a vehicle, <em>id., </em>and we interpret the lesser-included-offense of subsection (2) likewise to require driving a vehicle. Moreover, the statute is located in Title XXIII of the Florida Statutes, which regulates \u201cMotor Vehicles,\u201d and chapter 316, entitled \u201cState Uniform Traffic Control.\u201d Although the location of the statute is not dispositive, it persuades us that the statute more likely governs offenses involving motor vehicles, such as vehicular flight, and not offenses involving pedestrian flight. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>139 F.3d 822, 835 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cAs interpretive aids ... we can look to the title of the statute and the heading of the section in which it is introduced.\u201d (quoting <em>Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co., </em>331 U.S. 519, 528-29, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 1391-92, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947))); <em>see also </em>Scalia &amp; Garner, <em>supra, </em>at 221 (\u201cThe title and headings are permissible indicators of meaning.\u201d). In addition, a punishment for a violation of section 316.1935(2) is revocation of the offender\u2019s driver\u2019s license, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(5), and \u201c[a]ny motor vehicle\u201d involved in the offender\u2019s flight \u201cis deemed to be contraband, which may be seized by a law enforcement agency and is subject to forfeiture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 316.1935(7). These penalties are rationally related to the crime of vehicular flight, not pedestrian flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">The standard criminal jury instruction adopted by the Supreme Court of Florida for section 316.1935(2) provides, as follows, that the prosecution must prove that the offender fled or attempted to elude an officer while operating a motor vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlOS\">To prove the crime of Fleeing to Elude a Law Enforcement Officer, the State must prove the following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-8\">1. (Defendant) was <em>operating a vehicle </em>upon a street or highway in Florida.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-9\">2. (Defendant) knowing [he] [she] had been directed to stop by a duly authorized law enforcement officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>willfully <em>fled in a vehicle </em>in an attempt to elude a law enforcement officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6O\">3. The law enforcement officer was in an authorized law enforcement patrol vehicle with agency insignia and other jurisdictional markings prominently displayed on the vehicle and with siren and lights activated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-4\"><em>In re Standard Jury Instructions in Criminal Cases </em>\u2014 Report <em>2011-01, </em>73 So.3d 136, 138 (Fla.2011) (emphasis added). Under this suggested jury instruction, a jury would not convict a defendant who flees only on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">We also find no support in Florida case law for Smith\u2019s interpretation that the statute prohibits flight on foot. Florida case law instead suggests that, even though an offender might initially flee in his vehicle and later escape his vehicle and continue on foot, an offender must employ a vehicle at some point in the commission of the offense. <em>See, e.g., Sanford v. State, </em>872 So.2d 406, 409 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct.App. 2004) (\u201c[Tjhere is no risk [based on the jury instructions] that the jury would believe that the fleeing and eluding felony was committed solely by Sanford\u2019s act of leaving the car and attempting to go to his residence.\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., id. </em>at 408-09 (distinguishing jury instructions in <em>Anderson v. State, </em>780 So.2d 1012 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct.App.2001), because the \u201ccourt\u2019s concern was that Anderson risked being convicted of a third-degree felony fleeing and eluding offense solely upon proof of what occurred after he stopped [his vehicle]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Because section 316.1935(2) prohibits only vehicular flight, we are bound by our decision in <em>Petite </em>that a prior conviction for fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer is a violent felony. <em>See Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1301. We must rule, as we did in <em>Petite, </em>that under the categorical approach \u201cintentional vehicle flight from a law enforcement officer is an inherently risky offense\u201d and \u201cprovokes a dangerous confrontational response from that officer,\u201d which \u201cplaces property and persons at serious risk both during and after the pursuit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Alternatively, fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer, whether in a vehicle or on foot, is a violent felony under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). When we employ the categorical approach, looking only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense, <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 202, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1593-94, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), we must conclude that fleeing and eluding an officer, whether on foot or in a vehicle, \u201cas a categorical matter, ... presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2273. In <em>Petite, </em>we concluded that section 316.1935(2) shared the same serious potential risks of physical injury as those risks identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Sykes, </em>which involved an Indiana statute prohibiting flight from law enforcement. 703 F.3d at 1300-01. An offender\u2019s flight \u201cinvites, even demands, pursuit\u201d and creates the possibility that \u201cofficers [in] pursuit] ... may deem themselves duty bound to escalate their response to ensure the felon is apprehended.\u201d <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2273. And \u201cthe confrontation between the offender and law enforcement continues to present substantial risks even after the pursuit has ended and the vehicles have stopped moving\u201d because the officer might be forced to use his firearm to subdue the offender. <em>Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1296 (citing <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2274). Our reasoning in <em>Petite </em>applies even if the statute prohibits more than vehicular flight. If the offender flees on foot, the officer is likely to pursue the offender in a vehicle because the statute states that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>offender must flee \u201ca law enforcement officer <em>in an authorized law enforcement patrol </em>vehicle.\u201d Fla. Stat. 316.1935(2) (emphasis added); see <em>also Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1296 (\u201c[W]e are obliged to look beyond the driving conduct of the offender alone.\u201d). The officer\u2019s vehicular pursuit \u2014 a \u201cconfrontational response from the officer\u201d in reaction to the \u201cdefiance of [his] orders\u201d\u2014 creates a risk of injury even if the offender\u2019s flight is on foot. <em>See Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1296. His \u201c[h]eadlong flight \u2014 wherever it occurs \u2014 is the consummate act of evasion,\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000), which \u201cgives the officer reason to believe that the defendant has something ... serious ... to hide\u201d and causes the officer \u201cto escalate [his] response.\u201d <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2273. The offender, in turn, \u201chaving chosen to flee, and thereby commit a crime, ... has all the more reason to seek to avoid capture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2274. \u201c[S]uch an offender is significantly more likely than others to attack, or physically to resist, [his] apprehender, thereby producing a \u2018serious potential risk of physical injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 128-29, 129 S.Ct. 687, 692, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)). His flight creates countless dangers for persons in the vicinity. An offender desperate to escape might use a firearm or ensnare onlookers to effectuate his escape, and the officer may employ force to capture the fleeing offender. <em>See Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2273-74. The offender, whether on foot or in a vehicle, has created risks comparable to risks posed by arson, \u201cwhich ... entails [an] intentional release of a destructive force dangerous to others,\u201d or those posed by burglary, which is \u201cdangerous because it can end in confrontation leading to violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2273.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The district court correctly enhanced Smith\u2019s sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act. Under <em>Sykes </em>and <em>Petite, </em>a prior conviction for fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2), qualifies as a violent felony. An offender who flees or eludes a law enforcement officer in active pursuit in a patrol vehicle categorically presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to that officer and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AsH\">We AFFIRM Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
