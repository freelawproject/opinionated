The answer to this question will determine the outcome of this appeal, and there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the California Supreme Court. Although we are mindful that our certification request adds to the burgeoning caseload of the California Supreme Court, this case raises an important question of California law and has broad implications for disability rights. \u201cComity and federalism counsel that the California Supreme Court, rather than this court, should answer\u201d the certified question. <em>Munson v. Del Taco, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 997, 999 (9th Cir.2008) (certifying questions to California Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Question Certified</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">Pursuant to Rule 8.548 of the California Rules of Court, we respectfully request that the Supreme Court of California answer the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">The California Disabled Persons Act, Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7\u00a7 54 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cDPA\u201d) provides that \u201c[i]ndividuals with disabilities shall be entitled to full and equal access, as other members of the general public, to accommodations, advantages, facilities ... and privileges of ... places of public accommodation ... and other places to which the general public is invited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 54.1(a)(1). Does the DPA\u2019s reference to \u201cplaces of public accommodation\u201d include web sites, which are non-physical places?</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">In response to this question, the California Supreme Court shall not be bound by the manner in which the question has been phrased by this court. We agree to follow the answer provided by the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">Defendant Cable News Network, Inc. (\u201cCNN\u201d) operates CNN.com, a publicly accessible web site containing online news videos. In December 2010, the Greater Los Angeles Agency on Deafness, Inc. (\u201cGLAD\u201d) requested that Time Warner Inc. (\u201cTime Warner\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> caption all of the videos on its news web sites so that hearing-impaired visitors could have full access to the online videos. In February 2011, CNN responded that it offered a number of text-based services and explained that CNN would be \u201cready to provide whatever web access is ultimately required\u201d by a then-pending federal rulemaking action regarding the captioning of online videos.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>GLAD and CNN did not reach an agreement over captioning, and in June 2011, GLAD filed suit in California state court, naming Time Warner<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the defendant. GLAD\u2019s Complaint alleges violations of the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7\u00a7 51 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cUnruh Act\u201d), and the California Disabled Persons Act, Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7\u00a7 54 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cDPA\u201d), and seeks damages, declaratory relief, and a preliminary and permanent injunction \u201crequiring [CNN] to take steps necessary to ensure that the benefits and advantages offered by CNN.com are fully and equally enjoyable to persons who are deaf or have hearing loss in California.\u201d CNN removed the action to federal court, and the parties consented to have the matter heard before a magistrate judge. CNN filed a motion to strike under California\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute, Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 425.16, which provides for the \u201cearly dismissal of unmeritorious claims filed to interfere with the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition,\u201d <em>Club Members for an Honest Election v. Sierra Club, </em>45 Cal.4th 309, 315, 86 Cal.Rptr.3d 288, 196 P.3d 1094 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">The statute establishes a two-step analysis for determining whether a cause of action must be stricken under Section 425.16. <em>Navellier v. Sletten, </em>29 Cal.4th 82, 88, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703 (2002). Under the first step, the defendant is required to make \u201ca threshold showing that the challenged cause of action\u201d arises from acts \u201ctaken in furtherance of the [defendant\u2019s right of petition or free speech ... in connection with a public issue.\u201d <em>Equilon Enters. v. Consumer Cause, Inc., </em>29 Cal.4th 53, 67, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685 (2002) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). At the second step, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish, with competent evidence, \u201ca probability that [he] will prevail on the claimfs].\u201d Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 425.16(b)(1). Applying this analysis, the magistrate judge found that CNN failed to satisfy the threshold showing at the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis and therefore denied CNN\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion without reaching the second merits-based step. CNN timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">In an opinion published concurrently with this order, we reversed the magistrate judge\u2019s decision at the first step of the anti-SLAPP inquiry, concluding that GLAD\u2019s action arose from conduct in furtherance of CNN\u2019s free speech rights. We exercised our discretion to consider the second step in the first instance. <em>Wallace v. McCubbin, </em>196 Cal.App.4th 1169, 1195, 128 Cal.Rptr.3d 205 (2011) (\u201c[W]e have discretion to decide the [second step anti-SLAPP] issue ourselves, since it is subject to independent review.\u201d). We concluded that GLAD was unable to prove a probability of prevailing on its Unruh Act claims as a matter of California law because GLAD could not establish that CNN engaged in intentional discrimination. After rejecting CNN\u2019s constitutional objections to GLAD\u2019s DPA claims, we deferred decision on the remaining issue of whether GLAD can prove a probability of prevailing on its DPA claims pending resolution of the certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Reasons for Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">The certified question presents an issue of significant precedential and public policy importance. Numerous recent cases have discussed the DPA\u2019s applicability to virtual spaces like web sites, but there is no conclusive California authority on point. Since the Internet is increasingly ubiquitous in daily life, and this question is likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>to recur, we respectfully request that the California Supreme Court resolve the issue. We provide the following summary of the parties\u2019 arguments and the relevant case law regarding the applicability of the DPA to web sites. We acknowledge that reasonable arguments exist on both sides of the issue and do not advocate for a particular resolution to the certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In its brief to our court, CNN argues that \u201c[n]o published appellate decision has interpreted the [DPA] to apply to a website that is not related to a brick and mortar place of public accommodation.\u201d To support this position, CNN relies on federal district court cases in California analyzing DPA claims deriving from alleged Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) violations. <em>See Cullen v. Netflix, Inc., </em>880 F.Supp.2d 1017, 1024 (N.D.Cal.2012) (stating that \u201c[t]he Netflix website is not an actual physical place, and therefore, under Ninth Circuit law, is not a place of public accommodation\u201d under the ADA (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of the Blind v. Target Corp., </em>452 F.Supp.2d 946, 952, 958 (N.D.Cal.2006) <em>(\u201cTarget I </em>\u201d) (stating, as to the ADA, that the \u201cNinth Circuit has declined to join those circuits which have suggested that a \u2018place of public accommodation\u2019 may have a more expansive meaning\u201d). In <em>Netflix, </em>the court ruled that, because the plaintiff could not show a violation of the ADA, he could not bring derivative claims for violation of the DPA based on Netflix\u2019s failure to provide closed captioning for hearing-impaired individuals on its streaming library. <em>Netflix, </em>880 F.Supp.2d at 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">CNN further contends that California courts have applied the DPA only where there was a denial of physical access. <em>See Turner v. Ass\u2019n of Am. Med. Colls., </em>167 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1412-13, 85 Cal.Rptr.3d 94 (2008) (holding that there was no violation of the DPA where there was no denial of physical access to testing facility); <em>Madden v. Del Taco, Inc., </em>150 Cal.App.4th 294, 301, 58 Cal.Rptr.3d 313 (2007) (holding that \u00a7 54 \u201chas always drawn meaning from a growing body of legislation intended to reduce or eliminate the physical impediments to participation of physically handicapped persons in community life\u201d (alterations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">GLAD counters that the cases limiting the scope of DPA claims involved claims that were derivative of ADA violations. GLAD posits that because its DPA claims arise independently of the ADA, these claims are not foreclosed by the authority cited by CNN. More specifically, in <em>Net-flix, </em>the court stated that the \u201c[plaintiff] may be able to pursue his discrimination claims if they are asserted as independent claims separate from an ADA violation because both the Unruh Act and the DPA apply to websites.\u201d 880 F.Supp.2d at 1024. GLAD also relies upon <em>Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of the Blind v. Target Corp., </em>582 F.Supp.2d 1185 (N.D.Cal.2007) <em>(\u201cTarget II\u201d), </em>where the court held for class certification purposes that \u201cthe DPA reach[es] Target.com as a kind of business establishment and an accommodation, advantage, facility, and privilege of a place of public accommodation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">GLAD additionally states that, although the cases upon which CNN relies address the DPA\u2019s application to physical places, these cases did not specifically address whether the DPA applies to non-physical places. GLAD maintains that the DPA should be interpreted broadly, citing California authority stating that the DPA \u201cmay also be construed as requiring equal physical access to a nontangible location such as an internet site.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>167 Cal.App.4th at 1412, 85 Cal.Rptr.3d 94. In addition, GLAD argues that the addition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>\u201ctelephone facilities\u201d to the list of places covered by the DPA favors a holding that the DPA applies to web sites, because \u201ctelephone facilities\u201d covers not just physical locations, but also \u201ctariff items and other equipment and services.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 54.1(a)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Finally, GLAD points to the DPA\u2019s statement that \u201c[individuals with disabilities shall be entitled to full and equal access, as other members of the general public, to accommodations, advantages, facilities ... and privileges of ... places of public accommodation ... and other places to which the general public is invited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 54.1(a)(1). GLAD buttresses its policy argument by stating that \u201cCalifornia courts have applied a canon of broad construction to civil rights statutes generally, and to \u00a7 51 [the Unruh Act] and \u00a7 54.1 [the DPA] in particular.\u201d <em>Arnold v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., </em>866 F.Supp. 433, 438 (N.D.Cal.1994). This canon of construction, GLAD argues, reinforces the contention that \u201cCNN.com is surely a \u2018place\u2019 to which the public is \u2018invited,\u2019 particularly given the increasing importance of the Internet.\u201d CNN\u2019s reply brief rejects such a broad construction of the statute, focusing on the fact that the statutory text of the DPA \u201cdoes not include the words \u2018internet\u2019 or \u2018services\u2019 or any other words indicating that it applies to anything other than physical places.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The foregoing precedent leaves us unable to predict how the California Supreme Court would resolve the certified question. Because the question would have significant ramifications for California disability law and would determine the outcome of this appeal, we respectfully seek guidance from the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Administrative Information</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The title of this matter is GREATER LOS ANGELES AGENCY ON DEAFNESS, INC.; DANIEL JACOB; EDWARD KELLY; JENNIFER OLSON, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, v.
