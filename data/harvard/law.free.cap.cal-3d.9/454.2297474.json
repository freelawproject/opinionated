We therefore grant the State of California\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of California, and remand the cause to that court for such further proceedings as may be appropriate. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Pursuant to the mandate hereinabove quoted we have reexamined our opinion in the subject case (reported at 7 Cal.3d 792 [103 Cal.Rptr. 299, 499 P.2d 979]) and certify that we relied upon both the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and article I, section 13, of the California Constitution, and that, accordingly, the latter provision furnished an independent ground to support the result we reached in that opinion. Inasmuch as we deem it unnecessary to alter or amend our prior decision, we reiterate and reinstate that decision in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing respondents to revoke the order suspending petitioner\u2019s license and to provide petitioner, upon due notice, a hearing on the suspension of his license.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
