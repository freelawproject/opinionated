The trial court found coverage under the \u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d provision of the policy. The record sustains the propriety of that ruling, and other points raised by the parties need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\"><em>Facts: </em>The facts are not essentially disputed. On March 13, 1967, plaintiff issued a policy to Milton H. Johnston covering a 1957 Chevrolet, and this policy was in full force and effect on the date of the accident here involved. Milton was the registered owner of the car and paid the premiums to plaintiff. However, the car was actually purchased for the use of his son Billy under an arrangement whereby Billy was to pay for the car, its upkeep, and insurance, while the car would remain in Milton\u2019s name. Billy was then under 18 years of age and was living with his parents in their Lodi home.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">On September 30, 1967, shortly after he was 18 years old, Billy</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>married and moved with his wife to Stockton. He took with him the 1957 car with the consent of his father that he would continue to use it as before when he was at his parents\u2019 home. In December 1967, the car became inoperable by reason of a frozen engine. Sometime in January 1968, Billy found a 1964 Chevrolet Impala suitable for the same use as the 1957 car. Billy purchased the 1964 Chevrolet with his father\u2019s approval, but this time the car was registered in Billy\u2019s name. Billy used the 1964 car for his driving needs the same as he had previously used the 1957 car, and he then sold the inoperable 1957 car. On March 9, 1968, while driving the 1964 car, Billy collided with another vehicle driven by John Mathew Shinn. Mr. Shinn was seriously injured, and his wife was killed. This tragic accident occurred four days before expiration of the policy period. Milton had not bought another car or cancelled his 1967 policy with its coverage provisions. On March 21, 1968, Billy went to plaintiff to inquire about future coverage for his 1964 car; and it was then that plaintiff learned of the March 9th accident, Billy\u2019s purchase of the 1964 car, and his sale of the 1957 car.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Question: <em>Did plaintiff\u2019s policy give defendant Billy Milton Johnston coverage for the subject accident?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Yes. </em>Plaintiff\u2019s policy provided coverage for the \u201cowned automobile\u201d\u2014\u25a0 meaning the described vehicle and including a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile,\u201d which was defined as \u201can automobile not owned by the named insured or his spouse while temporarily used with the permission of the owner as a substitute for the described automobile when withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.\u201d This clause commonly found in automobile liability insurance policies is primarily designed for the benefit of the insured. The purpose is not to defeat liability but reasonably to define coverage by limiting the insurer\u2019s risk to one operating vehicle at a time for a single premium. (12 Couch on Insurance (2d ed. 1964) \u00a7 45.219, p. 261.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The policy itself fixes no limit in time during which the temporary extended coverage is to be effective.  \u201cTemporary\u201d is a word of much elasticity and considerable indefiniteness. <em>(Eastman </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>68 Cal.App. 554 [229 P. 1002].) It has no fixed meaning in the sense that it designates any fixed period of time. <em>(Fleckenstein </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., </em>326 Mich. 591 [40 N.W.2d 733, 736].) As commonly accepted, \u201ctemporary\u201d is an antonym of \u201cpermanent.\u201d <em>(McKee </em>v. <em>Exchange Insurance Association, </em>270 Ala. 518 [120 So.2d 690, 692].) Here, it is unclear whether plaintiff, in its use of the word \u201ctemporary,\u201d was attempting to put a time limitation on the use of the substitute automo-</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>bile. Any doubt as to its meaning must be resolved in accord with settled rules for interpreting an insurance contract.  As said in <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co., </em>46 Cal.2d 423, at pages 437-438 [296 P.2d 801, 57 A.L.R.2d 914]: \u201cIt is elementary,in insurance law that any ambiguity or uncertainty in an insurance policy is to be resolved against the insurer. [Citations.]  If semantically permissible, the contract will be given such construction as will fairly achieve its object of securing indemnity to the insured for the losses to which the insurance relates. [Citation.]  If the insurer uses language which is uncertain any reasonable doubt will be resolved against it; if the <em>doubt </em>relates to extent or <em>fact of coverage, </em>whether as to peril insured against [citations], the amount of liability [citations] or the person or persons protected [citations], <em>the language will be understood in its most inclusive, sense, for the benefit of the insured.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Plaintiff argues that since Billy purchased the 1964 car to use in place of the inoperable 1957 car, and then sold the 1957 car, his use of the 1964 car was not a \u201ctemporary substitute\u201d but rather a \u201cpermanent replacement.\u201d In this regard, plaintiff would limit the coverage of the policy to operation of the substituted automobile during the period of repair until the automobile named in the policy is restored to use. But this argument adds a requirement not found in plaintiff\u2019s policy and relates the word \u201ctemporarily\u201d to the insured car rather than to use of the substitute car. Certainly, plaintiff\u2019s policy contemplated that the insured car might never be restored to use during the term of the policy, for it provided for a \u201ctemporary substitute\u201d when the insured car should be withdrawn from normal use because of \u201cbreakdown . . . loss or destruction.\u201d Here, the breakdown of the 1957 car apparently was such that it did not warrant repair but rather replacement for the remainder of the policy period. The important consideration for coverage under this provision of the policy was not the length of time of use but, rather, the purpose of the substitution and the substantial similarity between the use of the originally insured automobile and its substitute. In short, it is contemplated between the insurer and the insured that the <em>same </em>use of the <em>substitute vehicle </em>will be made as the one originally insured. <em>(Lewis </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>7 Wis.2d 586 [97 N.W.2d 408, 411-412].) Here, Billy used the 1964 car substitute for the same driving needs that he had used the 1957 car; Milton, his father, knew of the substitution and approved of its use for the same purposes as had applied with the 1957 car <em>(Hemphill </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>121 Ga.App. 323, 458 [174 S.E.2d 251]); and the sale of the inoperable 1957 car would not preclude coverage for the 1964 car as a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d for the remainder of the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>period. <em>(Continental Cas. Co. </em>V. <em>Ocean Accident &amp; Guar. Corp., </em>58 Del. 338 [209 A.2d 743].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">In <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company, </em>83 S.D. 32 [153 N.W.2d 397], where substantially the same \u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d provision was considered, the Supreme Court of South Dakota said at page 400: \u201cThe word \u2018temporarily\u2019 relates to and is a restriction on the use of the substitute vehicle. The policy does not similarly require that the insured vehicle be \u2018temporarily\u2019 withdrawn from normal use. This phase of the insurance contract is without time limit. Harte v. Peerless Insurance Company, 123 Vt. 120, 183 A.2d 223. Furthermore, the policy does not require the replacement, or an intention to replace, the insured vehicle in use after being withdrawn from normal use. A breakdown, repair, loss or destruction might be permanent in nature. Obviously, there would never be an intention to replace in use an automobile damaged beyond repair, as in the present case, or one that has been lost or destroyed. Nevertheless, the substitute automobile clause is clearly designed to extend coverage to an insured in those cases during the remainder of the policy period. The insured is thereby afforded protection paid for and the insurer\u2019s risk is confined to one operating vehicle at a time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Here, if plaintiff\u2019s policy, for which a premium was paid, be held to apply to any risk at all, it could apply only to the operation of the 1964 car operated by Billy when the accident occurred. No other risk existed at that time. Plaintiff's risk with respect to the use and operation of the 1957 car ceased with its breakdown and sale. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 5602.) An insurer charges a premium for assuming a risk covered by the policy. An insurer earns a premium only when there is a risk involved. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 481, subd. 1.) The risk to plaintiff under the policy was the same whether Billy operated the 1957 car or the later substituted 1964 car for the same basic purposes\u2014only one operating vehicle was covered at the given time. The policy makes clear that its purpose was to extend coverage, without payment of additional premium, to a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d used in place of the insured automobile withdrawn from normal use for reasons stated in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Plaintiff unavailingly relies on <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa., </em>226 F.Supp. 354, and <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>20 Utah 2d 186 [435 P.2d 925], for the proposition that a newly acquired car cannot qualify for coverage as a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile.\u201d The two cases actually concerned automobiles which were withdrawn from normal use for distinguishable reasons\u2014repossession in <em>Travelers </em>and failure to make financial payments in <em>Hays, </em>not by reason of \u201cbreakdown, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>repair, servicing, loss or destruction.\u201d Therefore, in neither case was the described car in the policy withdrawn from normal use for the specified reasons allowing for a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile,\u201d and consequently in neither case could the later acquired car qualify for coverage on that basis. Here, the 1957 Chevrolet, the described car, was unquestionably \u201cwithdrawn from normal use\u201d by reason of its \u201cbreakdown,\u201d as specified in plaintiff\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The applicable principle in the case of a \u201ctemporary substitute vehicle\u201d is well stated by the Supreme Court of Minnesota in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Nyquist, </em>286 Minn. 157, at pages 159-160- [175 N.W.2d 494]: \u201cIn the replacement-automobile cases the courts are usually willing to allow coverage under the policy as long as there is only one operable car. It makes no difference that the replacement car is purchased before the replaced car is sold as long as the replaced car is sold or is not operable at the time of the accident. In this way other users of the highways are protected and the insurance company\u2019s liability is limited to the operation of one car by the insured.\u201d [Citing numerous authorities.]</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">While plaintiff\u2019s introduction of the word \u201ctemporary\u201d into its \u201csubstitute automobile\u201d provision appears to have created an ambiguity, it is the plaintiff\u2019s language; and plaintiff cannot avoid the effect of its choice of terminology.  As was said in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 755, at page 758 [320 P.2d 90]: \u201c \u2018The provision for coverage of a substituted vehicle \u201cis for the insured\u2019s benefit\u201d and is to be \u201cconstrued liberally in favor of the insured, if any construction is necessary.\u201d \u2019 \u201d In accord: <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>9 Cal.App.3d 508, 518 [88 Cal.Rptr. 246].  Here, it must be concluded that Billy was using the 1964 car as a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d under the terms of plaintiff\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">An argument has been made that the 1964 Chevrolet cannot be regarded as a temporary substitute automobile, because the requirement that the automobile be \u201ctemporarily used with the permission of the owner\u201d suggests that the automobile must belong to someone other than the person using it; and Billy owned the 1964 Chevrolet and was using it. Since, however, we must give the policy provisions a liberal interpretation in favor of the insured (see <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.3d 508, 518; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 755, 758), we find this factor not determinative. Had the 1964 Chevrolet been purchased by Billy\u2019s father, the named insured, or the father\u2019s spouse, it would clearly have been a newly acquired automobile<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>and, could not be regarded as a temporary substitute automobile, the policy specifically providing that temporary substitute automobile may not be one owned by the named insured or his spouse. But the 1964 car was not acquired by Billy\u2019s father or' the father\u2019s spouse, as a result of which the provisions regarding a newly acquired automobile are inapplicable. At the same time, since the 1964 Chevrolet was owned by someone other than the named insured or his spouse, it can qualify as a temporary substitute automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Billy was unquestionably given unrestricted permission to use the 1957 Chevrolet in order to go to work and run errands; and, as hereinabove pointed out, the 1964 Chevrolet was acquired for use as a temporary substitute for the 1957 Chevrolet after breakdown of the latter. Under the circumstances, since Billy was using the 1964 Chevrolet for the same purposes for which he had been given permission to use the 1957 Chevrolet, he must be regarded as a permissive user of the 1964 Chevrolet and hence covered as an insured under plaintiff\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., and Burke, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Under the policy, \u201cOwned Automobile\u201d includes a newly acquired automobile, which is defined as \u201can automobile, ownership of which is acquired by the named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>insured or his spouse, if a resident of the same household, if (1) it replaces an automobile owned by either and covered by this policy . . . and (2) the named insured within 30 days following such delivery date applies to the company for insurance on such newly acquired automobile . . , .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b277-7\">SULLIVAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYN\">I dissent. We must face two questions in this case: First, whether Milton Johnston\u2019s policy afforded coverage to the 1964 Chevrolet; and second, if it did, whether the policy also afforded coverage to Billy Johnston. Unless both questions are answered in the affirmative, the insurer did not assume the risk arising from Billy\u2019s use of the automobile at the time of the accident. The majority answer the first question in the affirmative but do not deal with the second at all. I am at a loss to understand how they can affirm the judgment without deciding whether Billy was an insured under the policy. I respectfully dissent because the policy itself makes clear that both questions must be answered in the negative and that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Taking up the first question, I look to the policy itself. The pertinent provisions are as follows: \u201c[State Farm] . . . agrees with the named insured. . . . (1) To pay on behalf of the <em>insured </em>all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of (A) bodily injury sustained by other persons, and (B) property damage, caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>by accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use ... of the <em>owned automobile </em>. . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Under a section entitled \u201cDefinitions\u2014Insuring Agreements I and II,\u201d the following terms are defined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cOwned Automobile\u2014means the motor vehicle or trailer described in the declarations, and includes a temporary substitute automobile, [and] a newly acquired automobile . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">\u201cTemporary Substitute Automobile\u2014means an automobile not owned by the named insured or his spouse while- <em>temporarily used with the permission of the owner </em>as a substitute for the described automobile when withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201cNewly Acquired Automobile\u2014means an automobile, ownership of which is acquired by the named insured or his spouse, if a resident of the same household, if (1) it replaces an automobile owned by either and covered by this policy . . . and (2) the named insured within 30 days following such delivery date applies to the company for insurance on such newly acquired automobile . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">It is manifest from the above language that the policy affords coverage to the \u201cowned automobile,\u201d that is, the automobile described in the declarations or its substitute, which may be \u201ctemporary\u201d or \u201cnewly acquired.\u201d The original vehicle (the 1957 Chevrolet), not its replacement (the 1964 Chevrolet), was the vehicle described in the policy issued to Milton Johnston, the father of Billy. At that time, of course, Billy was unmarried and living at home with his parents. The 1964 Chevrolet which Billy purchased in January 1968, after he married and established a home of his own was not owned by the named insured, Milton Johnston, or his spouse. It is beyond argument, then, that it could not be a \u201cnewly acquired automobile\u201d of Mr. and Mrs. Milton Johnston so as to fall within the coverage of their policy. It follows then that to be afforded coverage under Milton Johnston\u2019s policy, the 1964 Chevrolet would have to meet the above definition of a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The question then boils down to this: Can the \u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d clause in Milton\u2019s policy be reasonably construed to include a vehicle <em>owned </em>and <em>used </em>by Billy, a person no longer a resident of Milton\u2019s household? I am of the view that a full examination of the policy compels a negative answer. As we have said, \u201cIn the construction of insurance policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>. . . the whole of the contract is to be taken together, each clause helping to interpret the other.\u201d <em>(Jurd </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>(1967) 57 Cal.2d 699, 704 [21 Cal.Rptr. 793, 371 P.2d 569].)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In the first place, the policy expressly states that a temporary substitute automobile cannot be a vehicle owned by either the <em>named insured </em>or his spouse. Secondly, a careful reading of the clause demonstrates that the temporary substitute cannot be a vehicle owned by the person who is <em>using </em>the automobile. The clause itself clearly requires that the automobile be \u201ctemporarily used with the permission of the owner.\u201d The majority misconstrue this provision to require the permission of Milton Johnston, who held no ownership interest in the 1964 Chevrolet. In fact, what the clause unmistakably does is to require the permission of the owner of the substitute automobile, a point recognized by defendants, who argue that Billy could give himself permission to use a vehicle owned by him. Defendants\u2019 strained construction of the clause cannot withstand analysis. Since use is one of the incidents of ownership of a vehicle, it is an absurd proposition to suggest that the clause be construed to require that the owner give permission to himself to use his own vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Moreover, the term \u201csubstitute\u201d within the phrase \u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d clearly indicates that the clause did not afford coverage to the 1964 Chevrolet. A replacement vehicle cannot be a \u201csubstitute,\u201d it has been held, unless it \u201cwas in the possession or under the control of the insured to the same extent and effect as the disabled car would have been except for its disablement.\u201d <em>(Tanner </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; F. M. C. Ins. Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1955) 226 F.2d 498, 500; see also 12 Couch on Insurance (2d ed. 1964) \u00a7 45:233, pp. 271-272.) Here the 1964 Chevrolet was not in the possession of or under the control of the named insured, Milton Johnston; and, unlike the described vehicle it was not owned by Milton. The 1964 Chevrolet was not, therefore, a \u201csubstitute\u201d for the described vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The majority seek to avert the impact of the \u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d clause by finding ambiguity in part of its language. Focusing on the phrase \u201ctemporarily used with the permission of the owner,\u201d they maintain that the word \u201ctemporarily\u201d is ambiguous. Resolving its meaning in favor of the insured, they declare that Billy could use a \u201ctemporary\u201d vehicle for the remainder of the policy period. They rely heavily on <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company </em>(1967) 83 S.D. 32 [153 N.W.2d 397], and <em>Harte </em>v. <em>Peerless Insurance Company </em>(1962) 123 Vt. 120 [183 A.2d 223], in reaching this result. Their reliance is indeed misplaced. <em>Nelson </em>merely decided that the <em>described </em>automobile did not need to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>restored to its normal use because any \u201cbreakdown, loss or destruction\u201d of the automobile might be permanent. Accordingly, the term \u201ctemporarily\u201d does not apply to the described vehicle but is, the <em>Nelson </em>court concluded (p. 400), a \u201crestriction on the use of the <em>substitute </em>vehicle.\u201d (Italics added.) In <em>Harte </em>it was held that the character of the use, whether temporary or permanent, must be decided with reference to the intention of the user. There the court stated (183 A.2d p. 226), \u201c. . . the object of the substitution clause is to afford a temporary insurance expedient to protect the insured\u2019s operation of a borrowed vehicle . . . [and that since the] insurance contract itself fixes no limit . . . during which the temporary extended coverage is to be effective . . . the intention of the insured [is controlling].\u201d (See also 12 Couch on Insurance, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45:230, 45:231, pp. 269-270.) Here, the trial court made no finding of fact concerning the intent of Billy Johnston with respect to the nature of his use of the 1964 Chevrolet. However, in declaring that Billy may \u201ctemporarily\u201d use the 1964 Chevrolet for the remainder of the policy period, the majority have applied no restriction at all, other than the term of the policy in which coverage is afforded. Consequently, they strip the term \u201ctemporarily\u201d of its real significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Whatever might have been the intent of Billy with regard to the use of the 1964 Chevrolet, I conclude for two related reasons that the temporary substitute clause did not afford coverage: First, the clause itself implies that a temporary substitute automobile may not be owned by the user; and second, the replacement vehicle (1964 Chevrolet) was not a \u201csubstitute\u201d for the described vehicle since Milton, the named insured, failed to control or possess the 1964 Chevrolet as he did the original automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">I now turn to the second question presented by this appeal. Assuming arguendo that the 1964 Chevrolet was a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile,\u201d we must still determine whether coverage was afforded to Billy Johnston as an insured under the policy. As previously mentioned, the majority fail to consider this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The provisions defining an insured, contained in what is commonly referred to as an omnibus clause, state as follows: \u201cInsured . . . includes (1) the named insured, and (2) if the named insured is a person or persons, also includes his or their spouse(s), if a resident of the same household, and (3) if residents of the same household, the relatives of the first person named in the declarations, or of his spouse, and (4) any other person while using the owned automobile, provided the operation and the actual use of such automobile are with the permission of the named insured or such spouse and are within the scope of such permission, and (5) ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>any person or organization legally responsible for the use of such owned automobile by an insured as defined under the four subsections above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Of the five subsections only subsection (4), defining a permissive user, is potentially applicable. Since Billy was neither the named insured nor a resident of his parents\u2019 household, subsections (1) through (3) cannot apply. Moreover, subsection (5), which extends coverage only to <em>another </em>who is liable for the use of an automobile by the insured, is inapplicable since a precondition of its applicability is that the user be an insured as defined by any of the four previous subsections. The permissive user provision remains as a possible basis for coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">However, since neither Milton Johnston, the named insured, nor his spouse, could give permission to use an automobile in which they had no ownership interest, subsection (4) is also inapplicable. Without the \u201cpower to grant or withhold\u201d the use of an automobile, no basis exists to extend permission for its use. <em>(Didlake </em>v. <em>Standard Ins. Co. </em>(10th Cir. 1952) 195 F.2d 247, 251 [33 A.L.R.2d 941]; see also 12 Couch on Insurance, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 45:342, pp. 347-348.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Milton Johnston had no ownership interest in the 1964 Chevrolet nor did he exercise any parental control over Billy. Although the trial court found that the father \u201capproved\u201d of the purchase of the automobile, his assent, without the authority to control the use of the automobile, is nothing more than a gratuitous act and of no legal significance in relation to the permissive use provision in the omnibus clause of the policy. In sum, at the time of the accident Billy Johnston was the owner of the 1964 Chevrolet and was operating such vehicle as owner. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Johnston owned the vehicle and therefore neither of them was in a position to grant permission to anyone to use it. Furthermore, Billy required no permission from them or anyone else to use the Chevrolet since he himself was the owner. As a result Billy was not a person using the automobile with the permission of the named insured and therefore did not fall within the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Quite apart from whether it was proper for Billy to be included as an additional insured with regard to the use of the original automobile when it was understood that he was to be the primary user of that automobile, I am unable to reach the result that he can be considered the permissive user of a temporary substitute automobile owned by him. Simply stated, it defies any notion of logic to suggest that Billy was \u201ctemporarily\u201d using a vehicle in which he had acquired an ownership interest as a \u201csubstitute\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>for an automobile that could no longer be used by him or the named insureds. Nor can it be said that the named insureds, Milton Johnston or his spouse, without any control over the use of the automobile, could extend permission for its use by Billy. Therefore, State Farm, the insurer, did not assume the risk of Billy\u2019s use of the automobile at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">To recapitulate, the policy issued by State Farm to Milton Johnston covered neither the Chevrolet which Billy purchased nor Billy himself as an insured. Billy had married, had ceased to be a resident of his father\u2019s household, had established his own home and had bought his own car. It not only defies logic but also offends fairness to say that he remained covered by his father\u2019s policy. I think that the simple answer to the present problem is that Billy should have purchased his own insurance for his own car.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Wright, C. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied May 3, 1973. Wright, C. J., and Sullivan, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
