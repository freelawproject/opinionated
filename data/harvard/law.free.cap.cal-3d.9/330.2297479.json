She subsequently filed an action for personal injuries alleging that as a proximate cause of defendants\u2019 negligence she was \u201crendered sick, sore, lame, and disabled, and was damaged in the sum of One Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($125,000.00).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">In due course, defendants served written interrogatories upon petitioner inquiring inter alia whether she had undergone previous illnesses and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>institutional confinements during her fifetime and requesting a description of the injuries she claims to have suffered in the collision with defendants\u2019 vehicle. In response, petitioner indicated that she had been hospitalized for a prior automobile accident in March or April 1969 and for an overdose of pills in September 1969. Petitioner further stated that she \u201creceived psychiatric treatment from Dr. Ernest W. Ely ... for a few months, but he reported that there was nothing wrong with me. I have no after effects.\u201d Petitioner described her injuries from the accident at issue herein as severe pain in the neck and' back with accompanying dizzy spells and headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Attached to petitioner\u2019s answers to defendants\u2019 interrogatories were various reports of the medical doctors who had treated her both before and after the collision with defendants\u2019 vehicle. Included were the handwritten notes of David W. Oberlin, M.D., which indicated, in an entry dated November 3, 1970, that petitioner had suffered a backache on and off since September 1969, the date of her attempted suicide.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his formal report to petitioner\u2019s counsel, Dr. Oberlin noted that petitioner stated she has \u201chad some mild back pain which began insidiously a few years ago, and whether this is related to or correlated with her previous auto accident I was unable to determine with the material available.\u201d Dr. Oberlin made no correlation between petitioner\u2019s previous \u201cmild back pain\u201d and her attempted suicide. The doctor diagnosed petitioner\u2019s injuries as a \u201ccervical strain, with tenderness out of proportion to the clinical findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The report of John R. Clark, M.D., prepared after the accident at issue herein, and addressed to Dr. Oberlin, states that he had \u201cread the reports of Dr. Ely but was impressed that she [petitioner] seems to be making a satisfactory adjustment.\u201d Dr. Clark made no reference to petitioner\u2019s current back injuries in relationship to her psychiatric treatment. With regard to petitioner\u2019s present injuries, Dr. Clark concluded that \u201cthis young woman seemed to need some reassurance. In the face of such excellent health and negative neurologic exam, I would recommend no further work-up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Upon receipt of petitioner\u2019s answers and the doctor\u2019s reports discussed above, defendants subpoenaed all of petitioner\u2019s medical records in the custody of the various doctors who had treated her, including those of Dr. Ely, petitioner\u2019s psychotherapist. Dr. Ely refused to surrender his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>records unless ordered to do so by the court, on the ground that they were privileged. Thereafter, in a letter to the court, defendants requested an ex parte order to compel production by Dr. Ely. The court set the matter on calendar for argument and petitioner filed a memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to the motion. One day prior to the filing of petitioner\u2019s memorandum, however, defendants received the medical records of Drs. Clark, Phillip Morgans and Faustino Bernadett each o-f which contained reports from Dr. Ely describing petitioner\u2019s psychotherapeutic treatment. Defendants removed their pending motion from the court\u2019s calendar stating that they would notice a formal motion at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Although petitioner\u2019s counsel failed to object immediately to this disclosure of Dr. Ely\u2019s records, eventually an order sealing the copies of the records possessed by defendants and their photocopy service was obtained by petitioner in a separate proceeding. (Roberts v. Conlan, Butte Super. Ct. No. 53864.) Defendants then filed a formal motion to compel production of the records. After a hearing, the motion was granted by the respondent court on the condition that Dr. Ely\u2019s records be deposited with the court clerk, open to inspection only by counsel accompanied by their medical examiners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Upon petitioner\u2019s application, we granted an alternative writ of prohibition ordering that Dr. Ely\u2019s records be sealed and maintained in the office of the Butte County Clerk pending further order of this court. We have concluded that a peremptory writ of prohibition should issue barring discovery of Dr. Ely\u2019s records by defendants and that the records of Dr. Ely should be ordered returned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Before proceeding to the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim, however, we must consider the use of the prerogative writ. In <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Superior Court, </em>2 Cal.3d 161, 169 [84 Cal.Rptr. 718, 465 P.2d 854], quoting from <em>Oceanside Union School Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>58 Cal.2d 180, 185-186, footnote 4 [23 Cal.Rptr. 375, 373 P.2d 439], we held that \u201c \u2018the prerogative writs should only be used in discovery matters to review questions of first impression that are of general importance to the trial courts and to the profession, and where general guidelines can be laid down for future cases.\u2019 \u201d In footnote 11 of our opinion in <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. </em>(at p. 170), however, we make it clear that an objection to the trial court\u2019s grant of discovery on irrelevancy grounds, as was the case in <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel., </em>is of an entirely different nature than a challenge to the grant of discovery when the trial court\u2019s order allegedly violates a privilege of the petitioning party. This distinction was set out in <em>West Pico Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>56 Cal.2d 407, 415 [15 Cal.Rptr. 119, 364 P.2d 295] (cited with approval in <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d 161, 170, fn. 11), where, quoting from <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 813, 816-817 [9 Cal.Rptr. 147], we stated: \u201c \u2018One of the prime purposes of the Discovery Act is to expedite the trial of the action. This purpose will be defeated if appellate courts entertain petitions for prerogative writs by which a review of the orders of trial courts in discovery proceedings are sought and which do not clearly demonstrate an abuse of discretion by the trial court where discovery is denied, or a <em>violation of privilege or of the provisions of section 19 of article 1 of the Constitution of this state, where discovery is granted. . . </em>.\u2019 (Italics added.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The need for the availability of the prerogative writs in discovery cases where an order of the trial court granting discovery allegedly violates a privilege of the party against whom discovery is granted, is obvious. The person seeking to exercise the privilege must either succumb to the court\u2019s order and disclose the privileged information, or subject himself to a charge of contempt for his refusal to obey the court\u2019s order pending appeal. The first of these alternatives is hardly an adequate remedy and could lead to disruption of a confidential relationship. The second is clearly inadequate as it would involve the possibility of a jail sentence and additional delay in the principal litigation during review of the contempt order. Thus, the use of the prerogative writ in a case such as this is proper. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1086, 1103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We may now turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Evidence Code section 1014 provides in relevant part that, \u201cSubject to Section 912 [waiver of privilege] and except as otherwise provided in this article, the . patient, whether or not a party, has a privilege to refuse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential communication between patient and psychotherapist if the privilege is claimed by: (a) The holder of the privilege ... or (c) The person who was the psychotherapist at the time of the confidential communication, but such person may not claim the privilege if there is no holder of the privilege in existence or if he is otherwise instructed by a person authorized to permit disclosure.\u201d In <em>In re Lifschutz, </em>2 Cal.3d 415, 423, 431-432 [85 Cal.Rptr. 829, 467 P.2d 557], we pointed out that because of the potential encroachment upon constitutionally protected rights of privacy by the compelled disclosure of confidential communications between the patient and his psychotherapist (cf. <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479 [14 L.Ed.2d 510, 85 S.Ct. 1678]), trial courts should carefully control compelled disclosures in this area.  Thus, the psychotherapist-patient privilege is to be liberally construed in favor of the patient. <em>(Op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 437.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Relying on Evidence Code section 1016, defendants first argue that petitioner has waived the privilege by bringing this action in which she claims to have been rendered \u201csick, sore, lame and disabled.\u201d Section 1016, setting out the patient-litigant exception to the psychotherapist-patient privilege, provides in part that, \u201cThere is no privilege under this article as to a communication relevant to an issue concerning the mental or emotional condition of the patient if such issue has been tendered by: (a) The patient; ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In <em>In re Lifschutz, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 415, 435, we rejected the statutory and constitutional contentions of Dr. Lifschutz that section 1016 did not limit the right of psychotherapists to refuse to disclose confidential information concerning their patients. We noted that under the provisions of section 1016 \u201ca psychotherapist may be compelled to reveal relevant confidences of treatment when the patient tenders his mental or emotional condition in issue in litigation.\u201d (Pp. 422-423.) We expressly restricted the scope of section 1016, however, by stating that, \u201cthe patient-litigant exception allows only a limited inquiry into the confidences of the psychotherapist-patient relationship, compelling disclosure of only those matters <em>directly relevant to the nature of the specific \u2018emotional or mental\u2019 </em>condition which the patient has voluntarily disclosed and tendered in his pleadings or in answer to discovery inquiries.\u201d (P. 431; italics added.) Pointing out that the physician-patient privilege \u201chas been generally applied <em>only to compel disclosure of medical treatment and communication concerning the very injury or impairment that was the subject matter of the litigation,\u201d </em>we stated that there was \u201cnothing to suggest that in the context of the more liberal psychotherapist-patient privilege this exception should be given a broader reading.\u201d (P. 434; italics added.) We also held that even where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the patient files a claim for mental suffering and damage, disclosure can be compelled only with respect to communications which are directly relevant to the specific conditions placed at issue by the patient\u2019s pleadings. \u201cDisclosure cannot be compelled with respect to other aspects of the patient-litigant\u2019s personality even though they may, in some sense, be \u2018relevant\u2019 to the substantive issues of litigation.\u201d (P. 435.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Recognizing that the patient may alone possess knowledge of the contents of the privileged communications and of the nature of the injuries for which redress is being sought, we also held in <em>Lifschutz (at </em>p. 436) that \u201cthe burden rests upon the patient initially to submit some showing that a given confidential communication is not directly related to the issue he has tendered to the court.\u201d In order to fulfill this burden, the \u201cpatient may have to delimit his claimed \u2018mental or emotional distress\u2019 or explain, in general tenns, the object of the psychotherapy in order to illustrate that it is not reasonably probable that the psychotherapeutic communications sought are directly relevant to the mental condition that he has placed in issue.\u201d <em>(In re Lifschutz, supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d 415, 436-437.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In the instant case, as noted above, petitioner alleged that she was \u201crendered sick, sore, lame, and disabled as a result of defendants\u2019 negligence.\u201d There are no allegations in the complaint claiming damages for emotional distress or mental suffering. Furthermore, in her verified petition for the writ of prohibition, and again before us in open court,'petitioner states, through her counsel, that she has tendered no issue concerning her mental or emotional condition. In her answers to defendants\u2019 interrogatories, petitioner indicated that the injuries for which she claims redress consist of pain in her neck, back and legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In addition to so delimiting her claimed injuries, petitioner explained that she had received psychiatric treatment from Dr. Ely for a few months following an overdose of pills. As petitioner pointed out to the trial court, it is significant that neither of the doctors who examined petitioner found any relationship between petitioner\u2019s previous psychiatric treatment and her current back problems, even though they both had knowledge of that treatment. On this showing, it cannot be said that it is reasonably probable that the psychotherapeutic communications sought by defendants are directly relevant to a specific mental condition placed in issue by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In support of their contention that discovery of Dr. Ely\u2019s records should be allowed under section 1016, <em>supra, </em>defendants assert that petitioner could be \u201csore\u201d and \u201cdisabled\u201d mentally as well as physically and that since the doctors\u2019 reports indicate that petitioner\u2019s tenderness is in excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>of that which may be indicated by their clinical findings, there is some indication that her injuries contain a \u201cmental component.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">We must of course recognize that any physical injury is likely to have a \u201cmental component\u201d in the form of the pain suffered by the injured person, at least insofar as he is conscious of the physical injury. Presumably, the perception of pain from a particular injury will vary among individuals. Thus, in every lawsuit involving personal injuries, a mental component may be said to be at issue, in that limited sense at least. However, to allow discovery of past psychiatric treatment merely to ascertain whether the patient\u2019s past condition may have decreased his tolerance to pain or whether the patient may have discussed with his psychotherapist complaints similar to those to be litigated, would defeat the purpose of the privilege established by section 1014, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In rejecting the assertion that section 1016 was an automatic and complete waiver of the psychotherapist-patient privilege, we stated: \u201cIf the provision had as broad an effect as is suggested by petitioner, it might effectively deter many psychotherapeutic patients from instituting any general claim for mental suffering and damage out of fear of opening up all past communications to discovery. This result would clearly be an intolerable and overbroad intrusion into the patient\u2019s privacy, not sufficiently limited to the legitimate state interest embodied in the provision and would create opportunities for harassment and blackmail.\u201d <em>(In re Lifschutz, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 415, 435.)  A fortiori, in a case such as this where there is no specific mental condition of the patient at issue, and discovery of the privileged communications is sought merely upon speculation that there may be a \u201cconnection\u201d between the patient\u2019s past psychiatric treatment and some \u201cmental component\u201d of his present injury, those communications should remain protected by the privilege of section 1014, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The fact that Dr. Oberlin\u2019s handwritten notes indicate that petitioner\u2019s back pains began around the same time as her hospitalization for an overdose of pills (see fn. 1, <em>ante) </em>does not change this result. In speculating that petitioner\u2019s back problems were related to the overdose, defendants are drawing a conclusion that neither Dr. Oberlin nor Dr. Clark was willing to draw in his report. Defendants are, of course, not barred from pursuing that issue further and attempting to prove that petitioner\u2019s back problems existed prior to her collision with defendants\u2019 vehicle. Dr. Oberlin\u2019s notes, without more, however, do not make it reasonably probable that the psychotherapeutic communications sought by defendants are directly relevant to a specific mental condition voluntarily placed at issue in the litigation by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Defendants further argue that petitioner has waived the psychotherapist-patient privilege through disclosure to them of the nature of the treatment given her by Dr. Ely.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Evidence Code section 912, subdivision (a), upon which defendants rely, provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the right of any person to claim a privilege provided by Section . . . 994 (physician-patient privilege), 1014 (psychotherapist-patient privilege) ... is waived with respect to a communication protected by such privilege if any holder of the privilege, without coercion, has disclosed a significant part of the communication or has consented to such disclosure made by anyone. Consent to disclosure is manifested by any statement or other conduct of the holder of the privilege indicating his consent to the disclosure, including his failure to claim the privilege in any proceeding in which he has the legal standing and opportunity to claim the privilege.\u201d Under the terms of this section, the disclosure must reveal a \u201csignificant part of the communication\u201d before a waiver will occur. In <em>In re Lifschutz, supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d 415, 430, we made it clear that the mere disclosure of the <em>existence </em>of the psychotherapist-patient relationship does not reveal a significant part of the communication and thus does not constitute a waiver. Similarly, we do not believe that petitioner\u2019s disclosure of the <em>purpose </em>of her psychiatric treatment waived the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In <em>Lifschutz </em>we recognized both the extent to which the patient confides in his psychotherapist and the need to protect such confidences from unwarranted intrusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As noted above, we also held that in order to avoid the application of the patient-litigant exception to the privilege, the patient may be compelled to \u201cexplain in general terms, the object of the psychotherapy.\u201d (I<em>n re Lifschutz, supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d 415, 437.) There is, of course, a vast difference between the disclosure of a general description of the object of her psychotherapeutic treatment, and the disclosure of all or a part of the patient\u2019s actual communications during psychotherapy.  Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>in the instant case, we conclude that petitioner did not waive her privilege merely by stating that she received psychiatric treatment from Dr. Ely following an overdose of pills. She has disclosed no more than we suggested in <em>Lifschutz </em>as necessary to avoid application of the patient-litigant exception to the psychotherapist-patient privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Defendants also argue that petitioner waived the privilege by reason of the exchange of Dr. Ely\u2019s reports with Drs. Phillip Morgans, Faustino Bernadett and John R. Clark and the subsequent disclosure of those reports to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The mere exchange of petitioner\u2019s records between Dr. Ely and the other physicians treating her did not constitute a waiver of the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Evidence Code section 912, subdivision (d), provides: \u201cA disclosure in confidence of a communication that is protected by a privilege provided by Section . . . 994 (physician-patient privilege), or 1014 (psychotherapist-patjent privilege), when such disclosure is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which the . . . physician, or psychotherapist was consulted, is not a waiver of the privilege.\u201d Defendants refer to all of these doctors as petitioner\u2019s \u201ctreating physicians\u201d and make no claim that the doctors obtained Dr. Ely\u2019s reports in anything other than the normal course of their medical treatment of petitioner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Dr. Ely\u2019s records remained confidential communications while in the hands of Drs. Morgans, Bernadett and Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The statutory physician-patient privilege is that of the patient and not that of the physician. <em>(City &amp; County of S. F. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>37 Cal.2d 227, 233 [231 P.2d 26, 25 A.L.R.2d 1418].) The physician thus has no power to waive the patient\u2019s privilege and, in fact, is under a duty to assert the privilege whenever he is present and a privileged communication is sought to be disclosed. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 995.) The same rule applies to the psychotherapist. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1015.)  Section 912, subdivision (a), <em>supra, </em>contemplates a waiver only when the holder of the privilege, i.e., the patient (Evid. Code, \u00a7 \u00a7 993, 1013), reveals a significant part of the communication, consents to disclosure, or fails to object when he has the opportunity. The disclosure of the communication by the physician or psychotherapist, unless done with the consent of the patient, will not, therefore, constitute a waiver of the privilege under section 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Since petitioner had actively asserted the psychotherapist-patient privilege prior to the disclosure of Dr. Ely\u2019s reports to defendants by her other physicians, defendants\u2019 assertion that the disclosure waived the privilege must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Petitioner\u2019s psychotherapist-patient privilege was properly invoked by Dr. Ely, the psychotherapist, when he refused to release his records to defendants\u2019 photocopy service as requested in the subpoena duces tecum. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1014, subd. (c), 1015.) The privilege was raised at the first opportunity provided for its assertion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   Under California law, upon the refusal of the deponent to produce the documents sought, the burden is upon the party seeking discovery to seek an order from the superior court to compel production. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2034, subd. (a).) There is nothing to require an assertion of the privileged nature of subpoenaed documents prior to a refusal to disclose the documents made in response to the subpoena. Thus, defendants were properly advised of petitioner\u2019s invocation of' the privilege prior to their receipt of the records of Drs. Morgans, Clark and Bernadett. Consequently, the disclosures made by these doctors cannot be asserted by defendants as a waiver by petitioner of her privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Defendants\u2019 final contention is that petitioner waived her psychotherapist-patient privilege by signing the form consent presented her by defendant\u2019s insurance carrier six days after her collision with defendants\u2019 vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u201cTo Whom It May Concern:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">\u201cYou are hereby authorized to furnish to <em>General </em>[?] <em>Adjustment Bureau or Western Casualty &amp; Surety Company </em>any reports or information whatsoever they may request regarding the medical history, physical condition and treatment rendered Janet B.

Welfare </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>7 Cal.3d 1, 10 [101 Cal.Rptr. 541, 496 P.2d 453].)  Accordingly, a form consent by the patient-litigant waiving her privilege is to be strictly construed against the insurance company supplying the form so that the waiver encompasses only that which clearly appears on its face. (Cf. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Redwood Mutual Life Assn., </em>13 Cal.App.2d 573, 576-577 [57 P.2d 222].)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The consent form in the instant case authorized the furnishing of any reports or information regarding petitioner\u2019s \u201cmedical history, physical condition and treatment rendered,\u201d and all X-ray pictures or records regarding petitioner\u2019s \u201cphysical condition\u201d or \u201ctreatment rendered.\u201d The language of the second clause of this form refers only to records regarding petitioner\u2019s physical condition and treatment rendered and therefore does not authorize the release of the records of petitioner\u2019s <em>mental </em>condition sought by defendants. The first clause of the form, authorizing the furnishing of reports regarding petitioner\u2019s \u201cmedical history\u201d and \u201cphysical condition\u201d does not apply directly to past psychiatric treatment and is thus also insufficient to inform petitioner that she was authorizing an investigation into her past psychiatric treatments.  The language of the consent form, plus the circumstance of its having been signed only six days after petitioner\u2019s accident involving physical injuries, would thus lead one in petitioner\u2019s position to believe that the authorization would apply only to reports and records regarding injuries resulting from the particular accident under investigation by the insurance company which obtained the consent. Therefore, the consent form was insufficient to constitute a waiver of petitioner\u2019s psychotherapist-patient privilege. Further, we hesitate ,to sanction the solicitation of such waivers, which would substantially defeat the privacy afforded by the psychotherapist-patient privilege, and possibly disrupt the confidential relationship sought to be protected in <em>In re Lifschutz, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 415, 431-438.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The peremptory writ of prohibition barring the production and inspection of the records of Dr. Ernest W.

As has been aptly pointed out by Judge Edgerton in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C. Cir. 1955) 222 F.2d 398, 401 (quoting from Guttmacher, M., et al., Psychiatry and the Law (1952) p. 272), 1 \u201cThe psychiatric patient confides more utterly than anyone else in the world. He exposes to the therapist not only what his words directly express; he lays bare his entire self, his dreams, his fantasies, his sins, and his shame. Most patients who undergo psychotherapy know that this is what will be. expected of them, and that they cannot get help except on that condition. ... It would be too much to expect them to do so if they knew that all they say\u2014and all that the psychiatrist learns from what they say\u2014may be revealed to the whole world from a witness stand.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">According to petitioner\u2019s answers to defendants\u2019 interrogatories Dr. Morgans treated petitioner at the time of her first automobile accident in March or April 1969, and periodically thereafter. Dr. Bernadett was petitioner\u2019s personal physician for some time prior to the accident at issue herein.

(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1985.) There is no provision in this procedure for an adversary hearing on propriety of the issuance of the subpoena. As noted in the text, Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, subdivision (a), contemplates a hearing on a. motion filed by the proponent of the discovery <em>after </em>the deponent has refused production or to answer a question. For this reason, defendants\u2019 additional argument that a waiver occurred because of the failure of petitioner\u2019s counsel to object to the production of Dr. Ely\u2019s records when the subpoena was originally served upon Dr. Ely is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The consent form reads as, follows:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
