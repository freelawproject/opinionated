They were injured as the result of a collision with an uninsured motorist. Jackson\u2019s medical expenses ($9,833.39) for the treatment of his injuries were paid under the California Medical Assistance Program (Medi-Cal), administered by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">The automobile liability policy issued to Sanders by plaintiff California State Automobile Association Inter-Insurance Bureau contained an uninsured motorist clause, as required by Insurance Code section 11580.2, with maximum coverage of $15,000 for injury to each person, not to exceed $30,000 for each accident. Plaintiff brought the instant interpleader action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>naming as defendants, Sanders, Jackson, and the other occupants of the vehicle and deposited with the clerk of the court (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 386), the sum of $30,000 which was its maximum liability under the policy. The Department, represented by the Attorney General, filed in the action a notice of lien claiming a first lien of $9,833.39 against any judgment rendered in favor of Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">After receiving evidence as to the extent of injuries suffered by each occupant of the Sanders automobile, the trial court announced that it would apportion $11,000 of the $30,000 to Jackson and $19,000 to the other injured persons. Judgment was entered accordingly in which the county clerk was ordered to pay Jackson the sum of $11,000 \u201csubject to the lien of the State of California.\u201d The judgment also stated that the amounts apportioned to the various parties were \u201cinsufficient and inadequate to fully compensate\u201d them and merely reflected a proportionate disposition of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">On the day the judgment was entered,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendants, through their respective counsel, filed a stipulation waiving the right of appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, neither plaintiff insurer, previously dismissed from the action, nor the lien claimant (Department), entered into the stipulation. Notwithstanding the waiver, Jackson appealed from that portion of the judgment which allowed a lien to the Department against the amount awarded him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">As a result we are confronted at the start with the Department\u2019s contention that Jackson waived his right of appeal and that his appeal should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>be dismissed. The Department argues that when the interpleading plaintiff deposited in court the $30,000 representing its limit of liability and was discharged from further liability, plaintiff ceased to be a party in the case and thereupon Jackson and the other defendants became the adversaries. (See 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) p. 1899.) The agreement entered into by such adversaries, so the argument runs, was an \u201carms-length transaction,\u201d was approved by Jackson\u2019s attorney and was submitted to the court, and therefore constituted a waiver of appeal not only as to the parties thereto but also as to Department. In response Jackson asserts (1) that the waiver was intended to relate only to the apportionment of the funds among defendants and not to the validity of the Department\u2019s lien; and (2) that assuming arguendo that it did relate to the validity of the lien, it was ineffective because Jackson\u2019s counsel could not validly waive his client\u2019s right to appeal without the latter\u2019s consent. Since we are of the opinion that Jackson\u2019s first point has merit, we deem it unnecessary to reach the second.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">From our examination of the language of the stipulation (see fn. 4, <em>ante) </em>we are satisfied that Jackson did not thereby waive his right to appeal the validity of the Department\u2019s lien. It is noteworthy that the Department is not a party to the stipulation. On the contrary, only defendants who asserted conflicting claims to the insurance proceeds deposited in court entered into the stipulation. In pertinent part it states: \u201c[The] right of appeal is waived by each of the <em>respective </em>parties.\u201d (Italics added.) \u201cRespective\u201d means \u201cproper or relating to particular persons or things each to each.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1963).) It is apparent from the context in which the stipulation was drafted, some four days prior to the entry of the judgment making Jackson\u2019s award subject to the Department\u2019s lien, that the conflicting claimants to the $30,000 insurance proceeds were merely agreeing that they would not further challenge the judgment insofar as it apportioned the proceeds between Jackson on the one hand and the members of the Sanders family on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">We turn to the merits.  Essentially the main issue of the appeal is this: May the Department recover the amounts paid by it for hospital</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>and medical services<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> required by Jackson for the treatment of injuries sustained in an automobile collision with an uninsured motorist by filing a lien against a judgment awarding Jackson a portion of the proceeds paid under the uninsured motorist coverage of an automobile liability policy? Jackson contends that the Department is not entitled to a lien for two reasons: First, he argues section 14117<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Labor Code section 3852,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Section 14117 was enacted in response to the federal requirement that a state or agency administering a medical assistance plan must, as a condition of federal approval, \u201c. . . take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services (available under the plan) arising out of injury, disease, or disability . . . and (C) that in any case where such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual, the State or local agency will seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability.\u201d (79 Stat. 344 (1965) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25).) Thus the Department\u2019s recovery pursuant to section 14117 of the benefits provided by it subserves the general purpose and intent of the Legislature in establishing the California Medical Assistance Program which declares among other things that \u201cbenefits available under this.chapter shall not duplicate those provided under other . . . contractual or legal entitlements of the person or persons receiving them.\u201d (Former subd. (c), now subd. (b), \u00a7 14000; see Stats. 1972, ch. 1366, \u00a7 1, p. 2718.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The point of Jackson\u2019s first argument is simply that section 14117 permits the Department to recover from \u201canother person . . . civilly liable\u201d but not from Jackson himself. However, as we explain <em>infra, </em>an analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>sis of the facts of the instant case demonstrates that the Department\u2019s lien falls properly within the statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">As set forth in section 14117 (see fn. 8, <em>ante), </em>\u201cthe director shall have a <em>right to recover </em>from such person [civilly hable] the reasonable value of the benefits\u201d provided under the Medi-Cal program. The appropriate legal officer \u201cmay, to enforce such right, institute and prosecute legal proceedings against the third person who is liable for the injury .... In enforcing such right the director may commence and prosecute actions, <em>file liens, </em>or intervene in court proceedings <em>all in the same manner, </em>with the same rights and authority as to notice, settlement and other matters, and <em>to the same extent </em>provided in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 3850), Part I, Division 4 of the Labor Code for an employer or workmen\u2019s compensation insurer where payments have been made or a liability incurred by an employer or an insurer under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus section 14117, subdivision (a), instead of setting forth in specific detail a procedural mechanism for enforcing the Department\u2019s right of recovery, merely incorporates by reference a mechanism existing in the Labor Code. Section 3852, for example, which is included among the Labor Code sections referred to, provides for one of the methods by which, in the context of the workmen\u2019s compensation laws, an employer or his workmen\u2019s compensation carrier who has provided benefits to an injured employee may recover from the negligent third person causing the injuries.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, <em>mutatis mutandis, </em>section 14117 contemplates in the context of the Medi-Cal Act similar methods for the recovery of health care paid by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">In the instant case, Jackson after being injured by an uninsured motorist, received hospitalization and medical care under the Medi-Cal program. Thereafter he sought to recover damages not only by resorting to the $30,000 deposited in court by plaintiff insurance company as the full amount provided by the uninsured motorist coverage of the Sanders policy but also by bringing an independent action against the uninsured motorist. Under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (a), his right of recovery under uninsured motorist coverage allowed him to obtain \u201call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>sums [he] shall be legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or wrongful death from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d As previously stated, in the instant interpleader action judgment was rendered in his favor in the sum of $11,000. His recovery from the money deposited in court by the interpleading plaintiff insurer is based on the latter\u2019s derivative liability under uninsured motorist coverage to Jackson and the other occupants of the insured vehicle for damages for the injuries caused by the uninsured third party tortfeasor. (See <em>Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Diskin </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 502, 505-506 [63 Cal.Rptr. 177].) In short, the insurer\u2019s liability under uninsured motorist coverage stands in the place of the third-party tortfeasor\u2019s liability, at least in part. Indeed, it is significant that the insurer paying a claim under uninsured motorist coverage becomes subrogated to the rights of the insured to whom the claim was paid against the uninsured motorist causing the injury. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (g); see <em>Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Diskin, supra.) </em>Recovery by the injured party under uninsured motorist coverage is, therefore, in effect a recovery from the uninsured tortfeasor of damages for the bodily injuries negligently caused by the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">Under section 14117 and the enforcement procedures which it incorporates from the Labor Code, the Department in enforcing its right of recovery may either bring a legal action against the third person liable for the injury or allow the injured party to do so. (\u00a7 14117; see fn. 10, <em>ante.) </em>Clearly in an action for damages brought directly by Jackson against the negligent third-party motorist, the Department could have joined as a party plaintiff or intervened (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3853) or could have applied for a first lien against the amount of Jackson\u2019s judgment (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3856, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the situation before us, however, Jackson has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>obtained a judgment for the recovery of money deposited in court which money represents damages for the negligence of the third party motorist (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (a)). We think that the Department is as clearly entitled to apply for a first lien against this judgment in Jackson\u2019s favor as it would have been against a judgment rendered in an action brought by Jackson directly against the negligent motorist. In the latter situation, Jackson would recover damages directly; in the situation at bench Jackson has recovered damages through a payment into court of uninsured motorist coverage and the insurer will in turn be entitled to recover from the third party to the extent of such payment. (See Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (g).) The two situations differ only in form but not in substance or effect. As we have explained, the insurer\u2019s liability stands in the place of that of the negligent uninsured motorist. We conclude that under these circumstances the Department\u2019s lien was within the purpose and intent of section 14117 and was properly allowed against the judgment entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">We take up Jackson\u2019s second attack on the Department\u2019s lien. His argument proceeds as follows: First, since the Department is enforcing its right of recovery according to the procedures incorporated from the Labor Code, it is in effect acting in the role of an employer or compensation insurance carrier; and second, since it is pursuing its remedies in such a role and is in effect attempting to recover the proceeds of uninsured motorist coverage, it is barred from doing so by Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (c)(4), which excludes employers and compensation carriers. The exclusion in effect at the) time of Jackson\u2019s injuries and his receipt of Medi-Cal benefits provided that uninsured motorist coverage did not apply \u201c[i]n any instance where it would inure directly or indirectly to the benefit of any workmen\u2019s compensation carrier or to any person qualified as a self-insurer under any workmen\u2019s compensation law.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Although, as we have explained earlier, the Legislature in implementing the Department\u2019s right of recovery under section 14117 has incorporated by appropriate reference the recovery procedures existing under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws, it does not follow that the Department thereby becomes in fact an employer or compensation insurance carrier by availing itself of such recovery procedures in the context of the Medi-Cal Act. It is true that section 14117, subdivision (a), states that these enforcement procedures are \u201call in the same manner . . . and to the same extent provided in . . . the Labor Code for an employer or workmen\u2019s compensation insurer . . . .\u201d However, we do not believe that such language transforms the Department into' an employer or workmen\u2019s compensation insurer or automatically imposes upon its right of recovery a restriction found in the Insurance Code, which makes no mention of the Department. (Cf. fn. 12, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">Finding in section 14117 no express statement or reasonable implication that the Department upon pursuing its right of recovery shall assume all the burdens and disabilities of an employer or employer\u2019s carrier, we consider the purpose and intent of the exclusion in Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (c) (4). We think that its purpose is clearly to shift the cost of an industrial injury sustained by an employee, as the result of the negligence of an uninsured motorist, from the motoring public (who pay the premium for uninsured motorist coverage) to the employer or workmen\u2019s compensation carrier. In other words, the uninsured motorist coverage, the cost of which is borne by holders of automobile liability policies, is withheld and the burden of liability falls on the employer or his carrier at least to the extent of compensation provided under workmen\u2019s compensation law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We apprehend no similar purpose in section 14117. To the contrary, the Legislature has declared that the costs of benefits provided to an injured person under the California Medical Assistance Program shall be paid by any \u201cperson . . . civilly liable\u201d (\u00a7 14117, subd. (a)) and that \u201c[t]he benefits available . . . shall not duplicate those provided . . . under other contractual or legal entitlements . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 14000, subd. (c).) We conclude that Insurance Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>section 11580.2, subd. (c)(4) does not preclude recovery by the Department in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In summary, we hold that the Department is entitled to a lien to the extent of its reduced claim (see fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>against the judgment entered in favor of Jackson for the amounts paid by the Department for hospital and medical services under the California Medical Assistance Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The Department\u2019s appeal is dismissed. The judgment is affirmed as to that portion thereof appealed from. The Department shall have its costs on both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Wright, C.

(See generally Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, div. 9, pt. 3, ch. 7, \u00a7 14000 et seq.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Judgment was entered on August 17, 1971. On September 20, 1971, a purported supplemental judgment was entered pursuant to a stipulation in which the Department agreed to reduce its lien claim to $4,916.69. This judgment awarded $6,083.31 to Jackson, or the difference between the total award of $11,000 and the amount of the reduced lien claim. Since notice of appeal was filed on September 16, 1971, the trial court was without jurisdiction to modify the judgment (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 916); therefore, the supplemental judgment is void. Nevertheless, the parties do not contest the validity of their stipulation, and have advanced arguments concerning the right of the Department to its reduced claim only. Moreover, the Department explains in its brief that the lien was reduced \u201cbecause it would be unconscionable to take $10,000 of a personal injury award of $11,000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b862-10\">The stipulation declared as follows: \u201cIt is hereby stipulated by and between the parties defendant, by and through their respective counsel, that findings of fact, conclusions of law, notice of entry of judgment and right of appeal is waived by each of the respective parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b862-11\">The Department also filed notice of appeal from the August 17 judgment on September 23, 1971, explaining in its reply brief that the cross-appeal is \u201cprecautionary\u201d and intended only to allow a remand to the trial court for correction of the judgment if its language were found to be defective in some manner. Since we have concluded that the judgment of the trial court was correctly stated, the Department\u2019s appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Jackson\u2019s position is that the right to appeal is a substantial right which can be waived by counsel only if the express consent of his client is obtained. (See <em>Linsk </em>v. <em>Linsk </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 272, 278 [74 Cal.Rptr. 544, 449 P.2d 760]; <em>Wuest </em>v. <em>Wuest </em>(1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 339, 345 [127 P.2d 934]; 1 Witkin, Cal.

The Department, citing <em>Fowlkes </em>v. <em>Ingraham </em>(1947) 81 Cal.App.2d 745, 748 [185 P.2d 379], argues that an attorney has an \u201cimplied authority to waive his client\u2019s right of appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The notice of lien filed by the Department claimed a first lien of $9,833.39, said sum representing \u201cpayments by the Department . . . for health care provided Joe Jackson, Jr., a beneficiary under Chapter 7 \u2018Basic Health Care\u2019 of Part 3, Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\u201d An attachment listed items of hospital and doctor bills.

After the payment of such expenses and attorney\u2019s fee the court shall, on application of the employer, allow as a <em>first lien against the amount of such judgment </em>for damages, the amount of the employer\u2019s expenditure for compensation together with any amounts to which he may be entitled as special damages under Section 3852.\u201d (Italics added.) Section 3856, prior to 1959, provided that the employer\u2019s lien be effective as against the \u201centire amount\u201d of a judgment in favor of the employee. This language was construed to mean that an employer\u2019s lien attached not only to that portion of the judgment attributable to special damages but also to pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>and suffering in the form of general damages. (See <em>Dodds </em>v. <em>Stellar </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 496, 504-505 [183 P.2d 658]; <em>Heaton </em>v. <em>Kerlan </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 716, 723 [166 P.2d 857]; <em>Pacific G. &amp; E.

The present language allowing a \u201cfirst lien against the amount of [the] judgment [in favor of the employee]\u201d has been given a similar construction.

(Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (h)(1).) If the Department were considered an employer or workmen\u2019s compensation carrier for all purposes, as Jackson contends, it would seem appropriate that the insurer providing uninsured motorist protection would be entitled to a similar reduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
