For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that a writ of mandate should issue compelling the quashing of the warrant and suppression of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The facts may be summarized briefly. The police obtained a warrant to search defendant\u2019s apartment at 1155 N. La Cienega, apartment 1100, Los Angeles. The search resulted in the seizure of less than one gram of heroin and a large quantity of plastic bags\u2014the evidence defendant seeks to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The relevant details of the affidavit executed by Police Officer McKnight in support of the search warrant are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">(1) Informant No. One told affiant that he saw William Freedman in possession of at least two kilos of heroin;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">(2) Penny Smith told affiant that she purchased two to three ounces of heroin per week from Freedman and stated that the heroin in her possession when she was arrested was so purchased;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">(3) Affiant, while keeping Freedman under surveillance, observed him entering the apartment building at 1155 N. La Cienega;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">(4) At an interview conducted by affiant\u2019s fellow officer, Sergeant Sakoda, affiant witnessed the manager of that apartment building identify Freedman from a photograph as the person who visited apartment 1100 at 1155 N. La Cienega almost every day, staying from fifteen minutes to two hours;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">(5) At the same interview, the manager told affiant that he knew the occupant of apartment 1100 as Belinda J. Alexander (defendant). The manager showed affiant a lease indicating defendant as the tenant of that apartment starting October 31,1969;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">(6) The Department of Motor Vehicles informed affiant that the car parked in the stall assigned to apartment 1100 was registered to defendant at 8804 Wonderland Avenue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">(7) Informant No. Two stated to affiant that Freedman kept large quantities of narcotics at a Wonderland Avenue residence where a female known as Belinda \u201csat\u201d on the stash of narcotics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The issue for decision is whether the affidavit is sufficient to support the issuance of a warrant for the search of apartment 1100, 1155 N. La Cienega.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">A search warrant should only be issued on probable cause. (U.S. Const., Amend. IV; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1525.) The requirement of probable cause interposes the magistrate between the police .officer\u2019s zealous pursuit of suspects and evidence and the citizen\u2019s pursuit of privacy and freedom from unreasonable interference. The magistrate\u2019s function in this scheme is to render a neutral and detached judgment, not to serve as a perfunctory rubber stamp for the police. <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 108 [12 L.Ed.2d 723, 84 S.Ct. 1509].)  To promote the meaningful performance of that function the Supreme Court in <em>Aguilar </em>established a two-pronged test requiring that the affidavit set forth (1) \u201csome of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were,\u201d and (2) \u201csome of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant . . . was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018rehable\u2019.\u201d <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>at p. 114 [12L.Ed.2d at p. 729].)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The instant affidavit provides two components of information about the defendant: (a) Informant No. Two told the officers that Freedman used defendant\u2019s former residence on Wonderland Avenue to store large quantities of narcotics,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (b) police surveillance indicated that Freedman, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>heavily implicated in illegal narcotics activity, regularly visited defendant in her apartment at 1155 N. La Cienega. An examination of these components compels the conclusion that the instant affidavit failed to support the issuance of a warrant to search defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">There can be no question that the information secured from Informant No. Two constituted the fundamental basis for the issuance of the warrant for defendant\u2019s residence. Aside from this information, the affidavit reveals only that defendant had frequent visits from a known narcotics dealer; no connection was made between such visits and any criminal conduct. As we discuss below, however, Informant No. Two\u2019s statement that Freedman kept large quantities of narcotics at defendant\u2019s former residence does not meet either prong of the <em>Aguilar </em>test, and, consequently, that tip, in itself, is inadequate to provide probable cause to believe that narcotics were present in defendant\u2019s La Cienega apartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 176 [77 Cal.Rptr. 785, 454 P.2d 681], this court articulated the first prong of the <em>Aguilar </em>test, requiring that \u201cthe affidavit . . . allege the informant\u2019s statement in language that is factual rather than conclusionary and must establish that the informant spoke with personal knowledge of the matters contained in such statement; . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 179-180.) <em>Hamilton </em>involved an affidavit which stated that the \u201c \u2018affiant was informed on July 13, 1967, by [a] confidential reliable informant,\u2019 \u201d that defendants had illegal drugs in their possession at a specified address. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 179.) We held, \u201cIt is the first \u2018prong\u2019 of the <em>Aguilar </em>test which strikes the affidavit now before us: that document undertakes absolutely no effort to set forth any of \u2018the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were. . . .\u2019 <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>378 U.S. 108, 114 [12 L.Ed.2d 723, 728, 84 S.Ct. 1509].)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 180.) Furthermore, even though the informant alleged that the drugs were kept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>in approximately 300 rolls of 10 pills each, we held that this detail was insufficient to permit an inference that the informer \u201chad personal knowledge\u201d of the matter. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The first prong of the <em>Aguilar </em>test as articulated in <em>Hamilton </em>was recently applied in <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 885 [101 Cal.Rptr. 375, 495 P.2d 1295]. In <em>Halpin, </em>the police officer made an oral application for a search warrant, testifying that he had been informed that a well-described person arriving on a flight from San Diego to San Bernardino would take possession of an equally well-described camper truck containing a large quantity of marijuana. We held that this testimony did not satisfy the requirements of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Hamilton </em>since \u201cThe magistrate was not provided with a sufficient statement of the underlying circumstances from which he could evaluate the validity of the informer\u2019s conclusion that [defendant] was handling, transporting or selling marijuana.\u201d <em>(Halpin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 893.) The court illustrated the fatal omission as follows: \u201cFor example, it is not alleged that the informant personally observed Halpin or others handling or transporting marijuana, or that the informant had had dealings with [defendant] or any other person in connection with the camper. . . <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In the instant affidavit, Informant No. Two was quoted as stating that narcotics, \u201cafter being prepared [were] kept at a stashed [s/c] where a female negro known as Belinda \u2018sat\u2019 on the stash of narcotics, . . . that the last time he had contact with this female negro known as Belinda she was living on Wonderland Avenue. . . .\u201d This statement does not inform the magistrate of underlying circumstances from which he could evaluate the validity of Informant No'. Two\u2019s conclusion that Belinda \u201csat on a stash of narcotics\u201d at Wonderland Avenue. Nor does the affidavit set forth a scintilla of showing that the informant saw Freedman bring narcotics to defendant\u2019s apartment at 1155 N. La Cienega. Freedman may have been a dealer in narcotics but we have not an iota of showing that he visited Belinda at the La Cienega address to \u201cstash\u201d narcotics or that narcotics were \u201cstashed\u201d at that place. The affidavit does not allege that the informant personally observed narcotics in defendant\u2019s apartment at either La Cienega or Wonderland Avenue. Nor does the statement set forth details as to the type or quantity of narcotics or the manner of concealment, if any, utilized at either place. We find even less detail here than the description which the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 176 [77 Cal.Rptr. 785, 454 P.2d 681], held insufficient to support an inference that the informant spoke from personal knowledge; we conclude that informant No. Two\u2019s statement does not satisfy the first prong of the <em>Aguilar </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Furthermore, Informant No. Two\u2019s statements regarding Belinda\u2019s \u201cstash\u201d were stale. The affidavit discloses that Informant No. Two last had contact with Belinda when she lived on Wonderland Avenue and that she took occupancy of apartment 1100 at 1155 N. La Cienega on October 31, 1969. From these facts, it can be inferred that Informant No. Two\u2019s information concerning Belinda was at least one year old when presented to the magistrate on November 12, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">As a general rule, information is stale, and hence unworthy of weight in the magistrate\u2019s \u2022 consideration of an affidavit, unless the information consists of \u201cfacts so closely related to the time of the issue of the warrant as to justify a finding of probable cause at that time.\u201d <em>(Sgro </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1932) 287 U.S. 206, 210 [77 L.Ed. 260, 263, 53 S.Ct. 138, 85 A.L.R. 108]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheridan </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 483, 490 [82 Cal.Rptr. 695].) No clear cut rule, of course, tells us when the time span must be deemed too attenuated. \u201cThe length of the time lapse alone is not controlling since even a brief delay may preclude an inference of probable cause in some circumstances while in others a relatively long delay may not do so. Nonetheless, there are obviously some limits.\u201d <em>(Durham </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1968) 403 F.2d 190, 194, fn. 6.) The information given by Informant No. Two was over one year old; the informant recites no special circumstances that would justify a man of ordinary prudence to conclude that the alleged illegal activity had persisted for more than a year. Hence, the information was stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The second prong of the <em>Aguilar </em>test requiring that the affidavit establish the reliability of Informant No. Two also remains unsatisfied. The Supreme Court in <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 393 U.S. 410 [21 L.Ed.2d 637, 89 S.Ct. 584] noted the insufficiency of the fact that the police officer attests to the reliability of the informant; <em>Aguilar </em>requires a statement of underlying circumstances from which the officer can conclude that the informant was reliable. Mr. Justice White, in a concurring opinion, stated that the honesty of the informant could be established by a statement of \u201c. . . the officer\u2019s previous experience with the informant.\u201d <em>(Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) <em>supra, </em>393 U.S. at p. 425 [21 L.Ed.2d at p. 649]; accord, <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 885, 893, fn. 7 [101 Cal.Rptr. 375, 495 P.2d 1295].) Although the affidavit does contain such a statement indicating the number of arrests and convictions that resulted from information given by Informant <em>No. One, </em>the affidavit supplies no such information with respect to Informant <em>No. Two. </em>In fact, the affiant police officer did not even attest to the reliability of Informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>No. Two.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus the affidavit totally lacked allegations concerning the reliability of this informant\u2014the second prong of the <em>Aguilar </em>test was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">It is clear, therefore, that Informant No. Two\u2019s statement was not sufficient in itself to provide the basis for a finding of probable cause with respect to the La Cienega address. Moreover, the additional information in the affidavit does not lend any significant support to the unreliable tip and certainly does not cause \u201cthe suspicions engendered by the informant\u2019s report to ripen into a judgment\u201d that narcotics were probably being stored in defendant\u2019s La Cienega apartment. (See <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) <em>supra, </em>393 U.S. 410, 418 [21 L.Ed.2d 637, 644-645].)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The additional allegations of the affidavit reveal only that Freedman, who for these purposes is conceded to be a narcotics dealer, visited defendant in her apartment quite regularly. Mere association with Freedman, without some reliable showing of recent criminal activity, however, fails to establish a sufficient basis to subject defendant to the invasion which a search entails.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Nadell </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 746 [100 Cal.Rptr. 444], the affidavit sought to implicate defendant by stale and conclusionary- allegations of criminal activity coupled with detailed factual allegations of defendant\u2019s acquaintance with various known bookmakers and of visits by them to his home. The court held that an \u201caffidavit [which] proves no more than that, on one occasion (inferentially three years before), there was reliable information that this defendant was engaged in bookmaking, . . . that he still carries on an acquaintanceship with . . . bookmakers (the nature of that relationship being unexplained), and that street gossip-implicates him in current bookmaking activity ... is not sufficient.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 756.) The court did not consider the visits by known bookmakers\u2019to defendant\u2019s home significant because, \u201cthere was no showing of criminal activity therein.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 756.) The instant affidavit similarly lacks factual support for the conclusion that Freedman\u2019s present visits to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>fendant\u2019s residence jmvolved criminal activity, and hence the allegations of regular visits do not provide the additional support necessary to justify the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The case of <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) <em>supra, </em>393 U.S. 410 is also directly in point. In <em>Spinelli, </em>the key portion of a challenged affidavit was a conclusionary tip from an unreliable informant that the defendant was operating a gambling operation by use of two specific telephone numbers. Police surveillance of Spinelli revealed a series of visits to an apartment which contained the telephone referred to by the informant, but the surveillance uncovered no evidence of criminal activity. The <em>Spinelli </em>court concluded that the unreliable tip, even when partly corroborated by the police investigation, was not an adequate basis for a finding of probable cause, and the court suppressed the evidence which had been obtained pursuant to the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In the instant case, as in <em>Spinelli, </em>the crucial component of the questioned affidavit is a tip from an unreliable informant averring, in conclusionary terms, that a named narcotics dealer previously used defendant\u2019s former residence as a \u201cstash\u201d for narcotics. Although independent police investigation did reveal that the narcotics dealer regularly visted the defendant (at a new address, however), as in <em>Spinelli </em>the police surveillance failed to connect defendant with any criminal activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we believe the holding in <em>Spinelli </em>directly supports our conclusion that the instant affidavit is inadequate to satisfy the governing state and federal constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Thus we conclude that the affidavit, resting primarily on a conclusionary and stale tip from an unreliable informant, and uncorroborated by sufficient evidence of current criminal activity on the part of defendant, is insufficient to support the issuance of the instant search warrant. Since the record does not indicate whether the district attorney possesses other evidence sufficient to bring defendant to trial, we do not order a dismissal of the proceeding against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the respondent superior court to quash the warrant authorizing search of defendant\u2019s residence at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>1155 N. La Cienega, apartment 1100, Los Angeles, and directing the court to suppress the evidence obtained in the execution of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Wright, C. J., Mosk, J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b396-5\">BURKE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGO\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the affidavit is insufficient to support the issuance of the warrant for the search of defendant\u2019s apartment. In reaching that conclusion the majority, among other things, has omitted relevant facts alleged in the affidavit that are relied upon by the People and support the magistrate\u2019s action in issuing the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The superior court denied defendant\u2019s motion under Penal Code section 1538.5 to suppress evidence obtained under the warrant, and the Court of Appeal upheld the superior court\u2019s action. I cannot agree with the majority that all three courts erred in approving the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">It is settled that a magistrate\u2019s resolution of the issue of probable cause \u201cis to be sustained by reviewing courts as long as there was a \u2018substantial basis\u2019 for his conclusion that legitimate objects of the seach were \u2018probably present\u2019 on the specified premises\u201d (see <em>Skelton </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Cal.3d 144, 153 [81 Cal.Rptr. 613, 460 P.2d 485]), and that a warrant can be upset by an appellate court \u201conly if the affidavit fails <em>as a matter of law </em>to set forth sufficient competent evidence supportive of the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause, since it is the function of the trier of fact, not the reviewing court, to appraise and weigh evidence when presented by affidavit as well as when presented by oral testimony.\u201d (Italics added; <em>id., </em>at p. 150; in accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>71 Cal.2d 296, 302 [78 Cal.Rptr. 510, 455 P.2d 438].)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">We are bound to accept all reasonable inferences in support of the finding of reasonable cause (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 751, 762 [86 Cal.Rptr. 767]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>184 Cal.App.2d 308, 312 [7 Cal.Rptr. <em>461]; People v. Kirk, </em>109 Cal.App.2d 203, 207 [240 P.2d 630]), and when two' or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts we cannot substitute our deduction for that of the trial court (see <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, 72 [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553]). Also, courts should not invalidate a warrant by interpreting it in a hypertechnical, rather than commonsense, manner, and \u201cthe resolution of doubtful or marginal cases . . . should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 109 [13 L.Ed.2d 684, 689, 85 S.Ct. 741]; in accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Johnson) 6 Cal.3d 704, 711 [100 Cal.Rptr. 319, 493 P.2d 1183].)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Here the affidavit upon which the warrant was issued was made and submitted to the municipal court on November 12, 1970, by an experienced narcotics officer, who stated that he had reason to believe that heroin and narcotic paraphernalia were at defendant\u2019s apartment, namely, apartment 1100 at 1155 North La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles. The grounds for this belief are alleged in detail in the affidavit and, as we shall see, the magistrate could reasonably conclude from those allegations that there was probable cause to believe that one William Freedman trafficked in heroin and that he kept heroin and narcotic paraphernalia at defendant\u2019s apartment on La Cienega. The allegations may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In December 1969 affiant received information from a confidential reliable informant [hereafter called Informant No. One] that Freedman was actively involved in heroin and cocaine traffic throughout California and that the informant was present when Freedman had in his possession as much as two kilos of heroin. In the past this informant has given information resulting in six arrests and the seizure of narcotics, and three of the arrestees were held to answer and three are awaiting preliminary hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In September 1970 affiant interviewed Penny Smith, who was arrested with heroin in her possession, and she stated that this heroin was purchased from Freedman, that she was \u201cscoring\u201d several ounces of heroin weekly from him, and that \u201cat one time Freedman had employed her as a runner during which she transported large quantities of heroin to San Francisco . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">On October 6, 1970, affiant was told by a second confidential informant [hereafter called Informant No. Two]: \u201c[A]t one time [this informant] was engaged in narcotics activity with . . . Freedman .... Freedman was dealing large quantities of heroin and cocaine . . . and was sending large quantities of cocaine and heroin to San Francisco and . . . used runners who would transport the narcotics to San Francisco by commercial aircraft. . . . Informant had personally been to Freedman\u2019s residence at Marina Del Ray and had seen Freedman preparing as much as a kilo of heroin for sale. Informant . . . had observed Freedman involved in this activity as late as September, 1970; and . . . Freedman normally did not keep large quantities of narcotics \u2018stashed\u2019 at the Marina, but . . . after being prepared it was kept at a stashed [sz'c] where a female negro known as Belinda \u2018sat\u2019 on the stash of narcotics .... [T]he last time [the informant] had contact with ... . Belinda she was living on Wonderland Avenue . . . .\u201d Freedman lived at 4782 La Villa Marina, apartment H, with a female known as Christy and drove a motorcycle, a 1961 black Porsche, and a 1957 black Ranchero.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The affidavit further alleges facts corroborating Informant No. Two\u2019s statements regarding Freedman\u2019s address, the person with whom Freedman lived, and the vehicles Freedman drove.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">On November 11, 1970, affiant was advised by Sergeant Sakoda that he observed' Freedman \u201center apaftment 1100\u201d at 1155 North La Cienega,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and it may be inferred that the observation was on that sa\u00edne day.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">At an interview by Sergeant Sakoda of the manager of that apartment bouse in affiant\u2019s presence, which interview it may be inferred was on November 11, 1970, the manager, after being shown a picture of Freedman, stated \u201cthat he had observed the person in the photograph often and that he normally would observe this person drive into the apartment parking area . . . and that he would go to apartment llOQ.and visit a female negro . . . known ... as Belinda J. Alexander.\u201d The manager further stated that Freedman visited the apartment most every day, remaining 15 minutes to two hours and that Belinda rarely left the apartment. The manager showed affiant a lease indicating that the apartment was leased to Belinda Alexander as of October 31, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">A check through \u201cDMV\u201d revealed the license to the car in the stall assigned to apartment 1100 was registered to Belinda J. Alexander, 8804 Wonderland.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The affidavit also contains (1) a recital of matters observed by Sergeant Sakoda from which it may be inferred that on November 12, 1970, Freed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>man was involved in a narcotics transaction<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) allegations indicating Freedman has a narcotics record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In concluding that the affidavit is insufficient to show probable cause to believe that heroin and narcotics paraphernalia were in defendant\u2019s apartment on La Cienega, the majority states, inter aha, that \u201cInformant No. Two\u2019s statement that Freedman kept large quantities of narcotics at defendant\u2019s former residence[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] does not meet either prong of the <em>Aguilar </em>test\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that \u201cthe additional information in the affidavit does not lend any significant support to [that informant\u2019s] tip . . . .\u201d I agree that if Informant No. Two\u2019s report is considered by itself at least one prong of <em>Aguilar </em>is not met, but in my opinion when that informant\u2019s entire report (not merely the portion thereof that the majority isolates and inaccurately describes (see fn. 5, <em>ante) </em>is considered together with all the corroborating information in the affidavit (not merely .the limited portion thereof the majority mentions) there is sufficient corroboration so that the magistrate could properly conclude that reliance on that informant\u2019s report is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Considering Informant No. Two\u2019s report apart. from the affidavit\u2019s other allegations that corroborated information in that report, it is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>that the second prong of <em>Aguilar </em>is not- met. It does not appear that the police had prior experience with that informant or that his identity was such as to indicate his reliability. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Scoma, </em>71 Cal.2d 332, 338 [78 Cal.Rptr. 491, 455 P.2d 419].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to the first prong of <em>Aguilar, </em>however, it is at least arguable that this prong is met. Although there is no explicit statement in the affidavit as to the basis of Informant No. Two\u2019s statement regarding Belinda\u2019s \u201csitting\u201d on the narcotics for Freedman, as heretofore appears, the affidavit alleges that this informant stated that he \u201cat one time . . . was engaged in narcotic activity with . . . Freedman,\u201d \u201chad personally been to Freedman\u2019s residence and had seen him preparing . . . heroin for sale,\u201d \u201cobserved [Freedman] involved in. this activity as late as September, 1970,\u201d and had \u201ccontact\u201d with Belinda on Wonderland Avenue. The allegations, read in a commonsense rather than hypertechnical manner (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, supra, </em>380 U.S. 102, 109), arguably might be viewed as indicating that the informant obtained his information as to the location of Freedman\u2019s \u201cstash\u201d in a rehable way such as being told thereof by Freedman<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or personal observation rather than through gossip or rumor. But even if the allegations regarding Informant No. Two\u2019s report are insufficient in themselves to comply with the first prong of <em>Aguilar </em>and even though the informer was previously untested, a magistrate could properly issue a warrant on the basis of such an informer\u2019s report if the supporting affidavit also recites facts indicating that reliance on the information is reasonable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flores, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 563, 564-565; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Johnson) supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 704, 712.) The question the magistrate must ask is \u201cCan it fairly be said that the tip, even when certain parts of it have been corroborated by independent sources, is as trustworthy as a tip which would pass <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>tests without independent corroboration?\u201d <em>(Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 415 [21 L.Ed.2d 637, 643, 89 S.Ct. 584].)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Here in addition to the allegations detailing the police investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>and report of the apartment house manager<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that corroborated information furnished by that informant regarding Freedman generally (e.g., the fact Freedman and Belinda were acquainted, Freedman\u2019s residence, and the vehicles he drove), there was corroboration of part of that informant\u2019s statements regarding Freedman\u2019s criminal activity. The portion of that informant\u2019s report indicating that Freedman trafficked in cocaine and heroin was corroborated by the personal observation of Sergeant Sakoda and the information from Informant No. One and Penny Smith, both of whom purported to speak from personal knowledge, and Informant No. One\u2019s reliability was established by, among other things, the allegations that he previously furnished information resulting in six arrests and the seizure of narcotics and that three of the arrestees were held to answer and three are awaiting trial (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Keener, </em>55 Cal.2d 714, 717, 721 [12 Cal.Rptr. 859, 361 P.2d 587] [disapproved on another issue in <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>64 Cal.2d 842, 845 (52 Cal.Rptr. 4, 415 P.2d 819)]). And even more significantly, the portion of Informant No. Two\u2019s report that Freedman used runners to transport large quantities of heroin to San Francisco was corroborated by Penny Smith\u2019s report that \u201cat one time Freedman had employed her as a runner during which she transported large quantities of heroin to San Francisco.\u201d Manifestly she purported to speak from personal knowledge. Her statement constituted an admission of crime, and such an admission carries its own indicia of credibility (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 583 [29 L.Ed.2d 723, 733, 91 S.Ct. 2075]). Although admissions of crime \u201cdo not always lend credibility to contemporaneous . . . accusations of another\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 584 [29 L.Ed. 2d at p. 734]), here the corroborating matters alleged in the affidavit showing that over a substantial period of time Freedman trafficked in narcotics, made it reasonable to believe Penny Smith\u2019s statement. In view of the corroboration of a substantial portion of Informant No. Two\u2019s report including part of Freedman\u2019s modus operandi (i.e., his use of runners to transport large quantities of heroin to San Francisco), it was apparent that Informant No. Two had not fabricated his report out of whole cloth, and with so much of that report verified the magistrate could reasonably infer that the statement by that informant about the location of Freedman\u2019s narcotics was probably likewise true. (See, e.g., <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 313 [3 L.Ed.2d 327, 332, 79 S.Ct. 329]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Talley, </em>65 Cal.2d 830, 836 [56 Cal.Rptr. 492, 423 P.2d 564]; <em>Galena </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>237 Cal.App.2d 581, 589-590 [47 Cal.Rptr. 88].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The magistrate therefore could reasonably conclude that the report of that informant, when partially corroborated by independent sources, is as trustworthy as a tip which would pass <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>tests without independent corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">This case differs from <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United. States, supra, </em>393 U.S. 410, upon which the majority relies. In <em>Spinelli </em>the affidavit alleged that the FBI was informed by a confidential reliable informant that Spinelli was operating a handbook and accepting wagers by means of telephones with two specified numbers. The affidavit further contained (1) a flat statement that Spinelli was \u201cknown\u201d to the FBI as a gambler and (2) detailed facts from which it appeared that independent investigation by the FBI verified that Spinelli on one day visited the apartment which contained the telephones with the specified numbers and on several days parked at the lot used by residents of that apartment house. With respect to the foregoing flat statement, <em>Spinelli </em>stated (393 U.S. at pp. 418-419 [21 L.Ed.2d at p. 645]), \u201c[J]ust as a simple assertion of police suspicion is not itself a sufficient basis for a magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause, we do not believe it may be used to give additional weight to allegations that would otherwise be insufficient.\u201d <em>Spinelli </em>further concluded that the allegations detailing the FBI\u2019s independent investigative efforts failed to adequately corroborate the informant\u2019s report. <em>Spinelli </em>stated (at p. 417 [21 L.Ed.2d at p. 644]) that \u201cAt most, these allegations indicated that Spinelli could have used the telephones specified by the informant for some purpose\u201d and (at p. 418 [21 L.Ed.2d at p. 645]) that these allegations \u201ccontain no suggestion of criminal conduct when taken by themselves.\u201d Here considerably more details of the informer\u2019s report were verified than was the case in <em>Spinelli, </em>and here, unlike <em>Spinelli, </em>the allegations setting forth the corroborating matters, considered alone, show criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The majority considers it significant that in the present case there was \u201cno . . . corroboration of any criminal activity on the part of the <em>instant </em>defendant\u201d\u2014that insofar as she is concerned the corroboration showed merely that a narcotics dealer regularly visited her apartment. The majority believes that <em>Spinelli </em>is therefore controlling. However, nowhere in <em>Spinelli </em>is it stated that corroboration of the type presumed essential by the majority is required, nor has the majority cited any other authority imposing such a requirement. And such a requirement is. unreasonable. The issue is whether there is a substantial basis for the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that legitimate objects of the search were probably present on the premises to be searched, and in view of Informant No. Two\u2019s proven familiarity with matters relating to Freedman and his criminal operations it was reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>to believe that Informant No. Two was correct as to the location of Freedman\u2019s narcotics supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">But states the majority, Informant No. Two\u2019s statements regarding Belinda\u2019s \u201cstash\u201d were stale. The majority notes that the affidavit discloses that Informant No. Two\u2019s last contact with Belinda was when she lived on Wonderland Avenue and that she took occupancy of apartment 1100 at 1155 North La Cienega on October 31, 1969. The majority states \u201cFrom these facts, it can be inferred that Informant No. Two\u2019s information concerning Belinda was at least one year old when presented to the magistrate on November 12, 1970.\u201d Such an inference, however, is contrary to one that the magistrate and superior court reasonably could have drawn from the affidavit. As heretofore shown, according to the affidavit, Informant No. Two stated on October 6, 1970, that Freedman \u201cwas dealing large quantities of heroin and cocaine,\u201d that the informant in question \u201chad observed Freedman involved [in preparing heroin for sale] as late as September, 1970,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that \u201cFreedman normally did not keep large quantities of narcotics \u2018stashed\u2019 at the Marina but . . . after being prepared it was kept at a stashed [sic] where . . . Belinda [sat] on [it].\u201d From these allegations it may be inferred that at least as of September 1970 Freedman was dealing in narcotics and storing them at Belinda\u2019s. This inference is not precluded by Informant No. Two\u2019s further statement that he had not had contact with Belinda since she lived on Wonderland Avenue, because he could, of course, have been told of the narcotics by Freedman or seen the narcotics at Belinda\u2019s apartment without having contact with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">It further may be inferred from the allegations in the affidavit previously set forth that up until the date the warrant was issued Freedman continued to deal in narcotics and to visit Belinda regularly at her apartment on La Cienega. Nothing in the affidavit shows that he stopped keeping narcotics at Belinda\u2019s.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And since there was probable cause to believe he trafficked in narcotics and stored narcotics at Belinda\u2019s, it was not unreasonable to believe that he probably likewise kept narcotic paraphernalia at her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>From the facts alleged in the affidavit and the reasonable inferences therefrom, the affidavit in my opinion cannot be said as a matter of law to be insufficient to support the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause, I would deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The dissent suggests that one can infer from the affidavit that Informant No. Two actually indicated that Freedman \u201cstashed\u201d narcotics at . defendant\u2019s present La Cienega address, rather than only at her earlier Wonderland Avenue residence. The affidavit reads: \u201cInformant stated that he had observed Freedman involved in [narcotics] activity as late as September, 1970; and he stated that Freedman normally did not keep large quantities of narcotics \u2018stashed\u2019 at [his own residence] but that after being prepared it was kept at a [stash] where a female negro known as Belinda \u2018sat\u2019 on the stash of narcotics. The informant stated that the last time he had contact with this female negro known as Belinda she was living on Wonderland Avenue in the Laurel Canyon area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Although this statement may be somewhat ambiguous, we believe that the most natural and reasonable interpretation of this language is that the informant indicated only that Freedman stashed narcotics at Belinda\u2019s Wonderland address. The affidavit makes no mention of defendant\u2019s present residence and gives absolutely no indication, \u2022as the dissent speculates, that Freedman told Informant No. Two in September 1970 that he was currently stashing narcotics with Belinda. If the informant actually gave the crucial information which the dissent is willing to \u201cinfer,\u201d such information clearly should have been\u2014and, we believe; would have been\u2014included in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Moreover, even if we could interpret the statement in question as a declaration by the informant that Freedman was currently stashing narcotics in Belinda\u2019s residence (wherever that might be), under <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 393 U.S. 410 [21 L.Ed.2d 637, 89 S.Ct. 584], the affidavit would still be insufficient. Even as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201cliberally\u201d interpreted by the dissent, the allegation of criminal behavior by the defendant remains a totally conclusionary charge by an unreliable informant; as discussed in text <em>infra, Spinelli </em>demonstrates that such a tip, even when slightly corroborated by police investigation, cannot support a finding of probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">For other cases recognizing and applying the requirements of <em>Aguilar </em>and finding the involved affidavit to be insufficient, see <em>People </em>v. <em>Scoma </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 332 [78 Cal.Rptr. 491, 455 P.2d 419]; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 836 [83 Cal.Rptr. 369, 463 P.2d 721]; and <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 885 [101 Cal.Rptr. 375, 495 P.2d 1295].

The instant affidavit does not contain even a conclusionary statement of Informant No. Two\u2019s reliability. Furthermore, Informant No. Two\u2019s statements concerning defendant are not detailed factual allegations indicating that he was speaking from personal knowledge but are purely conclusionary.

Sakoda observed Freedman enter Gonick\u2019s car and remain about five minutes and leave. Sakoda then saw Gonick place a package in the trunk.
