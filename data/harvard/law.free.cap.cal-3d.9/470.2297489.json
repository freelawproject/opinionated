Code, \u00a7 211) following trial by jury. He asserts that prejudicial error occurred at trial, namely, two separate violations of the rule which forbids any adverse comment upon the exercise of his right to .remain silent at trial. (See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229].) We have concluded that although <em>Griffin </em>error occurred, that error was harmless beyond all reasonable doubt, in view of the relatively minor nature of the error and the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The robbery victim, Mr. Olness, testified that on the day in question (June 29, 1971) he attended the La Paloma restaurant for dinner, carrying with him $147 in cash. Mr. Olness, who was 60 years old and suffering from cancer, had difficulty remembering many of the details surrounding the offense but in general he testified as follows: After his meal, Olness pulled out a \u201croll\u201d of bills from his pocket and paid his dinner bill. He noticed that his cane was missing, and thereafter two men approached him and told him the cane was at one of their houses. Olness (who confessed that he was a \u201cfool\u201d to flash his money and then to follow these men outside) walked out of the restaurant with these men. One of them grabbed Olness, who fell to the ground; the other man, whom Olness identified as defendant Vargas,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> went through his pockets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>and took his money. Olness testified that it was dark when the robbery occurred. After the robbery, Olness returned to the restaurant, reported the incident, and then went home. He called the police who, according to Olness, met him back at La Paloma. Four or five days later, Olness returned to La Paloma, where one of the restaurant employees, Trini Rubio Campio, pointed out to him two men (defendant Vargas and his co-defendant Medina) whom she believed were the robbers. The police were called in and defendant and Medina were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Miss Campio also testified for the prosecution. Although she spoke only Spanish, her testimony was translated into English by an interpreter. Miss Campio stated that she is an employee of La Paloma, and that on the day in question she observed Mr. Olness, a regular customer, leave the restaurant after his dinner. Miss Campio also left the restaurant, to return to her apartment. Once outside, a small girl (the four-year-old child of another La Paloma employee) called to her. She saw Mr. Olness with two men in a vacant lot near the restaurant. The two men were defendant \u201cPete\u201d Vargas and John Medina. Miss Campio identified defendant and explained that she had been acquainted with him and Medina for two or three months, as customers of La Paloma. In Miss Campio\u2019s words, \u201cJohn\u2014I knew him less because I had seen him in there three or four times. <em>Pete I saw quite often.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Miss Campio testified she was \u201cabsolutely positive\u201d that the two men she saw were defendant and Medina.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">According to Miss Campio, Mr. Olness was \u201c[t]hrown on the ground\u201d when she first observed him, and defendant, who was leaning over him, made a grabbing motion with his hand toward the side of Olness\u2019 pants pocket. Miss Campio \u201cdid not know what he [defendant] took, if anything.\u201d She said in a loud voice to defendant and Medina, who were approximately 25 feet away, \u201cDo not run. You will pay for it. I saw you.\u201d The men said nothing, but walked away from the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Neither Mr. Olness nor Miss Campio were positive that the incident occurred on June 29. Moreover, although Mr. Olness recalled that it was dark at the time, Miss Campio believed that it was still light. Miss Campio also thought that she had seen defendant in the restaurant nearly every day during the 10 days prior to June 29. A police witness testified, however, that defendant had been in jail on another charge until June 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Miss Campio testified that she did not immediately report the incident to the police because she had no phone, and couldn\u2019t speak English. According to Miss Campio, a few days after the robbery, Olness returned to La Paloma and, using \u201csign language\u201d pointed out defendant Vargas to her, and she replied \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Defendant and codefendant Medina chose not to testify and presented no defense, by way of alibi or otherwise. During his closing arguments to the jury, counsel for Medina apparently<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> explained to the jury that the defendants were under no compulsion to testify. Thereafter, during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor agreed that defendants did not have to take the stand, but he inquired, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they have ' some witnesses to say where they were on the 29th, on the evening of the 29th. They had to be somewhere . . . .\u201d (No claim is made that these remarks constituted error.) Thereupon, a conference in chambers was held and the court cautioned the prosecutor against commenting further \u201cas to the context of the defendants not taking the stand, why weren\u2019t witnesses called as to where they were, what they were doing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The prosecutor thereupon completed his closing remarks, including the following: \u201cAnd ladies and gentlemen, there is no evidence whatsoever to contradict the fact that Mrs. Rubio [Campio] saw Mr. Vargas and Mr. Medina over Mr. Olness. <em>And there is no denial at all that they were there. </em>The defendants are guilty beyond any reasonable doubt . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Thereupon, defense counsel requested a further conference in chambers, during which they contended that the prosecutor\u2019s statement con- . stituted <em>\u201cGriffin\u201d </em>error, justifying a mistrial. The court acknowledged that the question of error was \u201cawfully close,\u201d but asked defense counsel if an admonishment to the jury would \u201csatisfy\u201d them. Counsel agreed to withdraw their motion for mistrial \u201cif the Court makes a strong admonishment and states that type of argument is improper.\u201d Thereafter, the court admonished the jury to \u201cdisregard completely\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s statement \u201cregarding there being a failure to deny the defendants being there.\u201d The court explained that in a criminal case, the burden is on the prosecution, that defendants have a right to rely upon the state of the evidence at the close of the People\u2019s case, that they have a constitutional right not to take the stand, and that the jury should not draw any inferences of guilt from defendants\u2019 failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Immediately thereafter, the court instructed the jury on the law, reading to them various instructions previously submitted by the parties. Among these instructions were CALJIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61, which, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>cording to the record, were requested by one or both of the defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These instructions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">CALJIC No. 2.60: \u201cIt is a constitutional right of a defendant in a criminal trial that he may not be compelled to testify. Thus the decision as to whether he should testify is left to the defendant, acting with the advice and assistance of his attorney. You must not draw any inference of guilt from the fact that he does not testify, nor should this fact be discussed by you or enter into your deliberations in any way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">CALJIC No. 2.61: \u201cIn deciding whether or not to testify, the defendant may choose to rely on the state of the evidence and upon the failure, if any, of the People to prove every essential element of the charge against him, and no lack of testimony on defendant\u2019s part will supply a failure of proof by the People so as to support <em>by itself </em>a finding against him on any such essential element.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">Defendant now contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comment upon defendant\u2019s failure to \u201cdeny\u201d the robbery, coupled with the suggestion (in CALJIC No. 2.61) that \u25a0 defendant\u2019s failure to testify may, when supported by other evidence of guilt, be considered by the jury, constituted reversible error. We agree that error was committed in this regard, but we find it harmless in view of its limited nature, and the overwhelming evidence against defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">1. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s </em>Misconduct\u2014Under the rule in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>380 U.S, 609, error is committed whenever the prosecutor or the court comments upon defendant\u2019s failure to testify. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Modesto, 66 </em>Cal.2d 695, 710-711 [59 Cal.Rptr. 124, 427 P.2d 788].) However, not every comment upon defendant\u2019s failure to present a defense constitutes <em>Griffin </em>error.  It is now well established that although <em>Griffin </em>prohibits reference to a defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand in his own defense, that rule \u201cdoes not extend to comments on the state of the evidence or oa the failure of the defense to introduce material evidence or to call logical witnesses. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 238, 247 [75 Cal.Rptr. 688]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>22 Cal.App.3d 25, 32-33 [99 Cal.Rptr. 171]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>18 Cal.App. 3d 930, 936 [96 Cal.Rptr. 229]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 798, 805-806 [95 Cal.Rptr. 146]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>268 Cal.App.2d 470, 475 [74 Cal.Rptr. 111].) For example, in <em>Bethea </em>(p. 936), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>prosecutor made a closing argument which summarized the evidence against defendant and commented that \u201c \u2018[t]he state of the record is that <em>there has been no explanation </em>given for this [the People\u2019s evidence of guilt] ....\u2019\u201d (Italics added.) The court held that \u201c[t]here is absolutely no reference to the fact that defendant did not take the stand; nor is the remark susceptible of such interpretation by inference or innuendo.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">At first glance, the words in <em>Bethea </em>appear substantially identical to the words at issue herein, namely, \u201cthere is no denial at all that they were there [robbing Mr. Olness].\u201d Yet we believe that, although the question is close, the <em>Bethea </em>case is distinguishable. In the present case, the word \u201cdenial\u201d connotes a personal response by the accused himself. Any witness could \u201cexplain\u201d the facts, but only defendant himself could \u201cdeny\u201d his presence at the crime scene. Accordingly, the jury could have interpreted the prosecutor\u2019s remarks as commenting upon defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand and deny his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Other cases in this area confirm our analysis. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Gioviannini, </em>260 Cal.App.2d 597, 604-605 [67 Cal.Rptr. 303], the court found <em>Griffin </em>error when the prosecutor commented upon defendant\u2019s alleged admission to a police officer, stating that \u201c \u2018[t]he defendant, in his own words spoken to Sergeant Wrona, there is no denial of those words, <em>with the defendant present, </em>. . .\u2019\u201d (Italics added by the court.) Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Northern, </em>256 Cal.App.2d 28, 30-31 [64 Cal.Rptr. 15], the court found <em>Griffin </em>error in the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the People\u2019s evidence \u201c \u2018has not been refuted by the Defendant ....\u2019\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Modesto, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 695, 711 [prosecutor\u2019s comment that defendant knows the facts, and is sitting in the courtroom, \u201c \u2018and just sitting.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ham, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 768, 778-779 [86 Cal.Rptr. 906] [trial judge commented that, defendant was in the best position to explain certain facts]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 524, 535-536 [61 Cal.Rptr. 472] [prosecutor\u2019s comment that \u201c \u2018[t]he only thing we have heard from the defendant is this roundabout story from these relatives\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">It is quite possible that the prosecutor in this case only intended to point out to the jury that the defense had introduced no evidence to show that defendant or Medina were elsewhere during the robbery. Yet the language used by the prosecutor was sufficiently ambiguous in this respect to lead us to conclude that <em>Griffin </em>error was committed. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>analyze the question of the prejudicial effect of this error after reviewing an additional claim of <em>Griffin </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">2. <em>Error in Jury </em>Instructions\u2014Defendant contends that CALJIC No. 2.61, set forth above, improperly permitted the jury to consider defendant\u2019s failure to testify in appraising his guilt or innocence. The People argue forcefully that CALJIC No. 2.61 accurately sets forth the \u201ctruism\u201d that \u201cthe failure of a defendant to testify will not \u2018by itself\u2019 supply what the prosecution has failed to do\u2014present the evidence necessary to convict . . . .\u201d  Yet, although this interpretation of the instruction was undoubtedly the intent of its framers, an ordinary juror reading it might assume that if the People have presented some evidence of guilt, the defendant\u2019s silence can then be considered as supplementing the People\u2019s case. Such an instruction would, of course, violate <em>Griffin </em>principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The Second District of the Court of Appeal, in two recent cases, has held that the giving of CALJIC No. 2.61, as it read in this case, was <em>Griffin </em>error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>22 Cal.App.3d 34, 45-46 [99 Cal.Rptr. 103]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Townsend, 20 </em>Cal.App.3d 919, 923-925 [98 Cal.Rptr. 8].) As stated in <em>Williams </em>(p. 45), \u201cBy this [instruction], the jurors were told, in effect, that they could not infer from the circumstance that defendant did not testify that a certain thing was true and use this alone as the support for a finding on their part that an element of the crime or an indication of guilt had been proved, but that they could use such inference along with other evidence to support such a finding. This demeaned the force of the preceding instruction [CALJIC No. 2.60, also given in the instant case] which had stated that they must not draw any inference of guilt. For despite that instruction they are being told that they <em>can </em>draw an inference from defendant\u2019s silence if they can use it along with some other evidence. This was error. [Citation.]\u201d We agree that <em>Griffin </em>error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Although the record indicates that CALJIC No. 2.61 was requested by \u201cdefendant,\u201d the record does not disclose whether defendant Vargas or codefendant Medina requested the instruction. Rather than rely upon a presumption that Vargas requested the instruction (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Vanderbogert, </em>66 Cal.App. 408, 409 [226 P. 35]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Cebulla, </em>137 Cal. 314, 317 [70 P. 181]), and thereupon face the difficult question whether invited error occurred (compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Nye, </em>63 Cal.2d 166, 173 [45 Cal.Rptr. 328, 403 P.2d 736], with <em>People </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>71 Cal.2d 303, 317-320 [78 Cal.Rptr. 217, 455 P.2d 153]), we assume arguendo that the <em>Griffin </em>error was uninvited, for we believe that such error (together with the prosecutor\u2019s indirect comment upon defendant\u2019s failure to testify) was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>3. Prejudicial Effect of Griffin Errors  The applicable test for determining whether an error which violates federal constitutional principles is reversible error is set forth in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065], wherein the court held that \u201cbefore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d This determination \u201cmust be based on our own reading of the record and on what seems to us to have been the probable impact of the . . . [errors] on the minds of an average jury.\u201d <em>(Harrington </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 254 [23 L.Ed.2d 284, 287-288, 89 S.Ct. 1726].)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">First of all, apart from the state of the evidence in this case, we note that the type of <em>Griffin </em>errors involved here' are of a much less direct, and accordingly much less serious, nature than the <em>Griffin </em>errors present in most of the cases which have found .such error prejudicial and grounds for reversal. For example, in <em>Griffin </em>itself, the prosecutor <em>and </em>the court had directly informed the jury that, in appraising defendant\u2019s guilt, it could take into consideration defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Similar error was committed in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, <em>In re Banks, </em>4 Cal.3d 337, 348-349 [93 Cal.Rptr. 591, 482 P.2d 215], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Haston, </em>69 Cal.2d 233, 254-255 [70 Cal.Rptr. 419, 444 P.2d 91].</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Thus, this court has noted that in determining whether prejudicial <em>Griffin </em>error has occurred, \u201cwe must focus upon <em>the extent to which the comment itself might have increased the jury\u2019s inclination to treat the defendant\u2019s silence as an indication of his guilt. </em>The risk that a comment will have this effect may become considerable if either the court [fn. omitted] or the prosecution [fn. omitted] \u2018solemnizes the silence of the accused into evidence against him\u2019 ... by telling the jury \u2018that from the failure of [the defendant] to testify ... the inferences from the facts in evidence [should] be drawn in favor of the State.\u2019 ... A forbidden comment, however, is less likely to affect the \u2018substantial rights\u2019 of a defendant ... if that comment merely <em>notes </em>the defendant\u2019s silence and includes no suggestion that, among the various inferences which might be drawn therefrom, those unfavorable to the defendant are the more probable. As the court pointed out in <em>Griffin, </em>absent such a suggestion \u2018the inference of guilt is not always so natural or irresistible.\u2019 . . . We do not mean to imply that a prohibited comment is necessarily or even ordinarily harmless so long as it is unaccompanied by a statement that silence implies guilt; we simply note that the absence of any such statement tends to mitigate the independently damaging effect of a comment uttered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>violation of the <em>Griffin </em>rule.\u201d (Italics in original; <em>People </em>v. <em>Modesto, </em>66 CaL2d 695, 713 [59 Cal.Rptr. 124, 427 P.2d 788].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In <em>Modesto, supra, </em>the prosecutor committed error in pointing out to the jury that the defendant, who knew the facts, was sitting in the courtroom, \u201cand just sitting.\u201d Neither the prosecutor nor the court in its instructions told the jury that an inference of guilt might be drawn from defendant\u2019s silence. In finding harmless error only, we stated, \u201cThus we do not deal here with what the <em>Chapman </em>court characterized as \u2018a machine-gun repetition of a denial of constitutional rights, all designed and calculated to make [defendant\u2019s] version of the evidence worthless, . . (66 Cal.2d at p. 714.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We made a similar observation in <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>70 Cal.2d 711 [76 Cal.Rptr. 391, 452 P.2d 607], wherein the prosecutor commented upon defendant\u2019s silence and the court instructed the jury that an unfavorable inference could be drawn against defendant for his failure to deny or explain prosecution evidence. We noted in <em>Morse </em>that the prosecutor\u2019s comment \u201cwas brief and mild and not uttered with \u2018machine-gun repetition\u2019 and devastating effect as in <em>Chapman.\u201d </em>(P. 730.) Moreover, in context, the court\u2019s instruction, though erroneous, was of minimal significance. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">As in the <em>Modesto </em>and <em>Morse </em>cases, the prosecutor\u2019s remark here (\u201cThere is no denial at all that they were there\u201d) was brief and mild, and amounted to no more than an indirect comment upon defendant\u2019s failure to testify without suggesting that an inference of guilt should be drawn therefrom. Moreover, the trial court, at defendant\u2019s request, promptly admonished, the jury and carefully explained to them that no adverse inferences were to be drawn from defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The erroneous instruction (CALJIC No. 2.61) was no more devastating in effect than the prosecutor\u2019s comment, for the error was buried within an otherwise proper instruction, and was preceded by another instruction (CALJIC No. 2.60) which correctly set forth defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent, and the further principle that no adverse inferences could be drawn from his silence. The error which was committed was certainly less substantial than the errors in earlier cases, cited above, wherein the jury had been instructed that it <em>could </em>consider defendant\u2019s failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The cases which have considered the prejudicial effect of errors similar to those committed in the instant case almost uniformly have found those errors to be harmless. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 711, 729-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>730; <em>People </em>v. <em>Modesto, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 695, 712-714; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>67 Cal.2d 64, 73 [60 Cal.Rptr. 254, 429 P.2d 606]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Townsend, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 919, 925 [CALJIC No. 2.61]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ham, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 768, 784; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burns, supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 238, 249; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gioviannini, supra, </em>260 Cal.App.2d 597, 604-605; <em>People </em>v. <em>Northern, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d 28, 30-31; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crawford, supra, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 524, 535-536.) The one exception appears to be <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.3d 34, 46, wherein (as here) indirect prosecution comment upon defendant\u2019s failure to testify was combined with the giving of CALJIC No. 2.61. In <em>Williams, </em>however, the <em>Griffin </em>error was aggravated by \u201ca breakdown in legal representation [by defense counsel] which substantially reduced the strength of defendant\u2019s claim of total diminished capacity\u201d (p. 50), together with <em>three </em>erroneous instructions regarding intent, insanity and unconsciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Moreover, in <em>Williams </em>(as in all of the decisions we have reviewed which reversed convictions for <em>Griffin </em>error), \u201cthe decision [as to defendant\u2019s guilt] was a close one.\u201d (P. 39; see p. 46, fn. 11.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the combination of errors committed in that case was harmless. (P. 58.) In the instant case, however, the case against defendant was overwhelming: The defense presented no alibi witnesses or other exculpatory evidence, and defendant was positively identified as one of the robbers by the victim and an eyewitness. .The victim, Mr. Olness, was evidently quite confused regarding the time and circumstances of the robbery,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> yet he remained unshaken regarding his identification of defendant. Miss Campio was even more positive that defendant was one of the robbers, for she actually had <em>known </em>defendant (\u201cPete\u201d) for some time prior to the incident. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>prior acquaintance with defendant made wholly irrelevant her apparent error in believing that defendant had been frequenting the La Paloma restaurant during the 10 days prior to the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">This court has stated that, in order for <em>Griffin </em>error to be prejudicial, the improper comment or instruction must either \u201cserve to fill an evidentiary' gap in the prosecution\u2019s case,\u201d or \u201cat least touch a live nerve in the defense, . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Modesto, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 695, 714; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 711, 730.) In the instant case, the errors complained of could not conceivably have served either function. (See also harmless error cases, <em>supra, </em>pp. 479-480, many of which emphasize the failure of the defendant to present a credible, or any, defense.) We conclude that, on the basis of the record before us, the <em>Griffin </em>errors at issue could have had no significant impact upon the jurors and were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Sullivan, J., and Clark, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\">At a pretrial lineup, Olness identified defendant with some hesitation, explaining that defendant was wearing a goatee and sideburns when he robbed Olness, but was clean shaven at the lineup. At trial Olness stated that he was \u201cpositive\u201d that defendant had robbed him. However, he admitted that his certainty was reinforced by the fact that a witness, Miss Campio, pointed out Vargas to him as his assailant. Nevertheless, Olness insisted that he independently recognized Vargas, stating that \u201cwhen I get a good look at a man, I will never forget a man or a woman.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\">That portion of the transcript which contains the jury arguments of defense counsel has not been made part of the record in this case. However, recorded colloquy between the trial judge and counsel in chambers indicates that Medina\u2019s counsel initiated the discussion regarding defendants\u2019 failure to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The clerk\u2019s transcript indicates that these instructions were \u201crequested by defendant,\u201d but nowhere does the record disclose which defendant made the request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b475-10\">CALJIC No. 2.61 has now been amended to delete the italicized words.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Thus, under the rule in <em>Bethea, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s initial comments, set forth above, regarding the lack of alibi witnesses was not <em>Griffin </em>error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\">For example, in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, the evidence against defendants was wholly circumstantial. In <em>In re Banks, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 337, the eyewitness\u2019 identifications were tainted by a suggestive lineup, the descriptions did not closely match defendant, there was no evidence that defendant was preparing to commit a robbery, defendant\u2019s actions differed from the modus operandi of the suspected robber, and defendant was able to explain satisfactorily the presence of cash in his pockets, the denominations of which failed to match those taken by the robber. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Boston, supra, 69 </em>Cal.2d 233, defendant presented an alibi defense, was able to rebut other prosecution evidence, and the witnesses to the crime did not see the robbers\u2019 faces, since they wore masks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b480-11\">O1ness, whose confusion may be explained by the unfortunate state of his health, believed that the robbery occurred in darkness, although Miss Campio testified that the sun was still out. Many of the details given by Olness regarding events immediately <em>following </em>the robbery were contradicted by the testimony of the officer who answered Olness\u2019 call to report the robbery. None of these inconsistencies however, pertained to the occurrence of the robbery itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Defendant also contended on appeal that the trial court erred in not entertaining during the course of trial defendant\u2019s motion to suppress a photograph of codefendant Medina used by the People to refresh Miss Campio\u2019s memory regarding Medina\u2019s facial hair at the time of the robbery. (Evidently, Medina had shaved off his moustache subsequent to the robbery.) This photograph was a jail \u201cmug shot\u201d arising from a prior arrest of Medina; defendant evidently sought to show that Medina's arrest was illegal, and that this photograph was the unlawful fruit of that arrest and hence inadmissible. Subsequent to the trial of this case, however, we decided <em>People </em>v. <em>McInnis, </em>6 Cal.3d 821 [100 Cal.Rptr. 618, 494 P.2d 690], and held that the People may use as evidence in a subsequent, unrelated trial a photograph taken following an earlier illegal arrest. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion was without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
