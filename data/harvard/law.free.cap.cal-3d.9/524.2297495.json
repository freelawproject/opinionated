At the end of the 1969-1970 academic year, the Governing Board of the Torrance Unified School District<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> terminated petitioner Stanley Lindros, a proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tionary teacher, because he read a theme to his English class which contained controversial language, and because he allegedly on one occasion allowed students to return needed books to the library without proper authorization. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we hold that these incidents fail to establish \u201ccause\u201d for termination which is reasonably \u201crelate[d] to the welfare of the schools and pupils thereof\u201d as required by section 13443, subdivision (d); in so doing we note that in both incidents Lindros acted in the good faith pursuit of concededly legitimate educational objectives, and that the Board demonstrated no significant adverse impact on the students or the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Torrance Board employed petitioner as a tenth-grade probationary English teacher at South High School for the 1969-1970 school year. Petitioner\u2019s record attested to his eminent qualification for the position. Not only did he hold a California teaching credential but also he had studied for, or obtained, advanced degrees in philosophy, theology, and the communication arts. A Catholic priest on leave of absence from the Church, petitioner had enjoyed a wide range of experience: he had served as a parish priest, prison chaplain, resident counselor, and secondary level teacher. Nothing in the record suggests, that petitioner had failed to fulfill his promise as an effective English instructor or had been unable to relate well with young people; indeed \u201cteacher evaluation\u201d records indicated that he proved himself \u201cabove average\u201d in both competency in subject matter and in rapport with students.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The incident which constituted the main charge against the petitioner occurred early in the school year. In mid-October 1969 petitioner assigned his tenth-grade English classes the task of preparing a short story relating a personal emotional experience. The purpose of this assignment, as later described by petitioner, was to stress \u201cthe relationship between good creative writing and personal experience. I believe this to be the key in communicating with students and encouraging better writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">At the request of several students that he present them with an example of his own work, Lindros read a short story, \u201cThe Funeral,\u201d which he originally wrote as a rough draft for a television play at Loyola University. Autobiographical in nature, the story recorded petitioner\u2019s emotions at the funeral of one of his students who, during the time Lindros taught at a predominantly black high school in Watts, died of a heroin overdose. The theme contained language later deemed objectionable by South High\u2019s principal\u2014including a slang expression for an incestuous son. We set forth the full text below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u201cThe Funeral</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">\u201cI was mad, disgusted . . . tense.

The weeping and gnashing lasted long enough for all of us to troop past Ed and glance at his ashen, black face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">\u201cI felt whipped out; this was a strange two hours; strange to a white who had no blackness in him; strange to a white who knew no such poverty and desperation; even stranger outside when I greeted a young Black in a Panther-like outfit:\u2018White-mother-fuckin Pig.\u2019 . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Before reading the controversial words at the end of \u201cThe Funeral,\u201d petitioner pondered their appropriateness for the classroom, and decided in good faith that their use was permissible in some, but not all, of his classes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As petitioner stated, although he recognized that \u201ca few words in \u2018The Funeral\u2019 [were] not acceptable in common usage . . . [he] felt that even if one student was to give up or think less of drugs, the reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>reading the play was justified.\u201d Lindros read the young black\u2019s objectionable and defiant remark at the end of the story only in college preparatory classes, which he considered most mature; in other classes he substituted the initials \u201cW.M.F.P.\u201d While petitioner did not preliminarily consult with school administrators as to whether he should read the story, his conduct accorded with the prevailing policy of the school that instructors could select outside instructional material. According to the hearing officer \u201cThere [was] widespread use of outside instructional material selected by the instructors and not submitted for approval.\u201d Moreover, school administrators had promulgated \u201cno clear statement of the criteria or standards [to be] applied in selecting this material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Furthermore, the prevailing practices and conditions at the high school strongly indicated that the inclusion of the language in a literary composition would evoke no concern. The library shelved books, readily available to students, which contained words identical to all of those found in \u201cThe Funeral\u201d; school administrators, moreover, as part of the curriculum, had permitted instructors to take students to theatrical performances in which the lines spoken by the actors contained the same or similar words.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">No disruption of classroom activities followed petitioner\u2019s reading of \u201cThe Funeral.\u201d As the hearing officer noted, \u201cIn considering the seriousness of the use of the offending material . . . these words were presented fully or by their initial letters to five classes of a total of approximately 150 students. No complaint arose from the students and none arose from the parents of these students. This will not establish that the material was appropriate for classroom use but does tend to establish that the context and manner of presentation was not nearly so startling to the . students who heard it ... as the disembodied restatement of the offending words makes it appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Despite this seemingly indifferent reaction, the principal of the high school learned of the incident and reprimanded Lindros. The principal counseled Lindros that the language of the short story did not accord with established classroom usage and that further use of vulgar material should be avoided; petitioner agreed to abide by this directive and signed a statement to that effect. This meeting closed the incident until the end of the school year, some eight months later, when the Torrance Board announced that it would not rehire Lindros. As both the hearing officer and the superior court later found, the reading of \u201cThe Funeral\u201d constituted the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the Torrance Board\u2019s complaint against Lindros.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>In addition to the incident involving \u201cThe Funeral,\u201d the hearing officer found Lindros to have permitted students to leave class on one occasion without the authorization normally required by school regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 6, 1970, petitioner allowed students in one class to depart a few minutes before the \u201csounding of the bell signalling the close of the class session.\u201d Lindros \u201chad instructed those of his students who were in possession of a book entitled <em>Zorba the Greek </em>to depart from class early, secure the book from their lockers, and return the book to the library so that it could be redistributed when needed by the students of another English instructor. ... It was not established that all of those students who departed were leaving to complete this errand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">After the superintendent of the Torrance School District served notice of an intention not to rehire Lindros because of the aforementioned incidents, the Board held an administrative hearing pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 13443. At this proceeding the hearing officer found that \u201c \u2018The Funeral\u2019 is not within the generally accepted standard and that its use would violate the policy of the school in regard to the introduction of objectionable language into the classroom.\u201d He further found that although \u201c[t]he school does sanction the use of literary work and current periodical material in which socially unacceptable words and phrases appear . . . [The Funeral] is not a generally accepted literary work and does not appear within a generally accepted periodical. [Petitioner\u2019s] lapse of judgment and violation of standards is a factor relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>welfare of the students and the school.\u201d Though he found that the incident involving \u201cThe Funeral\u201d was the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the complaint, the hearing officer also declared that the February 6, 1970, incident involving early dismissal of students from class constituted \u201ccause\u201d under section 13443.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The Torrance Board, without examining the record of the administrative hearing, adopted the hearing officer\u2019s report as its own; the Board further declared that each charge \u201cseparately and collectively\u201d constitute[d] . . . sufficient cause not to reemploy [petitioner].\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Following the Torrance Board\u2019s final decision, Lindros petitioned the Los Angeles Superior Court for a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. In denying the petition the superior court declared that the language of \u201cThe Funeral\u201d is \u201cmanifestly coarse and vulgar\u201d and that \u201c[p]etitioner should have known that such language by a teacher was totally unacceptable in a Tenth Grade English class.\u201d The superior court then noted that the charges relating to both \u201cThe Funeral\u201d and the February 6, 1970, incident involving early dismissal of students \u201cwere found to be related to the welfare of the school and the pupils thereof, and the Governing Board\u2019s determination of sufficiency is conclusive.\u201d We believe that this holding cannot be sustained because petitioner\u2019s conduct did not, as a matter of law, constitute cause for termination within the meaning of Education Code section 13443. We turn now to an analysis of section 13443, and of the errors which we perceive in the superior court\u2019s denial of the writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">I. <em>The question whether alleged misconduct establishes \u201ccause\u201d under section 13443, subdivision (d), constitutes a question of law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Education Code section 13443, subdivision (d), defines the conditions under which a local school board can refuse to rehire a probationary teacher. The statute provides that: \u201cThe governing board\u2019s determination not to reemploy a probationary employee for the ensuing school year shall be for cause only. The determination of the governing board as to the sufficiency of the cause pursuant to this section shall be conclusive, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>cause shall relate solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The precedents clearly establish that the question whether a particular cause for refusal to rehire relates \u201csolely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof\u201d presents a matter of law that must be determined by the courts, and, ultimately by this court. The Board determines the <em>facts </em>and their sufficiency to support the Board\u2019s determination but the court decides whether the facts as found\u2014in our case, the conduct of the teacher\u2014\u25a0 reasonably could be said to have adversely affected the welfare of the school or its pupils.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In the fountainhead case of <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 93 [37 Cal.Rptr. 194, 389 P.2d 722], a school board refused to rehire a probationary teacher for \u201clack of self-restraint and tact in dealing with co-workers, pupils, and parents.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 97.) We interpreted section 13443 (then \u00a7 13444) to mean that \u201cwhere there is evidence to support the board\u2019s findings of fact <em>and where the cause for dismissal found by the board can reasonably be said to relate to the \u2018welfare of the schools and pupils thereof,\u2019 </em>the reviewing court may not consider whether the facts found are sufficiently serious to justify dismissal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 96.) (Italics added.) The <em>Griggs </em>court then found a reasonable relationship between the \u201ccause\u201d (lack of tact) and the \u201cwelfare of the schools.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at p. 97.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We more recently examined the division of responsibilities between courts and governing boards under section 13443 in <em>Bekiaris </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 575 [100 Cal.Rptr. 16, 493 P.2d 480]. \u201cIt is to be emphasized . . . that [under section 13443] the general applicability of the rule of substantial evidence in light of the entire record does not affect the power and duty of the trial court to make an independent determination of questions having a legal character. Thus \u2018[n]othing . . . prevents the reviewing court from determining whether the board has proceeded in excess of jurisdiction, whether there has been a fair trial, and whether the board\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 [Citation.] Moreover, it is for the <em>court to determine whether a particular cause for dismissal </em>\u2018relate[s] <em>solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof </em>as required by section 13443. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 587.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">We further explained that \u201calthough the reviewing court must accept evidentiary facts shown by substantial evidence and the sufficiency of those facts to constitute a stated cause, still it remains for the court to determine <em>as a matter of law </em>whether such cause relates to the welfare of the school and its pupils and is therefore adequate under the provisions of section 13443 to justify dismissal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 589.) (Italics in the opinion.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The Courts of Appeal have consistently followed this approach. Thus, the court in <em>Blodgett </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 183 [97 Cal.Rptr. 406], held that refusal to rehire a probationary teacher solely because she was overweight was not a \u201ccause\u201d reasonably related to school welfare; the \u201cphysical condition unrelated to the plaintiff\u2019s fitness to teach was used as a pretext for refusing re-employ[ment].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 193.) In <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 761 [68 Cal.Rptr. 842], the Court of Appeal held refusal to rehire solely because a probationary teacher was 65 years old was not \u201ccause\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> reasonably related to the welfare of the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In sum, whether particular conduct establishes cause under section 13443, poses a pure question of law. This question must be sharply distinguished from two other types of questions which arise under section 13443: (1) questions of <em>fact </em>and (2) questions as to the <em>sufficiency </em>of the \u201ccause\u201d to warrant dismissal in light of all the circumstances. Past cases have held that findings of fact, developed by the hearing officer and the governing board, will be upheld by the courts so long as supported by substantial evidence on the whole record. <em>(Griggs </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d at p. 96.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, the determination as to the \u201csufficiency of the cause\u201d\u2014whether the \u201ccause\u201d warrants a refusal to rehire despite the teacher\u2019s redeeming qualities as a teacher, his attitude, and the particular needs of the school district\u2014lies solely in the discretion of the governing board <em>so long as </em>section 13443\u2019s requirement of \u201ccause . . . relate[d] solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof ...\u201d has been met. <em>(Bekiaris </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 589.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Having demonstrated that the determination of \u201ccause\u201d under section 13443 constitutes a question of law, we turn to an examination of that issue in light of the two charges of misconduct against petitioner Lindros.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>II. <em>The reading of \u201cThe Funeral\u201d did not constitute \u201ccause\u201d under section 13443.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Lindros\u2019 reading of the composition did not constitute \u201ccause\u201d under section 13443 because, first, in presenting it to his pupils petitioner sought to pursue a bona fide educational purpose and in so doing did not adversely affect \u201cthe welfare of the schools or the pupils thereof\u201d; second, the composition was used as teaching material without prior reasonable notice that such use would later be deemed impermissible by school authorities. We shall separately analyze each of these propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">A. <em>In reading \u201cThe Funeral\u201d petitioner sought to pursue a bona fide educational purpose and in so doing did not adversely affect the welfare of the school or the pupils thereof.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Erroneously applying a per se approach to the controversial epithet at the end of \u201cThe Funeral,\u201d the superior court declared that its use was \u201cmanifestly coarse and vulgar.\u201d The court, however, apparently failed to make the crucial distinction between unrestricted use of such words in the classroom and their inclusion in teaching material for a class in creative writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Petitioner is the first to concede that it would be \u201coutrageous ... if a teacher simply shouts \u2018mother-fucking-pigs\u2019 to his students.\u201d Obviously teachers are not to sanction the use of words as blatantly offensive as these in classroom discussion or even in the personal banter of students. But here the words were used by a character in a story; the story, in turn was presented as an example of expressive writing. The black character utters the words in \u201cThe Funeral\u201d as a mark of his anger and disgust at a white\u2019s presence at the funeral; the words were employed for a definite literary objective. Thus, Lindros read the story to his students as part of a quite obvious teaching technique.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Many classic works seeking to capture the anger of blacks against a society that they consider inexcusably oppressive are peppered with epithets that express outrage in terms at least as violent as that used here. Malamud\u2019s \u201cThe Tenants\u201d is a recent example; \u201cMan-Child in a Promised Land\u201d by Claude Brown is another. Baldwin\u2019s \u201cThe Fire Next Time,\u201d written, as it is, by a black, is the most virulent; we could cite innumerable other examples. The writer of \u201cThe Funeral\u201d could not properly convey the fury of the young black at the apparent condescension- of a white man in attending the funeral except by the use of an expletive. The outrage of the black <em>had </em>to be mirrored in language that outraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Lindros was obviously trying to teach his students that in writing creative compositions the author must attempt to put those words in the mouths of his characters that belong there. The blasphemous epithet must fit the emotional outburst of the speaker. To isolate the epithet and to condemn the teacher is to miss the function of expressive writing. In sum, we could not impose upon teachers of writing, as a matter of law, that they must tell and teach their students that in depicting the jargon of the ghetto, the slum, or the barrack room, characters must speak in the pedantry of Edwardian English.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The record shows that neither student nor parent complained about this use of the lurid words in Lindros\u2019 composition. The students had been exposed to identical langauge in books and periodicals in the school library; their teachers had taken them to dramatic productions that used these and other obnoxious terms. That the students were not \u201cshocked\u201d can come as no surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Finally, the United States Supreme Court has recognized the widespread use of current, divergent and distasteful patterns of speech, such as those involved here; indeed, in some situations that court has accorded constitutional protection to similarly shocking and offensive language. For example, the Supreme Court recently held the phrase \u201cfuck the draft\u201d protected by the First Amendment when portrayed on a jacket worn in a courthouse corridor. <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>California </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 15 [29 L.Ed.2d 284, 91 S.Ct. 1780].) Although <em>Cohen </em>involved a controversial term in expressing a political view in a public forum and is thus distinguishable from the instant situation, we note its reasoning: \u201cHow is one to distinguish this from other offensive words? Surely the State has no right to cleanse public debate to the point where it is grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among us. Yet no readily ascertainable general principle exists for stopping short of that result were we to affirm the judgment below. For, while the particular four-letter word being litigated here is perhaps more distasteful than most others of its genre, it is nevertheless often true that one man\u2019s vulgarity is another\u2019s lyric.\u201d <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>403 U.S. at p. 25 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 294].)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Three recent cases in which the Supreme Court vacated criminal convictions for offensive speech and remanded in light of <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>403 U.S. 15, illustrate the same point. In <em>Rosenfeld </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 901 [33 L.Ed.2d 321, 92 S.Ct. 2479], the defendant was convicted of disturbing the peace by indecent and offensive language; he had addressed a school board meeting, attended by some 40 children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>using, on several occasions in his speech, the words \u201cmother fucker\u201d; in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 914 [33 L.Ed.2d 326, 92 S.Ct. 2507], the defendant, during a speech before a group of men and women in the University of Tulsa chapel, referred to policemen as \u201cmother fucking fascist pig cops\u201d; in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>City of New Orleans </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 913 [33 L.Ed.2d 321, 92 S.Ct. 2499], a mother addressed police officers who had arrested her son as \u201cgod-damned-mother-fucking-police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">These cases illustrate both the use of such speech in sections of our multifarious society and an increasing immunity from criminal sanction for such expressions. While these rulings by no mean legitimize the general use of offensive language in the classroom, they do explain the background and reasons for the use of such words in literary works depicting realistically the coarse and strident forms of communication that so often attend public dialogue today.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We conclude that the Board has failed to show that the inclusion of opprobrious language currently used in many subcultures, in a single composition, presented solely for teaching purposes, rises to the level of a legal cause for severance of a teacher from his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">B. <em>The reading was only a single incident in the presentation of teaching material which, although later deemed objectionable, was used in the absence of prior reasonable notice that such use would be deemed impermissible by the school authorities.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">As we have pointed out, the accepted policy at South High School permitted the selection of instructional material by teachers without submission to administrators for advance approval. Moreover, as we have explained, books and periodicals at the school library contained language as controversial as that found in \u201cThe Funeral\u201d; further, students with the sponsorship of their teachers attended plays in which such language was employed. In the previous section we have alluded to the unfortunate current prevalence of language as repulsive as that we face here. The record shows no specific disapproval of the use of written material containing such expres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>sions. Under these circumstances we must conclude that petitioner acting in good faith, presented the composition to the class without prior reasonable notice that such presentation would contravene the governing policies of the high school.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">We do not believe that one isolated classroom usage of material later deemed objectionable by school administrators, without reasonable prior notice, can constitute \u201ccause\u201d for termination reasonably \u201crelate[d] solely to the welfare of the schools or pupils thereof.\u201d \u201cCause\u201d under section 13443 requires that the teacher must have failed to exercise such reasonable judgment as would be expected of a member of his profession under the same circumstances. \u201cTeachers, particularly in the light of their professional expertise, will normally be able to determine what kind of conduct indicates unfitness to teach. Teachers are further protected by the fact that they cannot be disciplined merely because they made a reasonable, good faith, professional judgment in the course of their employment with which higher authorities later disagreed.\u201d <em>(Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 233 [82 Cal.Rptr. 175, 461 P.2d 375].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">III. <em>The incident involving dismissal of students on one school day fails to establish \u201ccaus\u00e9\u2019 reasonably related to the welfare of the schools and was not the true reason for the Board\u2019s refusal to rehire Lindros.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We turn to the remaining charge that on one occasion during the school year Lindros permitted students to leave one of his classes \u201cwithout proper authorization.\u201d A close review of the findings pertinent to the incident reveals that it was not conclusively established that Lindros violated any school rule, and that, in any event, the isolated <em>de minimis </em>violation charged was a mere makeweight that did not constitute the true reason for the Board\u2019s refusal ,to rehire Lindros.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact, later adopted by both the Torrance Board and the superior court, contain ambiguities which cast doubt on the assertion that Lindros improperly dismissed his class;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> these ambiguities strengthen our conclusion that the charge of improper dismissal of students did not trigger the action against Lindros. The record indicates that on February 6, 1970, Lindros dismissed some students for the legitimate educational purpose of returning needed copies of the book, <em>Zorba the </em>Greek, to the library. Nothing suggests that this action, by itself, violated any school rule. Although it \u201cwas not established that all of those students who departed\u201d actually followed petitioner\u2019s instructions, Lindros could hardly be dismissed merely because he failed to prove that all of the students obeyed his instructions and went to the library after leaving his classroom. Thus the findings of fact could not support a conclusion that Lindros failed to \u201cauthorize\u201d his students to go to the library.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">As the hearing officer found, however, de facto school policy required a teacher to provide a <em>written </em>authorization when sending more than five students to the library; conceivably, Lindros violated a school regulation, not by dismissing his students, but by failing on this single occasion to furnish a written \u201chall pass.\u201d The hearing officer\u2019s decision, however, omitted any findings about this vital fact. The findings therefore do not directly support even the conclusion that Lindros dismissed the students without proper <em>written </em>authorization. (Cf. <em>Almaden-Santa Clara Vineyards </em>v. <em>Paul </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 860, 867-868 [49 Cal.Rptr. 256].)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>In any event, the record makes clear that the reading of \u201cThe Funeral\u201d comprised the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the charges, and that the refusal to rehire rested upon this foundation. We are reminded here of the incisive language of <em>Bekiaris </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 575, 592-593, that \u201ca dismissed public employee is entitled to a judicial determination of the <em>true </em>reason for his dismissal ...\u201d (italics in the original). Although <em>Bekiaris </em>condemned a dismissal involving constitutional rights, its logic equally applies in the instant situation involving statutory rights. Since both the hearing officer and superior court found that \u201cThe Funeral\u201d comprised the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the complaint against petitioner, we believe that charge was the \u201ctrue reason\u201d for the-refusal to rehire.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Furthermore, to assume that the Torrance Board would have refused to rehire Lindros based <em>solely </em>on the incident of February 6 stretches the credible. The incident at most involved a single, unrepeated infraction of a minor regulation in mid-year, with no showing of any adverse impact on the educational process, and with no showing that it occurred by other than mere inadvertence. We doubt that the Torrance Board would have acted so harshly as to ignore Shakespeare\u2019s common sense observation that \u201cmen are men; the best sometimes forget.\u201d (Shakespeare, Othello, II (1604).)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Summarizing the case as a whole, we conclude that the Board\u2019s refusal to rehire petitioner was invalid because it was not for cause reasonably related to the Welfare of the school.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We heed Judge Wyzanski\u2019s characterization of fundamental public policy: that education must \u201cfoster open minds, creative imaginations, and adventurous spirits. Our national belief is that the heterodox as well as the orthodox are a source of individual and of social growth. We do not confine academic freedom to conventional teachers or to those who can get a majority vote from their colleagues. Our faith is that the teacher\u2019s freedom to choose among options for which there is any substantial support will increase his intellectual vitality and his moral strength. The teacher whose responsibility has been nourished by independence, enterprise, and free choice becomes for his student a better model of the democratic citizen.\u201d <em>(Mailloux </em>v. <em>Kiley </em>(D.Mass. 1971) 323 F.Supp. 1387, 1391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The judgment of the superior court denying the writ of mandate is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the superior court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Wright, C.

The substantive protection afforded by the statute appears in subdivision (d) which declares in relevant part that <em>\"The governing board\u2019s determination not to reemploy a probationary employee for the ensuing school year shall be for cause only.

It should require no argument to support the proposition that the District\u2019s Governing Board, as the ultimate employer of the teacher on behalf of the citizens of the district, has the right to control the teacher by promulgating the standards of conduct which it deems appropriate. These standards may allow broad discretion or may be explicit. Here, as is true of much in the field of education, a latitude has been allowed for the exercise of the professional judgment of the educational administrators and the teachers. Whenever latitude for judgment is granted there will be inevitable variances in its exercise by the individuals involved. The superior may reasonably anticipate that the subordinate\u2019s exercise of judgment will vary from his own and, particularly in the case of a beginning employee, that it will be at times erroneous.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The superior court declared that \u201cthe substantive charge involved, as the hearing officer said, and I agree with him, the gravamen of these proceedings [was] the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>of this short story, \u2018The Funeral,\u2019 with its coarse language at the end\u201d; the hearing officer, however, found that the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the charges against Lindros included not only the reading of \u201cThe Funeral\u201d but also use of copies of the lyrics from the song \u201cThe Pusher\u201d in one of Lindros\u2019 classes on January 30, 1970. These lyrics were distributed by one of Lindros\u2019 students who presented a class report on drug use. \u201cThe Pusher,\u201d according to the findings of the hearing officer, was a popular score taken from the motion picture \u201cEasy Rider\u201d and was at the time widely disseminated in radio broadcasts and readily available in phonographic record shops. In fact, the lyrics of \u201cThe Pusher\u201d had been used by other instructors at South High School. The hearing officer concluded that \u201cThe Pusher\u201d was a work of \u201cestablished usage\u201d and that its use did not constitute \u201ccause\u201d within the meaning of Education Code section 13443.

It was not established that all of those students who departed were leaving to complete this errand. It is contrary to school policy to permit students to be out of class during the class time without a proper pass, with the limited exception that five students at a time may be permitted to be in the hallway for the purpose of obtaining or returning books at the bookroom in the library.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">One of petitioner\u2019s supervisors, the sole witness for the Board on the charge of early dismissal of students, testified that he observed students leave Lindros\u2019 class <em>without any authorization. </em>Petitioner\u2019s testimony contradicted that of his supervisor; petitioner attested that he authorized his students to leave class to return copies of <em>Zorba the Greek </em>to the library.

The majority have wholly emasculated the provisions of section 13443, subdivision (d), of the Education Code which, until now, assured that a local school board\u2019s decision as to the sufficiency of the cause for failing to reemploy a probationary teacher was <em>conclusive </em>and free from judicial interference. The \u201ccause\u201d which led defendant district to refuse to reemploy Lindros was his <em>classroom </em>use of improper, indecent language. Since the use of such language in a tenth-grade classroom obviously is a matter of relating to \u201cthe welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof . . .\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 13443, subd. (d)), the district\u2019s determination concerning the sufficiency of that cause should have been \u201cconclusive.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Instead, the majority have rendered that determination wholly <em>inconclusive, </em>by relying upon a variety of supposedly mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>factors (such as Lindros\u2019 asserted \u201cgood faith\u201d) which more properly were matters of sole concern to the district in appraising the sufficiency of the cause for terminating Lindros\u2019 services. More importantly, however, and wholly apart from the particular circumstances surrounding this case, the majority\u2019s approach can be employed in future cases involving probationary teachers to undermine and defeat the clear legislative intent to vest in the local school board plenary control over these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Section 13443, subdivision (d), carefully allocates the respective responsibilities of the school boards and the courts in cases involving refusals to rehire probationary teachers. That section expressly makes the governing board\u2019s determination as to the sufficiency of the cause \u201cconclusive,\u201d so long as that cause relates to the welfare of the school or its pupils. As stated in <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>61 Cal.2d 93, 96 [37 Cal.Rptr. 194, 389 P.2d 722], the landmark case in this area, \u201cNothing in the language of section 13444 [now \u00a7 13443] prevents the reviewing court from determining whether the board has proceeded in excess of jurisdiction, whether there has been a fair trial, and whether the board\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. However, <em>where there is evidence to support the board\u2019s findings of fact and where the cause for dismissal found by the board can reasonably be said to relate to the \u2018welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof,\u2019 the reviewing court may not consider whether the facts found are sufficiently serious to justify dismissal.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In <em>Griggs, </em>the \u201ccause\u201d for the board\u2019s decision was the teacher\u2019s \u201clack of self-restraint and tact in dealing with co-workers, pupils and parents.\u201d Since substantial evidence existed to support the existence of that cause, and since that cause \u201cis clearly a matter which relates to the welfare of the school and its pupils,\u201d this' court held that \u201cthe trial court could not properly substitute its own judgment for that of the board on the question of the sufficiency of the cause for Mrs. Griggs\u2019 dismissal.\u201d (P. 97.) I stress the fact that this court did not purport to reappraise the \u201cgood faith,\u201d \u201clack of significant adverse impact,\u201d or other possible mitigating factors in Mrs. Griggs\u2019 favor, unlike the majority\u2019s approach in this case, for such matters were exclusively within the domain of the school board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Subsequent cases have uniformly employed the <em>Griggs\u2019 </em>approach, namely, to determine only whether or not the <em>type </em>of conduct at issue (e.g., lack of tact) can be said to reasonably relate to the welfare of the school and its pupils. For example, in <em>Raney </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 256 [48 Cal.Rptr. 555], the \u201ccause\u201d relied upon by the school board was the teacher\u2019s severe grading techniques and poor rapport with students. The court explained that were it at liberty to supervise the judgment of the board on the matter, the court \u201cmight well reach an opposite conclusion .... <em>[B]ut our theory of government gives to the school trustees, for better or for worse, an almost absolute choice either to \u2018hire or fire\u2019 teachers who have not yet attained tenure.\u201d </em>(Italics added; p. 260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Similarly, in <em>American Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>San Lorenzo etc. Sch. Dist., </em>276 Cal.App.2d 132, 136 [80 Cal.Rptr. 758], the court held that a probationary teacher\u2019s inability to accept responsibility and inadequate supervision of students \u201ccertainly relate to the welfare of the schools and the pupils . . . .\u201d Accordingly, the court explained that it \u201ccannot consider whether the charges justify dismissal.\u201d (See also <em>Governing Board </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 396 [95 Cal.Rptr. 712] [teacher advocated marijuana use]; <em>McGlone </em>v. <em>Mt. Diablo Unified Sch. Dist., </em>3 Cal.App.3d 17 [82 Cal.Rptr. 225] [failure to supervise students]; <em>Feist </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>3 Cal.App.3d 404 [83 Cal.Rptr. 465].)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The two cases which reversed school board decisions in this area are not on point for they merely established that physical characteristics of a teacher, such as advanced age or obesity, cannot constitute \u201ccause\u201d under section 13443 since neither factor standing alone could involve the welfare of the school or students. In the instant case, on the other hand, the cause for Lindros\u2019 termination was his <em>classroom </em>use of indecent language, a matter which (like the lack of tact in <em>Griggs, </em>the severe grading techniques in <em>Raney, </em>or the inadequate supervision in <em>San Lorenzo) </em>by its very nature relates to the welfare of the school and its pupils. Of course, depending upon the underlying circumstances in each case, including the teacher\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d or the lack of any \u201csignificant adverse impact,\u201d the school board might determine that a particular act or impropriety is excusable and insufficient cause for refusal to reemploy. Yet that decision lies with the school board, not the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>As I interpret section 13443, the Legislature intended to vest the school board with sole discretion in appraising the sufficiency of the cause, but to assure that the cause asserted has some reasonable relation to the school and its pupils rather than pertaining solely to the teacher\u2019s private life, unrelated to school affairs. For example, a court might properly hold that a teacher\u2019s persistent refusal to obey his parents, his inability to teach his wife how to drive, his failure to keep timely dental appointments, or his intemperate language with his neighbors, were acts of a type which could not reasonably relate to the welfare of the school or its pupils under section 13443. Yet similar acts of insubordination, incompetence, tardiness or use of indecent language, when occurring in a classroom setting or otherwise affecting school affairs, clearly would meet the statutory test.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">In the instant case, Lindros used language <em>in his classroom </em>which many persons deem objectionable in any context.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, it is well established that even permanent, tenured teachers are subject to appropriate discipline, including dismissal, on account of their classroom use of indecent or profane language. (See <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Metzger, </em>8 Cal.3d 206, 212 [104 Cal.Rptr. 452, 501 P.2d 1172]; <em>Palo Verde etc. Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Hensey, </em>9 Cal.App.3d 967 [88 Cal.Rptr. 570].) Accordingly, the district certainly had statutory authority to refuse to reemploy Lindros for the coming year.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The majority stress such factors as Lindros\u2019 \u201cgood faith,\u201d his \u201cbona fide educational purpose,\u201d the lack of complaints from his students, and the absence of school rules or regulations prohibiting the use of crude and vulgar language by teachers. Once again, it is apparent to me that consideration of such allegedly mitigating factors is for the school board, not the courts. If the board, in the exercise of its discretion and expertise, chooses not to reemploy a probationary teacher who uses such language, on what basis can this court interfere with that decision? Certainly there is no rule of law, statutory or otherwise, which would require advance publication of elaborate regulations and guidelines anticipating all possible infractions or misconduct which a probationary teacher might commit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the trial court pointed out, Lindros\u2019 language was \u201cmanifestly coarse and vulgar.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>. . . [Petitioner should have known that such language by a teacher was totally unacceptable in a Tenth Grade English class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The Court of Appeal, Second District, in the vacated opinion in this case written by Presiding Justice Ford (103 Cal.Rptr. 188), aptly disposed of plaintiff\u2019s contention regarding lack of notice: \u201cThere is no ironclad rule of law that regulations or rules be promulgated which specify in minute detail the various kinds of misconduct which will subject a teacher to disciplinary action. It is not unreasonable to assume that a person engaged in the profession of teaching will have a reasonable concept of generally accepted standards relating to propriety of conduct, including the avoidance of vulgarity, and will adhere to such standards in his relationship with his pupils. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u201cAdhering to an objective standard, in the present case it was not unreasonable to determine that the plaintiff was on notice that in teaching his tenth grade English classes the art of writing a short story and in affording his students aid by using as a model a short story written by him, resort to a particular story embodying vulgarity would not serve a substantial educational purpose but would constitute a serious impropriety because of the extraneous matter of an unexemplary nature. Since manifestly inherent in such conduct was the probability of an effect adverse to the welfare of students, it was reasonable to assume that the teacher was aware that he was thereby subjecting himself to the hazard of disciplinary measures. Consequently, his contention as to the lack of adequate notice to satisfy the concept of due process is untenable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">I would conclude that the trial court properly denied mandate in this case, and, accordingly, would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied July 12, 1973. McComb, J., Burke, J., and Clark, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The majority have substantially misstated the test set forth in section 13443 and the <em>Griggs </em>case. Although correctly explaining that the role of the courts is limited to determining whether the cause for termination <em>relates </em>to the welfare of the school or its pupils <em>(ante, </em>pp. 532-534), the majority purport to apnly that test by inquiring whether in fact the teacher\u2019s conduct <em>adversely affected </em>the welfare of the school or its pupils. <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 527, line 10, p. 533, line 9, p. 535, line 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>pp. 535-537.) Yet the question of adverse effect is precisely the question reserved to the school board by section 13443\u2014otherwise a court could in every case reverse the board\u2019s decision by finding that particular conduct had no \u201csignificant adverse impact\u201d <em>(ante, </em>at p. 527, line 10) on the school or its pupils.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Since the district\u2019s action in this case can be sustained on the basis of Lindros\u2019 improper language in his classroom, I do not reach the question whether that action could also be upheld on the independent ground that Lindros permitted unauthorized departure of students from his class.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The majority\u2019s reliance upon the so-called \u201cfree-speech\u201d cases (e.g., <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, </em>403 U.S. 15 [29 L.Ed.2d 284, 91 S.Ct. 1780]), seems wholly misplaced, for no attempt is made to subject Lindros to criminal liability for his conduct. As conceded by the majority <em>(ante, </em>p. 537), \u201cthese rulings by no means legitimize the general use of offensive language in the classroom . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
