Davis, the appellee, against O. Posey Herbert, the appellant, in the Circuit Court for Charles County, for commissions claimed by the appellee to be owing to him by the appellant for the sale of the latter\u2019s farm in Charles County.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Joseph L. Davis, the plaintiff, a real estate agent, or dealer, testified that in the spring of 1919 he was in Hughesville and while there saw Herbert, the defendant, and asked him if he wished to sell his farm, and he replied that he had bought it expecting to go there himself, but, having determined not to do so, \u201cho would sell it.\u201d The plaintiff then asked him the price at which he would sell. He said that \u201che wanted $16,-000 for it,\u201d and when asked if he would pay commission out of that said, \u201cHo; I want $16,000 net.\u201d The plaintiff said he would try to sell it for him and defendant said, \u201cYou can go ahead and sell it.\u201d Some time thereafter the defendant\u2019s farm was, by the plaintiff, shown to one Leo S&gt;. Knott, who subsequently became the purchaser of it. Knott was told by the plaintiff that he thought it could be bought \u201caround $16,000.\u201d This Knott thought was too much for the property, but said he would come back and again look it over. The plaintiff then called up Herbert and told him he thought ho had a prospect of selling his farm, but did not believe he could get his price. On the next morning, or the day after, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Herbert went to plaintiff\u2019s home at Charlotte Hall and discussed with him the sale of the farm, and plaintiff there told him the condition of the farm did not warrant the price he asked for it, hut said he would do the best he could, that Knott, he thought, would come back, although he had said that he would not pay over $15,000 for the farm; that he would try to bring Mr. Knott back if defendant was inclined to take $15,000 for it. The. defendant then suggested to plaintiff that he bring Knott up to see him when he came, and plaintiff then called Knott up on the \u2019phone and arranged that he should come the next day, or in a few days thereafter. When he came \u201cthey walked the property over thoroughly,\u2019\u2019and Knott said to him that he would not pay over $15,000 for it. The plaintiff then told him that he had no authority to consider the offer, but suggested that he should go to see Mr. Herbert. So* both he and Knott called upon Herbert, who was told by the plaintiff that he had brought Knott up to discuss with him the sale of his farm. Herbert said to Knott, \u201cHasn\u2019t Mr. Davis told you?\u201d and he replied, \u201cWell I told Mr. D'avis I could not give over $15,000 for it,-provided you accept my terms.\u201d Knott then told him what his terms were and Herbert said, \u201cWell,.the farm is not in very good condition this year. * * * I do not expect to use the farm as a home. I have decided to sell it and I will take your offer.\u201d A contract of sale was then drawn up1 by Davis, by which two hundred dollars in cash was paid at the time to Herbert and the balance was to be paid as follows: Four thousand eight hundred dollars as soon as the title thereto could be examined and deed prepared and balance of ten thousand dollars was to be secured by \u00e1 mortgage. It was also agreed that the purchaser should receive half of all crops of that year, and he pay the taxes for 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Shortly after the day upon which the contract was executed, 'the plaintiff called the defendant over the \u2019phone and said to him, \u201cI suppose you understand that I am expecting a commission from the sale,\u201d and Herbert said to' him, \u201cHo; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>1 told you this was a net price, to which the plaintiff replied, \u201cYou told me the $1(5,000 was net. I brought a customer to you, and you agreed to take $15,000.\u201d The plaintiff then suggested to him that he did not mention \u201cnet to him\u201d either on the occasion when he was at his home at Charlotte Hall, or upon the day the contract was executed, and, as he says, \u201c[ thought you were going to pay me a commission, as you did not say anything about the $15,000 being net to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">After that plaintiff was at Hughesville, and again brought this question to the attention of Herbert by saying to him, \u201cI think it is nothing' more than fair that you should pay me a commission. I effected the sale and turned the customer over to you and 1 certainly think I am entitled to my commission.\u201d Herbert said, \u201cHot a damn cent,\u201d and the plaintiff replied, \u201cThis is rather a. wrong view to take of it.\u201d The plaintiff further testified that, on Herbert\u2019s second visit to Charlotte Hal], Herbert said to him, to get for him in the sale of the farm all that he could, but the lowest he would take was $15,000. Herbert, he said, dealt directly with Knott on the occasion when the sale was consummated and the contract executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Knott corroborated the plaintiff in bis statements that he was shown the property by the plaintiff; that he was told by him that it could be bought for about $16,000; that he went with the plaintiff to see Herbert, and he asked him the lowest price he would take for it, and ho said, that- Josie (meaning the plaintiff) knew the best, price, which was $15,000; that he agreed to take the farm at that price and the contract was then and there executed, which contained the agreement as to the crops and taxes, and when asked, \u201cWith whom did you make the agreement for the purchase of the farm?\u201d he replied, \u201cHr. Herbert directly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The defendant, when upon the stand, said, \u201cHr. Davis came to me at Hughesville and wanted to know whether I would sell the farm. I told him \u2018yes.\u2019 He wanted to know what I wanted for it, and T told him $16,000. He said to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>me: \u2018You are going to pay commission?\u2019 I said, \u2018No, sir; I pay no commission. It has got to be your net price.\u2019 \u201d Nothing more was said on that occasion about the sale of the farm. After that, on one occasion, upon the defendant\u2019s return from Baltimore, he was told that the plaintiff wished him to call him up over the \u2019phone, which he did, and the plaintiff said to him, \u201cWell, I think I have sold your farm.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018Is that so?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 We talked a little bit \u25a0and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t care to talk over the \u2019phone. You drive down to Charlotte Hall to see me.\u2019 So I drove down there to see him, and we got to talking about the place. He said to me, \u2018I think you are a little steep' on that place,\u2019 or something to that effect. He said, \u2018I will tell you what I can do. I will get you $15,000 for it.\u2019 Finally I agreed to it after a little while. I said, \u2018All right, sir, if you get me $15,000 for it you can sell it.\u2019 And the commission was never mentioned any more after the first time it was talked of.\u201d There was no written contract between Herbert and Davis for the sale of the property. The defendant also testified as to the conversation at his home when the plaintiff asked the defendant about his commission. The defendant in reply thereto said, \u201cWhy, your commission? It stunned me. I was surprised, because I did not think he was going to ask me any such thing. I thought everything was all fixed to start with, and T think he thought so too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In the course of the trial one exception was taken to the admission of evidence and one to the ruling of the court upon the prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The plaintiff offered one prayer which after-modification by the court was granted. The defendant offered four prayers, all of which were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The jury were told by the plaintiff\u2019s prayer that if they found \u201cfrom the evidence that the defendant employed the plaintiff to procure a purchaser for the property spoken of by the several witnesses, and the plaintiff did procure a purchaser for said property, and said property was sold by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>defendant to the purchaser procured by the plaintiff, if they shall so find, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover such compensation as they may find usual and customary for services so rendered; <em>unless, they shall further find that there was a special agreement between the pla\u00c1ntiff and the defendant, in force at the time of the execution of the written contract of sale offered in evidence in this case, that no commission or compensation for such services was to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The court modified the prayer as offered by adding thereto the italicised words of the1 prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The prayer as offered was approved in <em>Jones v. Adler, </em>34 Md. 440, a case very similar to the one before us. In that case the Court said: \u201cWhere there is a special contract, by the terms of which the broker is not to be paid commissions unless he sells the property at a specified price, the sale hv him at such a price is a condition precedent to his right to compensation, unless pending' the negotiations, and whilst his agency remains unrevoked, the owner consents to a sale for a sum other than originally agreed upon. In this case then,, although, by the terms of the original contract, the appellee was not to receive commissions unless he sold the house for $16,000, yet, if pending the negotiations\u2019, the appellant and Ms wife agreed to take $14,000, and the sale was- made-through the agency of the appellee at that price he would undoubtedly be entitled to commissions.\u201d And further on bathe same opinion it is said by the Court: \u201cIt is well settled, if the agent introduces or discloses the name of the purchaser, and such introduction or disclosure is the foundation upon which negotiations are begun and the sale effected, he will he entitled to commissions and this too although in point of fact the sale may have been made by the owner. In other words, he cannot avail himself of the services, and by making a sale through information derived from the agent, deprive the latter of his commissions. <em>Keener </em>v. <em>Harrod, </em>2 Md., 63; <em>Beall </em>v. <em>Treswell, </em>3 Md. 196.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The objection urged against this prayer by the appellant as disclosed by the brief of his counsel is that the addition thereto made by the court tends to mislead and confuse the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The prayer was no doubt modified by the court to meet the contention of the appellant that there was an agreement between the parties that no commission or compensation was to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff for his services in connection with the sale of the property, and we cannot conceive how the same could tend to' mislead or confuse the jury, or how the appellant could have been injured thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">By the defendant\u2019s first prayer the jury were told that if they found from the evidence that the defendant listed his property for sale with the said plaintiff and said plaintiff agreed to sell said property on a net basis (to said defendant) and not on a commission basis, then the verdict must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">This prayer is defective in the fact that the rights of the plaintiff to recover is made to depend upon the terms and provisions of the alleged original agreement between him and the defendant under which he first undertook to sell the property, without regard to the changes thereafter made in said agreement, shown by the evidence1 in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">His second prayer, we think, also was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The third prayer of the defendant submitted to the finding of the jury the question whether the plaintiff was \u201cin the employ or acting as the agent of the said purchaser,\u201d \u201cor that the plaintiff was acting in the interest of said purchaser.\u201d This, too, was properly rejected, as there was no evidence legally sufficient in the case upon which the jury could base their finding; and by the defendant\u2019s fourth prayer the jury was asked to find whether the plaintiff \u201cused disinterested diligence and skill for the exclusive benefit of the defendant.\u201d This prayer was also properly rejected as there was no evidence whatever in the record showing that the plaintiff did not use disinterested diligence and skill, or that he was not acting for the exclusive benefit of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>This brings us to the rulings upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In the course of the trial Knott, the purchaser, was asked \u201cWere you or not brought in contact, in reference to the purchase of this property, with Mr. Herbert through the efforts of Mr. Davis?\u201d This question was objected to by the defendant for the reason, first, that it was leading, and second, that it submitted to the witness for his determination a question that was to be determined by the jury. The court overruled the objection and the witness answered, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Whatever may be said as to the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling' thereon, it is unnecessary for us to pass upon it, in as much as it was otherwise shown by the undisputed evidence in the case, that of the plaintiff and defendant, that it was through the efforts of Davis, the plaintiff, and him alone, that Knott, the purchaser, was brought in contact with the defendant, and that the plaintiff was the procuring cause. Consequently the defendant was in no way injured by this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">As we find no errors in the rulings of the court below, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, ivith costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
