The dealer agreed to work and develop to the satisfaction of the distributor and manufacturer the territory of Washington County, to advertise there the automobiles, to report monthly to the manufacturer and the distributor all deliveries of Cadillac automobiles, with the details incident thereto, to keep in stock at least one Cadillac automobile, and a stock of automobile parts, to install without charge \u201csuch parts as the manufacturer sup-plied gratis\u201d for use on its automobile, to render free ins-pectio-n service for a stated period on all new automobiles sold by the dealer, and \u201cto- pay in par funds for all g\u2019oods ordered, on o-r befo-re delivery to the cander.\u201d It further provided that the dealer should not he entitled to any compensation from the distributor for work done or material used except upon its written order, that all accepted orders should he filled by the distributor as. \u201crapidly as practicable, consistent with the schedule given by the distributor to the dealer, and consistent with the requirements of the- distributor\u2019s other customers.\u201d The parties also agreed: \u201cThat the dealer is not authorized or empowered to- act as agent for the distributor or the manufacturer; nor to- transact business, incur obligations- or bill goods- in the name or for the account of the distributor or manufacturer, nor on behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>of the distributor or of the 'manufacturer to make any promise, \u2019warranty or representation with respect to goods or any other matter; and that the distributor or manufacturer shall not be bound by the acts or conduct of the dealer/7 and that no alterations of the terms of the contract should be valid unless in writing and signed by the distributor and \u201cthat this contract supersedes all previous contracts between the parties hereto and expires by limitation July 1st, 1918, or may be \u25a0terminated at the pleasure of either party, with or without cause or reason, upon thirty days7 written notice given through the usual course of mail, or otherwise; provided, however, that for any violation of the provisions, hereof by either party, \u2019the other party may terminate the same without notice. The termination of this contract shall cancel all orders for goods which may not have been delivered prior to the date of notice of such termination; but does not release the dealer from the payment of any sum which he may then owe the distributor. After the termination of this agreement, the sale of goods; or the referring of inquiries by the distributor to the dealer, shall not be considered as a renewal hereof; nevertheless; all orders thereafter accepted by the distributor shall be according to the \u2019provisions hereof.\u201d It also contained other provisions which are not material to the consideration of any question before us and need not be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">On August 6th, 1918, the distributor wrote Shockey that the discount allowed to him on purchases of automobiles -would be increased to eighteen per cent, and the contract extended to July\u20181st, 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">On October 6th, 1919, Shockey sold a Cadillac automobile to Janies Koleopolis for $4,522.15, and took from the purchaser a deposit of $100, and at once mailed the contract with his own check for $100 to the appellant, and ordered from it an automobile to be delivered to Koleopolis in accordance with his contract with the latter. This order was not filled but, on December 26th, 1919, he received a letter from the Standard Motor Company notifying him that, on January 1st, 1920, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>would \u201c'sever all agency connection\u201d with him. In this letter the company among other things said: \u201cWe have taken into consideration many things before arriving at this decision, and in fact have let the matter run along since the expiration of your contract until the present time, as we wanted to he sure of the best course to pursue, and did not wish to do you an injustice in any way.\u201d Shockey never received the automobile he ordered from the appellant, and consequently did not deliver to Koleopolis the automobile he agreed to sell him, but later Koleopolis purchased and received an automobile, from the Elay Motor &amp; Tire Company, which succeeded Shockey as a dealer in Cadillac automobiles in Washington County, and on March 5th, 1920, the appellant wrote Shockey as follows;: \u201cWe recently delivered to Mr. James Koleopolis, the Victoria for which you gave us $100.00 deposit several months ago. We have credited your account with 5% of list price of Victoria, feeling that you should he compensated for your effort in making sale. This; credit is mad\u00a9 notwithstanding the fact that your contract expired sometime before fhis transaction was completed. The amount of credit was $217.00. We have also credited your account with deposit of $250.00, which has been held by us for some time. After applying these two credits, there is a balance in your favor of $63.33, check for which is attached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The arrangement proposed in this letter not being satisfactory to him, on March 30th, 1920, he sued the appellant under the Practice Act of 1886 in the Superior Court of Baltimore City. The declaration contained the six common counts; and two special counts, and to it was attached t-he contract referred <em>to- </em>and an account in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cMarch 29th, 1920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\u201cStandard Motor Company to Ernest Shockey:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201cAmount on deposit with Standard Motor Company........................... $250.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">\u201cAmount due for sale of car to James Koliopules, 18 per cent, of $4,140.00....... 745.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201cAmount due for sale to Dr. J. Hubert Wade, 18 per cent, of $4,450.00........ 801.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">$1,796.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">\u201cLess amount due to Standard Motor Company............................... 403.67</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">$1,392.53,\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">and an affidavit as required by the Act of 1886. The defendant filed the general issue pleas and an affidavit in which it admitted $66.33 of the claim to he due and owing, hut disputed the balance. The trial of the issues thus presented resulted in \u00e1 judgment for the plaintiff, and from that judgment this appeal is taken. The record contains ten exceptions, of which nine relate to questions of evidence and one to the court\u2019s ruling on the prayers. The plaintiff offered no prayers. The defendant offered eight, of which one was granted and the others refused. These rulings are the subject of the tenth exception, which we will now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">' The defendant in its first prayer asked the court to direct a verdict in its favor, on the ground that the plaintiff had offered no evidence legally sufficient to entitle him to recover. It is.contended that this prayer could not have been granted because the defendant in its affidavit admitted $63.33 to be due the plaintiff. But that contention cannot prevail, for while under the terms of the act the plaintiff could, before the trial of the case, have taken a judgment for the amount admitted to be due, and have proceeded to trial for tire recovery of the amount which was disputed, yet since he failed to do that, but elected to proceed' to trial for the recovery of the whole amount claimed by him to be due, after joining issue on the defendant\u2019s pleas as filed, the defendant at such trial was not bound by the admission in its affidavit, and the burden was upon the plaintiff to establish the claim upon which the suit was brought as in other cases, as though no such admission had been made. <em>Laubheimer </em>v. <em>Naill, </em>88 Md. 174; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>Sisters of Notre Dame </em>v. <em>Kusnitt, </em>125 Md. 341; <em>Nat. Bldg. Co. </em>v. <em>Gosnell, </em>116 Md. 646; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Woman's Medical College, </em>110 Md. 444; <em>Legum </em>v. <em>Blank, </em>105 Md. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Inasmuch as the prayer makes no reference to the plead-, ings, it will he \u201cheld to relate exclusively to the evidence\u201d and its \u201ccorrectness will he determined entirely by a consideration of the evidence\u201d <em>(Whitby </em>v. <em>Balto. C. &amp; A. Ry. Co., </em>96 Md. 700; 2 <em>Poe, Pl. &amp;, Prac., </em>sec. 302), and the question therefore is whether there isi in the case evidence legally sufficient to show any indebtedness at- all due to thei plaintiff by the defendant. It therefore is necessary to examine the evidence with a view to discovering, not whether it furnishes any proof of the cause of action sued on, but whether it supplies proof of any cause of action whatever. Such an examination demonstrates that, if we disregard the admission in the affidavit of defense, as we must do under the circumstances of this ease, there is no evidence that at the institution of this suit the appellant was indebted to the appellee for anything at all, unless as a result of the transaction which is referred to as the sale of Koleopolis\u2019 automobile, for while it does appear that the appellee at the time this suit was brought had on deposit with the appellant $350, yet he admitted that as against that he owed the appellant over $400.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Nor does it appear that the appellee rendered to the appellant any services for which he was entitled to recover under any implied contract for compensation according to the value of his services, for it appears that the only services which he rendered were rendered under the terms of the express contract offered in evidence. There was no relation of master and servant between the parties to this suit, nor was there a relation of principal and agent, because the contract in terms negatives the hypothesis of such a relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The only remaining ground upon which a recovery could be sought is that the appellant contracted with the appellee to sell him an automobile and that it did not perform that contract. The contract offered in evidence is in effect an under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>taking on the part of the appellant to sell automobiles to the appellee at a certain discount. In consideration of that discount the appellee undertook to render certain specific services designed to promote the sale of the make of automobiles handled by the appellant. That contract by its terms ended July 1, 1919, but by its terms all orders accepted thereafter were to be \u201caccording to its provisions.\u201d But while it automatically terminated on July 1st, 1919, it was treated by both parties to it as continuing until its cancellation in December of that year, for the appellee in this case claims the discount allowed by it, to which he could only be entitled'upon the hypothesis that, when he ordered the automobile in October, 1919, the contract allowing the discount was in force, and the appellee, in its letter of December 26th, 1919, expressly recognized its continuance, and we will therefore assume for the moment that it was renewed on July 1st, 1919, and continued in force until its cancellation in December, 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">If the contract was not in force at the time he gave the order for the automobile, clearly he was not injured by the failure of the appellant to deliver it, because the only loss he claims to have suffered is tire loss of eighteen per cent, discount from the list price allowed him under the contract. He had no claim to any discount from the list price of the auto&gt;mobile aside from the contract, and if it was not in existence he had none at all, and as there is no evidence that he suffered any loss as a result of the appellant\u2019s failure to deliver to him the automobile, except the loss of the discount, it follows that, if the contract was not in force when he gave the order for the automobile, ho cause of action accrued to him from the appellant\u2019s failure to deliver it.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">But assuming that the contract was in force when the- order was given, what then is the appellee\u2019s position under the evidence ? The contract provided it could be terminated at any time by either party with or without cause upon thirty days\u2019 notice, and by either party without notice for any violation of the terms of the contract, and that its termination should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u201ccancel all orders for goods\u201d not delivered prior to the Stotioe of cancellation. The appellant notified the appellee on December 2Gth that the contract would be terminated on January 1st, 1920. The appellee testified that the \u201cStandard Motor Company terminated the agency by that letter,\u201d and he therefore regarded and accepted it as a valid notice of the termination of the contract, and it became unnecessary to incluir\u00e9 whether there was any breach of the contract by tbe appellee justifying a termination of the contract npon less than thirty days\u2019 notice. The appellant could not be beld responsible for its failure to deliver tbe machine after it terminated the contract, for by its terms such termination automatically cancelled all orders unfilled at the time the notice of termination was received. But the appellee contends that the appellant is responsible because it could have delivered tbe machine before the termination of the contract, but that it negligently or wilfully failed to do so, but there is no evidence which can be said to be legally sufficient to support tbat contention. It is true that it appears that the- appellant delivered automobiles of the type ordered by the appellee npon orders accepted after his order was given, but it appears that they were distributed in accordance with a definite scheme of allotment adopted by the appellant for the benefit of its business and with no particular reference to the appellee. In doing that the appellant was acting within the discretion which it reserved to itself under that clause of the contract which provides: \u201cThat all accepted orders shall be filled by the distributor as rapidly as practicable, consistent with the schedule given by the distributor to the dealer, and consistent with the requirements of the distributor\u2019s other customers, subject, however, to delays caused by strikes, fires, transportation difficulties, or any other cause beyond tbe distributor\u2019s control; that the <em>distributor </em>or the manufacturer <em>shall not be liable for any Joss or damage from its failure to deliver goods ordered.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>But even if there were proof that in failing to deliver the machine the appellant acted wilfully, it could not help' the situation, because in the clause last cited the appellee expressly agreed that'the appellant should \u201cnot be liable for any loss or damage from its failure to deliver goods ordered.\u201d In the absence of anything impeaching the validity of the contract, we know of no reason why the parties who have executed it should not be bound by its terms. And since the appellee has in it agreed that the appellant shall not be liable for any loss or damage for \u201cits failure to deliver goods ordered\u201d he cannot now be permitted to repudiate his agreement and do the very thing which, he agreed, could not be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">From what has been said it follows that the first prayer of the appellant should have been granted and the case withdrawn from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">As this conclusion finally disposes of the case no further discussion of the exceptions is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Dor the error in refusing the first prayer of the appellant it will be necessary to reverse the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed without a procedendo, with costs to the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
