It alleges the execution of the contract filed as an exhibit, and tbat at tbe time of the execution thereof appellants paid five hundred dollars on account of the purchase money, as set out in the contract, and that, immediately upon the execution thereof possession was delivered to appellants of the property, business, stock of goods, etc., referred to in said contract; and that appellants retained possession thereof and conducted a retail grocery business, such as had previously been conducted by appellees in said property, disposing of certain goods and replacing certain portions of the stock sold; that appellees made arrangements to comply with their1 part- of the contract and appellants, were notified of the time and place when and where title would be conveyed to. them; that notwithstanding appellees have been and now are ready and willing to convey the property mentioned in the contract, upon appellants complying with the terms of said contract, appellants have refused and have declared their intention not to comply with said contract; that, upon appellants abandoning said property, appellees., realizing tbe value of a grocery business being actively conducted, concluded to operate said business for and on-behalf of appellants until such time as they would carry out their contract of purchase, the said determination being communicated to appellants, and as no objection was raised thereto, appellees have continued to conduct said business for and on behalf of appellants; that appellants own two pieces of real estate in Baltimore City, Kos. 2443 and 2502 Fleet Street, which said properties, appellees believe, are the only assets appellants, are possessed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Prayer of bill is: (1) That contract may be specifically enforced. (2) Tbat a receiver1 may be appointed to take charge of the property mentioned in the contract and the business therein conducted, and to hold said property and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>duct said business pursuant to further orders of court for the benefit of the parties to this cause as their respective rights thereto may hereafter be determined. (3) That appellants may be restrained and enjoined from disposing of, or encumbering or otherwise dealing with the said properties belonging to them or either of them on Fleet Street until the further order of court. (4) For further relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The contract, filed with the bill as an exhibit, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzK\">\u201cThis Agreement, Made this 19th day of March, nineteen hundred and twenty, between Franciszek Sicinski, Emilia Sicinski, his wife, of Baltimore City, State of Maryland, of the first part, Alexander Powichrowski, of the same place, of the second part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWx\">\u201cWitnesseth, That the said parties of the first part do hereby bargain and sell unto the said party of the second part, and the latter doth hereby purchase from the former the. following described property, situate and lying in Baltimore City, known as 2520 Poster Avenue, subject-to an annual ground rent of thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents, dwelling, store fixtures, stock, shelving and everything belonging to grocery business, at and for the price of six thousand, five hundred dollars, of which five hundred dollars have been paid prior to the signing hereof, and the balance is to be paid as follows: In cash within thirty days from. date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cAnd upon payment as above \u2022 of the unpaid purchase money, a deed for the property shall be executed at the vendee\u2019s expense by the vendor, which shall convey the property by a good and merchantable title to the vendee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">\u201cTaxes, etc., to be paid or allowed for by the vendor to day of settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">\u201cWitness our hands and seals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">\u201cE.

Suffice it to sa.y that, according to the testimony of Maneiszek -Sicinski, who alone testified in behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>appellees on that point, Alexander Pbwichrowslci, one of the appellants, after conducting the business with the assistance of the witness and the wife of witness until Saturday, April 10th, at midnight of that day threw down the keys, on the meat block, left the store and went out. \u201cI said, \u2018Are you going to come tomrrow morning ?\u2019 He said, \u2018I do not come no more.\u2019 He did not come Sunday. Monday at ten o\u2019clock all the bread and calces lay outside. I had to lock the sto.re. I took the bread in, and at ten o\u2019clock he came in. I said, \u2018What is the matter with you; did you sleep over or what ?\u2019 He said, \u2018I am not going to bother with it. I paid for one small ham; I am going to take it.\u2019 He took the ham and I not see him any more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The version of Alexander Powiehrowski as to what took place on that day is as follows: \u201cQ. Did he (Sicinski) clerk for you at any time in the store ? A. Sometime in the morning he opened the door and said, how is business? and he goes. Q. Did he sell any goods for you during the time you were there? A. Ho, just the day he put me out. Q. What day did he put you out ? A. Saturday, April 10th, quarter of five. Q. In the afternoon? A. In the morning. I just come and opened the store and he took his license. I said, \u2018I have to stay under your license before the settlement; after the settlement I can take license.\u2019 no said, \u2018Ho, you cannot sell them, I am going to arrest you.\u2019 Pie was going to call the policeman and I put a bar on the front store. He said, \u2018You cannot sell any more.\u2019 Then, two ladies\u00a1 in the store I tried to sell them and he said, \u2018You cannot sell,\u2019 you have no license. Q. When were you to have a settlement ?' A. I told him Thursday I would settle April 10th. Q. You told him Thursday before the settlement ? A. Yes. Q. You told him Thursday, April 12th? A. Ho, April 8th, that I would settle April 10th. Q\u201e He left you there then? A. Yes. Q. Did you mean it when you say you notified him on the 8th, that you would be ready to settle by the 12th of April ? A. My time was April 19th, but I wanted to settle April 12th. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Q. Did yon Lav\u00a9 the money to- pay him? A. I. paid down five hundred dollars. Q. Had you made any provision ? A. Ho, sir; I paid all my hills. Q. Yon do not, understand me. You paid him $500- down and on the 8th of April you said to him that you were ready to settle on the 12th ? A. Yes. Q. Did you have any m,onoy to settle with ?' A. At the time, yes. I settle with my property on Fleet Street; he give me possession for thirty days. (There was some previous testimony of an attempt to sell the Fleet Street property before the injunction.) Q. Was that why you sold the property oar Fleet Street ? A. Yes, I sold that property. Q. Where- are you now ? A. I was living at 2443 Fleet Street. Q. Doing business there? A. Yes. Q. Did you buy that place? A. Yes, sir. Q-. When? A. I made a contract May 10th. Q. When did you take possession of it ? A. I took possession May 10 th.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Florian Bidzzynslri testified that on Saturday, April 10th, there was some disturbance there; witness jumped out in the street at five o\u2019clock in the morning, and then all of a sudden the lights went out in the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Joseph Yaltalsld testified that on April 10, 1920, he was a tenant in this building, living over the- store; witness heard the wife of Sicinski complain and cry about having sold the place, that she liked it and did not want it sold; heard-him say to his wife, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t bother, we are- still going to keep hold of this place\u201d; that Sicinski was still in the habit of keeping butter and cigarettes upstairs and selling it to customers; \u201cthe Friday prior to the Saturday before the whole thing was finished he said tomorrow is the day on which I will put the fellow out and I will finish the whole business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Mrs. Amelia FTalstalski testified that she boarded at Sicinski\u2019s at the time in question; that she heard Mrs,. Sicinski\u2019 carry on and cry about the sale of the store; she did not want it sold and Mrs. Sicinski on one occasion told witness that she was in hopes of getting the store hack; that on April 10th, in the evening, witness \u201cheard Mr. Sicinski say to- the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ant that he was not going to give him the book to collect money on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Mrs. Powichrowski testified that Sieinski camo to her house after he chased her husband out of the store. \u201cPie said: 'Well, I will know wbat I do; I chased you out of the store, but you can come over again and sell your meat, because you got your meat.\u2019 He says, 'You can come and sell it.\u2019 My husband did not want to go. He says, 'Well, I will go anyway and see what you do again.\u2019 So&gt;, my husband went to the store. I said, all right, you gave half of that money\u2014 what you call it ? Q. The forfeit <em>? </em>A. The forfeit. I said you gave half, you make such a shame of my husband, so you give just half of that money, and we were going to give it hack. He got up and said, 'Ho, I am not going to give you half of that money\u2019; he says, 'After I sell this property I will give you some.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Sieinski, in rebuttal, denied that he chased Powichrowski out of the store. In reference to what happened at Powichrowski\u2019s house, witness said, \u201cI taken the license off of him; he come to the store, he said I will go get tire license and come hack, and in one hour he went out and come hack and attend to his business \u2014 that was in the morning, Saturday. Q. Were you in her house pleading? A. I was up there to see what was the matter \u2014 he closed the store \u2014 and said, 'what is the matter ?\u2019 I said, 'Please come and attend to the business. If you do not, I am going to sue you for the damage what you are doing and then he come hack and attend to business.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Witness denied his wife cried because the store was sold, but said she cried because Powichrowski cursed him; denied that he said he would not give him the books; denied that he sold butter and cigarettes upstairs; denied that he said in the presence of the witness, Halstalski, that he was going to put Powichrowski out.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">It will he noted that Sieinski is not corroborated in any particular by a single witness, as to his version of the occur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>renco on April lOtli. The absence of Mrs. Sicinski, one o\u00a3 the appellees, is significant. It will also he noted that there is not a particle of evidence that the taking possession of the store and running it for three months before the filing of the hill in this case (for the benefit of appellants, as Sicinski claims') was done with the approval of appellants or either of them, or that Sieinsld ever told either of them he was running it for them, although the hill so alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Aor is there any contradiction of Powichrowski\u2019s testimony that, on April 8th, he told Sicinski he would be ready to pay the balance of the purchase money on April 12th. Tf it can he said that anything done by Powichrowsld relieved appellees as to him of the necessity of tendering performance of their part of the contract and demanding performance hy appellants, before bringing a suit of this character, there is no testimony that such a condition existed as to Mrs. Powichrowsld, who is also a party to the contract and a defendant in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Por three months, appellees had sole possession of the property and ran the business as their own, before filing the bill of complaint. After so long a time there may not have been left a single article of merchandise which was included in the contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u201cSpecific performance is relief which this Court will not give, unless in eases where the parties seeking it come promptly, and as soon as the nature of the case will permit.\u201d <em>Penn </em>v. McCullough, 76 Md., at p. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">It goes without saying that specific performance should not he decreed after the contract has become incapable of being performed. See <em>Shriver </em>v. <em>Seiss, </em>49 Md., at p. 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u201cSpecific execution of contracts hy courts of equity is not a matter of absolute right in the party applying\", but of sound discretion in the court, to he exercised upon consideration of all the circumstances of each particular1 case. The court will ho controlled, of course, in the exercise of its discretion, by the established doctrinos and settled principles upon the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ject; but it does not follow, as a. matter.of course, that because the legal obligation under the contract may be perfect, therefore the equitable power of the court will be exercised to compel or effect specific execution. In every case the question is whether the exercise of the power is called for to sub-serve the ends of justice; and unless the court- is satisfied that the application to it for this extraordinary assistance is fair, just and reasonable <em>in every respect, </em>it will refuse to' interfere, and leave the party to other remedies for redress.\u201d <em>Semmes </em>v. <em>Worthington, </em>38 Md. at p. 325; <em>Rickard </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>130 Md. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Under the principles announced in these and in many other cases, appellees did not make out such a case1 as to entitle them to a decree for specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">And even if such a decree could have been properly passed, it would have been error, in a proceeding of this sort, and while the proceedings were pending, to interfere by injunction with the disposition of property in no way connected with the contract involved, in the proceeding. <em>Uhl </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>10 Md. 500; <em>Frederick County Bank </em>v. <em>Shafer, </em>87 Md. 54; <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>Ragan, </em>117 Md. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\n<em>Decree reversed, and bill dismissed, with costs to appellants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
