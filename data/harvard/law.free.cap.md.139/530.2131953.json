Devlin, 48 Md. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">In <em>Wilson </em>v. Wilson, 86 Md. 638, decided on January 5th, 1898, it was said that the weight of authority seems to be that either the husband or wife can sue the other in equity for protection of his or her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">In <em>Masterman </em>v. <em>Masterman, </em>129 Md. 176, decided on June 23rd, 1916, it is distinctly said that there would seem to' he no doubt about the right of the wife to sue the husband in equity. Section 5 of article 45 authorizes married women <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>to sue for the recovery, security or protection of their property, and if section 20 of that article be not applicable, it would seem that the plaintiff could sue her husband as well as any other person for the protection of her property under section 5 of the article. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Boland, </em>125 Md. 116; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Welslager, </em>90 Md. 409; 1 <em>Poe, Pl. &amp; Pr., </em>secs. 311-317; <em>Lyell </em>v. <em>Walbach, </em>113 Md. 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It will be seen that a complete change was made and effected in the law as to the rights of married women in this State by chapter 157 of the acts of 1898, and by chapter 633 of the acts of 1900, and now embraced as sections 5 and 20 of article 15, entitled \u201cHusband and Wife,\u201d Bagby\u2019s Code, vol. 1, page 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">By section 5 of article 15 of the Code, it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJd\">\u201cMarried women shall have power to engage in any business, and to contract, whether engaged in business or not, and to sue upon their contracts, 'and also to sue for the recovery, security or protection of their property, and for torts committed against them, as fully as if they were unmarried; contracts may also be made with them, and they may also be sued separately upon their contracts, whether made before or during marriage, and for wrongs independent of contract committed by them before or during their marriage, as fully as if they were unmarried; and upon judgments recovered against them, execution may be issued as if they were unmarried; nor shall any husband be liable upon any contract made by his wife in her own name and upon her own responsibility, nor for any tort committed separately by her out of his presence, without his participation or sanction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">And by section 20 of article 15 of the Code (section 19A, chapter 633, acts 1900), it is also provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201cA married woman may contract with her husband or with any other person or persons in the same manner as if she were a feme sole, and upon all such contracts, partnership or otherwise, a married <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>woman may sue and be sued as fully as if she were a feme sole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">It was clear, we think, both under the Code and upon the authorities that have been cited, that even prior to the passage of the acts of 1898 and 1900, now sections 5 and 20 of article 45 of the Code, that either the wife or the husband could sue the other and maintain an action in a court ,of equity for the protection of his or her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">It. seems also now well settled, upon a proper construction of sections 5 and 20 of article 45 of the Code, set out herein, that a married woman in this State may sue for the recovery, security, or protection of her property 'as fully as if she were unmarried, either in a court of equity or in a court of law, and she may also be sued separately upon her contracts, and for wrongs independent of contract committed by her, as fully as if she were a <em>feme sole.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">By section 20 of article 45 of the Code, it is specially provided that a married woman may contract, with her husband, or with any other person, in the same manner as' if she were a <em>feme sole, </em>and upon all such contracts or otherwise she may sue or be sued as fully as if she were a <em>feme sole, </em>and this means that she may sue or be sued either in a court of law or a court of equity, as the nature of the case may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">So without stopping to. review the averments of the bill, which have been clearly stated in the previous part of this opinion, we think, the facts alleged therein are sufficient to sustain the relief sought by the bill, if they can be supported by proper proof, and the court below, therefore, committed no error in overruling the demurrer and requiring the defendant to answer the plaintiffs bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">For the reasons stated, the order of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">\n<em>Order affirmed, the cause remanded, with costs to the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
