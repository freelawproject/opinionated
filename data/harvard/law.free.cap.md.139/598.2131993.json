Appellee filed a caveat to the will, to which the executor and the appellants filed answers. Appellants also filed a petition alleging that the caveator was debarred from caveating the will by an agreement of settlement or compromise between her and the petitioners, which petition was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\u201cPetition of George M.

Freed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">\u201c \u2018Witness: Lida Freed. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">Appellee filed an answer to this petition,.to which a general replication was filed by the petitioners, and the matter was set down for hearing; but, before the date set for the hearing, appellee withdrew her answer and filed a motion that the petition of appellants be not received; which motion was granted and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">This appeal is from the order of the orphans\u2019 court granting said motion of appellee and dismissing appellants\u2019 petition. The single question raised by this appeal is whether or not it was the duty of the orphans\u2019 court to decide as a preliminary question the right of appellee to caveat the will and have issues sent -to the circuit court, before sending such issues to that court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">It is contended by appellee that the orphans\u2019 court was without jurisdiction to decide that question in this case, because to do so would be \u201cto enforce a contract or to give forde and efficacy thereto,\u201d and that such power is beyond the limited jurisdiction conferred upon that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">We do not agree with this contention. What the court was asked to do was to determine whether appellee has such an interest in the estate disposed of by the will as to entitle her to have issues tried as to the validity of the will; and in this were involved the questions as to the validity and effect of the agreement set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Among other powers conferred upon the court by statute, is the power \u201cto secure the rights of orphans and legatees and administer justice in all matters relating to the affairs of deceased persons.\u201d <em>Code, </em>art. 93, sec. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In the case of <em>Macgill </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>80 Md. 256, it is said that the language above quoted is very broad, \u201cand shows the legislative intention was to confer adequate power and jurisdiction upon orphans\u2019 courts in every case in which their general powers would enable them to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">And in <em>Pole </em>v. <em>Simmons &amp; Pole, Executors, </em>45 Md. 246, it was held that \u201cwhere the orphans\u2019 court has jurisdiction over a matter, it has the right to hear and receive evidence in relation thereto; and if the evidence consist of written instruments, to examine and construe them, in order that it may properly apply it to the case before it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">And in <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company, Excr., </em>v. <em>Devilbiss, </em>128 Md. 182, it was held that the question of the interest of the caveator and his right to file a caveat must be determined by the orphans\u2019 court as a preliminary question before sending issues to be tried as to the validity of a will; that this preliminary question should be first decided by that court, upon proof taken before it, or after the trial of appropriate issues relative thereto in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The last two cases cited seem to be conclusive of the question at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Of course the other side, if it so desired, had the right to ask for appropriate issues relative to this preliminary question to be tried in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Being of the opinion that the orphans\u2019 court erred in refusing to receive the petition filed by appellants, we must reverse the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">\n<em>Order reversed, and cause remanded, with costs to appellants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
