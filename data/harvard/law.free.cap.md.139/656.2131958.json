The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to the question, and the first exception is to that ruling. The question does not appear to have been answered by the witness, and the trial court so states in a note to the bill of exception. The defendant could not, therefore, have been injured by the ruling complained of. 2 <em>Poe, Pl. &amp; Pr., </em>sec. 314; <em>King v. Zell &amp; Merceret, </em>105 Md. 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">A part of the alleged slanderous statement made by the defendant was in the Polish language and a part in English, and the third exception is to the refusal of the court below to permit the defendant to ask his own witness the following question\u2019: \u201cQ. The declaration states that the words inelud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ing the two English words are in Polish, and then proceeds to translate all in the English language. Will you state to the gentlemen of the jury whether a Pole of ordinary intelligence, an intelligent Pole, would use the language as contained in this declaration ?\u201d It is apparent that there was no error in this ruling. The only questions involved were (1) whether <em>the defendant </em>used the language set out in the declaration, and (2) whether the words spoken were actionable. Whether an \u201cintelligent Pole,\u201d or another person, would have used such language was entirely immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the record contains the following statement of what was said by counsel for the defendant and by the court: \u201c(Mr. Gregorius) : If your Honor please, the law plainly states \u2014 unless it is waived by both sides that the foreign words \u2014 -that there must be some proof that the foreign words contained in the declaration are correctly translated into English. Ho one has been put on the witness stand and we have no proof except in an indirect way whether the alleged slanderous words in a foreign language were correctly translated into English, and we don\u2019t know whether the foreign words as contained in the declaration are criminal, or any words of any meaning, or any words at all. If your Honor will uphold my contention that is one of the requirements of the law, I would submit a prayer to instruct the jury to bring a verdict in for defendant. (The Court) : Without prejudice I prefer to hear the whole case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Counsel for the defendant treated the statement of the court as equivalent to the rejection of a prayer directing a verdict for the defendant, and accordingly reserved his second exception. Ho prayer was in fact offered, or instruction asked for, and, strictly speaking, there was no ruling of the court that could be made the subject of an exception. Put even if we assume that the exception was properly taken, the defendant waived it by proceeding to offer evidence in his own beh\u00e1lf. If, at the conclusion of the whole testimony, the defendant was still of the opinion that the case should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>withdrawn from the jury, he could have renewed his application for an instruction to that end, and reserved an exception to the refusal of the court to grant it. But a defendant cannot proceed with his own evidence and. retain the benefit of an exception to the refusal of the court to grant such a prayer at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. It is not necessary to state the reason for this well established rule, and we will simply refer to a few of the many cases in which it has been approved and followed. <em>Barabasz </em>v. <em>Kabat, </em>91 Md. 53; <em>Cowen </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>91 Md. 344; <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. Co. </em>v. <em>State, use of Logsdon, </em>101 Md. 359; <em>Bernheimer </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>102 Md. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">As there is no reversible error in the rulings of the court below, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
