Anders,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">\u201cThe State\u2019s Attorney for Frederick County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Appellee was indicted under Section 412 of Article <em>21 </em>of the Criminal Code, -which provides as. follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">\u201cIf any person shall place anything, or cause anything to be placed, on any railroad in this State, calculated to obstruct, overthrow or direct from the track of such railroad any car, vehicle or carriage, travelling or passing on such railroad, or shall break or injure in any manner any railroad in this State, with the view or intent to obstruct or overthrow any ear, vehicle or carriage, such person so offending shall be deemed guilty of felony, and upon conviction thereof shall.be sentenced to the penitentiary for not less than two years nor more than ten years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The only ground on which it was seriously argued that the indictment was had, was the use of the word \u201ctract\u201d in the first part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We think the learned trial court, erred in sustaining the demurrer, whether the word \u201ctract\u201d was used intentionally in preparing\u2019 the indictment or is a mistake in spelling. Where that word occurs it would clearly have been a compliance with the statute if the word \u201cproperty\u201d or \u201cright of way\u201d had been used, as placing an obstruction upon the <em>trach </em>is not a necessary element of the offense charged under the statute. These expressions could he used interchangeably without violating any rules of good English or any requirement of the statute. If that were not so, then the only meaning that could be given to the word, in the connection in which it is used, would he \u201cbrack\u201d-and the mistake in spelling could mis- \u2022' d or deceive no one. The indictment would he saved by the doctrine of <em>idem </em>sonans, if on no other ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Errors in spelling which do not obscure the sense are not fatal. See 22 <em>Cyc. </em>291, and illustrations in note.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">We have examined carefully the authorities cited by appellee. Certainly none of the Maryland cases sustain his contention. The requirements for a good indictment, and the reasons for them, are perhaps as Well and concisely stated as anywhere in <em>Homer </em>v. State, 49 Md., at <em>p. </em>284, as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u201cAs a general proposition, every indictment must charge the crime of which the party is accused with such certainty and precision that it may be understood without resort to intendments, and all the elements to constitute Hie offense must he averred. This is important not only as a means of notice to the acidised, but as means of identification of the particular accusation, with a view to future protection against a second prosecution for the same offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The indictment in this case gratifies all these requirements. It cannot be seriously contended that it failed in any respect to notify the accused of the precise offense with which he was charged, or that, by reason, of lack of particularity in the identification of the offense, it left him in danger of a future prosecution therefor. Neither is it open to the objection that it fails to aver any of the elements necessary to constitute the offense under the statute, or that it cannot bo understood, without resort to intendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">It is true some of the cases in other states, cited by appellee, go very far in holding errors in spoiling and in the misuse or omission of words fatal; much further, indeed, than we feel disposed to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Recently, however, the Supreme Court of Missouri, in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Adkins, </em>225 S. W. Rep. 981, overruled a former decision, of that court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>210 Mo. 202, which became known as the \u201cThe\u201d case, because the omission of the word \u201cthe\u201d immediately preceding the word \u201cState,\u201d in the phrase, \u201cagainst the peace and dignity of the State,\u201d was held fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Ifaidly more than passing notice is required of another objection suggested by counsel for appellee in his oral argument, viz :\u25a0 The failure to use a capital \u201cT\u201d in the word \u201cthe\u201d preceding \u201cBaltimore and Ohio Railroad Company,\u201d thereby in effect, it was suggested, omitting a part of the name by which the company was incorporated. That objection does not impress na as having much form</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
