Under the guidelines, prior convictions generally increase a defendant's criminal history score, unless they arose out of the same criminal episode as the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced. In this case, defendant was convicted of multiple crimes based on child pornography on his computer. Over defendant's objection, the court increased defendant's criminal history score after it sentenced him for each of the crimes, until it reached the maximum criminal history score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant appealed, arguing, among other things, that his convictions were based on his possession of multiple images of child pornography at the same time and place and that possession of multiple items of contraband at the same time and place constitutes a single criminal episode. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Dulfu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411872\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/209/\">\n    282 Or. App. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411872\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/209/\">\n    386 P.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). On review, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As explained below, the rule that governs the calculation of a defendant's criminal history score, OAR 213-004-0006, provides that a defendant's criminal history score is based on the defendant's criminal history at the time the defendant's \"current crimes\" are sentenced; therefore, a defendant's \"current crimes\" do not count toward the score. The legislative history of the rule shows that, by \"current crimes,\" the drafters of the rule were referring to crimes arising from the same \"criminal episode,\" which they understood to include crimes that, under the statutory and constitutional double jeopardy provisions, must be brought in a single criminal prosecution. Thus, a conviction does not count toward a defendant's criminal history score if, for double jeopardy purposes, it arose out of the same criminal episode as the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced. In other words, if double jeopardy principles require crimes to be joined in a single criminal prosecution, then a conviction for one of the crimes cannot be used to increase the defendant's criminal history score for sentencing on any of the other crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this case, the state prosecuted defendant for multiple crimes based on the possession of multiple items of contraband at the same time and place, and, under double jeopardy rules, those crimes were part of a single criminal episode. Therefore, the trial court erred in using defendant's convictions for those crimes to increase his criminal history score as it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. HISTORICAL AND PROCEDURAL FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Law enforcement officers seized and searched defendant's computer and duplicated its hard drive. During a search of the duplicated hard drive, a forensic investigator discovered computer files containing visual recordings of sexually explicit conduct involving children. The state charged defendant with crimes based on 15 of the files. For each of the 15 files, the state charged defendant with one count of encouraging child sexual abuse in the first degree (ECSA I), ORS 163.684, and one count of encouraging child sexual abuse in the second degree (ECSA II), ORS 163.686, for a total of 30 counts. (For example, Count 1, which charged defendant with ECSA I, and Count 16, which charged defendant with ECSA II, were based on the same file.) The indictment alleged that the crimes occurred on eight different dates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As relevant here, a person commits ECSA I if the person either knowingly \"duplicates * * * a visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involving a child\" or knowingly \"possesses * * * such a visual recording with the intent to * * * duplicate\" it. ORS 163.684(1)(a)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, as relevant\n   here, a person commits ECSA II if the person \"knowingly possesses * * * a visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involving a child for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual desires of the person or another person.\" ORS 163.686(1)(a)(A)(i). Thus, ECSA I applies to the duplication of recordings and the possession of recordings with intent to duplicate them, whereas ECSA II applies to the possession of recordings for a sexual purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The case was tried to a jury. The state presented evidence that the 15 files were on defendant's computer when it was seized from his house and that defendant downloaded the 15 files on eight different dates. The state argued that defendant was guilty of the ECSA I counts because he had possessed the files with the intent to duplicate them; it also argued, in the alternative, that defendant was guilty of those counts because he had duplicated the files by downloading them. The state did not elect a theory of ECSA I, and the jury verdict form did not identify a theory. The jury convicted defendant on all 30 counts (one ECSA I count and one ECSA II count for each file).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court sentenced defendant on the ECSA I counts first. Under the sentencing guidelines, a defendant's presumptive sentence for a crime is based on the crime seriousness ranking of the crime and the defendant's criminal history score. OAR 213-004-0001. The guidelines include a 99-block grid, with eleven crime serious categories on the vertical axis, ranging from \"1\" to \"11,\" and nine criminal history categories on the horizontal axis, ranging from \"A\" to \"I.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411872\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/209/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (describing the sentencing guidelines grid); OAR ch. 213, App. 1 (setting out sentencing guidelines grid); OAR 213-017-0000 - 213-017-0011 (setting forth the complete crime seriousness scale); OAR 213-004-0006 (describing the criminal history scale). \"A\" is the highest criminal history category and applies if a defendant's \"criminal history includes three or more person felonies in any combination\n   of adult convictions or juvenile adjudications.\" OAR 213-004-0007. \"I\" is the lowest criminal history category and applies if a defendant's criminal history \"does not include any juvenile adjudication for a felony or any adult conviction for a felony or Class A misdemeanor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411872\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/209/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When sentencing a defendant for a crime, a trial court identifies the crime's seriousness ranking on the vertical axis and the defendant's criminal history score on the horizontal axis, and the gridblock where those axes intersect contains the presumptive sentence for the defendant's crime. OAR 213-004-0001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ECSA I has a crime seriousness ranking of \"8.\" OAR 213-017-0004(14). Defendant's criminal history score for Count 1 was \"I.\" Therefore, defendant's gridblock for Count 1 was \"8-I,\" for which the presumptive prison term is 16-18 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OAR ch. 213, App 1 (showing presumptive sentences for gridblock). The trial court imposed an 18-month prison term on Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court then had to determine whether to include defendant's conviction on Count 1 when calculating his criminal history score for Count 2. The calculation of a defendant's criminal history is governed by\n   OAR 213-004-0006, which provides, in part, that a defendant's criminal history is based on the number of convictions \"in the offender's criminal history at the time the current crime or crimes of conviction are sentenced.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant argued that, under this court's case law, a conviction cannot be included in a defendant's criminal history if it arose out of the same \"criminal episode\" as the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Cuevas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801806\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/147/#p150\">\n    358 Or. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 150,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=361%20P.3d%20581\">\n    361 P.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (so stating). Defendant further argued that the term \"criminal episode\" has the same meaning for the purposes of the criminal history calculation as it does for the purposes of double jeopardy analysis. Thus, according to defendant, if two crimes were part of the same criminal episode for double jeopardy purposes and, therefore, had to be joined in a single criminal prosecution, then they were also part of the same criminal episode for criminal history calculation purposes. They are the defendant's \"current\" crimes, and a conviction for one of them cannot be used to increase the defendant's criminal\n   history score for any of the others. Applying that rule, defendant argued that, under\n   <em>\n    State v. Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    271 Or. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    533 P.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975), his convictions arose out of a single criminal episode for double jeopardy purposes and, by extension, for criminal history purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   , a double jeopardy case, this court held that two charges based on the defendant's possession of two different items of contraband at the same time and location arose out of a single criminal episode.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, defendant relied on\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   to argue that his convictions based on the possession of different pornographic images at the same time and location arose out of a single criminal episode and, as a result, none of the convictions could be used to increase his criminal history score for any of the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The state agreed that, if multiple convictions arise out of a single criminal episode, none of the convictions can be used to increase a defendant's criminal history score for any of the others; but the state did not agree that defendant's convictions arose out of a single criminal episode. The state contended that defendant's criminal history score could be increased for each crime committed on a different date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court rejected defendant's argument that, because the state had prosecuted him for possession of the computer files at the same time and place, his convictions arose out of a single criminal episode. The trial court did so by making its own finding regarding the basis for defendant's guilt on the ECSA I counts. Specifically, the trial court found that defendant was guilty of the ECSA I counts because he duplicated the images by downloading them:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[Defendant's] conduct was not one criminal episode, but rather multiple criminal offenses. I find that he was convicted of downloading and duplicating these videos on eight separate dates.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court increased defendant's criminal history score for sentencing on Count 2 and each of the remaining counts until it reached the maximum criminal history score of \"A.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Increasing defendant's criminal history score increased defendant's presumptive sentences. As mentioned,\n   on Count 1 defendant's gridblock was 8-I, for which the presumptive prison term is 16-18 months. Because the court included defendant's conviction on Count 1 in its calculation of his criminal history score on Count 2, defendant's gridblock on Count 2 was 8-D, which carries a presumptive prison term of 27-28 months. Then, because the court continued to increase defendant's criminal history score after sentencing defendant for each conviction, defendant's gridblock on Count 3 was 8-B, which carries a presumptive prison term of 35-40 months, and his gridblock on Count 4 was 8-A, which carries a presumptive prison term of 41-45 months. Because \"A\" is the highest criminal history score, defendant's gridblock on the remaining ECSA I counts was 8-A, and his gridblock on all the ECSA II counts was 5-A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OAR 213-017-0007(9) (providing that ECSA II has a crime seriousness ranking of 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On each count, the trial court imposed the\n   maximum presumptive prison term.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court ordered defendant to serve some of the prison terms consecutively, for a total of 180 months (15 years).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant appealed, renewing his argument that all his convictions arose from a single criminal episode and, therefore, none of his convictions could be used to increase his criminal history score for sentencing him on any of the others. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II. PARTIES' ARGUMENTS ON REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On review, the parties agree that the issue in this case is whether defendant's convictions arose out of a single criminal episode for the purposes of the criminal history rule, OAR 213-004-0006. But, they do not agree on what constitutes a criminal episode or whether defendant's crimes were part of a single criminal episode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant argues that the term \"criminal episode\" has the same meaning in the criminal history context as it does in the double jeopardy context and, therefore, if crimes must be joined in a single criminal prosecution for double\n   jeopardy purposes, a conviction for one cannot be used to increase the defendant's criminal history score for any of the others. Defendant further argues that there are multiple tests for determining whether crimes are part of the same criminal episode, and that this court identified three of them in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   . As discussed below, one is the \"same act or transaction\" or \"cross-related\" test, which is whether the charges are for crimes that \" 'are so closely linked in time, place and circumstance that a complete account of one charge cannot be related without relating details of the other charge.' \"\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    271 Or. at 563-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    533 P.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v. Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2129566\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/267/266/#p273\">\n    267 Or. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2129566\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/267/266/#p273\">\n    516 P.2d 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973) ). Another is the \"same criminal objective test,\" which is whether the charges are for \" 'continuous and uninterrupted conduct that establishes at least one offense and is so joined in time, place and circumstances that such conduct is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 564-65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    533 P.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting ORS 131.505(4) ). And, a third is whether the crimes are for the possession of contraband at the same time or place.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    at 570-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    533 P.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant argues that, under each of those three tests, his crimes were part of a single criminal episode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In response, the state argues that the only test for whether crimes are part of a single criminal episode for the purposes of the criminal history rule is the \"same criminal objective\" test. Under that test, the state contends that defendant's crimes were not part of a single criminal episode because, even though the jury did not make an express finding regarding the bases for its verdicts on the ECSA I counts-that is, even though the jury did not expressly find whether defendant duplicated the files or possessed them with the intent to duplicate them-the trial court itself could find that defendant was guilty of the ECSA I counts for duplicating the files by downloading them, and the trial court could further find that defendant downloaded the files on eight separate dates, during eight separate criminal episodes. Alternatively, the state argues that, even if the trial court itself could not make a finding that defendant duplicated the images and even if the other two tests apply, defendant's crimes were not part of a single criminal episode under any of the tests because defendant came into possession of the images at eight different times. Finally, the state\n   argues that, even if defendant's crimes were part of a single criminal episode and the trial court erred in calculating his criminal history scores as it did, the error was harmless because the trial court \"could and would impose the same total sentence on remand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, although the parties agree that a conviction cannot be used to increase a defendant's criminal history score if it arose out of the same criminal episode as the conviction for which the defendant is being sentenced, they disagree about what constitutes a criminal episode for the purposes of the criminal history rule. To resolve that disagreement, we must interpret that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   III. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Oregon Felony Sentencing Guidelines were developed by the Oregon Criminal Justice Council, adopted as administrative rules by the Sentencing Guidelines Board, and expressly approved by the legislature.\n   <em>\n    Oregon Sentencing Guidelines Implementation Manual\n   </em>\n   3 (1989) (hereafter\n   <em>\n    Guidelines Implementation Manual\n   </em>\n   ); Laird C.

OAR 213-004-0006 provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"(2) An offender's criminal history is based upon the number of adult felony and Class A misdemeanor convictions and juvenile adjudications in the offender's criminal history\n   <em>\n    at the time the current crime or crimes of conviction are sentenced\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   OAR 213-004-0006(2) establishes the point in time at which a defendant's criminal history score is to be calculated for sentencing purposes: \"the time the current crime or crimes of conviction are sentenced.\" The drafters' use of the plural term \"crimes\" reflects their recognition that a defendant may have multiple current crimes of conviction. Under\n   the rule, if a defendant has multiple current crimes of conviction, the defendant's criminal history score is calculated at \"the time\" those \"crimes\" are sentenced. The drafters' use of the singular \"time\" and the plural \"crimes\" indicates that they intended that, when a defendant has multiple current crimes of conviction, the defendant's criminal history score is calculated\n   at one time-specifically, at the outset of the sentencing of the group of crimes. That is, the defendant's criminal history score is calculated before the sentencing on the first crime and remains the same for sentencing on the remainder of the group of crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   If the drafters of the criminal history rule had intended that, when a defendant has multiple current crimes of conviction, each conviction could be used to increase the defendant's criminal history on the subsequent convictions, the drafters would have simply stated that a defendant's criminal history score is based on the defendant's criminal history at the time the current \"crime\" is sentenced. As the Court of Appeals has observed, \"If, upon sentencing, each crime becomes part of the criminal history, * * * then the reference in the rule to prior convictions at the time of the\n   <em>\n    crimes\n   </em>\n   of conviction becomes mere surplusage.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

To hold that a defendant's criminal history score must be increased after each crime is sentenced would be to ignore the express reference to \"crimes\" of conviction, which we are not to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 174.010 (providing that courts are not to \"omit what has been inserted\" when construing statutes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Thus, the plain text of OAR 213-004-0006 shows that, when a defendant is sentenced for multiple current crimes, none of the current crimes are to be used in the calculation of the defendant's criminal history. The question then becomes: what are a defendant's \"current crimes\"?

Consequently, the legislative history did not aid the defendant, because there was no dispute that his theft and\n   drug convictions arose out of separate criminal episodes; as this court observed, the defendant's theft crime was committed more than one month before the drug crime, and the two crimes were \"separate and distinct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2210040\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/317/309/#p314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2210040\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/317/309/#p314\">\n    at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2210040\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/317/309/#p314\">\n    855 P.2d 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the theft crime was not part of the same criminal episode as the drug crime, defendant's theft conviction could be used to increase his criminal history score for sentencing on the drug crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   To summarize, the legislative history discussed in\n   <em>\n    Bucholz\n   </em>\n   shows that the drafters of the criminal history rule recognized that a defendant could appear before a trial court for sentencing on multiple crimes, which the drafters described as \"current\" crimes. The legislative history also shows that the drafters did not intend the trial court's pronouncement of sentence on each current crime to result in an increase in the defendant's criminal history score on the remaining crimes.

First, at the time the drafters used the term, it had an established meaning in the double jeopardy or former jeopardy context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    271 Or. at 563-571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    533 P.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing meaning of criminal episode);\n   <em>\n    State v. Shields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2152751\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/280/471/#p473\">\n    280 Or. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2152751\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/280/471/#p473\">\n    571 P.2d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977) (noting that a defendant may not be serially prosecuted for crimes arising out of the same criminal episode). Thus, the drafters' use of the term suggests that they intended it to have the same meaning as it does in the double jeopardy context. Second, the drafters used the term to describe crimes that could be in front of a court in a single criminal proceeding, that is, crimes that could be joined. That use suggests that, at a minimum, the legislature intended the term to have the same meaning as it does in the double jeopardy context, because the statutory and constitutional double jeopardy provisions govern mandatory joinder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Or. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 12 ; ORS 131.515. Under those provisions, if crimes are part of the same criminal episode, they cannot be prosecuted serially; if they can be prosecuted in the same court and are known to the prosecutor, they must be joined. Third, nothing in the legislative history of the rule indicates that the drafters intended the term to have one meaning in the criminal history context and a different meaning in the double jeopardy context, which would lead to significant confusion. Instead, it appears that the drafters concluded, at a minimum that, if crimes were sufficiently related that they had to be brought in a single criminal proceeding, then a conviction for one could not be used to increase the defendant's criminal history score for sentencing on the others. Consequently, we\n   conclude that the term \"criminal episode\" has the same meaning in the criminal history context as it does in the double jeopardy context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   That conclusion leads to the question whether defendant's crimes were part of the same criminal episode, as that term is used in the double jeopardy context; that is, whether defendant's crimes had to be joined in a single criminal case.

That test is referred to as the \"cross-related\" test, and, although it was first articulated as a test for permissive joinder, this court held in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   that it was \"sufficiently related to the purposes of the double jeopardy concept as to serve as a criterion for application of 'single act or transaction' for double jeopardy purposes as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    271 Or. at 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    533 P.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, this court concluded, \"[w]henever multiple charges are as interrelated as the test demands, the failure to join them in the first proceeding is inexcusable and therefore a subsequent attempt by the state to prosecute would constitute undue harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The second test is whether the charges arose out of a \"single criminal episode,\" as that term is defined for the purposes of the double jeopardy statute, ORS 131.515, which provides, in part, \"No person shall be separately prosecuted for two or more offenses based upon the same criminal episode, if the several offenses are reasonably known to the appropriate prosecutor at the time of commencement of the first prosecution and establish proper venue in a single court.\" For the purposes of the double jeopardy statute, \"criminal episode\" is defined by ORS 131.505(4), which provides, \" 'Criminal episode' means continuous and uninterrupted conduct that establishes at least one offense and is so joined in time, place and circumstances that such conduct is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The third test is for charges based on the possession of contraband.

The interrelationship deemed essential in\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   is lacking in the present case because the possession of the separate items of property do not constitute relatable\n   <em>\n    events\n   </em>\n   but rather a single\n   <em>\n    condition\n   </em>\n   characterized by the manner in which the items are held by the accused.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    533 P.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   , the possession of multiple items of contraband, at the same time and place, constitutes a single criminal episode. That is because, if the possession of multiple items of contraband at the same time and place is not treated as a single criminal episode,\n   then the state could subject defendants to harassment through serial prosecutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Convictions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendant argues that, under each of the three tests identified in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   , his conviction arose from a single criminal episode. His primary argument is that all his convictions were based on his possession of the computer files and, because he possessed the files at the same time and place, his possession constitutes a single criminal episode under\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Before addressing the merits of that argument, it is necessary to address the state's argument that it does not matter whether defendant possessed the files at the same time and place because the trial court could and did find that defendant was guilty of the ECSA I counts for duplicating the files by downloading them and that he had downloaded them during eight separate criminal episodes. The state acknowledges that it presented alternative theories regarding the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of the ECSA I counts; it argued that the jury could convict defendant of those counts either on a theory that defendant duplicated the files by downloading them or on a theory that defendant possessed the files with the intent to duplicate them. The state also acknowledges that the jury's verdict does not reflect the theory on which the jury based its verdicts. Nevertheless, the state contends that the trial court could make its own finding at sentencing regarding the factual basis for defendant's guilt on the ECSA I counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   That is incorrect. In a jury trial, it is the jury's role to determine what criminal conduct, if any, the defendant engaged in.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Or. Const., Art.

Although the state may present alternative theories of a defendant's guilt to a jury, a trial court cannot impose a sentence that is contingent upon the jury having made a particular finding regarding the defendant's guilt if the record does not reflect that the jury actually made that finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Wedge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8642129\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/293/598/#p600\">\n    293 Or. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 600,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8642129\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/293/598/#p600\">\n    652 P.2d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) (holding that the trial court's imposition of a firearm minimum sentence violated the defendant's Article I, section 11, jury right when, in finding the defendant guilty, the jury did not need to find that the defendant had personally used or threatened to use a firearm in the commission of his crimes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In this case, as in any criminal case tried to a jury, it was the jury's role to determine whether the state carried its burden of proving the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of each charged crime. Thus, for each ECSA I count, it was the jury's role to determine whether the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had duplicated the files, that defendant had possessed the files with the intent to duplicate them, or both. That was not the trial court's role. Once the jury issued its verdict, the trial court could determine whether defendant's criminal conduct-as found by the jury-constituted one or more criminal episodes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801806\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/147/#p150\">\n    358 Or. at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=361%20P.3d%20581\">\n    361 P.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the trial court could not make its own finding about what defendant's conduct was. In order for the state to have the trial court sentence defendant based on a finding that defendant was guilty of the ECSA I counts for duplicating the files, the state needed to obtain that finding regarding the basis for defendant's guilt from the jury. It did not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Therefore, we return to the merits of defendant's argument that, under\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   , his convictions arose out of a single criminal episode because the state prosecuted him for his possession of the files at the same time and place. Because, as we have explained above, the term \"criminal episode\" has the same meaning in the criminal history context as in the double jeopardy context, we agree with that argument. It is clear that, under\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   , the state could not have brought serial prosecutions against defendant in this case, each based on possession of a different computer file. For example, the state could not have brought a case against defendant for possession of one file, and then, after that case was resolved, have brought a second case based on possession of a second file at the same time and location, even if the second file was obtained at a different time. As in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]here would be no reason other than harassment of the defendant for the state to divide the condition of possession into parts and prosecute separately on each.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    271 Or. at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n    533 P.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the crimes would have to be joined in a single criminal prosecution. That is true, even if defendant acquired the files on different dates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123442\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/558/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (stating that \"[i]f a defendant is charged with the possession of drugs, some of which had been acquired at one time and the rest at another time, it would seem clear that he would be entitled to object to multiple prosecutions\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, as explained, the drafters of the criminal history rule intended that, when a defendant was being sentenced for such crimes, a conviction for one would not increase the defendant's criminal history\n   score on the others. Therefore, the trial court could not increase defendant's criminal history score as it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The state argues that holding that defendant's possession of the computer files at the same time and location\n   constitutes a single criminal episode will result in unreasonable sentences. Specifically, the state argues,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   \"The necessary result of defendant's proffered rule is that a person who separately acquires unlawfully multiple items of contraband but then destroys or otherwise disposes of them is treated more harshly than a similar person who separately and unlawfully acquires the same multiple items of contraband and then chooses instead to continue to retain it all.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The result to which the state objects is the result of the drafters' importation of double jeopardy principles into the criminal history context. Application of those principles can result in defendants being treated differently. For example, a defendant who possesses multiple items of contraband at separate times and locations can be serially prosecuted, but a defendant who possesses multiple items of contraband at the same time and location cannot. Arguably, the first defendant is treated more harshly than the second. But the different treatment is not unreasonable; as this court explained in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   , joinder of the second defendant's crimes is necessary to protect against undue harassment. And, it was not unreasonable for the drafters of the criminal history score rule to conclude that, if crimes had to be joined in a single criminal proceeding, they would count as present crimes, not prior crimes, when calculating the defendant's criminal history score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Certainly, the legislature could have used one test for determining whether crimes had to be joined for double jeopardy purposes and a different test for determining whether crimes could be used to increase a defendant's criminal history score, but it did not. As this court held in\n   <em>\n    Bucholz\n   </em>\n   , and affirmed in\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   , the drafters of the criminal history rule \"distinguished between\n   <em>\n    a single criminal episode\n   </em>\n   , which they thought was not prior criminal history for use in sentencing on some other conviction from the same episode, and crimes from\n   <em>\n    more than one episode\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Bucholz\n   </em>\n   , 317 Or. at 317,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2210040\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/317/309/#p314\">\n    855 P.2d 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added). And, as explained above, \"criminal episode\" was a term used in the double jeopardy context, and the drafters used it in the same way: to identify crimes that would be before the court for sentencing in the\n   same criminal proceeding. And, they reasonably concluded that crimes that would be before the court in the same criminal proceeding should be treated as present crimes for sentencing purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Harmlessness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Having concluded that the defendant's simultaneous possession of the computer files constitutes a single criminal episode, we turn to the state's final argument, which is that, even if the trial court erred in calculating defendant's criminal history, the error was harmless because the trial court \"could and would impose the same total sentence on remand.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Or. Const., Art. VII (Amended), \u00a7 3 (stating that this court shall affirm a judgment, notwithstanding any error in the trial, if the court is of the opinion that the judgment \"was such as should have been rendered in the case\"); ORS 131.035 (providing that no error in a criminal proceeding \"renders it invalid, unless it has prejudiced the defendant in respect to a substantial right\"). Even assuming that the trial court could impose the same total prison term, we cannot conclude that the trial court's sentencing error was harmless. As described above, the trial court's error in calculating defendant's criminal history had a significant effect on defendant's presumptive sentences. It increased defendant's presumptive sentences rapidly and significantly; his presumptive sentence on Count 1 was 16-18 months, but by the time he was sentenced on Counts 4-15, it was 41-45 months. Given the effect the error would have had on the trial court's understanding of the maximum total sentence it could impose on defendant, it is far from certain that the error had no bearing on the trial court's determination of what sentence to impose. Thus, the record does not establish that, had the trial court properly calculated defendant's criminal history, it would have imposed the same total prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The decisions of the Court of Appeals and circuit court are reversed, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Specifically, the indictment alleged that the crimes occurred on November 26, 2011 (Counts 1 and 16); January 1, 2012 (Counts 2 and 17); January 6, 2012 (Counts 3 and 18); January 20, 2012 (Counts 4 and 19); January 24, 2012 (Counts 5, 6, 7, 20, 21, and 22); January 30, 2012 (Counts 8, 9, 10, 23, 24, and 25); January 31, 2012 (Counts 11, 12, 13, 26, 27, and 28); and February 2, 2012 (Counts 14, 15, 29, and 30).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    ORS 163.684 defines ECSA I, a Class B felony, as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n    \"(1) A person commits the crime of encouraging child sexual abuse in the first degree if the person:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n    \"(a)(A) Knowingly develops, duplicates, publishes, prints, disseminates, exchanges, displays, finances, attempts to finance or sells a visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involving a child or knowingly possesses, accesses or views such a visual recording with the intent to develop, duplicate, publish, print, disseminate, exchange, display or sell it; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n    \"(B) Knowingly brings into this state, or causes to be brought or sent into this state, for sale or distribution, a visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involving a child; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n    \"(b) Knows or is aware of and consciously disregards the fact that creation of the visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involved child abuse.\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Thus, defendant's prison terms were as follows: 18 months (Count 1); 28 months (Count 2); 40 months (Count 3); 45 months (Counts 4-15); and 16 months (Counts 16-30).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    In full, OAR 213-004-0006(2) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n    \"An offender's criminal history is based upon the number of adult felony and Class A misdemeanor convictions and juvenile adjudications in the offender's criminal history at the time the current crime or crimes of conviction are sentenced.

When the drafters were discussing the rule, a staff member of the Criminal Justice Council informed them that, if a defendant had \"multiple current offenses\" and each offense increased the defendant's criminal history score for the remaining offenses, that would increase the correctional resources required to implement the guidelines. Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections, June 20, 1989, Tape 103, Side A (statement of Kathryn Ashford). One of the drafters characterized the projected increase as \"substantial,\"\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . (statement of Rep. Tom Mason), and all the drafters, in agreeing with Ellis, appear to have intended to avoid such an increase.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The commentary further explains, \"[A] 'conviction' or 'juvenile adjudication' should be considered to have occurred upon the pronouncement of sentence in open court. This is a convention established only to provide continuity in the application of these rules with respect to\n    <em>\n     convictions from other proceedings\n    </em>\n    against the offender.\"\n    <em>\n     Guidelines Implementation Manual\n    </em>\n    51 (emphasis added). Thus, although the commentary states that a conviction is considered to have occurred upon the pronouncement of sentence in open court, the purpose of that statement-which was later inserted into the criminal history rule itself,\n    <em>\n     former\n    </em>\n    OAR 253-04-006 (Nov. 1, 1993)-is to establish the criteria for using a conviction\n    <em>\n     from another proceeding\n    </em>\n    in the calculation of a defendant's criminal history score. It was necessary because, as the Council members discussed, under Oregon law, there were many definitions of \"conviction.\" Minutes, Oregon Criminal Justice Council, Sept. 18, 1989, 9-10. For example, a conviction could be deemed to have occurred upon pronouncement of sentence or upon entry of a sentencing order.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2210040\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/317/309/#p314\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Thus, it was important to identify at what point in another proceeding a conviction occurred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    ORS 132.560 (1987), which governed permissive joinder, provided:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n    \"The indictment must charge but one crime, and in one form only, except that:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n    \"(1) Where the crime may be committed by the use of different means, the indictment may allege the means in the alternative.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n    \"(2) When there are several charges against any person or persons for the same act or transaction, instead of having several indictments, the whole may be joined in one indictment in several counts; and if two or more indictments are found in such cases, the court may order them to be consolidated.\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Prior to the session, the only charges that could be joined under ORS 132.560 were those that were \"for the same act or transaction.\" ORS 132.560 (1987),\n    <em>\n     amended by\n    </em>\n    Or.
