IFB appeals from the district court's order of summary judgment in favor of debtors Maj-Le and Harold Bridges (the \"Bridges\"). The Bridges also cross-appeal the district court's denial of a motion to stay arbitration as to a second note between the parties. We affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Bridges began leasing land from the Idaho Department of Lands (the \"State\") in 2005, with the intent to build a cottage on the land. This land was located in McCall, Idaho and abutted Payette Lake. In 2006, the Bridges obtained a $1.5 million construction loan from IFB to build the cottage. IFB took a note and deed of trust as security for the loan, with the Bridges pledging both their interests in the lease and in any future buildings they would construct on the leased land as collateral. The Bridges built a 5,000-square foot cottage\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the leased land which was completed in 2008. In order to finish construction of the cottage, the Bridges also obtained a second loan from IFB for $150,000 which was secured by a deed of trust on property in Boise, Idaho (the \"Boise property\"). That deed of trust included both a cross-collateralization clause, and a provision mandating arbitration of any dispute between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2014, the Bridges entered into a new nine-year term lease agreement (the \"2014 lease\") with the State. This new lease contained a provision classifying buildings and structures on the leased land as \"Personal Property.\" This provision was not in the original 2005 lease agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2015, the Bridges defaulted on the note. The Bridges then tendered both the cottage and the lease to IFB. On June 19, 2015, IFB filed suit, seeking a judgment on the note without taking action to foreclose on the deed of trust. On July 10, 2015, IFB amended its complaint, clarifying that it was seeking a judgment on the note because the cottage in question was personal property, as defined by the 2014 lease between the Bridges and the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   IFB then sold the cottage and the lease, obtaining $1,200,088 in proceeds when the sale closed on September 15, 2015. Significant for purposes of this appeal, a little more than three months later, on December 18, 2015, IFB amended its complaint a second time, claiming two separate causes of action seeking a deficiency judgment in the sum of $344,377.24. The first cause of action sought a deficiency under Idaho Code section 28-9-615, with IFB continuing to maintain that the 5000-square-foot cottage was personal property; the second cause of action sought the same relief on the basis of Idaho Code section 45-1512, relative to trust deeds and real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Bridges moved for summary judgment against IFB's deficiency claims. The Bridges argued that the cottage was not personal property; thus, the claim pursuant to section 28-9-615 was erroneous. Secondarily they argued that IFB's deficiency claims were time barred because they were not filed within three months after foreclosure of the deed of trust, as required by section 45-1512.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   IFB responded that the time bar under section 45-1512 was inapplicable because: (1) the cottage under the deed of trust was personal property and; (2) the lease was substantially valueless pursuant to Idaho Code section 45-1503(2). In the alternative, IFB argued its deficiency claims were timely because its second amended complaint could relate back to the filing of its original or first amended complaints under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court granted the Bridges' motion for summary judgment, ruling that the cottage was real property and thus subject to the strictures of Idaho Code section 45-1512, which barred IFB's deficiency claims because they were untimely. The court further ruled that IFB's deficiency claims could not relate back to the filing of the original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   IFB then filed a motion for reconsideration. At oral argument on its motion, IFB proffered a new legal argument, asserting that its deficiency claims could also relate back to its original complaint under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d). The district court denied IFB's motion for reconsideration at the conclusion of the hearing. IFB timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After filing its notice of appeal, IFB notified the Bridges that it was exercising its rights under the cross-collateralization clause in the deed of trust on the Boise property, which provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   CROSS-COLLATERALIZATION....\n   <em>\n    [T]his Deed of Trust secures all obligations, debts and liabilities, plus interest thereon, of [Bridges] to [IFB]\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    as well as all claims by [IFB] against [Bridges] ... whether now existing or hereafter arising\n   </em>\n   , whether related or unrelated to the purpose of the Credit Agreement, whether voluntary or otherwise, whether due or not due, direct or indirect, determined or undetermined, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, ... whether recovery upon such amounts may be or hereafter may become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether the obligation to repay such amounts may be or hereafter may become otherwise unenforceable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Emphasis added). Thus, under this provision the Boise property served as additional collateral for the cottage loan. The Boise property deed of trust also included a mandatory arbitration provision, which IFB exercised at the same time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Bridges then filed a motion with the district court to stay IFB's demand for arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   IFB responded and the matter was heard before the district court. The court denied the Bridges' motion on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on their requested relief under Idaho Appellate Rule 13(b). The Bridges then filed a timely cross-appeal of the district court's denial of their motion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The Court recognizes that the colloquial definition of the term \"cottage\" would generally refer to a \"small one-story house\"\n    <em>\n     Cottage\n    </em>\n    , Webster's II New College Dictionary 256, (2d ed. 1999); however, structures built upon state owned land which may be leased \"by the state of Idaho primarily for recreational or homesite use by a lessee\" are known as \"Cottage sites\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Idaho Code section 39-3634 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    IDAPA 20.03.13.010.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    When reviewing the district court's ruling on a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same standard used by the district court. Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Disputed facts and reasonable inferences are construed in favor of the non-moving party. If there is no genuine issue of material fact, only a question of law remains, over which this Court exercises free review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <em>\n     Miller v.

ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     A. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    IFB argues the cottage was personal property and that the 2014 lease with the Idaho Department of Lands was substantially valueless; therefore, neither the cottage nor the lease were subject to the time limitation to bring a deficiency claim under\n    section 45-1512. We hold the district court did not err in granting summary judgment, because 1) the cottage is real property and thus falls within the purview of Idaho Code Title 45, Chapter 15; and 2) the 2014 lease was not substantially valueless.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <em>\n     1. There was no genuine issue of material fact that the cottage was real property.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Our analysis of IFB's claim of error is governed by Idaho statutory and case law. The Idaho Legislature has defined \"real property\" under Title 55, Chapter 1, which governs property and ownership, as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    1. Lands, possessory rights to land, ditch and water rights, and mining claims, both load and placer.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    2. That which is affixed to land.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    3. That which is appurtenant to land.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    I.C. \u00a7 55-101.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    IFB's right to take the Bridges' cottage as collateral arises from the deed of trust. While the State added language to the 2014 lease with the Bridges which defined the cottage as personal property, IFB and the Bridges are bound by the constraints in their relationship, as governed by the deed of trust, which is limited to conveyances of\n    <em>\n     real property\n    </em>\n    . I.C. \u00a7 45-1502(3). Indeed, the only document recorded was the deed of trust, signifying that both IFB and the Bridges understood that the cottage was real property. Additionally, the deed of trust between these parties did not define the term \"personal property\" to include buildings; instead the deed of trust defined the term \"improvements\" to include \"buildings, structures, [and] mobile homes affixed on the\n    <em>\n     Real Property\n    </em>\n    ....\" (Emphasis added, capitalization in original). Accordingly, the cottage (as a building) was characterized as an improvement affixed on the \"Real Property\" under the deed of trust. Furthermore, a secondary agreement between IFB and the Bridges to provide flood insurance also characterized the cottage as \"real property.\" These facts support the district court's conclusion that the cottage was real property.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Moreover, while we recognize the right of the parties to classify what would otherwise be real property as personal property in contracts between themselves, the State's contractual classification of a piece of property in the lease between the State and the Bridges does not supplant the contractual language between IFB and the Bridges - nor does it overcome the legal requirements set forth by this Court in\n    <em>\n     Spencer v. Jameson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070967\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/147/497/#p502\">\n     147 Idaho 497\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 502,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070967\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/147/497/#p502\">\n     211 P.3d 106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 111 (2009) and\n    <em>\n     Liberty Bankers Life Ins.

In\n    <em>\n     Spencer\n    </em>\n    , we analyzed several factors relative to determining whether a mobile home in that case was real property. Those pertinent characteristics are likewise applicable here. They included\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    (a) [a] well set-up, with pump, pressure tanks, lines; (b) septic system with inspections, and hookup to home; (c) driveway completion to county standards; (d) power lines and pedestal, with inspections and hookup; (e) mobile title in file; and (f) foundation, decks, and mobile set-up, including attachment and conversion to real property. These tasks and improvements show: (1) the mobile home was actually annexed to the realty, (2) the mobile home was appropriated to the use of that part of the realty to which the home was connected, and (3) it was Spencer's intention to make the mobile home a permanent accession to the realty.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070967\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/147/497/#p502\">\n     147 Idaho at 502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070967\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/147/497/#p502\">\n     211 P.3d at 111\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Similarly here, there is no genuine issue of material fact whether the cottage was affixed to land. Evidence shows the cottage: (a) was a 5000-square-foot structure containing 7 rooms, 4 bedrooms, and 4.5 bathrooms; (b) the cottage had a concrete foundation embedded into the ground; (c) it was designed, built, and shaped to match the slope, topography, size, and orientation of the leased land; (d) it had a partial basement and crawl space; (e) it had a driveway connected to a two-car garage; (f) it was connected to a large patio, deck, and hot tub; (g) it was connected to public utilities; and finally (h) it was connected to a local well. These factors all support the district court's conclusion that the cottage was real property as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Spencer\n    </em>\n    , we applied three general tests to determine whether personal property becomes a fixture by being attached to the\n    land: \"(1) Actual or constructive annexation to the realty; (2) Appropriation to the use of that part of the realty to which it is connected; [and] (3) Intention of the party so annexing to make the article a permanent accession to the realty.\"\n    <em>\n     Spencer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070967\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/147/497/#p502\">\n     147 Idaho at 502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070967\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/147/497/#p502\">\n     211 P.3d at 111\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Liberty Bankers Life Ins.

While there is token debate whether the cottage was ever personal property, these tests enunciated in\n    <em>\n     Spencer\n    </em>\n    likewise support our conclusion in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Bridges' sworn declarations showed they intended the cottage to be a permanent part of the leased land and had no contingency plans for its future removal. IFB's evidence before the district court did not rebut these declarations. The evidence before the district court shows that: (1) the cottage was actually annexed to the realty; (2) the cottage was appropriated to the use of that part of the realty to which the home was connected; and (3) it was the Bridges' intention to make the cottage a permanent accession to the realty. The cottage at issue is real property.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    As such, IFB's attempt to seek a deficiency judgment based on its deed of trust falls squarely within the confines of Idaho Code, Title 45, Chapter 15. Section 1503 in that chapter provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    If any obligation secured by a trust deed is breached, the beneficiary may not institute a judicial action against the grantor or his successor in interest to enforce an obligation owed by the grantor or his successor in interest unless: (a) The trust deed has been foreclosed by advertisement and sale in the manner provided in this chapter and the judicial action is brought pursuant to section 45-1512.... or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    (c) The beneficiary's interest in the property covered by the trust deed is substantially valueless as defined in subsection (2) of this section, in which case the beneficiary may bring an action against the grantor or his successor in interest to enforce the obligation owed by grantor or his successor in interest without first resorting to the security. ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    I.C. \u00a7 45-1503. Despite IFB's efforts to argue that cottage in question was personal property as defined by the 2014 lease between the Bridges and the State, the evidence is clear that the cottage was real property. IFB was required to foreclose on the real property before instituting its judicial action against the Bridges and IFB's failure to do so was erroneous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Moreover, after a deed of trust is foreclosed, a creditor has three months to file a deficiency claim (if one exists) in district court. I.C. \u00a7 45-1512. There was no genuine issue of material fact that IFB failed to bring its cause of action for deficiency until after the three-month window to do so had expired. Accordingly, it is time-barred from seeking a deficiency under the cottage deed of trust and the relation-back doctrine does not save the claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Section C below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <em>\n     2. There was no genuine issue of material fact that the lease was not substantially valueless.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    IFB contends the 2014 lease was \"substantially valueless\" pursuant to Idaho Code section 45-1503(c). As noted above, section 45-1503 prohibits a deed of trust beneficiary from \"institut[ing] a judicial action against the grantor ... to enforce an obligation owed by the grantor ... unless: (c) [t]he beneficiary's interest in the property covered by the trust deed is substantially valueless.\" I.C. \u00a7 45-1503(c). The term substantially valueless means:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    [T]he beneficiary's interest in the property covered by the trust deed has become valueless through no fault of the beneficiary, or that the beneficiary's interest in such property has little or no practical value to the beneficiary after taking into account factors such as the nature and extent of the estate in real property which was transferred in trust; the existence of senior liens against the property; the cost to the beneficiary of satisfying or making current payments on senior liens; the time and expense of marketing the property covered by the deed of trust; the existence of liabilities in connection with the property for clean up of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants; and such other factors as the court may deem relevant in determining the practical value to the beneficiary\n    of the beneficiary's interest in the real property covered by the trust deed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    I.C. \u00a7 45-1503(2).\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     First Interstate Bank of Idaho, N.A. v.

App. 1993) (finding a junior lien's property interest being extinguished by a senior lien made the junior lien substantially valueless).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The evidence is uncontradicted that IFB foreclosed its property interest in both the lease and cottage for $1,200,088. IFB subsequently filed its second amended complaint seeking a deficiency judgment of $344,377.25 arising from this foreclosure. There was no genuine issue of material fact that the lease was not substantially valueless in this case. Indeed, it was an integral part of the value of the cottage on Payette Lake. The value of the lease and the cottage thus required IFB to follow the statute and bring a deficiency claim under section 45-1512. Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing IFB's deficiency claims as time barred pursuant to section 45-1512.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     B.

Therefore, by relating back, its deficiency claims were timely filed within three months after it foreclosed on the deed of trust, as required by section 45-1512. This Court reviews a district court's determination of whether an amended pleading can relate back to an earlier filing for abuse of discretion.\n    <em>\n     Black Canyon Racquetball Club, Inc. v.

Applying this Rule, the district court found that IFB's deficiency claims (within its second amended complaint) could not relate back to IFB's prior complaints because: (1) the deficiency claim did not arise out of the same conduct, transaction or occurrence set forth in the original or first amended complaints; indeed, the prior complaints did not mention the deed of trust collateral; and (2) the deficiency claims did not accrue when the prior complaints were filed because the deed of trust had yet to be foreclosed, in violation of section 45-1503. Therefore, the district court granted summary judgment against IFB's deficiency claims.

Therefore, the district\n    court had jurisdiction under Rule 13(b)(13) to grant its motion to stay arbitration to enforce its judgment against this collateral attack. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The district court's judgment dismissed IFB's deficiency claims with prejudice as to the cottage note. IFB's demand for arbitration was not an attempt to re-litigate its dismissed deficiency claims against the Bridges. Rather, the demand for arbitration was an attempt to collect the outstanding balance on the Note by foreclosing on separate collateral covered by the Boise deed of trust. Therefore, the district court did not have jurisdiction to rule on the motion to stay arbitration under Rule 13(b)(13) because it was not a motion to enforce the court's judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Even if the district court had jurisdiction to rule on the motion, it would not have had the authority to grant it. The only ground upon which arbitration may be stayed is \"on a showing that there is no agreement to arbitrate.\" I.C. \u00a7 7-902(b) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Loomis, Inc. v. Cudahy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4402965\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/104/106/#p109\">\n     104 Idaho 106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 109,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4402965\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/104/106/#p109\">\n     656 P.2d 1359\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1362 (1982) (\"[T]he inquiry [of the district court] must be limited in scope-is there an agreement to arbitrate or is there not. It would be inappropriate to review the merits of the dispute as such would in many instances emasculate the benefits of arbitration.\"). The Bridges did not allege there was no arbitration provision within the second deed of trust and, therefore, their motion to stay arbitration should have been denied even had there been jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Written arbitration provisions are \"valid, enforceable and irrevocable.\" I.C. \u00a7 7-901. Therefore, pursuant to the arbitration provision within the second deed of trust, IFB is entitled to have an arbitrator decide if it may foreclose on the other collateral within the second deed of trust to collect the outstanding balance on the Note. The three legal arguments asserted by the Bridges in their motion to stay arbitration can be appropriately decided in arbitration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The district court did not err in dismissing the Bridges' motion to stay arbitration because it did not have jurisdiction to rule on the motion pursuant to Idaho Appellate Rules 13(b)(6) and 13(b)(13).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     E. The Bridges are not entitled to an award of attorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-120(3).\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The Bridges claim they are entitled to attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Code section 12-120(3). This code section states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    In any civil action to recover on an open account, account stated, note, bill, negotiable instrument, guaranty, or contract relating to the purchase or sale of goods, wares, merchandise, or services and in any commercial transaction unless otherwise provided by law, the\n    <em>\n     prevailing party\n    </em>\n    shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee to be set by the court, to be taxed and collected as costs.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    (Emphasis added). The Bridges are not the prevailing party in this appeal because they lost their cross-appeal. Therefore, they are not entitled to attorney fees under section 12-120(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    We affirm the judgment of the district court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Chief Justice BURDICK, Justices HORTON, BRODY and Justice pro tem WALTERS concur.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-98\">\n     In the interest of judicial economy, the Court will not reach the Bridges' argument that section 45-1512 is a statute of repose and that claims otherwise barred by statutes of repose can never be related back under Rule 15(c).\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Resolution Tr.
