While the issue presented raises many interesting questions about the availability of the defense in general assault cases, the facts of this case govern the outcome, and so we resolve it on narrower grounds. We hold a defense of property jury instruction is not available when there is a valid court order prohibiting the defendant from contacting the protected party. We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals on different grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Steven Yelovich and Faith De Armond dated for more than five years. 3 Verbatim Transcript of Proceedings (VTP) (Apr. 7, 2016) at 255; 4 VTP (Apr. 12, 2016) at 322. It is undisputed that at all times relevant to this case there was a valid court order prohibiting Yelovich from contacting De Armond. 3 VTP (Apr. 7, 2016) at 256; Ex. 1. The order forbids Yelovich from \"[c]oming near and from having any contact whatsoever, in person or through others, by phone, mail or any means, directly or indirectly\" with De Armond. Ex. 1. It also prohibited Yelovich from causing any physical harm or bodily injury to De Armond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On the day in question, Yelovich parked his car in the driveway of his son's house. 3 VTP (Apr. 7, 2016) at 258-60. He was moving boxes from the garage, and an approximately four-and-a-half-foot wood\n   fence separated him and his car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 260-61. After about an hour, Yelovich believed he saw someone through the fence, but he could not identify the person. When he went to his car, which had a broken passenger window, he saw that his cell phone and other personal belongings were missing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 264-65. He saw De Armond walking down the street, and he testified at trial that he \"knew then that she did it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 265.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Yelovich was aware that he was prohibited from contacting De Armond, but he thought the police would not arrive in time to recover his phone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 267. Although he admitted it \"was an irrational, radical move,\" he chased after her in his car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When he found her a few blocks later, he got out of his car and attempted to take her purse because he believed she had put his phone in it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 271-75. A struggle ensued, and De Armond testified that he was \"bouncing [her] off the ground.\" 4 VTP (Apr. 12, 2016) at 325. Her testimony was corroborated by a Good Samaritan who intervened. He testified that he \"saw a man straddling a female. I saw him striking her,\" and \"he was\n   lifting her up off the ground and slamming her on the ground.\" 2 VTP (Apr. 6, 2016) at 125-26, 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Both the fire department and police responded to the incident. De Armond was treated for minor injuries, including redness, bruising, and a small laceration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154-55. The responding police officer who interviewed De Armond noted she seemed intoxicated and \"[s]he had a really hard time keeping herself together.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 150.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    \u00b6 6 The State charged Yelovich with one count of felony violation of a no-contact order predicated on his assault of De Armond and one count of bail jumping. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 47-48. At trial, he argued that he was entitled to a jury instruction on defense of property because he was protecting his cell phone, which he believed De Armond had stolen. The judge refused, reasoning that Yelovich \"was acting offensively, not defensively to protect property.\" 4 VTP (Apr. 12, 2016) at 382. The judge explained,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n    I am not aware of a single case in the State of Washington or any statutory authority that would let him do that, that would let him use force to recover property under such circumstances. I am unwilling to instruct the jury that as a matter of law he could use force to get back a cell phone that he believed had been wrongly taken. The law doesn't support that.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20P.2d%20681\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The jury was then instructed that to convict Yelovich of felony violation of a no-contact order it must find each of the following elements proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n    (1) That on or about June 7, 2015, there existed a no-contact order applicable to the defendant;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    (2) That the defendant knew of the existence of this order;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    (3) That on or about said date, the defendant knowingly violated a provision of this order;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    (4)\n    <em>\n     That the defendant's conduct was an assault;\n    </em>\n    and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    (5) That the defendant's act occurred in the State of Washington.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    CP at 74 (emphasis added).

RCW 26.50.110(4). Therefore, assault is an essential element of the crime of felony violation of a no-contact order, and the State must prove it occurred beyond a reasonable doubt.\n    <em>\n     State v.

The issue we must decide is whether Yelovich is entitled to raise defense of property pursuant to RCW 9A.16.020 as an affirmative defense to the\n    assault element. We review the contested jury instruction de novo because it was decided as a matter of law, as opposed to abuse of discretion when the decision rests on the facts of the case.\n    <em>\n     Taylor v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452161\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/743/#p767\">\n     187 Wash.2d 743\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 767,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20P.3d%20517\">\n     389 P.3d 517\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2017) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Kappelman v.

The statute states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    The use, attempt, or offer to use force upon or toward the person of another is not unlawful ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    ... [w]henever used by a party about to be injured, or by another lawfully aiding him or her, in preventing or attempting\n    to prevent an offense against his or her person, or a malicious trespass,\n    <em>\n     or other malicious interference with real or personal property\n    </em>\n    lawfully in his or her possession, in case the force is not more than is necessary.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    RCW 9A.16.020(3) (emphasis added). Yelovich argues the statute provides \"a valid affirmative defense whenever assault is charged or whenever assault is an element of the charged crime,\" and therefore it may be used when the charged crime is felony violation of a no-contact order. Suppl. Br. of Pet'r at 8. However, Yelovich's position ignores the critical role of the underlying no-contact order in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    \u00b6 10 The no-contact order prohibits Yelovich from \"having any contact whatsoever\" with De Armond and expressly forbids him from \"[c]ausing or attempting to cause physical harm, bodily injury, [or]\n    <em>\n     assault\n    </em>\n    .\" Ex. 1 (emphasis added). The standard language included in the order warns Yelovich that as the restrained party, he \"ha[s]\n    <em>\n     the sole responsibility\n    </em>\n    to avoid or refrain from violating the order's provisions. Only the court can change the order upon written application.\" Ex. 1, at 2 (emphasis added). Despite this clear language, Yelovich claims that when he is protecting his property, he has the right not only to contact De Armond but also to use violent force against her, thus reducing his felony violation to a misdemeanor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b6 11 In effect, Yelovich seeks to circumvent the plain language of the order while avoiding the directive that any modifications must be made by \"written application\" to the court.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=217%20P.3d%20286\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This court rejected a similar argument in\n    <em>\n     State v. Dejarlais,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"867960\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/136/939/\">\n     136 Wash.2d 939\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20P.2d%2090\">\n     969 P.2d 90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1998). The defendant argued that the no-contact order could not be enforced because the protected party consented to the contact.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 943,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20P.2d%2090\">\n     969 P.2d 90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We held that consent \"is not only inconsistent with, but would undermine\" the legislature's intent to protect victims of domestic violence.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 944,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20P.2d%2090\">\n     969 P.2d 90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Furthermore, the court explained, allowing parties to consent to contact \"would result in a de facto modification\" of the order, despite the\n    order's terms that it can be modified only after notice to all parties and a hearing.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 945,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20P.2d%2090\">\n     969 P.2d 90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \u00b6 12 We apply the same reasoning here and decline to create an exception for defense of property because doing so is inconsistent with the plain language of the order and the legislature's policy. By the terms of the order, Yelovich has no power to engage in self-help if doing so brings him into contact with De Armond. This bright line rule ensures that victims are not left wondering whether conduct prohibited by the no-contact order might later be deemed lawful. It therefore furthers the legislature's goal to provide \"victim[s] of domestic violence the maximum protection from abuse.\" RCW 10.99.010.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \u00b6 13 In sum, Yelovich had \"sole responsibility\" for not violating the terms of a valid court order that forbids him from contacting De Armond, and so he had no authority to chase De Armond when he believed she had taken his phone.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Ex. 1, at 2. Accordingly, Yelovich is not entitled to a jury instruction on defense of property because his conduct violated the court order.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \u00b6 14 Because Yelovich was subject to a valid court order prohibiting him from contacting De Armond, we hold that Yelovich is not entitled to a defense of property jury instruction to rebut the assault element. We therefore affirm the trial court and the Court of Appeals on different grounds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    WE CONCUR:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Fairhurst, C.J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Johnson, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Madsen, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Stephens, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    WIGGINS, J. (concurring in result only)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    \u00b6 15 The majority reaches the correct conclusion in this case, but it does so for the wrong reasons. We are not asked to decide whether the protection of property can serve as a complete defense to the crime of violation of a no-contact order. It is clear that it cannot. Instead, we must decide whether defense of property can be used to rebut the single essential element of assault, which elevates the violation from a gross misdemeanor to a felony. The majority fails to apply the plain language of RCW 9A.16.020 and rewrites the law in an understandable but misguided attempt to protect victims from abusers who violate domestic no-contact orders. The majority also misapprehends the consequences of permitting a limited defense of property under the plain language of RCW 9A.16.020. The defense does not rewrite no-contact orders to justify assaults, nor does it undermine the legislature's intent to protect victims of domestic violence. Consequently, I would instead hold that an affirmative defense under RCW 9A.16.020 is generally available to rebut the element of assault in felony violation of a no-contact order. But because Steven Yelovich sought to recover rather than protect his property, the defense was not available to him in this case. Thus, I would also affirm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    I. Defense of property\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b6 16 In most circumstances, the violation of a domestic violence no-contact order is a gross misdemeanor. RCW 26.50.110(1)(a). However, if the violation involves an assault, it becomes a felony. RCW 26.50.110(4).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    \u00b6 17 Here, the State alleged that Yelovich violated a no-contact order by assault. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 3-4. Based on that charge, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    To convict the defendant of the crime of felony violation of a court order as charged in Count I, each of the following five elements of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    (1) That on or about June 7, 2015, there existed a no-contact order applicable to the defendant;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    (2) That the defendant knew of the existence of this order;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    (3) That on or about said date, the defendant knowingly violated a provision of this order;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    (4)\n    <em>\n     That the defendant's conduct\n    </em>\n    was\n    <em>\n     an assault\n    </em>\n    ; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    (5) That the defendant's act occurred in the State of Washington.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    CP at 74 (emphasis added). Thus, assault was an essential element of the crime.\n    <em>\n     State v. Oster,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103673\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/147/141/#p146\">\n     147 Wash.2d 141\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 146,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20P.3d%2026\">\n     52 P.3d 26\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2002). The jury was further instructed on the elements required to find that an assault had occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    \u00b6 18 The fact that the no-contact violation included an alleged assault elevated Yelovich's violation from a gross misdemeanor to a felony. Without the assault, Yelovich would have still been charged with violating the no-contact order, but the offense would have been a gross misdemeanor, not a felony. RCW 26.50.110. As a result, the trial court also instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of violation of a court order:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    The defendant is charged in count I with Felony Violation of a Court Order. If, after full and careful deliberation on this charge, you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, then you will consider whether the defendant is\n    guilty of the lesser crime of Violation of a Court Order.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    A person commits the crime of violation of a court order when he or she knows of the existence of a court order and knowingly violates such order.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    CP at 79-80.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \u00b6 19 Yelovich argues that he should have been able to raise a defense of protection of property to rebut the element of assault in the charge of felony violation of a no-contact order. If successful in convincing the jury on a\n    defense of property, Yelovich would have been guilty only of a misdemeanor violation of a no-contact order, not a felony violation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    \u00b6 20 Whether defense of property is a valid affirmative defense to the element of assault in felony violation of a domestic violence no-contact order is a question of first impression. To answer this question, we must interpret the language of and relationship between RCW 9A.16.020, which specifies the situations in which the use of force is not unlawful, and RCW 26.50.110, which criminalizes the violation of protection orders.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    \u00b6 21 Our first priority in statutory interpretation is to \"ascertain and carry out ... legislative intent.\"\n    <em>\n     Dep't of Ecology v.

As a result, the plain language of RCW 9A.16.020 would apply to the element of assault in felony violation of a domestic violence no-contact order. The defense, if successful, justifies only the use of force to protect property. The affirmative defense does not justify the violation of a no-contact order.

RCW 9A.16.020(3). Assault, which necessarily involves the use of force, is an essential element of the crime of felony violation of a no-contact order, RCW 26.50.110(4), and the word \"whenever\" is unambiguous-it does not exclude any context.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    \u00b6 30 In contrast, we recognized in\n    <em>\n     Dejarlais\n    </em>\n    that the misdemeanor crime of violation of a no-contact order did not address consent or any other applicable defenses.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"867960\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/136/939/\">\n     136 Wash.2d at 943\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20P.2d%2090\">\n     969 P.2d 90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Majority at 726.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    At most, the application of the defense, if found credible by a jury, would lower the crime from a class C felony to a gross misdemeanor.

First, Yelovich argues that a malicious interference with property is not complete once an owner loses possession of his or her property. Second, he argues that there is a common law right to use reasonable force to recover property, as long as the recovery is accomplished during a \"fresh pursuit.\" I address each of these arguments in turn and find neither persuasive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    <em>\n     A. Malicious interference with property\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    \u00b6 37 Yelovich first argues that malicious interference with property is incomplete when a victim discovers that his or her property has been stolen and the thief is still within sight of the victim. Neither the language of the statute nor the case law supports this position.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    \u00b6 38 First, RCW 9A.16.020(3) implies that a malicious interference with property is complete once the victim no longer has possession of the property. The statute permits a person to use reasonable force to prevent a \"malicious\n    interference with real or personal property lawfully in his or her possession.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=328%20P.3d%20886\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \"Possession\" is \"the act or condition of having in or taking into one's control or holding at one's disposal ... something owned, occupied, or controlled ....\" WEBSTER'S ,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1770.

When Yelovich used force against De Armond, he was not preventing or attempting to prevent a malicious interference with property. The property-his cell phone-had already been taken. As a result, the phone was no longer in his possession, and Yelovich was acting solely in an attempt to\n    <em>\n     recover\n    </em>\n    property.
