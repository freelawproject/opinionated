Oklahoma Bar Association (Complainant) has presented this Court with an application to approve the resignation of Brian A. Curthoys, OBA No. 12630, (Respondent) from membership in the Oklahoma Bar Association. Respondent seeks to resign pending disciplinary proceedings and investigation into alleged misconduct, as provided in Rule 8.1, Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    5 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Ch. 1, App. 1-A. Upon consideration of the Complainant's application and Respondent's affidavit in support of resignation, we find:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"decisiondate\" id=\"p-7\">\n   1. Respondent executed his resignation on July 1, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   2. Respondent acted freely and voluntarily in tendering his resignation; he was not subject to coercion or duress, and was fully aware of the consequences of submitting his resignation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   3.

John and Honey Karr; (5) Mike and Jennifer Hoel: (6) William Paul Sommer; (7) Sawhorse Investments; (8) John and Carol Sanders; and (9) Charles and Lyanna Talley. The common gravamen of each of these grievances is that Respondent failed to safekeep client funds and property. In addition, grievances (2)-(6) averred that Respondent failed to properly represent the respective clients, while grievance (9) stated Respondent failed to diligently represent the clients. Respondent has waived the right to contest the allegations set forth in these grievances and in doing so relieves the Complainant from proving professional misconduct based on said allegations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   4.

He agrees that should the Oklahoma Bar Association approve and pay such Client Security Fund claims, he will reimburse the fund the principal amount and the applicable statutory interest prior to filing any application for reinstatement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   6. Respondent recognizes and agrees he may not make application for reinstatement to membership in the Oklahoma Bar Association prior to the expiration of five years from the effective date of this Court's approval of his resignation; he acknowledges he may be reinstated to practice law only upon compliance with the conditions and procedures prescribed by Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    5 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Ch. 1, App. 1-A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n    7.
