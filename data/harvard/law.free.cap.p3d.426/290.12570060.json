The Workers' Compensation Division (the Division) appeals, contending that Mr. Lysne did not provide adequate proof that his need for the surgery is causally related to his work injury. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b62] The Division asserts one issue, which we rephrase as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Was the Commission's finding that Mr. Lysne's work injury caused his need for knee replacement surgery supported by substantial evidence and not contrary to law?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b63] On July 22, 2013, Mr. Lysne, a roofer employed by Inman Roofing, injured his left knee while carrying shingles up a ladder and onto a roof. As he stepped onto the roof with his left foot, his leg \"gave out,\" causing him pain. When his knee did not heal after a month, he visited his doctor, who prescribed pain medication and told him to treat the knee with rest, ice and elevation. Mr. Lysne's knee did not improve, and when he sought the renewal of his pain medication prescription, his doctor indicated that he would need an MRI. Mr. Lysne then filed a worker's compensation claim and received an MRI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] After reviewing the MRI, Mr. Lysne's doctor referred him to Dr. Bruce Smith, an orthopedic surgeon in Cheyenne. Dr. Smith examined Mr. Lysne on January 21, 2014, noted that he continued to experience pain,\n   and diagnosed him with chondromalacia of the left knee, medial meniscus tear, patellar malalignment syndrome, and plica syndrome of the knee. Based upon his findings, on February 6, 2014, Dr. Smith operated on Mr. Lysne's knee, performing an arthroscopic excision of the medial meniscus tear, arthroscopic chondral shaving of the patella, femoral groove, the medial femoral condyle and the lateral tibial plateau, and an arthroscopic excision of the medial plica in the knee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] Post-surgery, Mr. Lysne began physical therapy. Initially, his knee did well, but as his therapy progressed, Mr. Lysne was unable to \"work past the pain.\" Consequently, in May of 2014, Dr. Smith recommended continued physical therapy and encouraged him to seek a second opinion. In June of 2014, Mr. Lysne saw Dr. Mark McKenna, another orthopedic surgeon, who ordered a second MRI. That MRI revealed \"meniscal fraying and irritation\" and \"swelling within the soft tissue and some cartilage damage.\" On July 31, 2014, Dr. McKenna performed a second arthroscopic procedure and found \"a tear of the posteromedial meniscus in the posterior horn[,] ... loose fragments within the joint[,] ... and synovitis and scar tissue formation over the anterior aspect of the joint.\" In October of 2014, Mr. Lysne again saw Dr. McKenna and reported continued and worsening pain in the knee. Dr. McKenna gave him an intraarticular injection of pain medications in his knee to relieve his pain and suggested that Mr. Lysne undergo an MRI of his back to determine whether it was contributing to his knee problems. Based upon his review of the results of the second MRI, Dr. McKenna recommended that Mr. Lysne see a neurologist or neurosurgeon and did not think that a knee replacement would help him at that point. Accordingly, Mr. Lysne met with a neurosurgeon who ruled out his back as a cause of his knee pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b66] On January 19, 2015, Mr. Lysne saw Dr. Jean Basta, a third orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Basta concluded that Mr. Lysne had a left medial meniscus tear, a left chondromalacia patella, and internal derangement in the left knee. Dr. Basta suspected that \"he is retearing the medial meniscus because it is in a weakened state.\" Dr. Basta gave Mr. Lysne another injection in his knee and ordered him to use crutches and remain non-weight-bearing for six weeks, and, if the pain persisted, she would perform a third arthroscopic surgery at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] Four days after seeing Dr. Basta and at the direction of the Division, Mr. Lysne saw Dr. Ricardo Nieves for an independent medical evaluation and impairment rating evaluation (IME). Despite the fact that Mr. Lysne was non-weight-bearing and had just received an injection for continued pain in his left knee, Dr. Nieves concluded that he was at maximum medical improvement (MMI) and that he had sustained a 1% whole body physical impairment. On March 4, 2015, the Division determined that Mr. Lysne's workplace injury resulted in a 1% impairment of his left knee and awarded him benefits in the amount of $1,509.68. Mr. Lysne objected to this determination, arguing that the conclusion that he had reached MMI was premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b68] On March 10, 2015, at the suggestion of Dr. Edgrin, who saw Mr. Lysne for reasons unrelated to his knee, Mr. Lysne saw Dr. Charlie Yang, an orthopedic surgeon in Denver, Colorado. Dr. Yang discussed treatment options with Mr. Lysne, including a left total knee arthroplasty (replacement). Mr. Lysne indicated that he would like to pursue the surgical intervention upon obtaining worker's compensation approval. In April, Dr. Ricardo Nieves supplemented his IME evaluation, concluding that \"[i]n my professional opinion within a reasonable degree of medical probability a left total knee replacement surgery is not causally related to Mr. Lysne's work injury of 7/22/2013 in which the resulting work injury was of a medial meniscus injury.\" On April 16, 2015, the Division denied Mr. Lysne's request for the preauthorization of his total knee replacement surgery. Mr. Lysne again objected to that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b69] The Division then referred Mr. Lysne to Dr. Mark Rangitsch, a fifth orthopedic surgeon, for another IME. In his May 4, 2015 report, Dr. Rangitsch explained that \"further treatment options [ ] could help\" and suggested \"unicompartmental [partial] knee replacement.\" Subsequently, the Division referred\n   Mr. Lysne to Dr. Greg Reichardt, a physical and rehabilitation medicine specialist, for a third IME on June 23, 2015. Dr. Reichardt concluded that a total knee replacement was not reasonable and necessary medical care for his workplace injury. Two months later, on August 17, 2015, Mr. Lysne saw a sixth orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Rocci Trumper. Dr. Trumper examined Mr. Lysne and recommended a total knee replacement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b610] After a contested case hearing on Mr. Lysne's objections to the Division's determinations, the Commission reversed the Division's March 4, 2015 and April 16, 2015 determinations. The Commission found that the physical impairment rating of 1% whole body offered by the Division was premature, that Mr. Lysne was not at a level of maximum medical improvement when he was rated by Dr. Nieves, and that he should be placed back on Temporary Total Disability payments for an additional period of time, terminating in June 2015 when he resumed gainful employment. With respect to preauthorization for total knee replacement surgery, the Commission concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The hearing panel further finds that the preauthorization request for total knee replacement surgery is reasonable and necessary under the circumstances and causally related to [Mr. Lysne's] work injury and is fully compensable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Division appealed, and the district court affirmed the Commission's findings. The Division timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b611] We review an appeal from a district court's review of an administrative agency's decision as if the case came directly from the agency and give no deference to the district court.\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

Thus, Mr. Lysne had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed knee replacement surgery is causally related to his workplace incident. The Commission found that he met this burden and concluded that the proposed surgery was compensable. The Commission recognized that Mr. Lysne bore the burden of establishing causation by a preponderance of the evidence, found that \"total knee replacement surgery is ... causally related to [Mr. Lysne's] workplace injury,\" and concluded that he \"met his burden of proof in establishing that he sustained a compensable work injury.\" The Commission also concluded that Mr. Lysne's injury is \"a legitimate work injury,\" that \"Mr. Lysne obtained a poor result from two prior arthroscopic surgeries and he was continuing to receive care,\" and that knee replacement surgery is \"causally related to the work injury of 7/22/2013.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b624] On review, our task is to determine whether that decision was supported by substantial evidence. \"When the burdened party prevailed before the agency, we will determine if substantial evidence exists to support the finding for that party by considering whether there is relevant evidence in the entire record which a reasonable mind might accept in support of the agency's conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Dale,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8186024\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/188/554/\">\n    188 P.3d at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b625] Here, the record contains substantial evidence that supports the conclusion that the proposed knee replacement is causally related to Mr. Lysne's compensable injury. Mr. Lysne first began experiencing knee pain when he injured his knee on the job in July of 2013. He testified that his pain continued and worsened as he sought a variety of both invasive and conservative forms of treatment. He had two arthroscopic surgeries performed by two different orthopedic surgeons. He had injections. He underwent extensive physical therapy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet his pain continued,\n   and he never fully recovered from his injury. Two orthopedic surgeons recommended knee replacement surgery and a third recommended partial knee replacement surgery to resolve the knee pain which began when he stepped from the ladder onto the roof in July of 2013. This is substantial evidence which supports the Commission's conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hildebrant\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880842\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/875/\">\n    345 P.3d at 880-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (testimony that spinal cord stimulator can relieve back pain and that claimant's ongoing leg and back pain was at least partially attributable to his workplace injury was substantial evidence to support hearing examiner's finding of a causal connection between the workplace injury and the proposed treatment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b626] The record contains some evidence that degeneration in Mr. Lysne's knee could be an additional source of his ongoing pain. Dr. Trumper noted that Mr. Lysne \"injured his knee at work,\" and since then has \"had no significant improvement.\" He concluded that his \"history and exam would suggest that his symptoms are all degenerative in nature.\" There is no indication in the record regarding whether Mr. Lysne's workplace injury caused the degeneration or whether it came about independently.

Is the proposed surgery for left total knee replacement causally related to Mr. Lysne's work injury of 7/22/2013? Please explain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Answer: In my professional opinion within a reasonable degree of medical probability a left total knee replacement surgery is not causally related to Mr. Lysne's work injury of 07/22/2013 in which the resulting work injury was of a medial meniscus injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Dr. Nieves also opined that Mr. Lysne had reached MMI. The Division's argument centers around the MMI opinion, which was unrelated to Dr. Nieves' opinion regarding causation. In support of his conclusion that Mr. Lysne had reached MMI, Dr. Nieves wrote that \"no additional diagnostic or treatment interventions are indicated\" and that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   the negative factors against additional interventions on [Mr. Lysne] includes [sic]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 The subjective complaints are out of proportion to objective findings\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 High level of perceived disability as evident by Pain Disability Questionnaire of 132\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 Chronic smoker (one pack a day for 30 years)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 Obesity (H 5'10?, W 230, BMI 33)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 Work related injury\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 Poor response to treatment interventions (conservative and surgical).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 1 year and 3 \u00bd months out of work\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   None of these factors address causation. The Commission was critical of Dr. Nieves' evaluation because his report \"only casually noted the injection provided by Dr. Basta four days earlier and nowhere in his report did he indicate that Mr. Lysne was on crutches and had been ordered to avoid all weight bearing on the left leg.\" The Commission also found \"Dr. Nieves' report and opinion is flawed in other respects.\" The Commission referred to the above-quoted factors regarding Dr. Nieves' conclusion that Mr. Lysne had reached MMI and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The [Commission] closely listened to the testimony of Mr. Lysne and his significant other and our findings are almost completely opposite of those of Dr. Nieves. Mr. Lysne is not an obese person. He is large but sturdy and has been engaged in the heavy occupation of roofing his entire life. He testified that the bundles of shingles he was carrying up the ladder on the date of the injury was 78 pounds. We found him to be a very accurate historian, and not one who exaggerates his condition. We further discount Dr. Nieves' opinion because he failed to discuss the treatment that had been recommended by Dr. Basta just four days earlier and he had barely commenced the non-weight bearing activity that had been prescribed. Dr. Basta clearly indicated that she wanted to see him back after that period of time and would consider a third arthroscopic procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Mr. Lysne did not have an opportunity to follow Dr. Basta's advice, and the [Commission] finds that Mr. Lysne was NOT at\n   a level of Maximum Medical Improvement at the time that he was rated by Dr. Nieves. Dr. Nieves' determination that he was at MMI was premature, and failed to fully consider the treatment that had been recommended by Dr. Basta.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Mr. Lysne had undergone two surgeries, a variety of conservative treatments, including physical therapy and injections, and continued to have problems with his knee, which we find to be credible and related to the work injury. Mr. Lysne's testimony that he injured his knee during physical therapy after the first surgery provides a completely plausible explanation as to why he failed to improve after the initial surgery. Radiologic studies were not immediately provided after the incident at physical therapy, and we are left with the testimony of Mr. Lysne and [his girlfriend] that his condition worsened after the incident and his knee was again in need of surgical attention after the incident at physical therapy. The medical panel notes that such complications after surgery occur quite regularly, and appear to have occurred with Mr. Lysne's treatment, complicating his course of care and treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   We further note that Dr. Nieves is NOT an orthopedic surgeon, but rather is an occupational medicine physician, and we place higher weight on the opinions of the various surgeons in this case, who have indicated that Mr. Lysne is in need of additional treatment, including the possibility of a knee replacement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b632] Dr. Reichardt found the identical date of MMI and impairment rating as Dr. Nieves. With regard to the causation issue, Dr. Reichardt wrote that he was \"unable to support a left total knee arthroplasty being done as treatment\" for Mr. Lysne's work injury \"for the reasons outlined above in paragraph 6.\" Paragraph 6 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   6. What is your prognosis and what are your treatment recommendations? From a physiatric\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   perspective, his prognosis is guarded. He has had multiple surgeries without a good outcome to date. His knee pain and functional limitations are more that would be anticipated based on his MRI. He has underlying diabetes and significant ongoing smoking habit [sic]. He is overweight. From a physiatric perspective, it would appear appropriate for him to focus on an independent active exercise program as the primary treatment modality. Continued use of an anti-inflammatory would appear to be reasonable. It would be best to try to taper him off of his opioids, particularly within the setting of his sleep apnea and it would be appropriate for him to pursue a sleep study outside of the setting of his Workers' Compensation claim to evaluate for sleep apnea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [\u00b633] The Commission recognized that Dr. Reichardt \"concluded that the total knee arthroscopy was not warranted.\" However, like its evaluation of Dr. Nieves' reports, the majority of the Commission's findings addressing Dr. Reichardt's report expressed the Commission's concern regarding Dr. Reichardt's MMI conclusion and his impairment rating, not the causation issue, which was not expressly addressed by Dr. Reichardt. The Commission explained that Dr. Reichardt's report \"provided a fairly thorough evaluation, but he appears to have simply adopted Dr. Nieves' physical impairment rating, as well as Dr. Nieves' date of Maximum Medical Improvement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [\u00b634] There is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Commission's decision to reject the conclusions offered by Dr. Nieves and Dr. Reichardt as to causation. The Commission did not disregard the evidence contained in Dr. Nieves' and Dr. Reichardt's reports; rather, it evaluated those reports, and for valid reasons, discounted them. The Commission was entitled to give more weight to the evidence it deemed more credible and reliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Straube\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7331137\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/208/41/\">\n    208 P.3d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Burke, J., dissenting) (\"it is up to the Medical Commission, not this Court, to determine the credibility of witnesses and the weight afforded to conflicting evidence,\" noting that \"[w]e defer to the experience and expertise of the agency in its weighing of the evidence\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Southwest Wyoming Rehab.

The Commission relied upon its own observations of Mr. Lysne when he testified before it as well as the opinions of surgeons who treated and/or evaluated Mr. Lysne. Dr. Yang noted that Mr. Lysne had two failed arthroscopies and discussed the total knee arthroplasty as the alternative option to repeat injections, which have failed in the past. Dr. Rangitsch thought that Mr. Lysne was \"a candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement.\" Dr. Trumper reported that Mr. Lysne \"exhausted conservative treatment including extensive therapy, intra-articular injections and two knee arthroscopies. Based upon the pain he feels and its location, I think the most predictable procedure for him would be a total knee replacement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   [\u00b635] Our review of the record reveals that the Commission's rejection of Dr. Nieves' and Dr. Reichardt's conclusions regarding causation is not \"contrary to the great weight of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Hurley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236914\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/6/134/#p138\">\n    6 P.3d at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The role of the Medical Commission is to resolve medically contested issues through the professional expertise of health care providers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236914\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/6/134/#p138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Snyder v.

Medical evidence of causation was not required because in this instance Mr. Lysne's need for knee replacement surgery was \"immediately and directly or naturally and probably\" the result of the accident.

We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The Division argues that Mr. Lysne's statement that his knee \"popped\" during physical therapy amounted to a re-injury and thus this matter should have been analyzed under the second compensable injury rule.
