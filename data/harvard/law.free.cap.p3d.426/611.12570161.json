The Respondent's name was stricken from the Oklahoma Bar Association membership rolls on June 11, 2018, for his failure to pay the 2017 membership dues.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-7\">\n     \u00b6 2 On November 17, 2016, the Respondent entered a plea of guilty to a misdemeanor charge of Driving Under the Influence in Alabama. Respondent received a suspended sentence of 180 days and was placed on probation for 24 months. The Oklahoma Bar Association filed rule 7 disciplinary proceedings against the Respondent on May 21, 2018, based on the 2016 Alabama conviction for Driving Under the Influence. The Proof of Service shows that the Notice of Guilty plea was originally mailed to the Respondent at his official roster address in Oklahoma and returned \"Unable to Forward.\" The Notice was then sent by certified mail to the Respondent at an address in Alexander City, Alabama, and the certified mail card was returned signed by a \"Susan Barrett.\"\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-8\">\n     \u00b6 3 On May 23, 2018, this Court issued a reverse show cause order asking the Respondent to show cause, no later than June 8, 2018, why he should not be immediately suspended from the practice of law. The Order was sent to the Respondent's official roster address in Oklahoma and returned \"Unable to Forward.\" The order was then mailed to the address in Alexander City, Alabama, and was not returned.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     \u00b6 4 To this date, the Respondent has never entered an appearance or responded to the notice or this Court's show cause order mailed to him. He is in complete default in these proceedings. \"The integrity of the judicial system demands that lawyers, who are officers of the court, respect its authority.\"\n     <em>\n      State ex rel.

The OBA further stated that apart from the Respondent's failure to pay his membership dues, the OBA had not discovered any evidence that would facially demonstrate Barrett's unfitness to practice law. The OBA asked the Court to enter such Orders as it deemed appropriate.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     \u00b6 6 Rule 7.2 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Procedure provides that a certified copy of a plea of guilty, an order deferring judgment and sentence, or information and judgment and sentence of conviction \"shall constitute the charge and be conclusive evidence of the commission of the crime upon which the judgment and sentence is based and shall suffice as the basis for discipline in accordance with these rules.\"\n     <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n      5 O.S. 2011\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , ch. 1, app. 1-A (RGDP).

In this disciplinary proceeding, he has never responded or otherwise offered any explanation for his conduct. He has not requested a hearing, filed a brief, or submitted any evidence to support any mitigation of final discipline. Respondent's continued failure to pay his Bar membership dues even after his suspension, resulting in his name being stricken from the membership rolls, his complete failure to respond to these disciplinary proceedings against him, and his criminal conviction, combine to reflect adversely on the Respondent's trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     \u00b6 9\n     <strong>\n      IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n     </strong>\n     that Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Oklahoma for six months. The suspension is effective from the date of this order until March 10, 2019. Respondent's failure to respond or defend has kept the costs of this proceeding at a minimum and, therefore, no costs are assessed to Respondent.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     \u00b6 10\n     <strong>\n      IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n     </strong>\n     that the Clerk of this Court shall mail a copy of this order to the Respondent at his Official Roster Address and at his address in Alexander City, Alabama, and to the Office of the General Counsel of the Oklahoma Bar Association.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     <strong>\n      DONE IN CONFERENCE BY ORDER OF THE SUPREME COURT ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2018.\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
