We have jurisdiction under article 6, section 5(3) of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-4031 and 13-4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In August 2011, Edgar S. and his girlfriend Perla M. went to a local Baskin-Robbins to get ice cream. They saw Acuna, who had previously been Edgar's friend. In 2008, Edgar had testified against Acuna during a criminal proceeding in which Acuna was sentenced to prison. Thereafter, their relationship soured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 When Acuna saw the couple inside Baskin-Robbins, he looked at them twice, his eyes widened, and he walked toward an exit door and yelled at Edgar, \"I told you I didn't want to [expletive] see you.\" Once outside, Acuna saw Sandra P., a friend from high school, who was running errands in the same shopping complex. Acuna appeared upset while talking with Sandra, saying (about Perla) that she \"told me that she hadn't seen him, that she wasn't talking to him no more,\" and she \"lied to me,\" and (about Edgar) that \"I did prison time for him.\" Sandra offered to help Acuna, reassuring him that she would support him in a fight against Perla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 After Edgar and Perla left the Baskin-Robbins and got into Perla's car, Edgar said, \"Baby, he's coming.\" Over her right shoulder, Perla saw Acuna running and firing a gun at her vehicle. Bullets shattered the car window and struck Edgar. Edgar tried to get out of the vehicle while Acuna continued to run behind the car and shoot at Perla. Acuna then left the scene in Sandra's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Edgar sustained multiple bullet wounds, and Perla was hit in her upper back. She survived, ultimately undergoing two surgeries. Edgar died from his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 Acuna was convicted after trial of first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, discharge of a firearm at a structure, and misconduct involving weapons. The jury found two aggravating circumstances: (1) that Acuna had been previously convicted for another serious offense (the attempted first degree murder of Perla); and (2) that he murdered Edgar in retaliation for testimony in a court proceeding. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-751(F)(2), (F)(12). Considering these factors and the mitigation evidence, the jury decided that Acuna should be sentenced to death for Edgar's murder. For the other convictions, the trial court imposed concurrent prison sentences, the longest for 15.75 years, to be served consecutively to the death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

At trial, the State introduced testimony that Edgar had \"testified in a previous criminal matter against\" Acuna, that Acuna was not legally entitled to possess a firearm because \"[h]e was a prohibited possessor [and h]e had a prior felony conviction,\" that the felony conviction was for a \"lesser charge,\" and that he had been sentenced to the Department of Corrections for 2.25 years. A minute entry\n   from the previous trial, as well as a Maricopa County Superior Court affidavit (stating there was no court record showing that Acuna's right to possess a firearm had been restored following his felony conviction), and redacted copies of Acuna's prison records were all admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Under the version of Rule 13.4(a) in effect at the time of trial, the trial court was authorized, but not required, to order a severance of offenses on its own initiative when \"necessary to promote a fair determination of the guilt or innocence of any defendant of any offense.\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 13.4(a) (2011) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, \"[t]he right to severance is waived if the defendant fails to timely file and renew a proper motion for severance.\" Ariz.

It stated that the court conducted \"a Rule 403 analysis\" and found \"that the prejudicial effect of telling the jury\" about the specific charge on which Acuna was previously convicted \"outweigh[ed] its probative value.\" Although we encourage trial courts to make their 404(b) findings on the record, the record here nevertheless supports the court's ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Stated differently, not every first degree murder is committed to retaliate against or prevent a person's adverse trial testimony or cooperation in a law-enforcement investigation. The instruction provided to the jury here, as an excerpt of the full statutory provision, narrows the subclass even further, to only those defendants convicted of first degree murder of persons who testified against them in a previous court proceeding. Both the statutory provision and the provided jury instruction sufficiently narrow the aggravator to apply only to a subclass of defendants in accordance with the first of the two required criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 39 The (F)(12) aggravator also contains a common-sense core of meaning.

Unlike \"heinous\" or \"cruel,\" \"retaliation\" possesses a core meaning that an ordinary person is capable of understanding. To that end, the jury note from deliberations did not indicate a lack of understanding or confusion as to what \"retaliation\" meant, but whether the retaliation was required to be the only possible reason for the murder. The language of the (F)(12) aggravator sufficiently channels the sentencer's discretion and neither it, nor the provided jury instruction, was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 40 Acuna's third argument regarding the (F)(12) aggravator challenges the statutorily required causal relationship between the aggravator and the subsequent murder.

Miller\n   </em>\n   , where the defendant \"made several statements that he wanted to kill [the victims] because of their cooperation with the arson investigation,\" and where \"[h]e began planning and taking steps to carry out the murders shortly after he was indicted for arson.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324362\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/31/\">\n    234 Ariz. 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45 \u00b6 56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324362\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/31/\">\n    316 P.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 41 Here, the pertinent events parallel the occurrences in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Like the defendant's statements about the victims in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , Acuna made statements-indeed, immediately before the murder-about doing prison time for Edgar and not wanting to ever see him again. Although longer than the timeframe in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , here sixteen months, Acuna murdered Edgar within a relatively brief period following his release from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 42 We also find \u00a7 13-751(F)(5) and related cases instructive in determining the causal relationship for the (F)(12) aggravator.

(According to the record before us, she was not limited to only yes or no answers for the entirety of her interview.) The State argued to the trial court that defense counsel could not \"allow [the testimony] to stand.\" Defense counsel stipulated to a short statement the judge read to the jury that she was not limited to only yes or no in her answers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 47 Then, during the penalty phase, mitigation witness Arianna H. testified that she was limited to only yes or no answers in her pretrial interview. (The record here shows otherwise.) Following Arianna's testimony, the State requested that the court read an instruction or stipulation to the jury that she was not so limited in her answers. Defense counsel initially refused to so stipulate, citing the prosecutor's responsibility to be prepared to impeach, instead of relying upon a stipulation. But, when the trial court proposed an instruction similar to the one given for Sylvia Z.'s testimony, defense counsel responded, \"We are not opposing that, Judge. We are just saying it's not our responsibility,\" and further explained that \"to say it's our responsibility to fix something that should be fixed by impeachment is just not appropriate, not accurate.\" The trial court then read the following statement to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, before we get started and resume Mr. Acuna's testimony, the previous witness, [Arianna], she testified that she was required to answer questions yes or no at an interview, at a previous interview that she gave by the prosecution and the defense attorney present. She was not required to simply answer her questions yes or no, and she was given the opportunity to answer the questions. So it was not just yes or no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In closing arguments, the State argued that Arianna had lied \"under oath about her interview with the State.\" Acuna argues both that defense counsel was \"deceived into entering\" the stipulation on Sylvia Z.'s testimony and that this acquiescence was the foundation for the subsequent error with Arianna's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 48 \" Article 6, Section 27 of the Arizona Constitution prohibits judges from commenting upon evidence presented at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

So it was not just yes or no.\" This constitutes a statement of what occurred both during Arianna's testimony and during the preceding interview, devoid of opinions on or inferences from the evidence.

He focuses on the following statements in guilt-phase closing arguments: \"Neither of the sisters had any problems answering the questions posed by the defendant's lawyer. They new [sic] every answer. They didn't miss a beat, and rarely asked to have questions repeated. Compare that to how they acted on cross-examination,\" and \"We ask because the defendant wants you to stop at the manufactured testimony of Griselda and Sylvia, and we ask that you fight a little harder past that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 96 Although these statements come very close to misconduct, when taken in context, they relate to witness credibility. The prosecutor should not have highlighted Acuna's defense counsel in describing the defense witnesses' testimony, and we do not condone prosecutors appearing to accuse the defense of \"manufacturing\" testimony.
