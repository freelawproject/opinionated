Act. 3(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Olsons own property in Cochise County that is situated within the geographic boundary known as Chula Vista and is subject to certain covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&amp;Rs). Petitioner Chula Vista Homeowners Association (the HOA) is a non-profit corporation, organized pursuant to the CC&amp;Rs. In 2009, the Olsons obtained a permit\n   to build a 6,000-square-foot steel structure on the property, which they intended to be ancillary to the residence they planned to build. At some point, the Olsons determined they were financially unable to build a primary residence on the property, and obtained a permit from Cochise County that allowed them to convert the structure into a family residence. In 2011, the HOA rejected the Olsons' request for approval of their plan to convert the structure into a residence, claiming it did not comport with the CC&amp;Rs, but granted them a three-year variance, permitting them to live in the structure while they built a residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Olsons did not build another home, and, in 2015, the HOA took the position they were in violation of the CC&amp;Rs because the structure was \"nontraditional\" and was not a \"First Class Private Dwelling\" within the meaning of the CC&amp;Rs as amended in 2007. The HOA recorded a Notice of Violation of Chula Vista Protective Covenants, which it removed shortly thereafter. It filed a second Notice about a month later, stating, as it had in the initial Notice, that the purpose of the recording was to adversely affect the Olsons' \"ability to convey marketable title\" to their property. The HOA also imposed fines for the violation and denied the Olsons' appeal of its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In February 2016, the Olsons sued the HOA. In the first two counts, they sought declaratory relief, asking the court to determine that the 2007 amendment to the CC&amp;Rs was invalid because it was not signed by a sufficient number of property owners, and that the relevant section was vague, ambiguous, and unenforceable. Alleging the CC&amp;Rs are a contract, the Olsons requested attorney fees and costs pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-341.01 and 12-341. In count three of their complaint, the Olsons claimed the HOA had violated the open meeting laws under A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1804(A)(5), and requested an award of costs under \u00a7 12-341. In the final count they alleged a claim of slander of title under \u00a7 33-420(A), seeking damages pursuant to \u00a7 33-420(A), the greater of $5,000 for each plaintiff or actual damages caused by the slander of title, and attorney fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 33-420(A), \u00a7\u00a7 12-341.01 and 12-341.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 After a trial, the respondent judge entered Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law and Amended Judgment, ruling in favor of the Olsons on all counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He found the HOA had violated the open meeting laws, slandered the Olsons' title and was \"liable to Plaintiffs for damages caused by the recording, and attorney's fees an[d] costs incurred,\" adding that the action arose out of contract because CC&amp;Rs are a contract, and as the successful parties, the Olsons were entitled to attorney fees under \u00a7 12-341.01. The respondent directed the HOA to record a Notice of Removal of Violation of Protective Covenants to clear title to the Olsons' property and awarded them statutory damages in the amount of $5,000 pursuant to \u00a7 33-420(A). He also vacated the penalty the HOA previously had imposed and awarded the Olsons $318 in taxable costs and reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $35,000. The total amount of the judgment was $40,318.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The HOA filed a notice of appeal and a motion for supersedeas bond. It asserted in the motion that under Rule 7, Ariz. R. Civ. App. P., and \u00a7 12-2108, the amount of the bond had to be based on $5,318, \"which is comprised of the damages awarded to the Plaintiffs in the form of a $5,000.00 statutory penalty pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 33-420(A) and court costs.\" Relying on\n   <em>\n    City Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328159\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/37/\">\n    237 Ariz. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328159\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/37/\">\n    344 P.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    AOR Direct L.L.C. v.

The statute, like the portion of the rule that essentially mirrors it, provides that \"the amount of the bond ... shall be set as the lesser of the following: (1) The total amount of damages awarded excluding punitive damages; (2) Fifty per cent of the appellant's net worth; [or] (3) Twenty-five million dollars.\" \u00a7 12-2108(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

The language the respondent judge used in evaluating the motion on the supersedeas bond, however, suggests the respondent relied on\n   <em>\n    Desert Mountain\n   </em>\n   . Consequently, to the extent the respondent relied on that case, he erred as a matter of law and thereby abused his discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Tucson v. Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3423931\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/172/\">\n    218 Ariz. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3423931\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/172/\">\n    181 P.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2008) (court abuses discretion if it commits error of law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17 In addition, none of the other exceptions to the general rule that attorney fees are not damages applies here. The fees were awarded pursuant to statutes authorizing attorney fees, independent from what the Olsons were entitled to as damages. The respondent judge found, for example, that the HOA had violated the open meeting laws and slandered the Olsons' title, and was therefore \"liable to Plaintiffs for damages caused by the recording, and attorney's fees an[d] costs incurred.\" With respect to the claim of slander of title, \u00a7 33-420(A) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A person purporting to claim an interest in, or a lien or encumbrance against, real property, who causes a document asserting such claim to be recorded in the office of the county recorder, knowing or having reason to know that the document is forged, groundless, contains a material misstatement or false claim or is otherwise invalid is liable to the owner or beneficial title holder of the real property for the sum of not less than five thousand dollars, or for treble the actual damages caused by the recording, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney fees and costs of the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   By its plain language the statute provides for an award of damages, which is separate and distinct from the statutorily authorized attorney fees. The attorney fees the respondent awarded here were not part of the damage award of $5,000, but were a distinct part of the judgment, authorized by that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 The Olsons contend, as they did below, that the Notice of Violation and the resulting slander-of-title claim is \"akin to a provisional remedy\" and, like a claim for wrongful writ of attachment or injunction, is an exception to the general rule that attorney fees are not damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coggins v. Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1231982\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/22/217/#p219\">\n    22 Ariz.

But the Olsons' claim was purely statutory. And as we noted above, \u00a7 33-420(A) contains express provisions for determining damages and separately authorizes the award of attorney fees. Based on the plain language of that statute, we therefore reject this argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stauffer v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856819\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/22/\">\n    233 Ariz. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856819\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/22/\">\n    308 P.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2013) (finding language in \u00a7 33-420(A)\"unambiguous\" and therefore applying plain meaning without statutory interpretation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 19 Similarly, the respondent judge found the action arose out of contract because CC&amp;Rs are a contract,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucson Estates Prop. Owners Ass'n v. McGovern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311808\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/52/\">\n    239 Ariz. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311808\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/52/\">\n    366 P.3d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2016), and that \u00a7 12-341.01 therefore permitted him to award the Olsons' their attorney fees. But the fact that the statute permitted the award does not make them damages as the Olsons suggest. They assert, too, that the respondent correctly found they had incurred the fees to protect their interest due to the HOA's breach of the contract. But even assuming attorney fees can be damages in certain circumstances resulting from a breach of contract, the Olsons did not bring a breach-of-contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20 Moreover, the Olsons' assertion suggests that like the respondent judge, they are impliedly relying on\n   <em>\n    Desert Mountain\n   </em>\n   , which, as we have found, is inapposite. And as previously pointed out, the fees awarded here were incurred in connection with this action, based on the claims alleged and on which the Olsons prevailed. There was no third-party litigation and none of the claims constitutes an exception to the general rule that attorney fees are not damages. The judgment itself distinguishes between the damages awarded under \u00a7 33-420(A) and the attorney fees awarded under that statute and \u00a7 12-341.01. Although authorized under the latter statute and part of the judgment, the attorney fees were not awarded as damages for any of the Olsons' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Disposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21 We conclude the respondent judge erred by including the attorney fees he awarded the Olsons in the supersedeas bond under \u00a7 12-2108 and Rule 7, Ariz. R. Civ. App. P. We therefore vacate the respondent's order setting the bond and direct him to enter an order consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Although the Olsons prevailed on all claims, the respondent judge ordered them to complete certain upgrades on their residence within twelve months, presumably pursuant to the HOA's counterclaim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Although not relevant here, the rule and the statute permit the trial court to increase this presumptive amount if the appellant is dissipating assets to avoid paying the judgment or lower it if requiring the appellant to pay that amount will cause the appellant substantial economic harm. \u00a7 12-2108(B), (C) ; Ariz. R. Civ. App. P. 7(a)(5).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
