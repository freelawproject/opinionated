DeLeon, Jason Kingery, and Steve Paul Beck (collectively, Plaintiffs) each filed suit against BNSF Railway Company (BNSF) in Montana's Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, for injuries allegedly sustained while working for BNSF in states other than Montana. BNSF moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims for lack of personal jurisdiction. The District Court granted BNSF's motions to dismiss and each Plaintiff appealed. We address the following issue in Plaintiffs' consolidated appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Does a company consent to general personal jurisdiction in Montana when it registers to do business and voluntarily conducts business activities in Montana?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We conclude a company does not consent to general personal jurisdiction by registering to do business in Montana and voluntarily conducting in-state business activities. We therefore affirm the District Court's orders granting BNSF's motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Plaintiffs each filed Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) negligence claims against BNSF in Montana's Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County. BNSF is a rail carrier incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Texas. BNSF does business in Montana: it has 2,061 miles of railroad track in Montana; employs approximately 2,100 workers in Montana; maintains an\n   automotive facility in Montana; and generates less than 10% of its total revenue in Montana.\n   <em>\n    BNSF Ry.

In June 2013, plaintiff DeLeon, a Texas resident, filed to recover for injuries he allegedly sustained while working for BNSF in Texas. In January 2014, plaintiff Beck, a Texas resident, filed to recover for injuries he allegedly sustained while working for BNSF in Texas. Thereafter, Plaintiffs' cases followed substantially similar procedural paths.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 BNSF moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs responded to BNSF's motions to dismiss, maintaining Montana had personal jurisdiction over BNSF because the rail carrier consented to general personal jurisdiction in Montana when it registered to do business and subsequently conducted in-state business activities. The District Court determined BNSF did not consent to personal jurisdiction in Montana and accordingly dismissed Plaintiffs' claims for lack of personal jurisdiction.

Consent jurisdiction is an independent basis for jurisdiction. Therefore, our standard two-step personal jurisdiction analysis is not applicable where neither general nor specific personal jurisdiction exists under M. R. Civ.

Where personal jurisdiction is premised upon consent, a defendant's due process rights are satisfied because it is just and fair to require\n   a defendant to defend a suit in a forum to which it previously agreed.

It permits a court to obtain\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   personal jurisdiction over a defendant-it is not limited to one case or\n   one contract.

Because a foreign corporation must comply with Montana's registration requirements to lawfully do business in Montana, the implication of\n   Plaintiffs' legal theory is that every foreign corporation lawfully conducting business in Montana consented to general personal jurisdiction when it registered to do business in the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 Montana's registration statutes clearly distinguish between service of process and the scope of personal jurisdiction. To transact business in Montana, a foreign corporation must obtain a certificate of authority to do business in the state. Section 35-1-1026(1), MCA. To obtain a certificate of authority, a foreign corporation must appoint a registered agent for service of process. Section 35-1-1028, MCA (application for certificate of authority); \u00a7 35-7-105, MCA (appointment of registered agent); \u00a7 35-7-113, MCA (service of process on entities). However, Montana's registration statutes specifically provide that the appointment of a registered agent \"does\n   <em>\n    not by itself\n   </em>\n   create the basis for personal jurisdiction over the represented entity in this state.\" Section 35-7-115, MCA (emphasis added). This express jurisdictional limitation appropriately ensures that service of process and the scope of personal jurisdiction remain separate legal concepts. Nothing puts a corporation on notice that, by appointing a registered agent to receive service of process in Montana, it is consenting to general personal jurisdiction in Montana. In fact, the statute explicitly tells corporations that they are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   subject to personal jurisdiction in Montana based solely on their appointment of a registered agent. Section 35-7-115, MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20 Plaintiffs argue \u00a7 35-7-115, MCA, simply prohibits finding jurisdiction based on registration \"by itself,\" and that the combination of (1) registering to do business in Montana and (2) actually conducting business activities in Montana constitutes consent to general personal jurisdiction. They contend a 2011 decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,\n   <em>\n    King v.

If a corporation consents to general personal jurisdiction by registering to do business in Montana, then the corporation has no genuine, meaningful choice to not consent to jurisdiction, aside from refraining from doing business in Montana. Reading our registration statutes to confer general personal jurisdiction over foreign corporations would swallow the Supreme Court's due process limitations on the exercise of general personal\n   jurisdiction, and we accordingly refuse to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 24 We also recognize that adopting registration-based consent to general personal jurisdiction would render our long-arm statute's specific personal jurisdiction provisions superfluous. M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(1)(A) provides that a corporation is \"subject to the jurisdiction of Montana courts as to any claim for relief arising from ... the transaction of any business within Montana.\" If a corporation is subject to general personal jurisdiction based on its registration to do business and subsequent in-state business activities, M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(1)(A) would be unnecessary-a corporation lawfully conducting business activities in Montana would be subject to personal jurisdiction in Montana based on claims arising from its transaction of business anywhere, not only in Montana. We cannot harmonize our long-arm statute's specific personal jurisdiction provisions with Plaintiffs' proposed registration-based consent to general personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 25 In light of Montana's registration statutes and the constitutional limitations on the exercise of general personal jurisdiction, we conclude that registering to do business in Montana and subsequently conducting in-state business activities does not amount to consent to general personal jurisdiction in Montana. BNSF's contacts to Montana are not significant enough to render it at home for purposes of general personal jurisdiction, Plaintiffs' claims do not arise from BNSF's activity in Montana for purposes of specific personal jurisdiction, and BNSF did not consent to personal jurisdiction in Montana. Construing BNSF's motion to dismiss in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs and taking all well-pleaded allegations as true, it appears beyond doubt that no set of facts supports Plaintiffs' claims for relief because BNSF is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Montana on Plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckles\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court's orders granting BNSF's motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims for lack of personal jurisdiction and find the court did not error by denying Plaintiffs jurisdictional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 26 Finally, we address Plaintiffs' arguments that BNSF is judicially, collaterally, and equitably estopped from denying it consented to personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs reason that BNSF should be estopped from denying jurisdiction because BNSF consented to personal jurisdiction in Montana in past litigation and because Plaintiffs have spent significant resources litigating their cases up to this point. Those arguments are unpersuasive. BNSF is free to waive its due process protections and consent to personal jurisdiction in any case in which it chooses. The fact that BNSF may have consented to personal jurisdiction in the past does not necessitate it to do so now.

While it is unfortunate that Plaintiffs will have to re-litigate their claims in other jurisdictions, Plaintiffs initially chose to file their claims in Montana state court, thus subjecting their claims to the possibility that they could be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. Finding that BNSF is estopped from denying jurisdiction would violate the constitutional rights the Legislature sought to protect by disallowing registration-based\n   consent jurisdiction, and we accordingly decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 27 Based on Montana's registration statutes and the constitutional due process limitations on personal jurisdiction, a foreign corporation does not consent to general personal jurisdiction in Montana when it registers to do business in Montana and then voluntarily conducts in-state business activities. Accordingly, BNSF did not consent to general personal jurisdiction by registering to do business in Montana and voluntarily conducting in-state business activities. Further, BNSF is not estopped from denying it consented to personal jurisdiction. The District Court's orders granting BNSF's motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   JIM RICE, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Legislature adapted \u00a7 35-7-115, MCA, from the Model Registered Agents Act (Model Act).
