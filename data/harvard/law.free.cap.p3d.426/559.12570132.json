J.S.'s father reported that A.R., age ten, had performed oral sex on J.S. without consent. The case was assigned to a JCSO deputy, who filed an incident report. The JCSO deputy did not conduct a forensic interview but did forward the report to the Jefferson County Attorney's Office. Jefferson County\n   appointed a special deputy prosecutor, Steven Shapiro, to evaluate whether to file a delinquency petition. After reviewing the incident report, Shapiro concluded the report established probable cause to believe that A.R. committed the crime of sexual intercourse without consent, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. Shapiro signed an Affidavit, attached to his Motion for Leave to File Petition, attesting to this. The District Court determined there was sufficient probable cause and granted the Motion. Jefferson County brought delinquency proceedings against A.R., and A.R. was arraigned. A forensic interview of J.S. was conducted, and it was determined that the allegations against A.R. were greatly exaggerated. The delinquency proceedings against A.R. were then dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 On March 30, 2015, the Renengers, A.R.'s parents, filed an amended complaint against Shapiro, the State,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Jefferson County, which included an action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   seeking damages based on an alleged violation of A.R.'s constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and a restriction of\n   A.R.'s liberty without due process; a\n   <em>\n    Dorwart\n   </em>\n   claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and a malicious prosecution claim. The Renengers alleged that Shapiro signed the probable cause Affidavit with reckless disregard for whether the allegations contained within the Affidavit were false. The State and Shapiro moved to dismiss on grounds of absolute prosecutorial immunity. On October 26, 2015, the District Court granted the Motion to Dismiss. The Renengers also filed a negligence claim against Jefferson County, alleging the County had a duty to avoid affirmative acts that would foreseeably cause harm. Jefferson County moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the public duty doctrine barred the Renengers' claims. On June 9, 2017, the District Court granted Jefferson County's Summary Judgment Motion. The Renengers appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 We review de novo a district court's ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to M.

More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Bassett v.

Finding no duty owed, the District Court did not address the merits of the Renengers' argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b628 The Renengers argue the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Jefferson County. The Renengers argue their case involves an affirmative act by a public official that harmed A.R. and rendered the public duty doctrine inapplicable. Specifically, they contend that JCSO personnel negligently forwarded A.R.'s case on to the County Attorney's Office to initiate proceedings before adequately investigating J.S.'s father's allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b629 Jefferson County counters that JCSO personnel's act of sending its case file to Shapiro is not an act which negates application of the public duty doctrine. Moreover, the act which the Renengers allege caused them damages was the actual filing of the delinquency petition by Shapiro on behalf of the State. Shapiro was not obligated to file the petition upon receipt of the JCSO's file. Thus, Jefferson County did not take an affirmative act against the Renengers that rendered the public duty doctrine inapplicable. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b630 Although public officials can be held liable for negligence committed on the job, any act of alleged negligence must be analyzed within the context of the official's job and daily duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bassett\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18, 22-23, 28. The process of investigating and passing along evidence to a prosecutor, or county attorney, is a regular function JCSO personnel do as part of their mandate to protect and secure the general public welfare.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21 ;\n   <em>\n    Gatlin-Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. The choice to pass along the incident report detailing allegations against A.R. is exactly the type of discretionary decision to which the public duty doctrine was intended to apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b631 Further, the heart of the Renengers' argument is that JCSO failed to do the proper due diligence prior to passing along the incident report to the County Attorney's Office. JCSO personnel failed to conduct a forensic interview and failed to delve a little deeper into the legitimacy of the allegations against A.R. The failure to conduct a forensic interview, though not required by statute or regulation, is not an affirmative act, but rather an omission. The Renengers' proposed expansion of what constitutes an affirmative act by law enforcement would render the public duty doctrine meaningless, as any person charged with a crime would necessarily be harmed when evidence was passed along to county attorneys and charges were filed. Additionally, as JCSO points out, Shapiro was not obligated to file a petition initiating proceedings against A.R. based on the JCSO report, and the\n   District Court was not obligated to conclude there was sufficient probable cause in Shapiro's Affidavit to proceed with filing a delinquency petition against A.R. Numerous intervening procedural steps and decisions by multiple governmental entities occurred between JCSO's initial investigation to the initiation of delinquency proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b632 Even if JCSO's action of forwarding the report on for further investigation was not an action precluded from liability by the\n   public duty doctrine, there is no evidence to suggest JCSO personnel behaved in a negligent manner. JCSO personnel did not conduct a forensic interview prior to sending the report to the County Attorney's Office. However, as previously discussed, JCSO was under no statutory or regulatory obligation to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has affirmed numerous cases prosecuted to verdict based only on a victim or other complaining witness's statement.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
