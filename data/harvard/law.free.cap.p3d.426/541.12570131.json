Montana State University\n   </em>\n   , Cause No. DDV-2012-906, Montana First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, the Honorable James P. Reynolds, presiding. By order filed April 11, 2018, the District Court summarily adjudicated liability against MSU on Plaintiff Breanne Cepeda's asserted negligence claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as an evidence spoliation sanction pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 37(e). MSU asserts that the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law and petitions for supervisory control and reversal of the sanctions order. Upon consideration of MSU's petition, Cepeda's response, and the pertinent facts of record, we find that exercise of supervisory control is necessary and proper and accordingly reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    1. Whether exercise of supervisory control is necessary and proper in this case?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in imposing default judgment as an evidence spoliation sanction pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 37(b)-(c) and (e) ?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2006, MSU hired Shuichi Komiyama as a teaching professor in the Music Department of the MSU College of Arts and Architecture (A&amp;A). At pertinent times, Komiyama was also the Director of the MSU Orchestra and Jazz Band. Incident to those duties, Komiyama developed and administered an informal group of hand-picked students known as his Assistant Conductors group. Komiyama often worked\n   separately with students of the group and chaperoned them on out-of-town and overnight road trips with little or no administrative oversight. Evidence exists that Komiyama also incidentally fraternized with them socially in public and private settings, including his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 2008, Cepeda was an MSU music student when she became a member of Komiyama's Assistant Conductors group. Like other members of the group, Cepeda subsequently developed a relatively close and informal relationship with Komiyama in the various educational and incidental social settings that were typical of the group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Evidence exists that, in 2009, a male member of the group (Student M) fell out of favor with Komiyama. In or about November 2009, in response to perceived negative treatment from Komiyama, Student M ultimately complained to the Head of the Music Department (Alan Leech) who recommended that he submit a written complaint to Assistant A&amp;A Dean Heather Bentz. Evidence exists that, in December 2009, upon receipt of an email complaint, Bentz interviewed Student M and then consulted about the matter with Glenn Puffer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who subsequently directed Leech to have \"a serious talk\" with Komiyama and to continue to monitor his conduct. After further communication with Bentz, Leech spoke with Komiyama and followed up with a corrective counseling letter on March 2, 2010. Leech's corrective counseling letter and various preserved email communications referencing Student M, Bentz, and Leech reflect MSU's handling of the Student M complaint. Bentz left MSU's employ two months later in May 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Soon after resolution of the Student M complaint, Leech became aware of additional unprofessional conduct by Komiyama toward music students and faculty. A timeline subsequently prepared by Leech\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and attached to his deposition in the underlying matter recounts Leech's view that Komiyama \"was still causing much friction in his dealings with [f]aculty and [s]tudents.\" Leech noted that, after gaining tenure in September 2010, Komiyama had \"started to be more blatant with his transgressions with students (particularly in the MSU Orchestra)\" and\n   disrespectful toward other faculty members. Leech's timeline further recounted that, in or about October 2010, he received an email from the conductor of the Bozeman Symphony forwarding him a link to an Internet article regarding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a California case in which a person named Komiyama was accused of some sort of sexual transgression with a high school student. There was no statement as to whether there was a conviction contained in the notice and [Leech] could find nothing further online at the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Leech recounted that \"[i]t seemed likely that this was our [Komiyama], but since it was just an Internet reference, and from about 20 some years in the past, I could not really act on it in clear conscience.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 Leech's timeline reflects that he \"started to compile a file\" on Komiyama in December 2010 \"to take to the MSU legal office\" regarding \"various complaints and information\" regarding Komiyama's \"questionable activities.\" Leech noted that, in or about January 2011, Music Department Professor Sara Biber told him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   about a couple of female students who had talked with her about uncomfortable situations with [Komiyama]. The students wanted to remain anonymous and would not come directly to [Leech] with the accusations, so [Leech] suggested that [Biber] take them to the MSU attorney's office where they could talk directly with [MSU's] female attorneys ... [Biber later advised] that unfortunately, they refused to go.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Leech's timeline further reflects that he had also heard unconfirmed rumors of Komiyama offering alcoholic beverages to students at his home. Leech recalled that, on February 18, 2011, Student M's father called Leech and advised that he had personally observed Komiyama offer alcoholic beverages to students in his home when the father was there in the company of his son during a visit. Leech further recalled that, in late February 2011, he also:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   heard from a high school teacher in Bozeman that [Komiyama] had been accused of 'sexting' high school girls while engaged in public school coaching in Billings [earlier that month]. The Billings high school administration would not allow him to come into their schools again. [Leech] called the Billings Music\n   Supervisor, Rob Wells[,] to discuss this and asked him if he would please send [Leech] a letter outlining the accusation. ... [Leech] subsequently also made a phone call to the Orchestra Director at the Billings school where the incident took place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 23, 2011, Leech met with MSU's in-house legal counsel (Leslie Taylor and Pam Merrell)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to discuss his knowledge and concerns about Komiyama's unprofessional conduct toward students and faculty. Leech noted that counsel advised him to report back after further documenting his concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 7 Leech's timeline reflects that, on March 8 or 9, 2011, he again spoke with Komiyama about his continuing concerns regarding Komiyama's unprofessional conduct. Leech recalled that Komiyama rebuffed him, which Leech subsequently reported \"to the Dean.\" Leech's timeline notes that, in mid-March 2011, he first heard \"rumors\" of Komiyama \"partying in a semi-undressed condition in his room with students\" at an educational convention in Missoula on October 10, 2010, but that \"no student had, or would, come forward with personal testimony about the actual events.\" However, in late March 2011, \"[s]everal students finally came forward ... willing to testify about the problems they were having\" with Komiyama. Leech interviewed those students and kept notes of the interviews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 8 According to Leech's timeline, Cepeda contacted him on April 1, 2011, while on a break from student teaching in Denver. Leech recounted that Cepeda \"verbally described [Komiyama's] offensive actions and [an] eventual rape\" and \"promised to send a signed letter.\" Leech advised her to call the police, and promised that he would \"act with MSU legal office backing as soon as [Leech] had her letter in hand.\" The timeline notes that on April 6, 2011, Leech separately received a letter from the Billings School District Human Resource Officer confirming that the District had banned Komiyama from Billings schools following its investigation of the February 2011 sexting incident. On April 8, 2011, Leech received a follow-up email from Cepeda documenting her complaints about Komiyama, specifically including the allegation that he subjected her to non-consensual sexual intercourse at his home in or about November 2010. Both Leech's timeline and the affidavit of MSU counsel Leslie Taylor reflect that Leech immediately delivered the entirety of his compiled\n   documentation regarding Komiyama to MSU counsel. The\n   documentation included Cepeda's email, other email communications, signed statements from MSU music students, correspondence from the Billings School District, and Leech's notes regarding various student interviews and related matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 9 Leech's timeline further reflects that, on April 14, 2011, the Music Supervisor of the Bozeman Public Schools emailed him a link to an Internet story \"about a [Shuichi] Komiyama in California who had been charged with sexual\" misconduct. The timeline notes that Leech immediately forwarded the email to counsel Taylor and that the link was to the same Internet story that he first saw in late February 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 15, 2011, Leech retired from MSU as previously planned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 10 After receiving the Leech materials on April 8, 2011, Taylor excluded Komiyama from campus the next business day pending further investigation. At Taylor's direction, MSU's information technology (IT) personnel immediately preserved Komiyama's MSU email account, deleted his access to the MSU system, and later removed and preserved the hard drive from Komiyama's office computer for imaging. On April 14, 2011, the President of MSU directed MSU Title IX Officer Diane Letendre to investigate the various allegations and issues raised by the Leech materials. Letendre and associate MSU legal counsel Merrell subsequently conducted a comprehensive internal investigation culminating in a thirty-page Investigation Report, dated July 22, 2011. The report recounts that the investigators interviewed Cepeda, Komiyama, seven MSU staff and faculty members, three public witnesses, a parent of an MSU student, and a number of students who had been Komiyama music students (including Assistant Conductors), who had complained about Komiyama, who had requested interviews, or who MSU investigators identified as possible witnesses. The report noted that investigators also obtained copies of emails from Cepeda regarding communications between her and Komiyama and that the Billings School District had similarly \"provided copies of interview notes and text messages\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   between Komiyama and the Billings High School student involved in the February sexting incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11 During the pendency of MSU's internal investigation, Cepeda served a written notice on the Tort Claims Division of the Montana Department of Administration stating her intent to file a legal claim for damages against MSU based on Komiyama's conduct toward her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under a cover letter dated May 26, 2011, the Tort Claims Division forwarded a copy of the notice to MSU.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 15, 2011, counsel Merrell emailed a records preservation notice to Susan Agre-Kippenham, the recently departed or outgoing A&amp;A Dean; Joseph Fedock, the new A&amp;A Dean; Gregory Young, the new head of the Music Department after Leech retired in May 2011; and Carole McLean, a music department administrator. The notice advised that \"it is possible that some party will sue MSU in relation to the [Shuichi] Komiyama Investigation\" and \"I am required under the law to make sure that we do not inadvertently destroy information related to potential lawsuits.\" The notice accordingly instructed the recipients to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   save all correspondence (including voicemail, email, videos, etc.) you or others in the college or music department may have with Komiyama or his students, and that you take steps to assure it is not destroyed. You must treat any other documents related to Komiyama and his students similarly and make sure that you and all others with such documents retain the documents and that they are not destroyed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   This includes electronic correspondence or documents of any type, including email, word processing, calendars, voice messages, videos, photographs, information in your cellphones, including texts, etc. ... If you have any such documents you may send them to [Merrell] for safekeeping, if you wish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 12 On August 11, 2011, Cepeda filed a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim (i.e., gender discrimination claim) against MSU with the Human Rights Bureau of the Montana Department of Labor and\n   Industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cepeda settled the sexual harassment claim seven months later by accepting an offer of judgment from MSU. On October 9, 2013, almost two and a half years after the completion of MSU's internal investigation, Cepeda commenced the underlying District Court litigation by filing a claim alleging that MSU negligently hired or supervised Komiyama and that MSU's negligence caused Cepeda to suffer harm in the form of non-consensual sexual intercourse allegedly inflicted on Cepeda by Komiyama on November 8 or 9, 2010. In September 2015, the District Court heard oral argument on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, discovery sanctions, and preliminary evidentiary rulings. Two and a half years later, on April 11, 2018, the court granted Cepeda's sanctions motion and adjudicated liability against MSU as a spoliation sanction pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 37(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 13\n   <em>\n    1.

If the District Court did not abuse its discretion, exercise of supervisory control will promptly and efficiently affirm the ruling, thereby eliminating that cloud over the remaining litigation and settlement prospects and clearing the deck for efficient and\n   unencumbered determination on the merits of the claim as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 17 Because the remaining course of litigation dramatically pivots on a discovery sanction, the issue in this case is not akin to a typical assertion of error on a summary judgment ruling where the losing party had a full and fair opportunity to either preclude summary judgment or prevail by making a sufficient factual or legal showing on the available evidence. It similarly varies from a typical assertion of an evidentiary error that may or may not be significant in the hindsight of the trial evidence. Here, a trial truncated to adjudication of causation and damages will invariably involve presentation of the evidence pertinent to liability in order to prove the necessary chain of causation and damages. In addition to altering the scope of trial and the parties' presentation for trial, the court's ruling will also dramatically affect the parties' settlement negotiations by significantly tipping the scales to one side on discretionary procedural grounds rather than on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 18 We have previously found exercise of supervisory control necessary and proper where the ruling at issue dramatically affects the cost and scope of trial preparation and presentation and also significantly alters the dynamic of settlement negotiations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stokes v.

Contrary to Cepeda's assertion, review of the District Court's sanctions order is not dependent on an undeveloped factual record or determination of genuine issues of material fact within the domain of the fact finder. Based on the nature of the issue and the sanction imposed, the pertinent factual record is currently as developed as it is going to be and will be unaffected by the\n   remaining course of litigation in any event. As in\n   <em>\n    Stokes I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Truman\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Plumb\n   </em>\n   , judicial economy and the avoidance of unnecessary procedural complication warrant the exercise of supervisory control to avoid substantial injustice in the form of undue cost, delay, and a dramatically-altered\n   settlement dynamic. We hold that exercise of supervisory control is necessary and proper because this case presents a significant question as to whether the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law which, if uncorrected prior to final judgment, will likely cause significant injustice rendering ordinary appeal inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19\n   <em>\n    2.

The sanctions order specifically pertained to unpreserved emails associated with the MSU email accounts of Komiyama, Komiyama music students, and former MSU employees Leech, Bentz, Agre-Kippenham, and Letendre. Though it did not make particularized findings of fact and conclusions of law, the District Court characterized the unpreserved email information as potentially relevant to substantiate Cepeda's assertion that MSU was or should have been\n   aware, no later than the 2009 Student M complaint, that Komiyama posed a risk of subjecting his students to sexually-oriented tortious conduct rather than sometime between the end of 2010 and Spring 2011 as asserted by MSU. The District Court was particularly troubled by what it characterized as MSU's \"systematic removal of all email accounts of its professors, students, and Komiyama,\" thus allowing MSU to \"create a void of communications\n   between\" those individuals \"save for what MSU alone determined to keep.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 30 MSU made an unrebutted evidentiary showing regarding the routine operation of its email server, personal computer systems, and non-litigation-related IT management practices. IT personnel routinely deleted employee email accounts from the MSU email server upon termination of employees from MSU. Prior to redeployment, IT personnel similarly deleted any personal email and files left behind on computers previously assigned to departed faculty. Deleted emails were nonetheless briefly recoverable from the MSU email server and personal computer storage media until automatically overwritten by system demands in the ordinary operation of those systems. Pursuant to the ordinary, non-litigation-related operation and administration of MSU's IT systems, any residual emails still present on the MSU email server or faculty-assigned computers in relation to a faculty email account were usually irrecoverably lost within a short time after the employee left MSU.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 31 As a matter of law, MSU had a duty to interrupt its routine IT operations and practices if and when it became reasonably foreseeable that it would likely be subject to an adverse legal claim based on Komiyama's sexually-oriented conduct toward Cepeda or other music students. Upon such occurrence, the duty required MSU to preserve any then-existing faculty and student email communications that would likely be relevant, or reasonably likely to lead to discovery of information relevant, to such claim or related defense. Based on the June 15, 2011 records preservation notice, the District Court found that MSU \"was on notice that litigation was foreseeable concerning Komiyama and his relationships with his students.\" We agree. MSU thereafter had a duty to preserve any then-existing email communications relevant to, or reasonably likely to lead to discovery of information relevant to, sexually-oriented conduct by Komiyama toward Cepeda or other music students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 32 However, Assistant A&amp;A Dean Bentz left MSU over a year before MSU received Cepeda's tort claim notice and MSU's subsequent issuance of the related records preservation notice on June 15, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Based on MSU's unrebutted showing, there is no evidentiary basis upon which to reasonably conclude or suspect that emails associated with Bentz's email account, other than those preserved by MSU and subsequently disclosed to Cepeda, still existed on the MSU email server or Bentz's office computer on June 15, 2011. Thus, contrary to the District Court's implicit finding, MSU's failure to preserve the email account or office computer files of Assistant A&amp;A Dean Bentz did not constitute a breach of a preservation duty because the duty did not arise until over a year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 33 More troublesome is MSU's failure to preserve all emails associated with the email accounts of Leech, Agre-Kippenham, Letendre, and Komiyama music students other than Cepeda, that may have existed on the MSU email server or faculty computers on June 15, 2011. Apart from an unverifiable, self-serving showing that they likely contained no relevant information other than as referenced in emails retained pursuant to its internal investigation, MSU's affidavit showings, through in-house counsel, were at best vague or ambiguous as to when unpreserved emails associated with the MSU accounts of Leech, Agre-Kippenham, and Letendre were in fact irrecoverably lost. Further, other than a showing that Komiyama and Cepeda primarily, if not exclusively, communicated by private email, MSU made no particularized evidentiary showing in response to Cepeda's sanctions motion as to whether and to what extent, if any, emails associated with MSU email server accounts assigned to Komiyama music students would still have been present on the MSU server on June 15, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Though Leech and Agre-Kippenham retired in May 2011, MSU's measured evidentiary showing and arguments evince tacit acknowledgment that it did not preserve all of the emails associated with the MSU accounts of Leech, Agre-Kippenham, and then-still-active Letendre that existed on June 15, 2011. Substantial evidence thus supports the District Court's finding that MSU retained only the\n   faculty and student emails that it deemed relevant to its internal investigation. Based on MSU's vague and ambiguous evidentiary showing, we cannot say that the District Court's implicit finding-that MSU breached a duty to take reasonable action to preserve information at least potentially relevant to a reasonably foreseeable adverse claim-was clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 34 However, the balance of the District Court's sanctions analysis is more problematic. Without any predicate finding, the court insinuated that MSU failed to preserve the entirety of the subject faculty and student emails in bad faith, i.e., with the intent or purpose of concealing unfavorable evidence. Except for disputable evidence of a breach of a duty to preserve the entirety of music department faculty and student emails, neither the District Court nor Cepeda have cited any non-speculative direct or circumstantial evidence indicating that MSU knowingly failed to preserve any potentially relevant student or faculty email communications with the purpose or intent of concealing unfavorable evidence. To the contrary, MSU's failure to preserve occurred in the midst of MSU's own aggressive investigation of Komiyama at a time when the decision to reinstate or terminate him from employment hung in the balance. The only real-time assessment reasonably supported by the limited record before us was that MSU was actively searching for evidence manifesting the propriety or impropriety of Komiyama's conduct and relationships with students, including Cepeda, in the face of serious and already significantly-substantiated allegations of misconduct. Beyond rank speculation and conjecture, neither the District Court nor Cepeda cited any substantial direct or circumstantial evidence that would support a finding or inference that MSU knowingly failed to preserve evidence with purpose or intent to conceal unfavorable evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 35 Seemingly recognizing the infirmity of its insinuation of bad faith, the District Court in any event found that MSU's failure to preserve faculty and student emails, other than those deemed relevant to its internal investigation, \"irreparably damage[d] Cepeda's ability to present her claims.\" Absent direct or circumstantial evidence of purpose or intent to destroy unfavorable evidence, dismissal or default judgment is a proper spoliation sanction under M. R. Civ. P. 37(b)-(e) only upon a finding of a substantial likelihood that the lost or destroyed evidence would have been materially relevant to an essential element of a claim or defense at issue and not substantially cumulative of other available evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stokes II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18-20 (citing\n   <em>\n    Willson,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28 and\n   <em>\n    Eisenmenger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4619446\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/264/393/#p406\">\n    264 Mont. at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4619446\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/264/393/#p406\">\n    871 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1321 ). Here, neither\n   the District Court nor Cepeda cited any non-speculative basis upon which to conclude or suspect that any substantial likelihood existed that any of the unpreserved email communications which may have existed on June 15, 2011, would actually have been materially favorable to Cepeda. The District Court's contrary finding is supported by nothing more than pure speculation and conjecture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 36 In contrast, MSU timely produced in excess of 1,700 pages of documentary discovery including all of the information initially compiled by Leech and subsequently gathered in MSU's extensive internal investigation. MSU made an unrebutted evidentiary showing that co-investigator Letendre had no involvement with Komiyama or related student complaints prior to her involvement in MSU's internal investigation. Cepeda thoroughly deposed Bentz, Leech, and Agre-Kippenham about their relevant involvement, knowledge, and communications in this matter. Cepeda had the opportunity to similarly depose Komiyama but did not. In her response in opposition to Cepeda's petition for supervisory control, Cepeda does not assert that Student M, Professor Biber, or any other MSU faculty member or Komiyama music student likely to have knowledge of pre-2010\n   Komiyama misconduct were no longer available for interview or deposition during the discovery period in the underlying matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 37 Under these circumstances, Cepeda has lost no more than the opportunity to comb through every single email communication to or from Komiyama, Komiyama music students, Leech, Bentz, Agre-Kippenham, and Letendre that\n   <em>\n    might possibly\n   </em>\n   have existed on June 15, 2011, and then\n   <em>\n    might possibly\n   </em>\n   have referenced Komiyama in some fashion, whether relevant or not. Cepeda has nonetheless had a full and fair opportunity to discover all known, materially-relevant documentary evidence that likely existed on June 15, 2011, regarding MSU's prior awareness of Komiyama misconduct. No non-speculative basis exists upon which to believe that MSU's failure to preserve every email communication that may have existed on June 15, 2011, caused the loss of a smoking gun or any other documentary information materially favorable to Cepeda or even otherwise substantially different from the information and evidence already available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 38 The District Court analogized the spoliation in this case to the materially-prejudicial spoliation in\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse v. BNSF.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   , we reversed a defense verdict and remanded for a new trial with imposition of a sanction \"commensurate with\" the prejudice that resulted from the railroad's failure to preserve workplace video surveillance highly probative of the accident at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 32-39. Despite its sophisticated awareness of the nature, frequency, and likelihood of a resulting FELA\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   claim after a workplace injury, the railroad allowed its video surveillance system to automatically overwrite a number of digital recordings of the accident scene after two supervisory employees viewed and found \"nothing significant\" about a brief portion of one that depicted the plaintiff's work stall at or near the time of the claimed injury.\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Unlike here where only a mere possibility exists that the unpreserved emails might have contained relevant information, the lost evidence at issue in\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   was unquestionably materially relevant to the extent that it could have shown the exact time and location of the accident, the condition of the accident scene, the manner or means in which the plaintiff was working at the time, and the plaintiff's immediate post-accident condition and manner.\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32. In essence, we held that the railroad prejudicially breached a duty to preserve materially-relevant evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 39 Contrary to the District Court's reasoning,\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   is not an analogous example of circumstances under which a default judgment is a proper spoliation sanction. In fact, in that case we actually affirmed the district court's denial of the plaintiff's motion for default judgment due to the lack of conclusive evidence of bad or good faith.\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39. We subsequently reversed and remanded only because the sanction imposed by the court (barring the railroad from referencing the fact or contents of the lost videos as long as the plaintiff remained silent) unfairly rewarded the destruction of preservable evidence by forcing the plaintiff to choose between remaining silent, and thereby allowing the railroad to assert that no evidence supported his claim or, alternatively, exposing the highly suspicious destruction of evidence, but thereby allowing the railroad to present irrefutable self-serving testimony that the lost evidence was favorable to the railroad.\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   is analogous to this case only to the extent that both cases essentially involved findings of a breach of duty to preserve evidence. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   , here there is no non-speculative basis upon which to conclude that MSU's failure to preserve the subject emails resulted in material prejudice to Cepeda.\n   <em>\n    Spotted Horse\n   </em>\n   is clearly distinguishable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 40 Except for insignificant differences, the circumstances of this case are most analogous to those in\n   <em>\n    Cartwright\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Willson\n   </em>\n   . Though\n   we did not expressly apply a duty, breach, prejudice, and proportionality analysis in those cases,\n   <em>\n    Cartwright\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Willson\n   </em>\n   essentially involved similar asserted breaches of a duty to preserve evidence, based on the failure to interrupt routine non-litigation related\n   data and records retention operations, but under circumstances where default judgment would not have been proportional to the nature and extent of the resulting prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cartwright\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27 (affirming denial of default judgment based on routine deletion of email and computer files during pendency of disputed unemployment insurance claim), and\n   <em>\n    Willson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27-29 (affirming denial of default judgment based on routine destruction of secondary, non-chart internal narcotic dosage record during pendency of medical-legal panel review). Similarly, here, though the District Court's implicit finding that MSU breached a duty to preserve potentially relevant information by failing to interrupt its routine IT operations and practices is not clearly erroneous, no cited substantial evidence manifests either a purpose or intent to conceal unfavorable evidence or a likelihood of resulting material prejudice in any event. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Cartwright\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Willson\n   </em>\n   , default judgment is not reasonably proportional to the nature and extent of the breach of duty and any resulting prejudice.

Upon extraordinary review, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in imposing default judgment against MSU as a spoliation sanction under M. R. Civ. P. 37(b)-(c) and (e). We therefore reverse that portion of the District Court's sanctions order and remand for further proceedings in the ordinary course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 42 Reversed and Remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Cepeda's response to MSU's petition for supervisory control characterizes this as a \"negligent hiring, retention, and supervision case.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    MSU further petitions for exercise of supervisory control over the portion of the District Court's April 11, 2018 order denying MSU's cross-motion for Rule 37 sanctions against Cepeda.
