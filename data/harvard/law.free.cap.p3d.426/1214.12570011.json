Our supreme court's additions to \u00a7 28-1388(E) 's express requirements make clear that the medical-draw exception for seizure of blood samples requires a showing of exigent circumstances. And it is well-established that this showing must demonstrate an imminent risk of destruction of blood-alcohol evidence beyond that posed by the natural evanescence of alcohol in the bloodstream-a circumstance that will rarely be present when the state seeks to effect a warrantless seizure of an already-preserved blood sample. Here, no exigent circumstances were present, and the test results from the improperly seized blood sample therefore must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 On March 7, 2016, at approximately 6:42 p.m., a witness discovered a vehicle crashed into a business's entry gate, with the engine still running. Diaz, the driver, was the vehicle's sole occupant. The witness saw Diaz\n   turn off the engine and slump over the steering wheel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Fire department personnel extracted Diaz and, finding him unresponsive with no visible trauma, placed him in an ambulance for transport to a hospital. Diaz was still unresponsive when he arrived at the hospital, and medical imaging revealed no trauma. Medical personnel determined that he was stable, but intubated him and placed him on a breathing machine while they worked to determine the cause of his unresponsive state and decide how to treat him. Hospital personnel also drew blood for medical purposes, and stored it securely. A nurse noticed the odor of alcohol on Diaz's breath and person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Police were advised of all the foregoing, and of the fact that medical personnel had drawn blood from Diaz for medical purposes. Without attempting to obtain a warrant, a police officer took custody of the blood at approximately 7:38 p.m. The state eventually tested the blood for its alcohol content, and thereafter charged Diaz with aggravated DUI under A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 28-1381 and -1383. Diaz seeks special-action relief from the superior court's denial of his motions seeking suppression of the blood evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 We accept special-action jurisdiction because Diaz's petition presents a purely legal issue of statewide importance that is likely to recur.\n   <em>\n    Vo v.

When the Fourth Amendment analysis begins post-draw, it is difficult to imagine such additional facts. For a legally cognizable exigency to exist, an\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   blood sample would have to be at imminent risk of destruction or degradation. That might be the case if, for example, the facility housing the sample were on fire or the custodian was about to immediately dispose of or alter the sample. But in the absence of such improbable circumstances, there is no exigency. As a practical matter, our supreme court's recognition of the constitutional exigency requirement as a necessary element of the statutory medical-draw exception renders the statute toothless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 We note that nothing prevents the state from requesting that medical personnel preserve already-drawn blood in a form that will permit subsequent testing. But the fact that the blood can be preserved in that manner highlights why the warrant requirement is a practical means of obtaining blood samples that have been legitimately secured by medical personnel for medical purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 Here, the state acknowledges that \"the record does not demonstrate exigency for the officer's warrantless taking\" of blood that \"had already been drawn and preserved in vacutainers by medical personnel.\" The state contends, however, that Diaz's medical state created an exigency because he could have been treated with blood-content-altering medication, or he could have been rendered unavailable by surgery. The state thus argues that \"where exigent circumstances would have permitted the officer to direct [a new/second] blood draw without a warrant, allowing the officer to seize a portion of blood from an already-drawn medical sample[ ] only serves to\n   <em>\n    minimize\n   </em>\n   the intrusion to the defendant by eliminating a second invasion of his veins.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 The state's argument is unpersuasive because there would be no need for a second blood draw absent a risk that the already-drawn sample would not be available to the state after obtaining a warrant. And if there were such a risk, that risk would presumably constitute an exigent circumstance justifying a warrantless seizure of the already-drawn blood sample. Either way, there would be no need to \"minimize the intrusion to the defendant\" by eliminating a second blood draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 Finally, we note that under the good-faith exception to the warrant requirement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"searches conducted in objectively\n   reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.
