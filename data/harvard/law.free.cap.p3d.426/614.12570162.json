The trial court sentenced accordingly, suspended payment of the fines, and imposed a $50.00 Victims Compensation Assessment and court costs in each count. The trial court ordered the sentences to run concurrently and granted Appellant credit for time served.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is from these judgments and sentences that Appellant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Thomas Bryan resided with his wife, Lori Mangels, at 1328 North Birmingham Place in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Appellant lived with his mother in a nearby home. Appellant's grandmother resided near Bryan's home too. Mangels knew Appellant through a mutual acquaintance. Bryan knew Appellant and his green Saturn from his travels through the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 On December 15, 2015, Bryan was helping his friend, Leland Mitchell, move into Bryan's home. The two men were in Bryan's front yard shortly after school let out that day. Bryan observed Appellant speed down the street in an unsafe manner while school children were walking nearby. Bryan hollered at Appellant to slow down but Appellant just kept going.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Mitchell and Bryan left to get another load of Mitchell's belongings. Mitchell drove Bryan's truck. Bryan followed on his motorcycle. On the way, Bryan observed Appellant's green sedan stopped on the street. Bryan approached the car and cussed Appellant. He exclaimed: \"What the hell is wrong with you? You're gonna run over somebody and kill someone, you know? I realize you got two kids in your car, how would you like for them to get runned over.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant responded by asking Bryan where his wife was at? Bryan drove off towards Mitchell's house. Appellant dropped his children off at his grandmother's house but allowed his younger brother to remain in the car. He chased after Bryan with his 12 gauge pump-action shotgun. Bryan noticed Appellant behind him just as Appellant fired two shots from his moving car. Bryan ran a stop sign and got away from Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Appellant visited Bryan's home while Bryan was at Mitchell's house. Lori Mangels was home and heard him honking. When she went to the front door, Appellant called to Mangels and told her that he needed to tell her something. Appellant beckoned Mangels to come to his car. When Mangels complied, Appellant asked her if she had heard those shots? Mangel asked, what shots? Appellant stated: \"I took two shots at Thomas.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant showed Mangels his shotgun. He explained that Bryan had called him the N-word while cussing him for speeding through the neighborhood. Appellant threatened that if he ever saw Bryan again he would blow Bryan's head off. This upset Mangels. After Appellant left, she phoned Bryan and told him what Appellant had threatened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 In response to Mangels' call, Bryan and Mitchell returned to Bryan's home. Everything was quiet for a few hours but Bryan soon observed Appellant's Saturn out front of his home on the security cameras he had installed on the front of his house. Appellant sat in the car for few minutes and then drove off. After Appellant drove by a second time, Bryan and Mitchell went out on the front porch. From approximately two blocks away, Appellant fired two shots while still seated in his car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Bryan did not have a firearm inside his home. He only had a pellet gun and a BB gun. Hoping to scare Appellant, Bryan shone a red laser pointer from his flashlight at Appellant's car. In the darkness, the laser shone very well. Bryan also held the pellet handgun. Appellant was undeterred by Bryan's actions. He started to circle the block around to Bryan's home again. Concerned that Appellant would shoot at his house, Bryan had Mangel hide inside the back part of the home. Bryan ran and hid between his house and his neighbor's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Against Bryan's advice, Mitchell went to his Grand Am to move it so that it would not get shot up. He drove the vehicle in reverse out of Bryan's driveway and into the street. Appellant fired two shots at Mitchell from the street one-half of a block south of Bryan's home. One of the slugs struck Mitchell in the head, killing him. After Appellant drove off, Bryan found Mitchell in the still-running car with a golf ball size hole in his forehead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Dr. David Arboe of the State Medical Examiner's Office performed an autopsy on Mitchell's body. Arboe found that the slug had entered Mitchell's left forehead area,\n   damaged several structures and exited the right posterior head. This wound caused Mitchell's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The Tulsa Police Department responded to Mangel's 911 call. They recovered the slug from the back window shelf of Mitchell's car. Officer Alisa Parrott located two pieces of shotgun wadding one-half block away from Bryan's home at the corner of Birmingham Place and Newton Place. Bryan identified Appellant as the shooter to the investigating officers. Officer Adam Dawson went to the home of Appellant's grandmother but Appellant was not there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Sergeant David Walker found Appellant's green Saturn on the side of the road half way between Bryan's house and the home of Appellant's mother. Officer Vic Regalado responded to Appellant's residence with several other officers. When the officers approached the house, the interior lights and Christmas tree lights were turned off. No one answered the door. The officers maintained a perimeter around the home. Appellant surrendered to the SWAT Team approximately two hours later, after a police negotiator was able to persuade both Appellant and his family to exit the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Sergeant Walker helped execute a Search Warrant on Appellant's residence. He discovered a set of Saturn keys hidden under a mattress in one of the bedrooms. Walker further found a Western Field brand pump action shotgun in the closet of the master bedroom. Detective Kyle Ohrynowicz also helped search the home. He discovered a shotgun shell in the floor of the master bedroom. Ohrynowicz also found a box of Winchester brand 12 gauge shotgun shells in a drawer in the home. The shells were one ounce slug rounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 Detective Richard Aschoff executed a Search Warrant on Appellant's Saturn. He found a spent Winchester brand shotgun shell pinched in the hinge between the door and the body of the vehicle. Aschoff also discovered a couple of live shotgun shells in the car. Both of the shells were slug rounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 Forensic Firearm Examiner, Joy Patterson, compared the spent shotgun shell recovered from the Saturn with the shotgun found in Appellant's residence. Patterson determined that the shell had been fired from the weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 Detective Justin Ritter interviewed Appellant the next morning. After waiving his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant immediately asked: \"What am I in here for?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant admitted driving the green Saturn but wholly denied any knowledge of a confrontation with Bryan. He denied speeding that day and disallowed that a guy on a motorcycle had come up to him complaining about his driving. After Ritter confronted Appellant with the fact that his fifteen year old brother had confirmed that the confrontation had occurred, Appellant finally acknowledged that Bryan had confronted him. He complained that Bryan had called him the N-word but related that he had gone back to his home and played video games afterward. Appellant denied shooting at Bryan while he was riding the motorcycle. He asserted that he did not have a shotgun. Appellant admitted that he spoke to Lori Mangels but claimed that he had told her that everything was cool. He related \"I guess the dude got shot ... people calling me already.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 When Ritter advised Appellant that they had found the shotgun in his house, the wadding on the street corner, and the slug in Mitchell's car, Appellant admitted to possessing the shotgun and firing it that day. He claimed that a few hours after the confrontation Bryan had pointed the laser pointer at him and fired a handgun at both him and his little brother. Appellant asserted that he had fired the shotgun one time into the air and then went back home. He was very adamant that he only fired the shotgun one time that day. Appellant related that he was familiar with the weapon and indicated that he practiced with the shotgun regularly at his family's farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 Ritter accused Appellant of lying and advised him that Mitchell had died after being\n   shot in the head. Ritter indicated that the officers intended to compare the slug recovered from Mitchell's car and compare it to Appellant's shotgun. Appellant feigned crying and exclaimed, \"I don't know if I shot that dude man. If it did happen I didn't mean for that to happen.\" No sooner than he began crying, Appellant stopped. He confessed that when the car backed out of Bryan's driveway, he had fired two shots down the street at it. Appellant admitted that prior to the shooting he was safe at home. He could not explain why he went back to Bryan's house and lamented that his friend had told him to leave it alone. Appellant admitted that initially he had \"lied\" to Ritter but asserted that he was just trying to scare Bryan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 In his first proposition of error, Appellant challenges the trial court's instruction on transferred intent. He concedes that he waived appellate review of this claim for all but plain error when he failed to raise this challenge at the time of trial.\n   <em>\n    Stewart v.

We note that the bolded language within the instruction is intended to signal to the trial court that the instruction must be modified before given to the jury. The slash symbol is intended to cause the trial court to elect the alternative(s) which most accurately fits the case at trial. Because the transferred intent doctrine directly relates to the relevant\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element of the charged offense, the trial court should have chosen \"kill\" from the alternatives of \"kill/injure/assault.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804929\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/371/1120/\">\n    2016 OK CR 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804929\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/371/1120/\">\n    371 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1122-23 ; 21 O.S.Supp.2012, \u00a7 701.7(A) (setting forth\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element of malice murder as a deliberate intention to unlawfully take away the life of another human being).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621 Instead, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   If you find that the defendant intended to kill/injure/assault THOMAS BRYAN, and by mistake or accident killed LELAND MITCHELL, the element of intent is satisfied even though the defendant did not intend to kill LELAND MITCHELL.

Thus in the semi-darkness A shoots, with intent to kill, at a vague form he supposes to be his enemy B but who is actually another person C; his well-aimed bullet kills C. Here too A is guilty of murdering C, to the same extent he would have been guilty of murdering B had he made no mistake. A intended to kill the person at whom he aimed, so there is even less difficulty in holding him guilty than in the bad-aim situation. And of course A's conceivable argument that his mistake of fact (as to the victim's identity) somehow negatives his guilt of murder would be unavailing: his mistake does not negative his intent to kill; and on the facts as he supposes them to be A is just as guilty of murder as he is on the facts which actually exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11661174\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/980/1081/\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted). 1 Wayne R.

The State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant had intended to kill Thomas Bryan. As opposed to the multitudes of cases which come before this Court without any direct evidence of intent, the record in the present contains Appellant's explicit expression of his intent to take Bryan's life. Lori Mangels testified that Appellant showed her his shotgun and threatened to blow Bryan's head off the next time that he saw him.

The first one is Instruction Number 50 and it explains exactly what the State just told you, that life is 45 years, that at 85 percent that's 38 years and three months.

The evidence at trial strongly supported the jury's determination that Appellant should be imprisoned for life without the possibility of parole. Appellant brazenly threatened to blow Thomas Bryan's head off and continued to follow through on this threat until he shot Bryan's companion, Leland Mitchell, through the forehead. Despite admitting that he was safe at his own home and had time to cool off from the initial confrontation, Appellant continued to pursue Bryan and attempt to kill him. Mitchell was wholly uninvolved in the circumstances and was simply a guest in Bryan's home. Appellant's act of murdering Mitchell occurred after his former conviction of a felony.

Ritter stated that he gave Appellant what is commonly known as the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning and advised him of his rights prior to having a substantive conversation with him. Appellant indicated that he understood each of the rights, waived them, and agreed to speak with the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b644 Ritter further testified that Appellant disclosed during the interview that he had mental health issues and had not taken his medication the preceding day but Ritter continued with the interview because Appellant was communicative and seemed fine. Ritter advised that Appellant appeared to understand where he was at and what was going on. Based upon his experience and training, Ritter did not believe that Appellant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Appellant\n   responded appropriately to Ritter's questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b645 The Rights Waiver form that Ritter used to advise Appellant of his rights is also within the record on appeal. The form accurately sets forth the rights announced in\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . Appellant's initials are next to each of the listed rights and his signature is affixed under the declaration: \"I have read and understood my rights. I am willing to answer questions and understand that I may stop answering questions at any time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b646 The recording of the interview corroborated Ritter's testimony. The recording contains both an audio and visual account of the interrogation. Detective Ritter and Detective Frazier interviewed Appellant around 5:45 a.m. on December 16, 2015. Appellant appeared alert and attentive throughout the interview. Ritter first ascertained that Appellant could read, write, and understand his questions. Appellant advised Ritter that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He had last smoked marijuana approximately twelve hours earlier. Appellant indicated that he could read and write. He further affirmed that he understood Ritter. When Ritter read Appellant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights from the Rights Waiver form Appellant actively read along with the detective and acknowledged that he understood each of the rights. He eagerly expressed his desire to speak with the officers and signed the Rights Waiver form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b647 Appellant admitted driving the green Saturn but wholly denied any knowledge of a confrontation with Thomas Bryan or anyone else that day. He denied speeding in his car and disallowed that a guy on a motorcycle had come up to him complaining about his driving. Even after Ritter confronted Appellant with the fact that his fifteen year old brother had confirmed that the confrontation had occurred, Appellant continued to deny any memory of such an encounter. Eventually, he asked Ritter to allow him to think and after rubbing his temples for several minutes admitted that such a confrontation had occurred. Appellant complained that Bryan had called him the N-word but related that he had gone back to his home and played video games afterward. Appellant further admitted that he spoke to Lori Mangel but claimed that he had told her that everything was cool. In an apparent attempt to further confront Appellant, Ritter asked Appellant if he had mental health issues. Appellant indicated, \"A little bit\" and asserted that he had Schizophrenia, Bipolar, OCD, and ADHD. Appellant advised that he was on medication through a local clinic but very confidently stated that he regularly took his medication. When Ritter asked if Appellant had taken his medication that day, Appellant indicated that he had not. However, he confidently asserted that he had taken it the day before. Ritter continued to interview Appellant without any incident or problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b648 It is truly questionable whether Appellant actually has mental health issues. Forensic Psychologist, Dr. Peter Rausch, of the Oklahoma Forensic Center evaluated Appellant during the competency proceedings held in the case before trial. Appellant asserted that he had Schizophrenia, Bipolar, and ADHD but could not relate any symptoms associated with these conditions. Dr. Rausch did not observe any legitimate signs of mental illness, cognitive impairment, or neurological disease while evaluating Appellant. Instead, Dr. Rausch indicated that Appellant tested excessively high above the cut score for malingering strongly suggesting that he was feigning the symptoms of mental illness. Based upon Rausch's report, Appellant was found competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b649 Nothing in the record suggests that Appellant's mental health status prevented him from understanding the rights at stake and the consequences of waiving them. Appellant was communicative and appeared fine. He responded appropriately to Ritter's questions but simply refused to confess his involvement in Mitchell's death until confronted with the cold hard reality of the circumstances. Appellant appeared wholly goal oriented. After he confessed Appellant openly admitted that he had initially \"lied\" to Ritter but asserted that he was just trying to scare Bryan. All of Appellant's statements and actions on the recording suggest that he understood the rights at stake and the consequences of waiving them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b650 Based upon this record, we must conclude that the trial court's determination that Appellant knowingly waived his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   was not clearly against the weight and effect of the facts presented. Proposition Four is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b651 In his fifth proposition of error, Appellant claims the combined errors in his trial denied him the right to a constitutionally guaranteed fair trial. When there have been numerous irregularities during the course of a trial that tend to prejudice the rights of the defendant, reversal will be required if the cumulative effect of all the errors is to deny the defendant a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    Bechtel v.

In this case, the State did not allege any intent to injure or assault with reference to the malice murder count and transferred intent was not applicable to the assault with a dangerous weapon count. I am, however, confident that the instruction did not cause any harm to Appellant in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b67 The jury was fully instructed on the elements of first degree malice murder and the requisite definitions of those elements. The jury was also instructed on the elements of the lesser offense of second degree depraved mind murder. First degree malice murder requires specific intent and second degree depraved mind murder does not. The transferred intent doctrine applies to specific intent crimes against the person. It would have been impossible for the transferred intent instruction to cause the jury to convict Appellant of first degree murder if he were actually guilty of second degree murder. I agree, therefore, that the instruction given was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b68 I believe this Court agrees that Oklahoma's first degree murder statute only requires that a defendant cause a death of another with malice aforethought (the intent \"to take away the life of a human being\"). 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 701.7(A). When a person acts with this intent and causes the death of another, the person is guilty of first degree malice murder. Under a clear reading of the statute, it is of no consequence whether a defendant intended to kill one specific individual but killed someone else by mistake or accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b69 Evidence was overwhelming that Appellant actually intended to kill the person at whom he discharged his shotgun. Therefore, his intent to kill the person killed was not legally transferred from an intended victim to the actual victim. This Court has not expanded the transferred intent doctrine to a situation where a defendant hurls a blow at an intended victim thinking that victim is someone else,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   \"bad eyesight\" which sounds similar to a \"bad aim.\" Public policy dictates, however, that a defendant not avail himself of a defense based on either \"bad eyesight\" or \"bad aim\" in malice murder cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   One method of upholding that public policy is to utilize the doctrine of transferred intent to prevent a defendant from claiming that the person killed was not the intended victim.

I believe the trial court's instruction on \"transferred intent\" was a correct statement of the law and appropriate in this circumstance. I believe the attorneys' misstatements of the 85% Rule could have affected the jury's sentence recommendation, and would affirm the conviction but remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b62 Appellant was convicted in Count 1 of intentionally killing Mitchell, the friend of Appellant's neighbor, Bryan, by intentionally firing a shotgun into a vehicle Mitchell was driving.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant eventually admitted to police that he shot in the direction of the car Mitchell was driving (he actually fired more than once, and hit Mitchell in the center of the forehead from a distance of about 120\n   yards). The shooting occurred at night, such that it would have been difficult for Appellant to see inside the car. Although the trial court noted that Appellant's various explanations of what happened were not consistent, it nevertheless included instructions on self-defense, and on depraved-mind murder as a lesser related offense. Rejecting these options, the jury concluded that Appellant fired his weapon into Mitchell's vehicle with an intent to kill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b63 The trial court instructed the jury on the concept of \"transferred intent,\" OUJI-CR (2nd) No. 4-11 (Instruction No. 20). Neither party objected to this instruction. In fact, both parties discussed the implications of the instruction in closing argument. The State never claimed Appellant intended to kill\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   . Appellant was angry with his neighbor, Bryan, not Mitchell, and there was no evidence he intended to harm Mitchell. The prosecutor explained that under the doctrine of transferred intent, the fact that Appellant killed someone other than his intended victim did not excuse his conduct. Based on Appellant's conflicting accounts, defense counsel advanced a mixture of self-defense and accident, claiming Appellant was in reasonable fear of his life, but that he only meant to scare Bryan. Defense counsel claimed that because Appellant had a legal right to use deadly force to protect himself, killing Mitchell was an unfortunate accident that was excusable under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b64 In Proposition I, Appellant objects for the first time to the wording of Instruction 20. He concedes a transferred-intent instruction was appropriate, but claims the court's failure to properly edit the wording of the Uniform Instruction to fit these particular facts prejudiced him. Specifically he claims the instruction relieved the State of its duty to prove\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   intent to kill on his part. In Proposition III, he faults trial counsel for not recognizing this textual flaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b65 The Majority's conclusion that the instruction was not warranted in this case is both incorrect and irrelevant. I appreciate the distinction between two classic fact patterns: one where the defendant accidentally kills someone other than his intended victim (the \"bad aim\" scenario), the other where he kills someone he mistakenly believes\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   his intended victim (the \"mistake of fact\" scenario). But however one labels these scenarios, the fact remains that\n   <em>\n    neither of them\n   </em>\n   excuses the defendant's conduct under Oklahoma law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b66 To prove premeditated murder, the State must establish the unlawful killing of another human with malice, and malice is the \"deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a human being.\" 21 O.S.Supp.2012, \u00a7 701.7(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   OUJI (2nd) No. 4-61.\n   <em>\n    There is no requirement that the defendant's malice be directed at the person who was killed.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

That point may seem obvious to lawyers, but it may not be so obvious to the layman. Hence an instruction on the concept may be entirely appropriate in cases like this where a third party is inadvertently harmed, and it is appropriate\n   <em>\n    regardless\n   </em>\n   of whether the third party's harm was due to \"bad aim\" (accident) or \"mistake of fact\" (mistake). Over a century ago, this Court recognized the technical distinction between the two scenarios, but found no legal difference in the result.\n   <em>\n    Fooshee v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1910%20OK%20CR%2086\">\n    1910 OK CR 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8747156\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/okla-crim/3/666/\">\n    3 Okl.Cr. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8747156\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/okla-crim/3/666/\">\n    108 P. 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   What's more, OUJI-CR (2nd) No. 4-11\n   encompasses\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   scenarios, and reaches the same result regardless of whether the victim was harmed by \"mistake\" or \"accident\" OUJI-CR (2nd) No. 4-11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b67 Even if the Majority were correct that the instruction was unwarranted here, the fact remains, the jury received it. The real issues are whether the instruction stated the applicable law, and if not, whether it renders the jury's verdict unreliable. I believe the instruction was appropriate to these facts and correctly stated the law. In fact, the trial court's editing made the instruction a more correct statement of the law (as applied to these facts) than the text of the Uniform Instruction itself. Uniform Instruction No. 4-11 contains alternatives to be selected based on what the defendant sought to do (assault, battery, or homicide), and the fate of the person mistakenly or accidentally harmed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   If you find that the defendant intended to\n   <strong>\n    kill/ injure/ assault\n   </strong>\n   [Name of Intended Victim], and by mistake or accident\n   <strong>\n    injured/ assaulted\n   </strong>\n   [Name of Actual Victim], the element of intent is satisfied even though the defendant did not intend to\n   <strong>\n    kill/ injure/assault\n   </strong>\n   [Name of Actual Victim]. In such a case, the law regards the intent as transferred from the original intended victim to the actual victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=751%20N.W.2d%20631\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court altered the text to account for the fact that Mitchell was\n   <em>\n    killed\n   </em>\n   rather than injured, but left alternatives for Appellant's original intentions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   If you find that the defendant intended to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     kill/ injure/assault\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   THOMAS BRYAN, and by mistake or accident\n   <strong>\n    killed\n   </strong>\n   LELAND MITCHELL, the element of intent is satisfied even though the defendant did not intend to\n   <strong>\n    kill\n   </strong>\n   LELAND MITCHELL. In such a case, the law regards the intent as transferred from the original intended victim to the actual victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b68 Appellant complains that the trial court left all three intent options in the first line of the text, but this was entirely proper under the facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the State of course alleged that Appellant intended to kill Bryan, Appellant's statements to police disputed that claim; he insisted that he only meant to scare Bryan. In any event, the instruction as edited by the trial court certainly\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   absolve the State from proving any criminal intent on Appellant's part, as he now claims. The first words of the instruction -- \"\n   <em>\n    If you find that the defendant intended to ...\n   </em>\n   \" -- speak for themselves. The instruction merely states this: Whatever the jury may believe Appellant\n   was endeavoring to do to Bryan (scare him, kill him), his culpability is not mitigated (\"\n   <em>\n    is satisfied even though\n   </em>\n   \") the person ultimately harmed by his conduct was someone else. That certainly comports with the law of this State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant's jury was properly instructed on the elements of premeditated murder and self-defense. Instruction No. 20 supplemented those instructions, but did not distort or contradict them. I find no reasonable probability that Instruction No. 20, as edited, could have contributed to an unreliable verdict, and no reason to fault trial counsel for not objecting to its wording.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b69 As to Proposition II, both the prosecutor and defense counsel repeatedly told the jury that \"life means 45 years.\" Their explanations were at best unclear and at worst misstatements of the law. The prosecutor contrasted a life-without-parole sentence -- one where \"you never get out,\" \"that will be it,\" \"he will never leave the penitentiary\" -- with a straight life sentence, which \"means 45 years.\" Defense counsel's own closing comments were just as misleading. She told the jury, \"Most likely those sentence[d] on an 85% crime will do almost all of the time. Life is 45 years.\" Defense counsel concluded by asking the jury to impose a life sentence for murder, because \"\n   <em>\n    45 years is a life\n   </em>\n   and that is the appropriate punishment for this crime.\" These comments can be construed as saying that a life sentence is, for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   purposes, automatically transformed into a sentence of 45 years -- and that even if the defendant does not receive parole after 85% of that term, he\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   be released in 45 years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Majority is uncomfortable enough to suggest amending the applicable OUJI instruction, and I wholeheartedly agree with that proposal. But I am not confident that the comments by both attorneys here did not influence the jurors' understanding of the law and recommendation on sentence. Appellant's crime was reprehensible, and the results were tragic, but I would remand this case for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    I would encourage the committee on uniform criminal jury instructions to examine the current Oklahoma Criminal Instruction on transferred intent. Other Courts have used similar, but different language to convey the same doctrine.

The Uniform Instruction on the 85% Rule is a correct statement as far as it goes, but still leaves room for jurors (and attorneys) to conclude that \"life means 45 years\" is a rule all its own. Telling a jury that the defendant will be released after 85% of his sentence (the Florez situation) is a different error from suggesting that regardless of parole, a life sentence equals 45 years.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
