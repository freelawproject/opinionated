Johnson (\"Mother\") appeals the superior court's order denying her petition to modify the primary physical\n   residence of the parties' children. Mother argues the court abused its discretion by precluding her expert's supplemental report due to her failure to timely disclose the report pursuant to the scheduling order and the Rules of Family Law Procedure. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Mother and respondent James Provoyeur (\"Father\") married and had two children in Rhode Island. In 2012, Mother moved to Arizona with the children. After Mother arrived, she learned she was pregnant with the parties' third child. After Mother gave birth in June 2013, she filed for dissolution in Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The parties conceptually agreed to a parenting plan under which the children would live with the primary residential parent during the school year and with the other parent during summer and alternating school breaks. Mother and Father each sought appointment as the primary residential parent. After an evidentiary hearing in July 2014, the superior court found it was in the children's best interests for Father to be the primary residential parent and for the children to reside principally in Rhode Island.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In April 2016, Mother filed a petition to modify the children's primary physical residence, asserting Father had failed to fulfill his responsibility as the primary residential parent and, as a result, the children were suffering in his care. The superior court scheduled an evidentiary hearing for November 21, 2016, and ordered the parties to exchange updated disclosure statements, including all documents and exhibits, at least 60 days before the hearing. At the parties' request, the court implemented a scheduling order requiring disclosure of experts' identities and opinions on or before October 14, 2016, and completion of all discovery (except expert depositions) by November 1, 2016. Mother disclosed the report of her expert, Carol Mellen, Ph.D., on October 21, 2016 (\"Original Report\")-a week after the court-ordered deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 A few days before the scheduled evidentiary hearing, the court granted Father's motion to continue, resetting the hearing for March 6, 2017. The request for a continuance was necessitated by Mother's untimely disclosure of witnesses and voluminous documents, again after the court-imposed deadline. When granting the continuance, the court reaffirmed its earlier discovery and disclosure order requiring the parties to make all disclosures at least 60 days before the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On February 21, 2017, Mother again violated the court's scheduling order and the Rules of Family Law Procedure by disclosing Dr. Mellen's supplemental report, dated February 13, 2017 (\"Supplemental Report\"). The Supplemental Report included summaries of Dr. Mellen's December 27 and 30, 2016 interviews and observations of the parties' children. Mother did not alert the court or Father of the expected report, nor did she request a continuance based on her late disclosure. On February 27, 2017, Father moved in limine to exclude the Supplemental Report and Dr. Mellen's related testimony because Mother had failed to timely disclose the Supplemental Report. He asserted the presentation of the newly disclosed information would cause him prejudice. Mother argued the disclosure was timely and not prejudicial to Father; she also asserted that it would be an abuse of the court's discretion to exclude the Supplemental Report because it contained information regarding the children's best interests. The court granted Father's motion and excluded Dr. Mellen's Supplemental Report, but admitted her timely disclosed Original Report and allowed Dr. Mellen to testify about the opinions therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Ultimately, the court denied Mother's petition to modify, determining she failed to show a substantial and continuing change of circumstances that would justify a change in the children's primary physical residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The superior court has broad discretion in ruling on disclosure and discovery\n   matters, and this court will not disturb an evidentiary ruling absent a clear abuse of discretion and resulting prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Marquez v.

Mother Did Not Timely Disclose the Supplemental Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Arizona Rule of Family Law Procedure (\"Rule\") 49(H) requires each party to disclose, at least 60 days before trial, all information regarding any expert witness he or she intends to call at trial. Here, the superior court also ordered the parties to complete all disclosures at least 60 days before trial. Mother was therefore required to disclose any supplemental report on or before January 5, 2017, and her February 21, 2017 disclosure of Dr. Mellen's Supplemental Report was not timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Untimely Disclosure Prejudiced Father\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 If a party fails to timely disclose information, he or she \"shall not, unless such failure is harmless, be permitted to use as evidence at trial, at a hearing, or in support of a motion, the information or the testimony of a witness not disclosed, except by leave of court for good cause shown.\" Ariz. R. Fam. Law P. 65(C)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 Mother argues her late disclosure was harmless and caused no prejudice to Father. We disagree. The untimely disclosure deprived Father of a fair opportunity to obtain Dr. Mellen's notes, to schedule and complete a deposition, or to allow his expert witness the necessary time to prepare a rebuttal report. Further, we reject Mother's argument that Father had ample time to cure this prejudice and his failure to depose Dr. Mellen in the two weeks before trial constituted \"lying in wait\" and using the discovery rules as a \"weapon.\" Arizona's disclosure rules do not require an opposing party to undertake new discovery the week prior to trial to remediate or avoid prejudice caused by the other party's disclosure violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Fam. Law P. 65(C)(1) (requiring the party making a late disclosure to seek \"leave of court for good cause shown\" to use the evidence at trial).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Mother was aware the Supplemental Report was forthcoming and neither gave Father advance warning nor sought leave from the court to disclose the report when it became available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 Moreover, we discern no dilatory conduct by Father. He filed his motion in limine to exclude the Supplemental Report four business days after he received it. The circumstances of this case are therefore distinguishable from the cases Mother cites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co. v.

Mother Did Not Establish Good Cause for Her Late Disclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Mother asserted in the superior court that her late disclosure occurred because\n   of illnesses, staff turnover and absences at her counsel's office in February 2017, and Mother's inability to pay Dr. Mellen to prepare the Supplemental Report until February 2017. Even accepting Mother's explanation, Mother was aware a report would be forthcoming but failed to either request a continuance or alert anyone to the impending disclosure or the issues she encountered in producing the document. Accordingly, the superior court rejected her argument and excluded the report based on Mother's disclosure violation. We find no abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marquez\n   </em>\n   at 441, \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062106\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/231/437/#p441\">\n    296 P.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (trial court has broad discretion when ruling on disclosure matters);\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman v.

In\n   <em>\n    Hays\n   </em>\n   , the superior court precluded evidence from a child's therapeutic counselor in a contested child custody proceeding as a contempt sanction because the child's mother had violated certain court orders.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 101, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"152649\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/205/99/\">\n    67 P.3d at 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Arizona Supreme Court vacated the sanctions, explaining the discovery rules did not authorize the exclusion because \"[n]either the superior court nor any party ha[d] identified any discovery order that Mother failed to obey,\" and thus, \"the sanctions were imposed pursuant to the court's inherent contempt power.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 101-02, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"152649\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/205/99/\">\n    67 P.3d at 697-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further held that excluding the evidence \"effectively preclude[d] potentially significant information from being considered in the custody determination\" and impacted the superior court's ability to consider the child's best interests.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 103-04, \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"152649\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/205/99/\">\n    67 P.3d at 699-700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Hays\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   here, Mother failed to comply with Rule 49(H) and failed to show good cause for her non-compliance. Arizona Rule of Family Law Procedure 65(C) therefore authorized the superior court to exclude the untimely disclosed Supplemental Report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, unlike the evidentiary\n   sanctions in\n   <em>\n    Hays\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the superior court did not exclude any evidence that had an \"especially significant effect\" on its ability to determine the child's best interests. The court admitted Dr. Mellen's Original Report, and she testified that the children had adjusted poorly to Father's home, their relationship with Mother had been disrupted, and Mother was more \"attuned\" to the children's needs. Mother argues the Supplemental Report contained new information critical to her case. In particular, she cites Dr. Mellen's summaries of her interviews and observations of the children and her opinions that the children were suffering from their removal from Mother's primary care at young ages. She also criticized Father's expert's methodology and opinion that the children were well-adjusted to Father's home. Dr. Mellen's Original Report contained similar concerns regarding the children's poor adjustment to being separated from Mother and her conclusion that Father was not attuned to the children's needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 Nevertheless, the court permitted Dr. Mellen to testify about those subjects contained in the Original Report. Further, with respect to the child interviews in which the middle child allegedly expressed a desire to live with Mother and the oldest child allegedly expressed frustration about the quality of her education in Rhode Island, the court found, as part of its best interests analysis, the children were too young for it to give weight to their preferences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This testimony, coupled with the parties' testimony and other evidence concerning the children's adjustment to Father's home, gave the court sufficient information to assess the children's best interests. Accordingly, as suggested by Mother, the holding in\n   <em>\n    Hays\n   </em>\n   did not require the superior court to admit the Supplemental Report despite Mother's untimely disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 Similarly, Mother's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Reid v.
