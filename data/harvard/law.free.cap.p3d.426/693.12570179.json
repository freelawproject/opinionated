This case looks at RCW 68.50.140(4) and what it means to act \"without authority of law\" under that statutory section. It is a class C felony to remove \"human remains from a place of interment, without authority of law.\" RCW 68.50.140(4). Also, RCW 68.50.220 allows cemeteries to move remains around within a cemetery, but they must first notify next of kin of their actions. Southwick Inc., a cemetery owner and operator, disinterred 37 sets of cremains (human cremated remains) without first notifying next of kin of its actions. Cemeteries are statutorily authorized to make their own rules concerning their day-to-day operations under RCW 68.20.060. Southwick claims it was acting under its own rules in disinterring the cremains without notice to family members, so it was acting with \"authority of law.\" Because Southwick's rules cannot supersede state statutes, we affirm the Court of Appeals and hold Southwick was not acting with \"authority of law\" when it disinterred the cremains and thus violated RCW 68.50.140(4). Additionally,\n   we hold that Southwick also violated RCW 68.50.220 for failing to notify next of kin before disinterring the cremains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Forest Cemetery, established in 1857, was operated for many years by the Forest Cemetery Association. In 1947, the association granted the city of Olympia (City) a waterline easement across the property. The City installed a large waterline in the easement that provided the City with its main water supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 By the 1980s, the Forest Cemetery Association had disbanded and the cemetery fell into disrepair. Southwick purchased Forest Funeral Home and Cemetery and took over the cemetery operations. Southwick met with the Washington State Funeral and Cemetery Board (Board) and agreed to honor all the existing contracts entered into by the prior owner. It had no knowledge of the City's easement on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Pursuant to RCW 68.20.060 and 68.24.110, Southwick adopted rules and regulations for its day-to-day operations. Southwick's rule 10(j) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The Corporation reserves the right to correct errors made by it in making interments, disinterments or removals.... In the event the error shall involve the interment of the remains of any person in such property, the Corporation reserves and shall have the right to remove and reinter the remains in the property conveyed in lieu thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Admin. Record (AR) at 86, 112. At some point, Southwick created the Devotion Urn Garden in an area immediately adjacent to a large monument, constructed by the cemetery's previous owner. Southwick entered into contracts for cremains to be buried in small plots in this urn garden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 On August 25, 2011, the City advised Southwick of its waterline easement that ran through the cemetery and requested Southwick remove any obstructions in the easement\n   area. After the City performed a survey, Southwick realized it had placed the urn garden in the easement. Southwick then moved the urn garden about nine feet to relocate it outside the easement area. The garden and relationship of the plots within retained the same alignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 A granddaughter of two people whose cremains had been buried in the urn garden filed a complaint that Southwick had moved the cremains without providing advance notice of their relocation. On August 26, 2014, the Department of Licensing (Department)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   issued a statement of charges against Southwick, alleging Southwick had violated RCW 68.24.060,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   68.50.200,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 68.50.220. Only the last alleged violation is relevant to this case as it stands before us. RCW 68.50.220 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   RCW 68.50.200 and 68.50.210 do not apply to or prohibit the removal of any human remains from one plot to another in the same cemetery or the removal of [human] remains by a cemetery authority from a plot for which the purchase price is past due and unpaid, to some other suitable place; nor do they apply to the disinterment of human remains upon order of court or coroner. However, a cemetery authority shall provide notification to the person cited in RCW 68.50.200 before moving human remains.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Alteration in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Both parties moved for summary judgment. On October 29, 2015, a presiding officer of the Board held that Southwick had violated RCW 68.50.140(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides,\n   \"Every person who shall remove human remains, or any part thereof, from a grave, vault, or other place where the same has been buried ... without authority of law ... is guilty of a class C felony.\" The Department had not alleged a violation of that statute. The presiding officer also found Southwick had committed unprofessional conduct under RCW 18.235.130(8) due to its violation of RCW 68.50.140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Southwick filed a motion for reconsideration by the Board of the presiding officer's summary judgment order alleging a due process violation, which is not before us,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and arguing that it had not violated RCW 68.50.140 because it was not acting without \"authority of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 After a hearing on Southwick's motion for reconsideration, the Board entered a final order affirming the summary judgment order, holding Southwick had violated RCW 68.50.140 and RCW 68.24.060 and thus engaged in unprofessional conduct under RCW 18.235.130(8). It imposed a fine of $7,500, as well as a requirement to attempt notification of next of kin and placement of notice in the local newspaper for three days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 Southwick petitioned Thurston County Superior Court for review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), chapter 34.05 RCW, alleging that the Board had misapplied RCW 68.50.140 and 68.24.060 and that its ruling was not supported by substantial evidence. RCW 34.05.570(3)(d), (e). The superior court affirmed the Board's final order. The Court of Appeals, Division Two, also affirmed the RCW 68.50.140 violation, holding that Southwick's internal rules and regulations did not provide \"authority of law\" for purposes of RCW 68.50.140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Southwick, Inc. v.

In this case, the Board is charged with administering the statutes in chapter 68.50 RCW.\n   RCW 68.05.090. Thus, the issue in this case is within its expertise, and we accord its interpretation substantial weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 RCW 68.50.140(4) provides, \"Every person who removes, disinters, or mutilates human remains from a place of interment, without authority of law, is guilty of a class C felony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   RCW 18.235.130(8) makes it unprofessional conduct to violate any provision of chapter 68.50 RCW, and RCW 18.235.110(1)(h) empowers the Board to impose civil penalties, including monetary penalties up to $5,000 per violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16 Chapter 68.50 RCW provides some exceptions and defenses (or authorization) to this general prohibition on disinterring human remains. Remains may be disinterred with a surviving family member's consent or, if a relative's consent cannot be obtained, by court order. RCW 68.50.200. These requirements do not apply when a cemetery authority moves remains within a cemetery, but \"a cemetery authority shall provide notification to the [next of kin] before moving human remains.\" RCW 68.50.220. The basis for the statutory violations in this case is not giving statutorily required notification to next of kin before disinterring the cremains. Under RCW 68.50.140(4) and 68.50.220, a violation of .140(4) may also be a violation of .220; the lack of prior notice is common to both. Conversely, notice by a cemetery before disinterment in accordance with .220 is a defense to a violation of .140(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 Southwick argues it acted pursuant to its own rule 10(j) when it moved the cremains to correct the error of interment within the easement area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   RCW 68.20.060 empowers\n   cemetery authorities to \"make ... and enforce rules and regulations for the use, care, control, management, restriction and protection of all or any part of its cemetery.\" RCW 68.56.060 gives cemetery authorities \"the authority of a police officer for the purpose of ... enforcing the rules and regulations of the cemetery association, the laws of the state, and the ordinances of the city or county, within the cemetery over which he or she has charge.\" RCW 68.24.110 authorizes cemeteries to \"sell and convey plots or rights of interment subject to the rules in effect or thereafter adopted by the cemetery authority.\" Given this statutory authority to create, implement, and enforce its own operating rules, Southwick argues that it was acting with \"authority of law\" when it disinterred the cremains pursuant to its rules and thus did not violate RCW 68.50.140(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 Southwick relies on language from\n   <em>\n    State v. Gunwall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1195512\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/106/54/\">\n    106 Wash.2d 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20P.2d%20808\">\n    720 P.2d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) for its definition of \"authority of law.\" In that case, we defined \"authority of law\" as including any \"authority granted by a valid ... statute, the common law or a rule of this court.\"\n   <em>\n    Gunwall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1195512\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/106/54/\">\n    106 Wash.2d at 68-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20P.2d%20808\">\n    720 P.2d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This definition does not help Southwick for two reasons. First, Southwick's operating rules are not statutes, part\n   of the common law, or a rule of the court. Therefore, per the\n   <em>\n    Gunwall\n   </em>\n   language, Southwick's rules are not \"authority of law.\" Southwick argues that it sold interment rights pursuant to contracts that incorporated these rules, which it argues are\n   <em>\n    common law\n   </em>\n   contract rights. This argument strains to place its rules within the\n   <em>\n    Gunwall\n   </em>\n   language, but Southwick, simply stated, cannot contract to evade statutory requirements. Parties may not contract around existing state law, and Southwick's argument that its rules establish authority of law fails.\n   \u00b6 19 Second,\n   <em>\n    Gunwall\n   </em>\n   defines the \"authority of law\" required by article I, section 7 of the Washington Constitution as it relates to search and seizure law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   By contrast, the \"authority of law\" in this case is provided by the specific statutes establishing exceptions to chapter 68.50 RCW's general prohibition on disinterment. Under the statutory exceptions, remains may be disinterred with the consent of a specified family member or, if familial consent cannot be obtained, by superior court order. RCW 68.50.200. Another exception is that cemeteries may move remains from one plot to another without consent, but they must notify next of kin before doing so. RCW 68.50.220. These statutes therefore establish the \"authority of law\" to disinter human remains within the statutory framework, and prior notification is the basic rule to which the exceptions apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 Southwick offers no case law supporting its argument that its rule making authority includes the authority to make rules that conflict with state statutes. The Department, on the other hand, cites numerous authorities holding that legislatively delegated rule making authority does not permit an agency, municipality, or corporation to make rules that conflict with existing state law.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21 Southwick argues that the Court of Appeals' interpretation of RCW 68.50.140 threatens to undermine the efficacy of cemetery-issued rules across the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also argues that the court's interpretation \"emasculates\"-or, in our words, \"disempowers\"-the trifecta of statutes allowing cemeteries to create, implement, and enforce these rules. However, the opposite seems true-Southwick's position undermines the efficacy of Washington's disinterment statutes. Southwick argues the legislature has granted cemeteries authority independent of other statutes, but this is not so. Through RCW 68.20.060, the legislature permits cemeteries to adopt and enforce internal rules and regulations consistent with, not independent of, state law. Importantly, nowhere under the statutory scheme is the express notice requirement established under RCW 68.50.220 excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 22 As the Department points out, if cemetery rules superseded state statutes, cemeteries could adopt rules exempting themselves from every statute governing cemetery operations, such as the statute prohibiting cemeteries from refusing to bury a nonwhite person. RCW 68.50.035. Nothing\n   in RCW 68.20.060 or 68.24.110 acts to relieve cemetery authorities of the obligation to comply with state law. Under Southwick's interpretation of the statutory framework, RCW 68.50.220 would be meaningless. A statutory scheme establishing and governing disinterment requirements cannot be interpreted to allow cemeteries to\n   create rules by contract exempting themselves from complying with those same statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 23 Southwick also argues that RCW 68.50.140(4) does not apply to its case's facts. Under the statute, a person is guilty of a class C felony if he or she removes \"human remains from a place of interment, without authority of law.\" \"Interment\" is statutorily defined as \"the placement of human remains in a cemetery.\" RCW 68.04.100. Given this definition, Southwick argues that \"place of interment\" means a cemetery in general. Therefore, to violate the statute, Southwick would have had to remove the cremains from the cemetery. We reject this argument. A \"place of interment\" is more specific than \"interment\" and means the particular place remains are buried, such as a plot within a cemetery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 24 RCW 68.50.140(4) must also be read in conjunction with RCW 68.50.220, which addresses a cemetery's ability to move remains within the boundaries of a cemetery. Under .220, a cemetery under specific circumstances may not need permission to disinter and relocate remains within the cemetery. However, the statute mandates that the cemetery\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   provide notice to next of kin before moving remains within a cemetery. The notice requirement is mandatory and applies to cemeteries, and Southwick cannot dispute it failed to notify family members before moving the cremains. Therefore, Southwick was not acting with the authority of law provided by RCW 68.50.220 that would have exempted it from RCW 68.50.140 's general prohibition of disinterring remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 25 We affirm the Court of Appeals and hold that Southwick was not acting with \"authority of law\" when it disinterred the cremains without giving prior statutory notification. Because the facts are undisputed, we hold Southwick also violated RCW 68.50.220 by failing to notify next of kin before relocating the cremains within the cemetery.

RCW 68.50.140(4) is a criminal statute originally designed to target grave robbers\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it makes removal of \"human remains from a place of interment, without authority of law,\" a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 27 Whether RCW 68.50.140(4) covers Southwick's conduct presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation. The rules of statutory interpretation compel us to hold that the plain language of this statute-criminalizing removal of human remains \"without authority of law,\" without defining the meaning of the phrase \"without\n   authority of law\"-creates confusion in this case. The confusion centers on whether Southwick's decision move those cremains to comply with a lawful demand by the city of Olympia (City) to vacate the City's easement-an easement necessary to protect public health\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -should be characterized as moving cremains \"with\" or \"without authority of law.\" Since\n   the statutory language and context do not answer that question, we must turn to legislative history and the rule of lenity. Both interpretive aids compel the same conclusion: RCW 68.50.140(4) cannot be used to make a felony out of Southwick's decision to move cremains a few feet to a new urn garden to let the City access its lawful easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 28 I therefore disagree with the majority's decision to uphold the finding that Southwick violated this criminal statute.

That subsection, in context of the entire statute, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (1) Every person who shall remove human remains, or any part thereof, from a grave, vault, or other place where the same has been buried or deposited awaiting burial or cremation, without authority of law, with intent to sell the same, or for the purpose of securing a reward for its return, or for dissection, or from malice or wantonness, is guilty of a class C felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (2) Every person who shall purchase or receive, except for burial or cremation, human remains or any part thereof, knowing that the same has been removed contrary to the foregoing provisions, is guilty of a class C felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (3) Every person who shall open a grave or other place of interment, temporary or otherwise, or a building where human remains are placed, with intent to sell or remove the casket, urn, or of any part thereof, or anything attached thereto, or any vestment, or other article interred, or intended to be interred with the human remains, is guilty of a class C felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (4) Every person who removes, disinters, or mutilates human remains from a place of interment,\n   <em>\n    without authority of law,\n   </em>\n   is guilty of a class C felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   RCW 68.50.140 (emphasis added). Southwick clearly \"remove[d] human remains.\" As the majority acknowledges, the only question is whether it did so \"without authority of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 42 Neither the plain language of RCW 68.50.140(4) nor the full statute within which it resides helps us interpret that phrase in this case. \"Authority of law\" is not defined in that statute. In fact, it is not defined anywhere in Title 68 RCW, even though it appears in two provisions of that title: RCW 68.50.140 (making it a felony to disinter human remains \"without authority of law\") and 68.24.190 (making it a misdemeanor to establish a roadway through cemeteries \"without authority of law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 43 The parties, of course, seize on the absence of a clear definition within the statute or the chapter to argue for their own interpretations. Southwick argues that it acted with \"authority of law\" when it moved the urn garden because a different statute in that title grants it police\n   powers to enforce its own rules and regulations and \"the ordinances of the city and county\" (remember, Southwick moved the cremains to comply with the City's assertion of its property right). That statute, RCW 68.56.060, gives the cemetery\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   the authority of a police officer for the purpose of maintaining order,\n   <em>\n    enforcing the rules and regulations of the cemetery association,\n   </em>\n   the laws of the state, and the ordinances of the city or county, within the cemetery over which he or she has charge, and within such radius as may be necessary to protect the cemetery property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Southwick argues that its own rules specifically reserve to it \"the right to correct errors made by it in making interments, disinterments or removals,\" so it had \"the right to remove and reinter the remains in the property\" under this police-powers statute. Appellant Southwick, Inc.'s Pet. for Review at 5-6 (quoting Admin. Record (AR) at 163). Southwick also asserts that it had \"authority of law\" to move the urn garden because the City demanded access to its easement for critical public health purposes-a demand premised on a lawful property right. Appellant Southwick's Opening Br. at 15 (citing AR at 163).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 44 The majority disagrees. In the absence of a resident definition of \"without authority of law,\" it argues that a different statute requires Southwick to notify the decedent's next of kin when his or her cremains are moved, so that other statute-in a different chapter-negates any \"authority of law\" Southwick might have had under RCW 68.56.060, even though the former statute makes no reference to the latter statute. Majority at 696, 698 (citing RCW 68.50.220 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 45 Neither interpretation of RCW 68.50.140(4) is perfect. Southwick's interpretation does not address the existence of RCW 68.50.220 at all. The majority's interpretation ignores the fact that the Department could have charged Southwick with failing to notify next of kin in violation of RCW 68.50.220 -which is not a criminal statute and which\n   cross-references RCW 68.50.200 and 68.50.210, but not RCW 68.50.140(4) -but did not. The Department charged Southwick\n   with disinterring cremains \"without lawful authority\" in violation of RCW 68.50.140(4). To reach its result, the majority has to make the interpretive leap that a violation of RCW 68.50.220 (in one chapter of Title 68 RCW) abrogates the \"authority of law\" that RCW 68.56.060 (in another chapter of Title 68 RCW) gave Southwick to govern and police its cemetery, so that Southwick now acted without such authority in violation of criminal statute RCW 68.50.140(4). To repeat, neither interpretation of the undefined term \"without authority of law\" is perfect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 46 We might then turn to our prior case law to help interpret the phrase \"without authority of law\" to see if that supplies the clarity that Title 68 RCW lacks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

This also weighs in favor of interpreting the statutory phrase \"without authority of law\" against the government and in favor of Southwick's position that using its delegated police powers to accommodate the City's lawful demand for access to its property was not without authority of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 58 After examining the statute's plain language and context, RCW 68.50.140(4) 's phrase \"without authority of law\" is ambiguous as applied to Southwick's actions. We must resolve that phrase's ambiguity against the government. Southwick's actions cannot, therefore, be deemed to have been taken \"without authority of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 59 I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Fairhurst, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Laws of 1909, ch. 249, \u00a7 239.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The relocation would allow the City unimpeded access to water pipes that supplied water to 90 percent of its residents.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
