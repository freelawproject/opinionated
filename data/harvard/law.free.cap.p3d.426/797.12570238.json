Huckins ultimately pled guilty to a reduced charge of felony harassment. Although Huckins does not seek reversal of his conviction, he contends that the trial court violated the pretrial release rule, CrR 3.2(d)(6), and his constitutional rights by ordering bail he could not afford without doing the analysis required by the rule. He also challenges several provisions of his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Despite its mootness, we address the issue of bail because it is of continuing and substantial public interest. We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider less restrictive conditions than monetary bail. We remand to the trial court to strike the portion of Huckins's sentence that was based on a statute that did not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. INCIDENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 On November 15, 2016, Huckins, while in his residence, threatened to stab his roommate. Huckins was upset because his Facebook account had been hacked, and he suspected his roommate of being involved. Police responded to the residence. They questioned Huckins and arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II. BAIL HEARING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 The State charged Huckins with assault in the second degree, a domestic violence allegation. Huckins first appeared in court the day after his arrest. An attorney who was present represented him at the hearing for the purpose of setting bail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State requested that the trial court set bail in the amount of $5,000. The State based its recommendation on Huckins's misdemeanor domestic violence conviction from the previous April and the current allegations of threatening a roommate with a knife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It also requested an order forbidding Huckins from contacting the victim and requiring him to stay at least 1,000 feet from his residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Huckins's attorney stated that he would be investigating a possible alibi defense and that he questioned the categorization of the case as domestic violence. He also pointed out that Huckins had complied with prior restraining orders against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Huckins stated that his only source of income was social security disability (SSD) for his mental disability. His defense attorney suggested that, under\n   <em>\n    Wakefield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court had to consider that Huckins had no money to post bail. The State argued that it was not requesting bail out of concern for Huckins failing to appear, but based on his recent assault conviction and the nature of the allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 The court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [I]t's just the actual, the fact that he was convicted of a domestic violence assault last year and this year he's charged with another domestic violence assault, a more serious one, again, is the Court's concern, and I'm a little bit nervous about just releasing him because I don't really understand this whole thing and it did involve, allegedly, somebody being told that he was going to get stabbed in the gut with a knife that was pulled on him, which does not sound good to the Court. I think what I'm going to do is, I may change my mind on this but at this point I'm going to set a small amount of bail. I know it's less than the State is seeking but I'm going to set bail at $1,000.00. I think to Mr. Huckins that would be a lot of money and I might give some thought to the special report calendar, especially if I knew a little more about what Mr. Huckins was doing, if he's actively engaged in some sort of treatment or counseling and I guess I'm a little bit concerned about what his relationship is with this house and what he has there, if his possessions are there and that kind of thing and I don't need to know all that right today but it just seems like those are the kind of the issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Report of Proceedings (RP) at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 The court then entered an order setting conditions of release pending trial. It used a form with the preprinted language \"THE COURT HAVING DETERMINED that release on personal recognizance will not reasonably assure his/her appearance, or there is a danger that Defendant will commit a violent crime or interfere with the administration of justice, IT IS ORDERED that:\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 48. The court then checked boxes that stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1.

PLEA AND SENTENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 10 Huckins did not post bail and remained in custody. On January 3, 2017, Huckins pled guilty to the reduced charge of felony harassment and he received credit for time served of fifty-four days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 11 The trial court also sentenced Huckins to twelve months of community custody with conditions, including that he comply with the statutory requirements of RCW 9.94A.120(8)(b)(c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The court waived all discretionary and mandatory legal financial obligations because Huckins \"has been on SSD all his life, has never worked, has only a $733 a month income from S.S.D., has no assets and has had mental health issues including PTSD and bi-polar disorder which precludes future employment.\" CP at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 12 The trial court observed that it was unsure whether it had the authority to waive Department of Corrections (DOC) supervision fees and stated that it would not do so. Huckins requested a stay of all financial obligations associated with community custody supervision and other costs associated with DOC and the court suggested that Huckins appeal because it did not believe it had the authority to waive them. The judgment and sentence did not impose DOC or community custody-related financial obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 13 Huckins appeals the trial court's bail order and his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I. MOOTNESS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 14 Huckins contends that we should consider his bail arguments on the merits despite their mootness. He contends that the bail rule and constitutional violations in this case raise questions of continuing and substantial public interest that are likely to arise again but evade review. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 15 \"A case is moot if a court can no longer provide effective relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Orwick v.

The proper interpretation and application of the bail rule is relevant to all criminal cases and there is currently a dearth of cases on point. Deciding this issue would provide useful guidance and assistance to all judges who have a duty to set release conditions for criminal defendants. The setting of release conditions is likely to recur. Additionally, given the time constraints inherent in criminal cases, the issue might otherwise evade appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 18 The Supreme Court recently accepted review of a moot bail case because \"the proper form of bail is a matter of continuing and substantial public interest, overcoming any claim of mootness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v.

It argues that \"the defendant may file a motion to reduce bail or for release on personal recognizance and the court's decision on that motion will be a final decision which is subject to discretionary review.\" Br. of Resp't at 6. However, the State does not suggest how this alternative method of obtaining appellate review implicates the factors we consider in determining whether bail presents an issue of continuing and substantial public interest. Nor does it address that the issue may evade appellate review given the time constraints inherent in criminal cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 20 We review Huckins's arguments on the merits, because bail presents a matter of continuing and substantial public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   II.

PRESUMPTION OF RELEASE ON PERSONAL RECOGNIZANCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 21 Huckins contends that the trial court failed to follow the presumption of release on personal recognizance as stated in CrR 3.2. He claims that the trial court did not make sufficient findings to overcome the presumption because it did not find that there was a \"substantial danger\" that Huckins would commit a violent crime.

This condition may be imposed\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   no less restrictive condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure the safety of the community. If the court determines under this section that the accused must post a secured or unsecured bond, the court shall consider, on the available information, the accused's financial resources for the purposes of setting a bond that will reasonably assure the safety of the community and prevent the defendant from intimidating witnesses or otherwise unlawfully interfering with the administration of justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   CrR 3.2(d)(6) (emphasis added). The condition of monetary bail may only be imposed if no less restrictive condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure the safety of the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 32 Here, before setting bail at $1,000, the trial court did not make any effort to ascertain a less restrictive condition or combination of conditions that would reasonably assure the safety of the community, as required by CrR 3.2(d)(6). However, the court stated it was willing to reconsider its bail decision if Huckins was actively engaged in treatment or counseling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It additionally restricted Huckins's\n   travel and prohibited him from having contact with the victim, using or possessing any controlled substances, and violating any criminal law. The court did not make any oral or written finding that these or other conditions, without the $1,000 bail, would be insufficient to reasonably assure the safety of the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 33 The court did not comply with the requirements of CrR 3.2(d)(6). Its offer to reconsider if Huckins was in treatment or counseling did not override CrR 3.2(d)(6) 's requirement that monetary bail only be ordered if no less restrictive condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure the safety of the community. Thus, the court abused its discretion by requiring monetary bail without considering less restrictive conditions as required by the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   IV. SENTENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 34 First, we consider Huckins's request that we strike the requirement that he comply with RCW 9.94A.120(8)(b)(c) on the basis that the statute does not exist. The State concedes this point. Because the statute does not exist, we strike this requirement of his judgment and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 35 Second, we consider Huckins's argument that the trial court erred by ruling it did not have the authority to waive community custody supervision costs. However, despite its statements on the record, the trial court did not impose them in the written judgment and sentence. Because the costs are not on the judgment and sentence, we do not consider this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 36 Washington is a written order state.\n   <em>\n    State v.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 37 We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider less restrictive conditions than monetary bail. Because Huckins does not seek reversal of his conviction, our opinion on the issue of setting release conditions serves to emphasize that courts must comply with the criminal rules when setting bail. We remand to the trial court to strike the portion of Huckins's sentence that is based on a statute that does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Bjorgen, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Lee, A.C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <em>\n     City of Richland v.
