Doty-Perez (Tonya) appeals from an order finding Arizona Revised Statute (A.R.S) section 25-409(C)(2) (2018) unconstitutional as applied. For the reasons that follow, this court vacates that finding and remands for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Tonya and Susan Doty-Perez (Susan) were married in Iowa in 2011, at a time when Iowa recognized same-sex marriage but Arizona did not. Later, the couple moved to Arizona and decided to adopt four children. At that time, Arizona law did not allow joint adoption by a same-sex couple. Accordingly, Tonya alone adopted the four children after the parental rights of the biological parents had been terminated. Although Tonya and Susan jointly parented the children, and the children treat them both as parents, Tonya was and is the only legal parent of the children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-401(4) (\" 'Legal parent' means a biological or adoptive parent whose parental rights have not been terminated.\") (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The relationship between Tonya and Susan later deteriorated and, on April 14, 2015, Susan filed a Petition of Dissolution of Marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After\n   <em>\n    Obergefell v.

Tonya argues: (1) Susan lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) ; (2) the superior court was required to dismiss Susan's request for third-party visitation because the children were not \"born out of wedlock\" as required by A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) ; and (3) the statute is constitutional under the rational basis test.

She is not a member of any possible class that could be potentially suspect by application of this statute.\" Factually, that may be true. But as Tonya also notes, \"a litigant may be accorded standing to assert the constitutional rights of a third person only if the litigant has a substantial relationship to the third person, the third person is unable to assert the constitutional rights on his or her own behalf, and failing to grant the litigant standing would dilute the third person's constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Kerr v.

Applying those concepts here, Susan has a substantial relationship to the children, the children are unable to assert constitutional rights on their own and failing to recognize Susan as having standing would dilute the children's asserted constitutional rights. Accordingly, on this record, Susan has standing to challenge the constitutionality of A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"216918\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/197/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, the court applies the rational basis test to Susan's challenge. In doing so, the court discusses various possible applications of the statute, starting with examples of how A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) treats adopted and biological children similarly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Where A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) Treats Adopted And Biological Children Similarly.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11 Susan argues that, under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) as construed by\n   <em>\n    Sheets\n   </em>\n   , biological \"children can become subject to a third-party visitation petition under certain circumstances. Adopted children, on the other hand, can\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   receive the benefits of third-party visitation.\" So far as it goes, this is a fair summary of the law. But examining various examples, in the context used by the superior court, further explains the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 12 The superior court focused on an adult's ability to seek third-party visitation under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) comparing adopted children and biological children. This comparison merits further discussion here, starting with the children Tonya adopted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 After their adoption by Tonya, the children were deemed \"born in wedlock\" under\n   <em>\n    Sheets\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041786\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/55/\">\n    238 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   56 \u00b6 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041786\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/55/\">\n    356 P.3d at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , barring Susan's third-party visitation request under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2). On the record presented, however, there is no showing that the children were \"born out of wedlock\" before Tonya adopted them. If the children were born in wedlock and not adopted, no one could seek third-party visitation under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2). Accordingly, the record in this case does not compel a conclusion that Tonya's adoption barred Susan's third-party visitation request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 Turning to biological children, in finding the statute unconstitutional, the superior court concluded that, if Susan and Tonya \"were divorcing and the children were naturally born to [Tonya], [Susan] would have no difficulty petitioning for visitation rights to the children.\" Recognizing that statement is based on hypothetical facts not presented in this case, it also turns on when the children in that hypothetical were born and other important details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15 If Tonya had given birth to the children\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   her marriage to Susan, the children would have been born in wedlock. In that case, there could be no claim the children were born \"out of wedlock\" as is required under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2). Accordingly, there would be no third-party visitation rights for the same reason Susan has no third-party visitation rights given Tonya's adoption of the children (because the children would not be \"born out of wedlock\" as required by A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16 If Tonya had given birth to the children\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   she was married to Susan, whether the statute would allow Susan to seek third-party visitation rights would turn on Tonya's marital status when each child was born. If Tonya was married to someone else at the time of their births, the children would have been born in wedlock. Accordingly, there would be no third-party visitation rights for the same reason Susan has no third-party visitation rights given Tonya's adoption of the children (because the children would not be \"born out of wedlock\" as required by A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 Each of these examples treats adopted and biological children the same, creating no basis for a constitutional challenge alleging similarly situated groups are being treated differently. On the record presented, there is no reason to believe that these examples fail to cover all possibilities presented in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Where A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) Treats Adopted And Biological Children Differently.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18 To continue with a final example, if Tonya had given birth to the children when she was not married, the children would be \"born out of wedlock\" for purposes of A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2). In that event, if Susan also could allege the children's \"legal parents are not married to each other at the time the petition is filed,\" she could seek third-party visitation under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C). The question, then, is whether that possibility (which is not presented by the facts of this case) means that A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C), or at least the \"born out of wedlock\" requirement of that statute, is unconstitutional under the rational basis test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19 Under rational basis scrutiny, a statute will be upheld \"if it has any conceivable rational basis to further a legitimate governmental interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

Particularly given this long-standing statutory declaration, in enacting A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C) far more recently, the Legislature is presumed to have known that third parties generally would not be able to seek visitation of an adopted child under that statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wareing v.

A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(E). Susan adds that \"[i]f a court wanted to prevent a third party from obtaining \u00a7 25-409 visitation, the appropriate route would be to find the visitation to be against the child's best interests-not to remove adopted children from \u00a7 25-409 's ambit entirely.\" The issue, however, is whether the statute as enacted by the Legislature is constitutional as applied.

On this record, Susan has not shown that A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) fails to rationally further Arizona's legitimate interests or that the distinctions it makes are irrelevant to the achievement of those legitimate interests. Accordingly, because A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) as applied satisfies the rational basis test, the superior court's finding that it is unconstitutional is vacated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186894\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/306/\">\n    199 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   313 \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186894\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/306/\">\n    18 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   107 ;\n   <em>\n    Graville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"252280\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/195/119/\">\n    195 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   126 \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"252280\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/195/119/\">\n    985 P.2d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 26 Notwithstanding this conclusion, it merits acknowledging the truth in Susan's assertion that application of A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C)(2) as written may yield harsh results. That is true here. And it would be true in other cases where, for example, a child adopted by one parent has lived with that parent and his or her spouse for many years but, in a divorce, the non-adoptive spouse is barred from seeking visitation rights of any sort. Although this case involves a same-sex marriage, potentially harsh results could also occur in opposite-sex marriages and in both same- and opposite-sex unmarried relationships. Accepting Susan's assertions as true, however, absent a constitutional infirmity, it is for the Legislature not this court to make those policy determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
