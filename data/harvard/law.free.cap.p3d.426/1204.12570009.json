Specifically, McKinney (1) committed the murder with the expectation of pecuniary gain pursuant to former A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703(F)(5) (now \u00a7 13-751(F)(5) ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) he killed Mertens in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner, pursuant to \u00a7 13-751(F)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 McKinney proved several mitigating circumstances. The record shows that he endured a horrific childhood. At the sentencing hearing, McKinney's sister and aunt testified that McKinney was verbally and physically abused by his stepmother. McKinney also experienced severe neglect. His stepmother frequently deprived him of food, forced him to live in filthy conditions and wear soiled clothes, and regularly locked him out of the home in extreme temperatures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKinney V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087712\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/798/#p804\">\n    813 F.3d at 805-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (summarizing McKinney's evidence regarding childhood abuse and neglect).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 McKinney also suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (\"PTSD\") at the time of the murders. Dr. Mickey McMahon, a clinical psychologist, evaluated McKinney and testified that McKinney's PTSD was caused by the abuse and trauma he experienced as a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Given the aggravating circumstances in this case, we conclude that McKinney's mitigating evidence is not sufficiently substantial to warrant leniency. In weighing McKinney's mitigation evidence, we take into account the fact that it bears little or no relation to his behavior during Mertens' murder. For example, Dr. McMahon testified that due to the PTSD, he believed that McKinney would \"rather withdraw from [a] situation\" in which he might encounter violence, and that his evaluation of McKinney \"did not indicate that he was [a] thrill-seeking kind of person\" who would murder someone in cold blood. However, McKinney's actions during the Mertens murder were planned and deliberate. Specifically, McKinney entered Mertens' home armed with a gun and knowing she was inside (because her car was parked outside). Additionally, after invading Mertens' home, he intentionally beat, stabbed, and shot her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 We accord McKinney's remaining mitigation minimal weight. For example, he argues that his age (twenty-three) at the time of the murders is a mitigator warranting leniency. In deciding how heavily to weigh a defendant's age in mitigation, we consider the \"defendant's level of intelligence, maturity, involvement in the crime, and past experience.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1505997\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/186/20/#p30\">\n    186 Ariz. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1505997\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/186/20/#p30\">\n    918 P.2d 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1048 (1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 Here, McKinney was the leader in planning and executing the burglaries and expressed a willingness to kill to make them successful. We therefore give little weight to McKinney's age.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544844\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/216/56/\">\n    216 Ariz. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72 \u00b6 82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544844\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/216/56/\">\n    163 P.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022 (2007) (\"Age is of diminished significance in mitigation when the defendant is a major participant in the crime, especially when the defendant plans the crime in advance.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 McKinney also argued at sentencing that residual doubt as to his guilt calls for leniency. However, this Court has previously stated that \"[o]nce a person is found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, claims of innocence or residual doubt do not constitute mitigation for sentencing purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048487\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/222/1/\">\n    222 Ariz. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 \u00b6 133,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048487\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/222/1/\">\n    213 P.3d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 In contrast to the proffered mitigation, the (F)(5) aggravator weighs heavily in favor of a death sentence.

McKinney and Hedlund targeted McClain as a victim in order to rob him. Additionally, as was the case for the Mertens murder, McKinney had previously stated his intent to kill anyone he encountered during the burglary, which was evidenced by the fact he and Hedlund were armed when they entered McClain's home and then shot the unarmed victim as he slept in his bed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 For the reasons discussed above, we affirm McKinney's death sentences.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703, the effective statute at the time of McKinney's crimes and first appeal, was renumbered as \u00a7 13-751 in 2008.
