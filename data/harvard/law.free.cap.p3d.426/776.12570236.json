The litigation ended in a settlement preserving the Bakers' claim for attorney fees for resolution by the trial court. Using the lodestar method, and a 1.3 multiplier, the trial court awarded the Bakers $1,209,757.25 for attorney fees and costs. The Bakers appeal and argue that the trial court erred in (1) failing to make them whole under\n   <em>\n    Olympic Steamship Co., v. Centennial Ins.

The Bakers opened the landfill in 1978 and operated it for six years until 1984. The Bakers purchased insurance policies for the landfill from Fireman's Fund covering the years between 1978 and 1986. The Bakers also purchased a three year policy from North Pacific Insurance Company, the predecessor to OneBeacon Insurance Company, in January 1986. OneBeacon cancelled this policy after only a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 3 The landfill received waste from a number of generators, including Snohomish County and incinerator ash from a Boeing waste-to-energy facility. After the ash was found to contain hazardous materials, the ash deliveries were stopped. In 1983, the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) found that leachate had escaped from the landfill. A year later, in 1984, the Snohomish Health District (SHD) suspended the Bakers' operating permit and ordered the Bakers to stop operating the landfill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 4 The landfill continued to be problematic after its closure. In August 2000, the SHD directed the Bakers to respond to the leachate problem and obtain a permit to perform closure activities in accordance with the SHD sanitary code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 5 In October 2000, the Bakers contacted Fireman's Fund about insurance coverage. Fireman's Fund responded and informed the Bakers that it had concluded that some or all of the claims alleged may not be covered and \"specifically reserve[d] the right to assert any and all defenses to coverage.\" The letter informed the Bakers that Fireman's Fund reserved the right to file a declaratory judgment action to determine coverage and that it would seek reimbursement for all monies paid toward the defense or representation if it was determined there was no coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 6 In May 2001, the SHD sued the Bakers alleging permit violations, violations of a SHD order, and nuisance. The Bakers appeared pro se and did not retain counsel. A default judgment was ultimately issued against the Bakers. The landfill was subsequently identified on Ecology's hazardous sites list and ranked a \"2\" out of a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 representing the highest level of concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 7 In November 2005, Fireman's Fund changed its coverage determination and agreed to participate in the \"defense of claims asserted against [the Bakers] by the SHD and DOE that the Landfill and adjacent property and/or associated groundwater are contaminated.\" It agreed to provide this defense subject to a full reservation of its rights. It also appointed Marten Law Group (Marten Law) to represent the Bakers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 8 In October 2006, Marten Law identified 12 waste generators and transporters who, by disposing potentially hazardous waste at the landfill, may have been potentially liable parties (PLPs). Marten Law identified several options for dealing with cleanup liability at the landfill including seeking contribution from the PLPs and settlement with the Ecology and Snohomish County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 9 In May 2007, the Bakers retained Hackett Beecher &amp; Hart (HBH) on a contingency fee agreement. The contingency agreement required the Bakers to pay HBH one-third of the \"gross amount recovered.\" With HBH as their attorney, the Bakers then filed suit against Fireman's Fund and one of the PLP's identified by Marten Law. The Bakers alleged that Fireman's Fund (1) breached its contractual duties to investigate, defend, and indemnify them for costs incurred under the Model Toxic Control Act (MTCA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , (2) acted negligently and in bad faith, and (3) engaged in unfair claims settlement practices in violation of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In May 2008, Fireman's Fund agreed to the Bakers' request to fund legal action against the PLPs using Marten Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 10 In April 2009, after Fireman's Fund unsuccessfully moved to sever the Bakers' insurance-related claims from claims against PLPs, the parties stipulated, at the trial\n   court's direction, that \"actions or positions taken by [Fireman's Fund] in [its] own defense as parties to this suit ... shall not be used or referred to in any way in connection with any of the causes of action [the Bakers] have asserted or will assert against [Fireman's Fund].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 11 In December 2009, in an effort to avoid foreclosure, the Bakers asked Fireman's Fund if it would pay the Bakers' outstanding property tax bill of $70,286.14. Fireman's Fund agreed and promptly paid the bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 12 From August 2010 until the summer of 2013, the Bakers' case against Fireman's Fund was pending but inactive. This was because of the lengthy time periods necessary to gather environmental data, present findings to Ecology, await the Ecology's opinion, and then gather more data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 13 In July 2014, the court continued trial to March 2015 and ordered the parties to mediate within 30 days of receiving Ecology's opinion on environmental remediation. The parties received Ecology's opinion letter in December 2014, and began mediation in January 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 14 Over the course of three mediation sessions, the parties resolved their disputes. The first settlement agreement resolved the disputes over the landfill remediation between the Bakers, Snohomish County, and two PLPs. Under this settlement, Snohomish County agreed to take ownership and full responsibility for remediating the landfill and closing it in return for payments on behalf of the Bakers and the two PLPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 15 The Bakers and Fireman's Fund then resolved their dispute by entering a settlement agreement, buy back of insurance policies, and release of all claims. In exchange for monetary payments, the Bakers agreed to release all claims against Fireman's Fund. The settlement, however, left open the Bakers' ability to separately pursue attorney fees through the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-22\">\n   Nothing in this Agreement shall foreclose the Bakers' ability to pursue attorney fees from Fireman's Fund based on\n   <em>\n    Olympic Steamship,\n   </em>\n   alleged Consumer Protection Act (CPA) violations, and/or bad faith, which attorney fee claim will be resolved on motion practice in the Lawsuit. The Bakers will file their motion for their claim for fees within 10 days of this fully executed Agreement, or as soon as practicable thereafter given the court's and the parties' availability for hearing the motion. The parties agree to abide by the briefing schedule set forth in CR 56(c), i.e., the Bakers' motion shall be filed not later than 28 calendar days before the hearing, any opposition shall be filed not later than 11 calendar days before the hearing, and any rebuttal shall be filed not later than five (5) calendar days before the hearing. For purposes of the Bakers' motion for attorney fees, CPA violations need not be proven, although Fireman's Fund makes no concessions that a specific fee entry relates to the CPA claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 16 Consistent with the settlement, on June 10, 2016, the Bakers petitioned the trial court for an award of their attorney fees and costs. The petitions sought fees pursuant to either\n   <em>\n    Olympic Steamship\n   </em>\n   , the CPA, or under equity due to bad faith. The Bakers asked the court to apply the lodestar method as the proper measurement of reasonable attorney fees. In support, the Bakers offered declarations from several local attorneys in support of a reasonable hourly rate, along with time records to support the number of hours billed. Under the lodestar method, the Bakers sought $1,147,435 in attorney fees. The Bakers asked the trial court to apply a \"liberal multiplier\" of 2.5 times the base amount in recognition of the unusual, difficult and risky nature of the litigation. The Bakers requested a total of $2,875,177 in attorney fees and costs. The trial court entered findings and conclusions concurring that the Baker's requested hourly rates were reasonable but reducing some of the hours billed for matters it deemed either unnecessary or inappropriate. The court determined that the proper lodestar amount was $930,582.50. The court then used a 1.3 times multiplier concluding that \"it is appropriate to take into account the exceptionally long pendency of this case during which time HBH received no payment of fees or reimbursement for costs, the exceptionally favorable result which they obtained on behalf of their clients, and the\n   risk (albeit not large) that no recovery might be obtained.\" The court awarded the Bakers' $1,209,757.25 for reasonable attorney fees and $26,634.06 in reasonable costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 17 After the trial court denied the Bakers' motion for reconsideration, the Bakers appealed. Fireman's Fund cross appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 18 There are two relevant inquires in determining an award of attorney fees: first, whether the prevailing party is entitled to legal fees, and second, whether the award of attorney fees is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Public Util.

In essence, the Bakers assert that because the fee agreement with their attorneys wouldn't have obligated them to pay HBH one-third of the gross recovery from Fireman's Fund, any award of fees less than that amount does not make them whole. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    \u00b6 22 At the outset, we agree with the Bakers that the equitable purpose supporting an award of attorney fees under\n    <em>\n     Olympic Steamship\n    </em>\n    requires that the insured be made whole. As our Supreme Court has explained: \"when an insurer unsuccessfully contests coverage, it has placed its interests above the insured.

When the Bakers notified Fireman's Fund of the tax issue in December 2009, Fireman's Fund agreed to pay the long overdue bill within a week.

Because Fireman's Fund promptly paid the tax bill after being notified, and the property tax bill was at best tangential to the Bakers' claims against Fireman's Fund, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the 211.7 hours spent on the foreclosure issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Fees Related to PRP Claims\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    \u00b6 31 In May 2008, at the Bakers' request, Fireman's Fund agreed to pay Marten Law to prosecute claims against the PRPs. There is no dispute that Fireman's Fund paid Marten Law in full. The Bakers sought recovery for additional attorney fees by HBH for litigation against the PRPs. Fireman's Fund did not oppose some of the claimed fees including time spent attending depositions of witnesses related to the PRP claims, time spent reviewing discovery, or time spent for updates from Marten Law. Fireman's fund did, however, object to time spent by HBH for preparing for depositions, strategy and assessment of claims, hours spent reviewing documents that consultants prepared for Marten Law, and other duplicative tasks. The trial court agreed with Fireman's Fund that some of these hours should be excluded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    Fees related to [PLPs] which were pursued by [MLG] on behalf of [the Bakers], for 139.4 hours, in the amount of $58,292.50.

(OneBeacon contributed $300,000 to the County.)

The court explained:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    while this case was complicated by long delays in part due to waiting on decisions from the Washington State Department of Ecology, the number of parties, and the combination of claims, it did not present complex or novel issue with regard to the insurance coverage issues. Furthermore, the probability of ultimately prevailing on the coverage issues was high because of Fireman's Fund's lack of responsiveness to Plaintiffs' inquiries from 2001 to 2005 and early assertions that there was no coverage under the policies. There is no evidence that HBH was required to turn down other profitable work because of this case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    After considering the entire record, the court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs have established that a 2.5 multiplier is appropriate.

The trial court concluded: \"Based on the evidence presented, the hourly rates set forth above are reasonable for the type of legal work performed in this case in the Puget Sound legal community for attorneys and paralegals of similar skill, experience, and reputation.\" The trial court's determination of reasonable hourly rates was supported by substantial evidence and was not an abuse of discretion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    \u00b6 55 We affirm the trial court's fee award.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    WE CONCUR:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Stephen Dwyer\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    J.
