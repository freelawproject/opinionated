A.D. died as a result of her injuries, and the state indicted Barnes on seven charges, including manslaughter, based on A.D.'s death (Count One), and endangerment, a count \"relating to [E.F.], who was driving behind [A.D.]\" (Count Three). The indictment apparently did not include dangerous-nature allegations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but, on the day it was returned, the state filed an \"Allegation of Dangerous Nature of the Offense(s) Charged,\" alleging both counts one and three were of a dangerous nature. Anticipating the possibility of jury instructions on lesser-included offenses, this filing also provided, \"[T]he State alleges the lesser included offense is of a dangerous nature.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 At the close of trial in April 2018, the respondent judge instructed the jury on manslaughter and endangerment, and, consistent with jury instructions proposed by the state, advised the jury, \"The State has alleged\n   that the offenses in Count One, Manslaughter[,] and Count Three, Endangerment[,] are of a dangerous nature.\" The jury was also instructed on negligent homicide, as a lesser-included offense of manslaughter, but not that the state had alleged dangerousness as to that offense. Similarly, although the verdict forms included interrogatories on the issue of dangerousness for the offenses of manslaughter and endangerment, there was no dangerousness interrogatory for negligent homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The jury found Barnes not guilty of manslaughter, but guilty of the lesser-included offense of negligent homicide and some of the other charges alleged. It also found the offense of endangerment \"to be of a dangerous nature involving the use and/or discharge and/or threatening exhibition of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument, to wit a motor vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 After reading the verdicts, the respondent judge asked the jurors, \"[A]re these your verdicts and the verdicts of each of you?\" to which they collectively responded, \"Yes.\" The respondent then asked whether either side wished to have the jury polled, and the prosecutor responded that the state did not, but asked to approach the bench, where the following discussion ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: I don't-I didn't hear the Court read out the verdict as far as whether Count One was of a dangerous nature or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: Because we didn't put dangerous nature on homicide. And I'm not sure you can have dangerous nature negligent homicide. But it is dangerous nature as to the endangerment. So he's going into custody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: You can certainly have dangerous nature on negligent homicide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yeah, you can.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: Well, it didn't go to them on it. So that was the Court's mistake and that's how it went to the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Judge, I would ask that we ask them to ask-answer that question for us. That makes a huge difference in not just custody status but sentencing range.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: It makes a huge difference. But you think I can send them back now to make that decision?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: I would ask the Court [to] do that since we alleged dangerous nature as to manslaughter and any ... lessers given.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don't think you can do that. I mean it-the jury's verdict has been rendered. It's not an aggravating factor. It's something they have to consider and it has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury. The forms were approved by the parties. We evidently didn't catch that we didn't put it on the lesser.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 7 The respondent judge then reviewed the jury instructions to determine whether the jury had been instructed about dangerousness for the negligent homicide offense, even though the dangerousness interrogatory was missing from the verdict form. She then stated, \"We didn't instruct them on it. So I'm not going to send them back. And we can discuss it later as to what we're going to do. Sorry.\" The respondent then asked if the defense wished to have the jury polled and, after defense counsel said he did not, she discharged the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 8 The following week, the state filed a \"Request for Trial on Aggravating Factors,\" asking the respondent to \"empanel a jury in order to make a Dangerousness finding as to the Negligent Homicide conviction.\" Citing Rule 19.1, Ariz.

Sup. Ct. Order R-17-0002 (Aug. 31, 2017). According to Barnes, the\n   state waived \"the option of requesting a separate trial to determine sentencing allegations\" because \"the parties and the Court tried the case with an understanding that the interrogatories for dangerousness ... would be presented to the jury for consideration at the same time as they were to decide guilt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 10 Barnes maintained this procedure \"was with the agreement of the parties, and thus permitted by Rule 19.1 [ (a)(2) ],\" the respondent judge \"correctly ruled that the State's requested remedy\" of presenting the question to the jury after guilty verdicts were returned \"was impermissible,\" and the state \"is now collaterally estopped from securing a different procedure after the jury was released.\" Citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Larin\n   </em>\n   , we considered somewhat similar circumstances, albeit before amended Rule 19.1(a)(2), which would appear to permit modification of the procedure for bifurcated consideration of aggravating factors with the court's permission and by agreement of the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 14 In that case, the state argued on cross-appeal \"the trial court erred by 'refusing to submit dangerous offense enhancement interrogatories after the jury returned guilty verdicts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Larin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856798\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/202/\">\n    233 Ariz. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856798\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/202/\">\n    310 P.3d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The prosecutor in\n   <em>\n    Larin\n   </em>\n   recognized the omission while final instructions were being given, and, rather than seek to revise the verdict forms after the jury had retired to deliberate, she asked the court to instruct the jury on dangerousness in an aggravation phase, in the event Larin was found guilty of the offenses charged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. The court denied the request, noting that language in the Revised Arizona Jury Instructions (RAJIs) suggested a jury should be instructed on dangerousness and provided with an attendant interrogatory on a verdict form, during the guilt phase of trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 15 Consistent with our supreme court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060647\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/230/270/\">\n    230 Ariz. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060647\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/230/270/\">\n    283 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we agreed the trial court had erred in denying the state's request, vacated Larin's sentences, and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Larin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856798\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/202/\">\n    233 Ariz. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 36, 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856798\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/202/\">\n    310 P.3d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting the clear language of the rule, we held \"in a non-capital case, [former] Rule 19.1(b) require[d] that a sentencing\n   aggravator such as dangerousness should not be mentioned in jury instructions or otherwise during the guilt phase of the trial unless it is an element of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Larin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856798\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/202/\">\n    233 Ariz. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 34-36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856798\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/202/\">\n    310 P.3d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the 2018 amendment to the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the provision pertaining to noncapital sentencing allegations was moved to Rule 19.1(c), with some stylistic changes to the language, including the replacement of \"shall\" with \"must.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Rule 19.1(c)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   203 Ariz.

Alleging an \"agreement\" to modify the bifurcated procedure called for in Rule 19.1(c), Barnes asserts, without citation to authority, that the state \"was collaterally estopped from securing a different procedure after the jury rendered its verdict, recorded in open court, and was released.\" But unlike Barnes, the state does not characterize its submission of dangerousness during the guilt phase, as to voluntary manslaughter and endangerment, as an agreed-upon deviation from Rule 19.1(c). Instead, it concedes error, albeit harmless, under that rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 17 In another context, we have cautioned that contested, \"off-the-record conversations\" may be \"too feeble a reed\" to support a finding of waiver.\n   <em>\n    Choate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1502893\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/151/57/\">\n    151 Ariz. at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1502893\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/151/57/\">\n    725 P.2d at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the limited record available on special-action review, we are unwilling to find waiver or collateral estoppel based on the state's submission of jury instructions and verdict forms on dangerousness with respect to some allegations, and its inadvertent omission of a proposed dangerousness instruction or interrogatory with respect to negligent homicide, particularly when the state had filed a notice of dangerousness specifically for \"the lesser included offense.\" This simply does not support a conclusion, as urged by Barnes, that the state \"agreed\" all allegations of dangerousness would be tried in the guilt phase or would otherwise be \"waived.\" Just as the parties and court \"didn't catch\" the omission of a dangerousness interrogatory for negligent homicide, the inclusion of dangerousness at all, during the guilt phase of trial, appears to have simply reflected inattention to Rule 19.1(c), rather than an affirmative intention to deviate from its \"clear dictates.\"\n   <em>\n    Larin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856798\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/202/\">\n    233 Ariz. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856798\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/202/\">\n    310 P.3d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting, and disapproving, provision in 2012 RAJIs suggesting addition of dangerousness interrogatory to \"standard 'guilty/not-guilty' verdict form\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 18 For similar reasons, we reject Barnes's attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Larin\n   </em>\n   on the ground that, in that case, the jury had not been instructed on dangerousness as to any offense,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856798\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/202/\">\n    233 Ariz. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856798\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/202/\">\n    310 P.3d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , whereas the jury here had been instructed on dangerousness with respect to manslaughter and endangerment during the guilt phase of the trial. According to Barnes, the state seeks \"another trial to determine the Allegation of Dangerous Nature that was determined\n   by the first jury (albeit arguably as a result of the State's mistake to not request instructions and verdict forms for Dangerous Nature as to the lesser offense of Negligent Homicide).\" But this is little more than an assertion of collateral estoppel in a different guise. The jury in\n   <em>\n    Larin\n   </em>\n   never considered or resolved allegations that the charged offenses were dangerous because it was never asked to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 42. Likewise here, the jury never considered or \"determined\" the allegation that the negligent homicide was a dangerous offense because the issue was not before it. As addressed below, the absence of a finding as to dangerousness is not the equivalent of an acquittal on that allegation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b628-29;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

It is the dismissal of the original jury that necessitates the need to empanel a second one-not the state's failure to submit all dangerousness allegations during the guilt phase, as Barnes maintains, or its submission of any sentencing factors before verdicts on the substantive offenses were announced, as the state now contends. The state did not ask that the jury be dismissed and, as already addressed, the jury was not subject to mandatory dismissal, as Barnes argues, when the state asked the respondent judge to \"send them back\" to consider, on the existing record, whether negligent homicide was a dangerous offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b623-24;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corrales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1238852\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/26/344/#p345\">\n    26 Ariz.
