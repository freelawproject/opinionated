TRIAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 On February 23, 2014, Arndt and her boyfriend, Darcy Veeder Jr., spent the night at their friends' home.\n   <em>\n    State v. Arndt\n   </em>\n   , No. 48525-7-II, slip op. at 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206337458\">\n    2017 WL 6337458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wash. Ct. App. Dec. 12, 2017) (unpublished) (http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/). Late that night, the house caught fire.\n   <em>\n    Arndt\n   </em>\n   , No. 48525-7-II, slip op. at 2. Everyone in the home escaped except Veeder, who died.\n   <em>\n    Arndt\n   </em>\n   , No. 48525-7-II, slip op. at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 After an investigation, the State charged Arndt with murder in the first degree with an aggravating circumstance of arson in the first degree,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   felony murder in the first degree with aggravating circumstances,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   arson in the first degree, and six counts of assault in the second degree.\n   <em>\n    Arndt\n   </em>\n   , No. 48525-7-II, slip op. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 The trial court instructed the jury that \"[a] person commits the crime of murder in the first degree ... when, with a premeditated intent to cause the death of another person, he or she causes the death of such\n   person.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 169 (Instr. 9). It further instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Premeditated means thought over beforehand. When a person, after any deliberation, forms an intent to take human life, the killing may follow immediately after the formation of the settled purpose and it will still be premeditated. Premeditation must involve more than a moment in point of time. The law requires some time, however long or short, in which a design to kill is deliberately formed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   CP at 182 (Instr. 22). The jury found Arndt guilty as charged. The trial court sentenced Arndt to life in prison without the possibility of release or parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Arndt appealed her convictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. JUROR MISCONDUCT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 Months after the verdict, Juror 2 approached a woman whom she did not know was the sister of Arndt's trial attorney. Juror 2 related that in Arndt's trial, she struggled with the term \"premeditation.\" She further related that to better understand the term, she looked it up on the internet. The attorney's sister told her brother what she had learned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Defense investigator James Harris then met with Juror 2, explained that he worked for Arndt's trial attorney, and asked to speak with her about her experience as a juror. Juror 2 spoke with Harris and told him that during deliberations she did internet research on the word \"premeditation.\" Juror 2 provided Harris with additional information, including sites she may have viewed. The State's investigator also interviewed Juror 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 Arndt moved for a new trial on grounds of juror misconduct. At a hearing on the motion, the court heard testimony from Juror 2 and Harris. Juror 2 testified that she had researched the term \"premeditation\" and had found different sites, but did not remember whether she had viewed any of the specific sites she had showed Harris when he earlier interviewed her. She said \"I believe it was from Wedipedia [verbatim], whatever that does when you Google, and that's the definition.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) (Feb. 6, 2017) at 21. She stated that the \"key thing\" that stuck out to her in the definitions she viewed was that \"[o]ne of the definitions was about premeditation being short.\" RP (Feb. 6, 2017) at 24. She said that she looked at a couple different definitions, but it was the word \"short\" that made her understand. Juror 2 also testified that she had not shared her research with other jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 The trial court entered a written memorandum opinion with findings of fact\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and conclusions of law. The court made explicit credibility determinations. It found that during deliberations, Juror 2 performed an internet search for the definition of \"premeditation\" from her home. The trial court found it could not determine the exact websites and content Juror 2 had viewed. Juror 2 consistently said that the definitions she viewed included the word \"short\" or the phrase \"however short.\" CP at 136. The court found that Juror 2's sworn statements in court were more reliable than her out-of-court statements to the two investigators which were used in an attempt to impeach her in-court testimony. The court also found that Juror 2 had not shared her research with the other jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 The court concluded that Juror 2 had committed misconduct which created a presumption that Arndt was entitled to a new trial. It determined that it must grant a new trial unless it was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the extrinsic evidence Juror 2 found in her research did not contribute to the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, the facts show that Juror #2 conducted outside research on the definition of \"premeditation,\" and that the definitions she viewed included the word \"short\" or the phrase \"however short.\" In substance, the Court finds that the definitions viewed by Juror #2 were indistinguishable\n   to the jury instruction and were consistent with the law. Because the known research results, as presented to the Court, were consistent with the jury instruction on premeditation and the law, the Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Juror #2's research could not have affected the verdict. Therefore, the motion for a new trial is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   CP at 138. It stated \"[t]o base a decision for a new trial on what is 'not known' would be inapposite to the 'strong, affirmative showing' requirement and would endanger the stability of all jury verdicts. Therefore, this Court's decision relies on evidence that has been credibly presented, not on unknowns.\" CP at 138 n.49. Arndt appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I.

Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1182907\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/110/128/#p137\">\n    110 Wash.2d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=750%20P.2d%201257\">\n    750 P.2d 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=756%20P.2d%20142\">\n    756 P.2d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   C. PREJUDICE ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 35 I agree with the majority that the trial court's denial of Arndt's motion for a new trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. But I believe that the trial court abused its discretion here because the evidence did not support the court's crucial factual finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 36 The key, undisputed fact is that juror 2 did not know what definitions of \"premeditation\" she reviewed. In its memorandum opinion, the trial court specifically stated that \"[b]ased on the provided testimony and declarations, the exact websites and content that Juror #2 viewed is unclear.\" CP at 136.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 37 The trial court found that \"Juror #2's research resulted in her reviewing definitions of 'premeditation' that\n   <em>\n    included\n   </em>\n   the word 'short' or the phrase 'however short.' \" CP at 136-37 (emphasis added). But there was no evidence regarding what else the multiple definitions juror 2 viewed stated about premeditation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 38 This uncertainty regarding what juror 2 learned from her internet research necessarily precludes the State from establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that her research could not have affected the verdict. Without knowing the language of the multiple definitions of premeditation juror 2 viewed, it is impossible to know whether those definitions affected the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 39 Inexplicably, the trial court ignored the lack of evidence regarding the definitions juror 2 viewed during her internet research. Instead, the court made the following finding: \"In substance, the Court finds that the definitions viewed by Juror 2 were indistinguishable\n   to the jury instruction and were consistent with the law.\" CP at 138. This crucial finding is completely unsupported by the evidence. If the trial court did not know what definitions juror 2 viewed, how could the court find that the multiple definitions juror 2 viewed were indistinguishable from the jury instruction and consistent with the law? Because nobody knows what the definitions stated, it is possible that they were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   indistinguishable from the jury instruction and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   consistent with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 40 The trial court concluded, \"Because the\n   <em>\n    known research results\n   </em>\n   , as presented to the Court, were consistent with the jury instruction on premeditation and the law, the Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Juror #2's research could not have affected the verdict.\" CP at 138 (emphasis added). However, this conclusion ignores the\n   <em>\n    unknown\n   </em>\n   research results. The fact that the one phrase juror 2 remembered may not be inconsistent with the jury instruction cannot somehow support the conclusion that the unknown research results also were not inconsistent with the jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 41 The majority emphasizes the trial court's explanation for ignoring the fact that nobody knows what juror 2 viewed: \"To base a decision for a new trial on what is 'not known' would be inapposite to the 'strong, affirmative showing' requirement and would endanger the stability of all jury verdicts. Therefore, this court's decision relies on evidence that has been credibly presented, not on unknowns.\" CP at 138 n.49. But the trial court failed to recognize that the State had the burden of overcoming the presumption of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Boling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2515545\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/131/329/#p332\">\n    131 Wash. App. at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20P.3d%20740\">\n    127 P.3d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What was not known prevented the State from meeting that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 42 Further, the trial court mixed its concepts. The \"strong, affirmative showing\" requirement applies to whether\n   <em>\n    misconduct has occurred\n   </em>\n   , not whether that misconduct caused prejudice.\n   <em>\n    State v. Balisok\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"812822\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/123/114/#p117\">\n    123 Wash.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 117-18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20P.2d%20631\">\n    866 P.2d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). The trial court made an unchallenged finding that misconduct had occurred, satisfying the strong, affirmative showing requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 43 Finally, the majority relies on\n   <em>\n    State v. Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5750850\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/153/235/#p238\">\n    153 Wash. App. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=220%20P.3d%201245\">\n    220 P.3d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). But that case is easily distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   , a juror looked up the word \"substantial\" in a dictionary that she brought to the deliberations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 238,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=220%20P.3d%201245\">\n    220 P.3d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of a new trial motion because there was no showing of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 240,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=220%20P.3d%201245\">\n    220 P.3d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, in that case the trial court knew exactly what definition the juror viewed. Here, the trial court acknowledged that what definitions of premeditation juror 2 reviewed was unclear and unknown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 44 When the evidence is insufficient to determine what extrinsic evidence a juror considered when engaging in misconduct, allocation of the burden of proof necessarily resolves the issue. Because the State has the burden of proving that no prejudice occurred, the absence of evidence should be fatal to its position. By ruling that the absence of evidence precluded a finding of prejudice, the trial court essentially shifted the burden of proof to Arndt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   D. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 45 The State could not satisfy its burden of disproving prejudice without more specific evidence regarding juror 2's internet search. As a result, the trial court clearly abused its discretion in denying Arndt's motion for a new trial. I would reverse and remand for a new trial untainted by juror misconduct.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
