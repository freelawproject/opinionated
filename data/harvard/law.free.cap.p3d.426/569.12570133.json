Later that night, he spoke with his ex-wife on the phone. There are no credible accounts of anyone seeing or speaking with Matt after that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b64 Although it was not unusual for Matt to be out of contact for a few days, his absence stretched into weeks, and friends and family members became concerned. The Butte-Silver Bow Police Department began investigating Matt's disappearance in mid-December.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 Investigators looked for Matt at the small cabin in which he lived on his mother's property near Butte. Matt's mother, who suffered from dementia, was unable to provide any assistance. Inside Matt's cabin, the investigators discovered blood spatter and signs that someone had attempted to clean it up. However, they did not locate Matt; searches of the property and surrounding area were fruitless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b66 Investigators also interviewed Matt's friends and family. The police learned Matt's son, Adam, had recently been seen driving Matt's pick-up truck around Butte. They questioned Adam, who claimed Matt had loaned him the truck. Adam denied knowing his father's whereabouts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 In late December, Adam parked Matt's truck on a street in Butte after it sustained front-end damage that made it undriveable. On December 24, 2008, the police obtained a search warrant for the truck and had it towed for the crime lab to examine it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 In October 2010, a hiker found a partial human skull in the Maney Lake area. In November 2013, investigators identified the partial skull as Matt's. In 2014, authorities arrested Adam and charged him with deliberate homicide. No other remains were found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 Adam was first tried for Matt's homicide in April 2015. After the jury failed to reach a verdict, the court declared a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 The State determined to retry Adam. During a pre-trial conference on January 29, 2016, Adam's counsel objected to the State's plan to call and later recall two law enforcement witnesses on direct examination, arguing this strategy would either limit his ability to effectively cross-examine the witnesses' credibility or would force him to ask the same questions multiple times. The State explained its purpose in recalling these witnesses was to allow them to testify to the progress of their investigation in chronological order, since the investigation into Matt's disappearance and death spanned several years. The State maintained these witnesses would testify to different subject matter each time they took the stand. The District Court overruled Adam's objection pursuant to M. R. Evid. 611(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 The District Court also informed the parties pre-trial that its practice was to not allow \"speeches\" with objections during testimony. It explained, \"The objection is, objection, hearsay; objection, relevancy. If you would like to discuss that further, you will ask for a sidebar with the Court. The sidebars are unrecorded. ... [A]t the next break, if you\n   would like to make your record as to what your objection would be, you are clearly allowed to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 The second trial began on February 8, 2016. It continued for seven days, during which time the District Court, consistent with its earlier pronouncement, disallowed \"speeches\" with objections, making evidentiary rulings during unrecorded sidebars. The court also conferred with the parties' respective counsel at the bench, in the courtroom but outside the presence of the jury, and in chambers on numerous occasions. Some of these conferences were on the record; most were not. The record usually does not indicate whether Adam attended these conferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 Among the witnesses testifying at trial were Heather Jenner and George Paul Holland. Jenner is a forensic scientist specializing in latent print and footwear examination who works at the State of Montana Forensic Science Division. Jenner testified as to the identification of a partial shoeprint found on a board in Matt's cabin. Holland is a detective lieutenant with the Butte-Silver Bow Police Department, who testified regarding evidence, including blood spatter evidence,\n   found in Matt's cabin and truck. Hatfield's counsel did not object to Jenner testifying as a footwear expert nor to Holland testifying as a blood spatter expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 On February 18, 2016, the jury found Hatfield guilty of deliberate homicide. On September 20, 2016, the District Court sentenced Hatfield to the custody of Montana State Prison for life, crediting him for 944 days served. Hatfield appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 This Court generally does not address issues raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Did the District Court violate Adam's right of presence and thus commit reversible error?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 Adam alleges he was not included in several sidebars and in-chambers discussions during his trial, and claims his right of presence was thereby violated 23 times. He argues his absence curtailed his ability to fully participate in his defense, thus rendering his trial fundamentally unfair and constituting structural error, which would entitle him to a new trial. Acknowledging his trial counsel did not object to his exclusion from these conferences, Adam urges us to apply the plain error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 The State disagrees with Adam's position, first arguing the record does not prove Adam was excluded from 23 conferences. The State next argues that, even if this Court determines Adam's right of presence was violated, the violation does not amount to structural error. The State further argues Adam has not met his burden to prove that failing to grant plain error review may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b622 First, we consider whether Adam has demonstrated he was absent from the conferences he cites. We have reviewed the transcripts and found the record is silent as to Adam's presence or absence in most instances. However, in eight instances, the transcript specifically\n   indicates the Judge and attorneys attended the conference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We believe,\n   had Adam also attended, the transcript would have noted his presence. Thus, we are satisfied the record supports Adam's contention he was not present in these eight instances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b623 Next, we consider whether Adam's absence from these conferences constitutes structural error. Adam argues his exclusion from various conferences throughout his trial made his trial fundamentally unfair, and meaningful appellate review of his case is impossible due to the lack of a record; thus structural error exists. The State argues any error was not structural and thus does not warrant automatic reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b624 Structural defects are constitutional violations which so infect and contaminate the framework of a trial as to render it fundamentally unfair, requiring automatic reversal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Charlie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742717\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/357/355/\">\n    2010 MT 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742717\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/357/355/\">\n    357 Mont. 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742717\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/357/355/\">\n    239 P.3d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). In previous cases regarding a defendant's right of presence, we have concluded that, even when the defendant was absent from a critical stage of the proceedings, the absence did not constitute structural error. In\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9, we held the defendant's absence from an in-chambers conference was not structural error, even though we considered the conference to be a critical stage of the proceedings. In\n   <em>\n    Charlie\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41, we held that although the District Court violated the defendant's right of presence from a critical stage of his case, the error was not structural. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Matt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3403319\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/347/530/\">\n    2008 MT 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3403319\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/347/530/\">\n    347 Mont. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3403319\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/347/530/\">\n    199 P.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (overruled in part by\n   <em>\n    Charlie\n   </em>\n   ), we held the defendant's right of presence had been violated at a critical stage of the proceedings when he was excluded from an in-chambers conference at the close of the State's case-in-chief, but further held this violation was not a structural error because the resultant rulings did not \"contaminate[ ] the trial mechanism along the lines that a biased judge, lack of counsel, an erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction, or a jury-selection error would.\" Similarly here, although the conferences at issue constitute a critical stage of the proceedings, any violation of Adam's right of presence is not a structural error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b625 We next consider whether Adam is entitled to plain error review. Adam admits his trial counsel did not object to his absence from these conferences, and thus he urges this Court to apply the plain error doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the absence of a timely objection in the trial court, the defendant must obtain review of a right of presence claim under one of the established methods, such as the plain error doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Reim\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40. Thus, we must consider whether to apply the plain error doctrine here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b628 Generally, an objection concerning constitutional matters must be raised before the trial court, and if the objection is not made, we will not review it on appeal. This Court's common-law power of plain error review is an exception to that rule.\n   <em>\n    Reim\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 38 (citations omitted). To obtain review under the plain error doctrine, the defendant must: (1) show the claimed error implicates a fundamental right; and (2) firmly convince this Court that failure to review the error would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    Reim\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 38 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b629 Adam has met the first factor since his right of presence is a fundamental right. The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment and the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United\n   States Constitution provide a criminal defendant the right to be present during criminal proceedings. Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution does the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b630 Thus, we consider whether Adam has met the second factor and firmly convinced us that failing to review the error would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. In an analysis of the threshold question of whether this Court should exercise plain error review of a right of presence claim, the defendant carries the burden to firmly convince this Court such review is warranted.\n   <em>\n    Reim\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41 (citation omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Reim\n   </em>\n   , the State moved for an order directing the deposition of an expert witness who would be unavailable to testify at trial. The State served notice of the deposition, specifically inviting\n   Reim and his counsel to attend. Reim's counsel attended, but Reim did not.\n   <em>\n    Reim\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22. At the start of Reim's trial, the State announced its intention to place a videotape and transcript of the deposition into evidence; neither Reim nor his counsel objected.\n   <em>\n    Reim\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23. On appeal, we determined Reim had not persuaded us plain error review was warranted because he had not explained how he could have meaningfully contributed to his counsel's cross-examination of the deposed witness.\n   <em>\n    Reim\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b631 Here, we consider whether, as Adam maintains, his trial was fundamentally unfair because he was excluded from conferences and the conferences were unrecorded. The State argues that in five of these eight instances,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   although the conferences were not on the record, the timing of these conferences indicates they were likely administrative matters, such as the scheduling of witnesses. We agree. These five conferences occurred at natural breaking points: in one instance at the end of opening statements, in one instance at the end of direct examination, and in the other three instances at the conclusion of a witness's testimony. While these five conferences were not recorded, an administrative determination by the District Court, such as whether there is time to take another witness's testimony during that day of trial, is not a situation in which Adam could have meaningfully contributed to his counsel's determinations as to scheduling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b632 The State acknowledges the three remaining instances \"occurred during witnesses' testimony and may have involved evidentiary issues.\" However, the State points out Adam's counsel chose not to make a record about these conferences, although the District Court had emphasized that both parties had the opportunity to make a record during jury breaks. Adam argues it is precisely that lack of record which entitles him to review under the plain error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b633 In the first of the three conferences which may have involved evidentiary issues, the State moved to admit a video of a police interview of Adam in December 2008. Adam had no objection, but the District Court asked to see counsel for both parties in chambers. When they returned to the courtroom, counsel for the State said, \"[F]or purposes of the record ... this particular exhibit ... has been modified to remove some objectionable content.\" Adam's counsel confirmed on the record he agreed with the modifications. The court then played the video-edited from approximately 4 hours in length to approximately 2.5 hours in length-for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b634 In this instance, Adam, the interviewee, was present when the video was made. He was also present when the edited version was played for the jury. Thus, he knows the result of this evidentiary determination, as he knows what the jury saw and what it did not see. He does not argue on appeal that specific portions of this video were incorrectly included or excluded from the viewing. More to the point, he has not explained how he could have meaningfully contributed to the parties' determination as to which portions of the video to show or exclude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b635 The second of the three conferences occurred during the State's redirect examination of Dr. Walter Loren Kemp, a forensic pathologist, who testified about his examination of Matt's skull after it was submitted to Dr. Kemp's laboratory. Dr. Kemp opined the\n   damage to the skull was consistent with a baseball bat, and the State's counsel suggested he might diagram an explanation of his opinion to aid the jury's understanding. Adam's counsel interrupted the testimony and asked to approach the bench. The District Court granted permission, and counsel for both parties then proceeded to chambers with the Judge. After they returned to the courtroom, the State had no further questions for Dr. Kemp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b636 In this instance, although the conference was unrecorded, the context makes it clear Adam's counsel received a favorable evidentiary ruling which foreclosed the State's further exploration of Dr. Kemp's opinions regarding the cause of the damage to Matt's skull. While Adam argues he could have offered his counsel, who had not attended Adam's first trial, \"insights into evidentiary rulings,\" he acknowledges he had no personal knowledge of the expert witnesses; moreover, any insight Adam could have offered into Dr. Kemp would not have changed the result, as Adam's counsel apparently obtained a favorable evidentiary ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b637 The third conference occurred during the direct examination of Harley Erickson, a friend of Adam's. Adam's counsel asked Erickson what had occurred during a walk he took with Adam, and Erickson stated, \"Adam had told me ....\" The State objected for hearsay and the District Court sustained the objection. Adam's counsel asked to approach, and the court and counsel for both parties went into chambers with the Judge. Upon return, Adam's counsel resumed questioning, asking Erickson to testify \"without telling us what Adam told you that day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b638 Again, although the conference was unrecorded, the context leaves little doubt this was simply a ruling on hearsay testimony. Although Adam argues that in the case of lay witnesses, he could have\n   meaningfully contributed because he personally knew the witnesses, without something more specific, we do not see how he could have meaningfully contributed to the argument of an evidentiary ruling on hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b639 Although Adam's right of presence was violated during critical stages of the proceeding, thus implicating Adam's fundamental rights, we conclude Adam has not established plain error in his exclusion from conferences. Adam has not firmly convinced us that any error resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice, left unsettled the question of fundamental fairness of the trial, or compromised the integrity of the judicial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b640\n   <em>\n    2.

The State argued these two officers filled varying roles in the investigation over the course of six years, and it wanted the witnesses to testify chronologically. The State reasoned chronological order would allow a more cohesive narrative than having each witness testify about things that occurred across the span of the investigation. The District Court concluded such format was permissible under M. R. Evid. 611(d).

We have reaffirmed the principle that the State must point to the\n   <em>\n    record\n   </em>\n   to rebut the presumption of prejudice and must demonstrate \"that there is no reasonable possibility that the violation prejudiced the\n   defendant ...\n   <em>\n    based upon the record before us\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    Charlie\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 45 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10. \"Where the record shows that the defendant was not prejudiced, we have affirmed.\"\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24 (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, \"we have reversed where the lack of a complete record makes it impossible to say that there was no prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, this Court reviews \"the record on appeal\" and may not reverse \"by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\" Normally, the defendant establishes \"that the claimed error was prejudicial,\" but our precedent is clear that where \" 'the only means to meet that burden-the court record-was not preserved by reason of the commission of the error itself,' \" the record's deficit makes it impossible to conclude there was no prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tapson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 35 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b688 Accordingly, I dissent from the Court's decision finding \"the existing record supports the State's position that Adam suffered no prejudice.\" Opinion, \u00b6 44. Here, the trial error was pervasive and systematic. Further, it is evident that Adam was absent from conferences during which substantive trial issues were discussed. There is little dispute that the District Court erred when it excluded Adam from nearly twenty-five conferences during his trial. After a review of the record, there is also no legitimate dispute that the State failed to rebut the presumption of prejudice. Our harmless error precedent, putting aside whether it is appropriate in the context of presence violations, clearly requires the State to meet this burden. In my opinion, the State failed to do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b689 The Court should not try to salvage what cannot be saved. I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    I agree with the Court that, had Adam been present during the conferences, the transcript would have noted his presence. Opinion, \u00b6 22. Therefore, for purposes of analysis, Adam must be deemed absent from those conferences where his appearance is not noted by the court reporter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
