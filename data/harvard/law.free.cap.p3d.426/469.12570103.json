The charges were brought against Charles Capone following the disappearance of Rachael Anderson in April of 2010. Capone was convicted of all charges following a sixteen-day jury trial. In this appeal, Capone challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction and asserts that the district court erred in the admission of certain evidence and by denying his motion for new trial. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Capone and Anderson were married in September of 2009. The two separated that December and Anderson filed for divorce. Anderson began receiving harassing phone calls following the separation and her car was vandalized multiple times. At the time, Capone owned Palouse Multiple Services, a repair shop in Moscow, Idaho. Capone repaired Anderson's car after it was vandalized. Capone was working on Anderson's car on Friday, April 16, 2010. At the time, Anderson was driving a white Yukon that belonged to a friend of Capone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Anderson drove the Yukon to Capone's shop to pick up her car. Anderson became upset when she learned her car was not ready. Anderson went to run some errands while Capone continued to work on the car. Anderson bought some beer with Capone's debit card and then, according to Capone, ran off with a man named Vince. No one saw or heard from Anderson after her visit with Capone. Anderson was reported missing after she failed to show up for work the following Monday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 20, 2010, Capone was interviewed by the police. During this interview, Capone admitted that he had made the harassing phone calls to Anderson's phone. The following day, the Anderson family's search for her led to their discovery of the Yukon in Lewiston.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Anderson's purse was inside the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 6, 2010, Capone was arrested for a federal firearm violation unrelated to Anderson's disappearance. While incarcerated on this charge, Capone made several incriminating statements to cellmates Brent Glass and Joshua Voss about his role in Anderson's disappearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After an investigation that lasted for three years, on May 1, 2013, Capone and David Stone were charged with first degree murder and related crimes in connection with Anderson's disappearance. Following a preliminary hearing where both Capone and Stone were bound over on all charges, Stone entered into a plea agreement with the State in which he agreed to testify against Capone in exchange for dismissal of the murder charge against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before trial, the State filed a motion in limine regarding several evidentiary issues. The State sought to prevent Capone from introducing evidence of prior felony convictions to impeach the testimony of Glass and Voss. Pursuant to Idaho Rule of Evidence 404(b), the State also gave notice of its intent to use evidence of a past strangulation attempt and federal firearm crimes by Capone. After hearing argument, the district court ruled that Glass and Voss's prior felony convictions for burglary were not relevant to their credibility and reserved its ruling on the admissibility of the 404(b) evidence until trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, the State relied heavily on Stone's testimony. Stone testified that he was at Capone's shop on April 16, 2010. Capone went outside to talk with Anderson. Stone heard a noise and went outside to find Capone strangling Anderson. Anderson was still moving and Stone asked Capone what he was doing. Capone instructed Stone to get a tarp. Stone went inside and searched for a tarp. When he came back out, Anderson was dead. Stone testified that he and Capone wrapped Anderson's body in the tarp and a chain and drove to Lewiston, where they threw her body into the river from a bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury found Capone guilty of all charges. Following the verdict, Capone learned of a statement Stone made to Tyler Byers while the two were cellmates in July of 2013. Stone told Byers that they would not find Anderson's body in the river because she was not in the river. Capone filed a motion for a new trial based on this newly discovered information. After hearing the motion, the district court found that the new evidence did not merit a new trial as it was merely impeachment evidence and likely would not produce an acquittal. Capone timely appealed his conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Capone advances several arguments on appeal. Capone first argues that there was insufficient evidence to corroborate Stone's accomplice testimony as required by Idaho Code section 19-2117. Next, Capone argues that the failure to instruct the jury regarding the corroboration requirement constitutes fundamental error. Capone next asserts that the district court erred by admitting 404(b) evidence of Capone's prior convictions and an\n   alleged physical altercation between Capone and Anderson. Capone also argues that the district court erred when it found Glass and Voss's felony burglary convictions were not relevant to their credibility. Even if the individual errors are determined to be harmless, Capone contends that the doctrine of cumulative error requires reversal. Finally, Capone contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion for a new trial. These arguments will be addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. There was sufficient evidence to corroborate Stone's testimony.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Capone argues that Stone was an accomplice to the crimes of murder and failure to notify coroner or law enforcement of death and thus, Idaho law requires that his testimony be corroborated. The State concedes that Stone was an accomplice to the crime of failure to notify coroner or law enforcement of death and conspiracy to commit that crime, but contends that Stone was not an accomplice to the murder. We will first consider whether Stone was an accomplice to murder, then consider whether there was sufficient corroborating evidence for the crimes where Stone was an accomplice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Stone was not an accomplice to the murder.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Capone argues that Stone was an accomplice to the murder because while Anderson was still alive Capone instructed him to go and get a tarp and Stone followed that command. The State argues that Stone was merely a bystander and did not take any action that would make him an accomplice to murder. The State is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Idaho Code section 19-2117 states in pertinent part, \"[a] conviction cannot be had on the testimony of an accomplice, unless he is corroborated by other evidence, which in itself, and without the aid of the testimony of the accomplice, tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense .... \" I.C. \u00a7 19-2117. Accomplice is defined by Idaho Criminal Jury Instruction 313 as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   a person who intends to promote or assist in the commission of a crime and who either directly commits the acts constituting the crime or who, before or during its commission, aids, assists, facilitates, promotes, encourages, counsels, solicits, invites, helps or hires another to commit the crime. Mere presence at, acquiescence in, or silent consent to, the planning or commission of a crime is not [in the absence of a duty to act] sufficient to make one an accomplice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Where the evidence raises a genuine issue as to whether a witness is an accomplice, the district court must submit the issue to the jury for resolution and instruct the jury accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Matthews v.

Stone walked out of the shop and witnessed Capone strangling Anderson. Stone asked Capone what he was doing at which point Capone told him to get a tarp. When Stone left, Anderson was still moving and when he came back she was no longer moving. There is nothing in the record that suggests that Stone did anything to aid, abet, or encourage Capone to commit murder. Because Stone was not an accomplice to the murder, Stone's testimony concerning the murder was not required to be corroborated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2. There was sufficient evidence presented at trial to corroborate Stone's testimony for failure to notify coroner or law enforcement of death and conspiracy to commit failure to notify coroner or law enforcement of death.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Capone next argues that there was not sufficient corroborating evidence of Stone's testimony to support his convictions\n   for failure to notify coroner or law enforcement of death and conspiracy to commit failure to notify coroner or law enforcement of death. In support of this argument, Capone points to evidence in the record which appears to contradict Stone's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As previously noted, Idaho Code section 19-2117 requires accomplice testimony to be corroborated. \"The corroborating evidence offered need only connect the defendant with the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Stone testified that after Capone killed Anderson, he assisted in rolling Anderson in a tarp, wrapping that tarp with a chain, and then throwing Anderson's body from a bridge. A shop owner in Moscow testified that Capone purchased a new tarp the following day. Evidence was admitted that Capone told Voss that Anderson had gone away before and always came back, but this time she was not coming back. Capone also told Glass that Anderson was not doing anything \"but pushing up daisies,\" and that he buried her so deep, \"they'll never find her.\" We hold that this was sufficient evidence to corroborate Stone's testimony regarding the crimes of failure to notify coroner or law enforcement of death and conspiracy to commit that crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Because there was sufficient evidence to corroborate Stone's testimony for crimes in which he was an accomplice, we do not consider whether the district court erred in failing to give a corroboration instruction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Capone next argues that the district court erred when it failed to give a jury instruction regarding corroboration. Capone did not object to the failure to give a corroboration instruction at trial. The State argues that even if the district court erred in failing to give a corroboration instruction that such an error does not rise to the level of fundamental error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As discussed above, there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to corroborate Stone's testimony. Because there is sufficient evidence to corroborate Stone's testimony, any error that may have occurred by failing to give a corroboration instruction is harmless. In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Evidence of the attempted strangulation should not have been admitted.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Capone next argues that the district court erred when it admitted evidence of his past crimes or wrongs. Capone argues that evidence of a past strangulation attempt and that he was not allowed to have firearms due to past felony convictions was improperly admitted. The State responds that although these issues were addressed during a motion in limine, the district court reserved its final ruling for trial and because Capone did not object to the admission of this evidence at trial he did not properly preserve the issues for appeal.

Capone is mistaken. Stone was not a party to the case; he was merely a witness. Because Stone was not a party to the action which pitted the State against Capone, his statement to Byer was not admissible as an admission of a party-opponent. Because Stone's prior statement could not be brought in as substantive evidence, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it held that Capone failed to demonstrate that the new evidence was material and not merely cumulative or impeaching.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We can find no error in the district court's determination that Capone also failed to demonstrate that the new evidence would probably have produced an acquittal. Capone spent a full day impeaching Stone with inconsistent statements he had made to police before November of 2013. At trial, Stone repeatedly stated that he had been living a lie and consistently lied to others about Anderson's disappearance before November 2013 when he decided to tell the police the truth. Stone's statement to Byer was made during the time in which Stone admitted to having lied about what happened to Anderson. For these reasons, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Capone's motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
