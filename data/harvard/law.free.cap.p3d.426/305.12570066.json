Because only this issue from Scalph's appeal merits publication, we have addressed Scalph's other arguments in a separate, unpublished memorandum decision issued simultaneously with this opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Sup. Ct. 111(h) ; Ariz. R. Crim. P. 31.19(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Scalph argues that the trial court imposed an illegal sentence on Count 1, possession of dangerous drugs for sale, because it \"combined\" Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") sections 13-3407 (West 2018) and 13-703(J).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Scalph argues that he should have instead been sentenced either as a repetitive offender pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703(J) or\n   given a \"flat-time\" sentence under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3407(E). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Section 13-703 plainly states that early release provisions do not apply when another statute or provision of law specifies a later release or requires completion of the prison sentence before release. Scalph was convicted of violating \u00a7 13-3407 based on his possession of methamphetamine for sale. In this situation, \u00a7 13-3407(F) expressly requires the court to impose a calendar-year prison term. Section 13-3407 is a statute specifically requiring the completion of a prison sentence before release; as such, the general release provisions of \u00a7 13-703 do not apply. Accordingly, for the following reasons and those set forth in the accompanying unpublished memorandum decision, we affirm Scalph's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Police officers searched Scalph's home pursuant to a warrant and discovered four guns. In a hidden compartment behind a shower, police found illicit drugs, a digital scale, and plastic baggies. The State charged Scalph with one count each of possession of dangerous drugs for sale (methamphetamine), a class 2 felony; possession of narcotic drugs for sale (heroin), a class 2 felony; possession of marijuana for sale, a class 4 felony; possession of drug paraphernalia, a class 6 felony; and eight counts of misconduct involving weapons, class 4 felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State proceeded to trial on the drug charges and the four weapons charges that were based on allegations Scalph possessed the firearms during the commission of the drug offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3102(A)(8). The jury could not reach a verdict regarding the heroin offense, but found Scalph guilty of the other charges. The jury also found the State sufficiently proved aggravating factors, including that Scalph was on probation for a felony conviction at the time he committed the offenses. The court subsequently found Scalph had two historical prior felony convictions. Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703(C) and (J), the court sentenced Scalph to presumptive concurrent prison terms as a category 3 repetitive offender, including a 15.75-year sentence on Count 1 (the methamphetamine offense), a 3.75-year sentence on Count 4 (paraphernalia), and 10-year sentences on the remaining counts. With respect to Count 1, the court ordered Scalph's prison sentence to be served day-for-day, or \"flat-time,\" in accordance with A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3407(A)(2), (F). Scalph timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1), 13-4031, and -4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Scalph argues that, for Count 1, the trial court erred in sentencing him as a repetitive offender and imposing a sentence without the possibility of early release (a \"flat-time sentence\"). According to Scalph, the court should have applied either A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703, the repeat offender sentencing statute, or A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3407, which requires a flat-time sentence for a conviction of possession of methamphetamine for sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-703(J), -3407(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 To address Scalph's argument, we must interpret the applicable statutes, an undertaking we conduct\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    State v.

Generally, a person convicted of a Class 2 through a Class 6 felony is subject to an enhanced sentence as a repetitive offender under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703 if the court finds the person has at least one historical prior felony conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 In 1996, our supreme court construed A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703 's predecessor statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-604, as providing \"an exclusive sentencing scheme\" for the repetitive-offender defendant convicted of possession of narcotic drugs for sale and sale of narcotic drugs.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the substantive statute required flat-time sentences-as does the one here-the Court found the following language in the repetitive offender statute dispositive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The penalties prescribed by this section shall be substituted for the penalties otherwise authorized by law if the previous convictions ...

Accordingly, because the State sought an enhanced sentence under the repetitive offender statute, the\n   <em>\n    Tarango\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that the release provisions in the substantive statute did not apply; therefore, it determined the defendant was eligible for early release.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488511\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488511\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/208/\">\n    at 209, 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488511\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/208/\">\n    914 P.2d 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 The following year, the legislature amended what is currently A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703(N) by inserting immediately after the language cited in\n   <em>\n    Tarango\n   </em>\n   , the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The release provisions prescribed by this section shall not be substituted for any penalties required by the substantive offense or a provision of law that specifies a later release or completion of the sentence imposed before release.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 34, \u00a7 1 (1st Reg. Sess.). The legislature also expressly stated its intent to overrule\n   <em>\n    Tarango\n   </em>\n   . 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 34, \u00a7 3 (1st Reg. Sess.);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \"Summary of Legislative Action,\" 43rd Legislature, 142 (describing language added to statute as \"[a]n emergency measure overruling the 1996 Arizona Supreme Court decision of\n   <em>\n    State v. Tarango\n   </em>\n   by allowing for enhanced flat-time prison sentences\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11 The language added by the legislature after\n   <em>\n    Tarango\n   </em>\n   plainly prohibits a court from applying the early release provisions in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703 when sentencing a repetitive offender for a substantive offense that specifies a later release or flat-time sentence. Because the jury convicted Scalph of possession of methamphetamine for sale, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3407(F) required the court impose a flat-time sentence. Additionally, because Scalph is a repetitive offender, the court did not err in also imposing an enhanced sentence under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 Scalph argues that when the court imposed the sentence for Count 1, the judge improperly considered a memorandum decision issued by this Court,\n   <em>\n    State v.
