Sts. <em>c. </em>87, \u00a7 7, for keeping a common nuisance, to wit, a tenement for the illegal keeping and sale of intoxicating liquor, on July 1, 1872, and on divers other days between that day and May 1, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-12\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Dewey, J., after evidence had been introduced concerning the character of the defendant\u2019s place on July 2, 1872, the presiding judge allowed evidence to be introduced, against the defendant\u2019s objection, as to what was found at the defendant\u2019s place on other days between said July 2, and May 1,1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-13\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-14\">The second case was an indictment under the Gen.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-5\">D. <em>W. </em>Bond, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah2\">The grand jury, by returning the two indictments, find that the defendant had kept a tenement as a nuisance continuously from July 1, 1872, to the time of the finding of the two indictments. The defendant was not guilty of as many different offences as there were days during this interval, but of one offence, more or less aggravated according to the length of time the tenement was so maintained. In <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Common</em>wealth, 12 Gray, 326, the court say: \u201cA nuisance is an offence that may have continuance, and may therefore be laid with a <em>continuando.\u201d</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-6\"><em>C. R. Train, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b52-7\">Endicott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF\">In the first of these cases, evidence that the defendant kept a common nuisance on any day between July 2, 1872, and May 1, 1873, was competent, and the government was not'confined to July 2 in its proof. The conviction is a bar to any other indictment for the same offence between the days named. But it is not a bar to the indictment in the second case for keeping a common nuisance between May 1, and the time of finding the indictment in June following. Evidence that would have been competent on the one indictment would not have been competent on the other. Distinct offences are charged in each indictment, and the same evidence could not convict in both cases. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>4 Gray, 11. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>7 Gray, 49. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefe, </em>7 Gray, 332. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Traverse, </em>11 Allen, 260. <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The evidence was properly admitted in the first case, and the demurrer to the defendant\u2019s plea in the second properly sustained. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
