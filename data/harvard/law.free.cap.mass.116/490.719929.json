The answer was a general denial. Trial in the Superior Court, before Rockwell, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-8\">The defendant contended and introduced evidence tending to show that she was the owner of the bond in question, and that it had been given to her by her husband, the said Jonathan, as a <em>donatio causa mortis.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-9\">The plaintiff requested the judge to rule that there could be no valid <em>donatio causa mortis </em>from a husband to his wife, and that such a defence could not be sustained. But the judge, for the purposes of the trial, ruled that a valid <em>donatio causa mortis </em>could b.e made by the husband directly to the wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-10\">The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show that no such gift was ever made by the testator to the defendant. It was in evidence that, at the time of his marriage, Jonathan Wheeler was a man seventy-four years of age, had been twice before married, and had a family of four adult children living, and that the defendant was then a widow with five children, and that an ante-nuptial contract was executed between them, by which Mrs. Wheeler retained her own property, and at the decease of the testator was to receive the use and improvement of one third of his real and personal estate so long as she should live, in lieu of dower and all claim whatsoever upon his estate, and that shortly after the marriage a will was executed by Wheeler, disposing of his property in conformity with the terms of this contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-11\">The plaintiff offered evidence to show that the testator, at different times from the year 1866 to the day of his decease in 1872, had declared his intention to adhere to the disposition of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>erfcy made by the will and marriage contract; that not long previous to his death, but before the alleged <em>donatio, </em>he had expressed his fear that his wife had been secreting money obtained from his property, and chad deposited it in the Fitchburg Savings Bank, and that he requested the witness, his son-in-law, to go there to ascertain if such was the fact; and also that on the day preceding his death, and a few days after the alleged gift, he had stated to this witness that he feared his wife and her friends, after his death, would take all there was of his estate, and begged that he would look after his estate and see that his children were not defrauded. He also offered to prove that, only a few hours previous to the time of the alleged gift, Jonathan Wheeler had expressed himself confident that he should recover; also, that on the Sunday succeeding the Friday on which the alleged gift was made, Wheeler, in conversation with the witness, in answer to an inquiry as to his health, stated that he was doing well, and believed he should ultimately recover; and, that from the Thursday preceding the alleged gift, to the Sunday succeeding, there had been no material change in his physical condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\">The defendant had previously introduced evidence that, at the time of the alleged gift, Wheeler had stated that he considered it doubtful if he should live long.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">The judge ruled that all the above evidence was incompetent for any purpose, and rejected the same. The case was submitted to the jury upon full instructions, which were not objected to. The verdict was for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-6\"><em>C. H. B. Snow, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-7\"><em>F. F. Fay, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5q\">The finding of the jury is conclusive upon the question whether the gift was made, unless evidence to control the fact of such gift was improperly excluded. The evidence offered by the plaintiff, which was excluded, was simply the declarations of the plaintiff\u2019s testator in his own favor, and these were not competent to control positive evidence of the gift. The plaintiff\u2019s testator is the real plaintiff in this action, and any declarations made by him in his own favor, not in the presence of the defendant, either before or after the gift, are inadmissible for any purpose. <em>Emmons </em>v. <em>Westfield Bank, </em>97 Mass. 230. <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>12 Allen, 114. <em>Lucas </em>v. Trumbull, 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Gray, 306. <em>Beecher </em>v. <em>Mayall, </em>16 Gray, 376. <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Iceland, </em>110 Mass. 325.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b508-4\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHVa\">Before the recent statutes, securing to married women their separate rights of property, gifts <em>causa mortis </em>from a husband to bis wife were sustained. 2 Redf. Wills, <em>c. </em>12, \u00a7 42, pl. 13. <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>1 P. Wms. 441. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>3 P. Wms. 356. <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>2 Swanst. 92. The proviso that nothing in those statutes shall authorize the husband to convey or give property to his wife, Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>108, \u00a7 10, does not operate to render invalid what was before held to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Gifts <em>mortis causa, </em>like testamentary gifts, express the state of mind and disposition of the donor towards the donee, and his purpose in regard to the bestowal of his estate. When there is any ground for doubt as to the intent with which a delivery of property was made, or whether in fact its possession was obtained by delivery as a voluntary gift or in some other mode, evidence tending to show a continuous and apparently fixed state of mind and purpose, inconsistent with such alleged gift, existing previously thereto, may have a legitimate bearing upon the case to affect the inferences to be drawn from the facts and circumstances attending the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The precise state of the testimony in this case is not disclosed upon the bill of exceptions. It appears merely that \u201c the defendant claimed and introduced evidence tending to show \u201d that the bond \u201chad been given to her by her husband \u201d \u201cas a <em>donatio causa mortis ; </em>\u201d and that the plaintiff \u201c claimed and introduced evidence tending to show that no such gift was ever made.\u201d In this position of the case, we see nothing to justify the exclusion of evidence offered to show the existence of a state of mind and purpose in the supposed donor inconsistent with the alleged gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
