The said property to be held in trust, and said annuity to be paid to said wife in semi-annual instalments, so long as she remains my widow, and no longer.

My wife, Sophronia Carter, may select or reserve for her own use and occupancy as above, one bed, and suitable bedding for the same, and what other furniture, pictures, or miscellaneous library she may wish to use and occupy, as above stated. She may also retain, in fee simple, all her marriage presents; also, her wardrobe of every description, for herself or her heirs. The rest of my miscellaneous library and furniture to be equally distributed, either by sale or otherwise, among my legal heirs. My desire is that my medical library, and apparatus pertaining to my profession, should be preserved until either of my grandsons, at the age of fifteen years, should choose to study and practise my profession, he shall have and hold, in fee simple, all my medical library and apparatus. Provided he will prepare and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>furnish gratuitously, from time to time, to the other members of my family, whatever domestic medicines they may wish to keep for their own use; otherwise such property shall be distributed like the rest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-4\">Annexed to the bill were schedules marked B, O, D, E and F, setting forth the indebtedness of his sons-in-law to the testator at the date of the will which was unpaid at his death; also schedules marked G and H, setting forth notes in the hands of third parties upon which the testator was indorser for the accommodation of his sons-in-law Tileston and Stockbridge. This liability was incurred after the date of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">It also appeared that the first named defendant was the second wife of the testator, and that he had had no children by her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">Hearing before <em>Wells, </em>J., who ruled that the evidences of indebtedness in schedules marked B, C, D, E and F were intended to be reserved, as provided in the will, until the property was finally distributed, and could not be collected by the administrators ; that the notes described in schedules marked G and H were not intended to be \u201c reserved \u201d by the will, and that the administrators should require the same to be paid by the makers thereof. At the hearing, the counsel for the heirs offered to prove that the notes described in the schedules marked G and H were renewals of notes of the same amounts which existed at the time the will was made ; but the judge held that such evidence would not affect the ruling as to said notes. The counsel for the heirs also offered to prove, by the declarations of the testator just prior to his decease, that the notes described in schedules G and H were intended by him to be \u201c reserved \u201d under the will, and also declarations of the deceased as to the furniture to be taken for use by his wife <em>; </em>but the evidence was excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">The judge also ruled that by the terms of the will the widow had the right to take for her use such furniture of the deceased as she pleased, and that there was no limit imposed by the will upon her selection ; and that it was the true intent of the testator, by the will, to give his wife an annual income of twelve hundred dollars as a charge upon both principal and income of his estate. The heirs appealed to the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-8\"><em>I. S. Morse &amp; F. S. </em>Heseltine, for the heirs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0u\">1. In determining the meaning of language used by the testator in his will, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>circumstances under which he was placed, and the state and condition of his family, are fair matters of inquiry and proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-4\">2. The declaration of the testator, just prior to his decease, as to the debts to be held in reserve, and as to the distribution of his furniture, should be received in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">3. In giving to his wife $1200 annually \u201c from the proceeds of my estate, real and personal,\u201d the testator could not have intended to give her the real or personal estate itself. The word \u201cproceeds\u201d means the \u201cincome, rent, receipts, rental\u201d of the estate, real and personal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">4. If the construction contended for be the true one, that there is no limit to the furniture to be taken by the widow, and that she may take the whole, the following language of the will, \u201c The rest of my miscellaneous library and furniture to be equally distributed, either by sale or otherwise, among my legal heirs,\u201d becomes of no effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-7\">5. The fact that the testator left a widow alone, without children or family, leads to the conclusion that when he said \u201c My wife may select and -reserve for her own use and occupancy as above, one bed, and suitable bedding for the same, and what other furniture and pictures, or miscellaneous library she may wish to use and occupy,\u201d he did not intend that she should take all the furniture and books that he left. He intended to limit her to what she needed for her individual use.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-8\"><em>T. P. </em>Proctor, for the widow.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b323-9\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anl\">Upon a view of all the provisions of this ill drawn and obscure will, we concur in opinion with the justice by whom the cause was heard, that the testator intended that his widow should receive a clear annual sum of $1200 out of his estate, whether the income of his property (excluding what he directed to be reserved) should be sufficient, or it should be necessary to apply part of the principal for that purpose; and that she should have the right to the use of so much of the furniture of any description as she might select. The oral declarations of the testator are clearly inadmissible to control the construction of his mil. <em>Decree </em>affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
