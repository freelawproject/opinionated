There was no evidence that the plaintiff made any reply, or that he knew that the person was an agent. The judge instructed the jury that, if they believed this evidence, the plaintiff could not maintain the action. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence would warrant the jury in finding that the attendance was furnished by the plaintiff under an agreement to he well paid for it if successful, and that if he failed he was to receive nothing; and that the instruction was correct.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-10\">Contract under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>70, \u00a7 16,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to recover for medical attendance furnished Armenia Olds, a pauper in the defendant town. At the trial in the Superior Court, before Lord, J., the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-11\">The legal settlement of Armenia Olds was in the town of Mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>terey; and the overseers of the poor for that town had made a bargain with one Meecham, the father of Armenia, to take care of her and procure and' provide everything which she might need, at a fixed price per week, and they arranged with Ephraim Cole, chairman of the overseers of the poor of the defendant town, to see that Meecham faithfully performed his agreement. The plaintiff was called to attend Armenia by her mother, Mrs. Meecham, in October, 1871, and continued to attend her until her death, in February, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-4\">Mr. Meecham testified that he was away from home when the plaintiff made his first visit, but returned while he was there, and had some conversation with the plaintiff as to the condition of Armenia and the prospect of her recovery, and told the plaintiff that if he would cure his daughter he should be well paid for it, but that if he failed to cure her he would ..pay him nothing; but this part of the conversation was denied by the plaintiff, and there was no evidence that the plaintiff made any reply to the remark of Mr. Meecham, or that he then knew that Meecham was employed by the town of Monterey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-5\">In December, 1872, the plaintiff met Cole and had a conversation with him about his attending Armenia and about his pay. The testimony touching this conversation was conflicting, the plaintiff and his witnesses, two in number, testifying that the plaintiff told Cole that he was doctoring Mrs. Olds, and should look to the town of Chesterfield for his pay, and that Cole contended that she belonged to Monterey, but encouraged the plaintiff to believe that he should be paid by the town of Monterey. Cole testified that the plaintiff met him and told him that he was doctoring Mrs. Olds, and asked him who was to pay him ; that he said she belonged to Monterey, that they had made nrovision for her, but he presumed the overseers of the poor for Monterey would pay him, if satisfied that the plaintiff could do Mrs. Olds any good. It was admitted that the town of Chesterfield furnished nothing for Mrs. Olds, and there was no evidence that any medical services were in fact rendered to Mrs. Olds after the plaintiff\u2019s conversation with Cole, except those rendered by the plaintiff; but there was evidence tending to show that Meecham had, previously to the plaintiff\u2019s attending, made arrangements with Dr. Streeter to attend her whenever called for. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The defendant offered to show that the neighbors were in the habit of bringing in to Mrs. Olds things for her comfort, as milk and other delicacies such as a sick person would need. This evidence was objected to by the plaintiff, but the objection was overruled and the evidence admitted, to which the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-4\">The plaintiff requested the judge to instruct the jury \u201c that if the jury are satisfied that Mrs. Olds was in need of medical aid, and that neither Chesterfield nor Monterey furnished a physician to fully meet that want, and the plaintiff did in fact supply that want, then he is entitled to recover for such services as he so rendered after notice to Chesterfield; that making arrangements with Meecham by the town of Monterey does not relieve the town of Chesterfield, if in fact neither the agent of the town of Monterey nor the town of Chesterfield furnished medical aid for Mrs. Olds.\u201d The judge declined to give these instructions, on the ground that he had already given them substantially, and that it was simply asking him to repeat that part of his charge which was most favorable to the plaintiff\u2019s case. The judge also instructed the jury that if Cole told the plaintiff that the town of Monterey had made arrangements for providing for Mrs. Olds, it was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to stop attending her until he could ascertain whether or not she was furnished with other medical attendance, and if he found she was not so attended and was in want, he then might have attended her, and recovered his pay from the defendant town; and that if they believed Mr. Meecham\u2019s testimony that he told the plaintiff he would not pay him if he did not cure his daughter, and the plaintiff then continued doctoring her under that understanding, the plaintiff could not maintain this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-6\"><em>A.

The plaintiff contends that the presiding judge erred in permitting evidence to be introduced that the neighbors of the pauper, Mrs. Olds (for medical attendance upon whom this action is brought under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>70, \u00a7 16), were in the habit of sending her articles for her comfort, \u201c as milk and other delicacies such as a sick person would need \u201d The only suggestion made is that this was immaterial. We cannot see, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>these exceptions, that it was not competent on behalf of the defend ant, upon the issue whether the services rendered by the plaintiff were reasonably necessary; but, if immaterial, the plaintiff fails to point out wherein he was liable to be injured by the introduction of it, or that it in any mode affected him unfavorably. Where evidence purely immaterial has been admitted, and it is not shown that such admission can have in any way prejudiced the excepting party, the verdict will not be disturbed. <em>Burghardt </em>v. <em>Van </em>Deusen, 4 Allen, 374. <em>Bragg </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>9 Allen, 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">2. Nor was it erroneous, on the part of the presiding judge, to decline to give the instructions asked at the conclusion of the charge. He had already given them substantially, as appears by his statement embodied in the bill of exceptions, and this was all to which the plaintiff was entitled. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Bowman, 12 </em>Gray, 467. <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Pepperell, </em>99 Mass. 40. He might well apprehend that by repeating them he would give them an undue prominence among the various considerations he had brought to the attention of the jury. His remark, \u201c that the plaintiff was simply asking him to repeat the portion of his charge most favorable to the plaintiff\u2019s case,\u201d was not, that we can perceive, unjust or calculated to influence the jury against the plaintiff\u2019s case ; it sim ply left such portion to be weighed by them in connection with the rest of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">3. The instruction \u201cthat if Cole\u201d (who acted for the town of Monterey to see that the arrangements which it had made for the pauper were faithfully carried out) \u201c told the plaintiff that the town of Monterey had made arrangements for Mrs. Olds\u2019 being provided for, it was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to stop attending her until he could ascertain whether or not she was furnished with other medical attendance ; and if he found she was not so attended and was in want, he then might have attended her and recovered his pay from the defendant town,\u201d is to be taken in connection with the instructions also given as stated by the judge, in substance, \u201c that if the jury are satisfied that Mrs. Olds was in need of medical aid, and that neither Chesterfield nor Monterey did furnish a physician to fully meet that want, and the plaintiff did in fact supply that want, then he is entitled to recover for such services as he so rendered after notice to Chesterfield; \u201d and further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u2018 that making arrangements with Meecham by the town of Monterey does not relieve the town of Chesterfield, if in fact neither the agent of the town of Monterey nor the town of Chesterfield furnished medical aid for Mrs. Olds.\u201d Its obvious meaning is that after the plaintiff was thus informed that provision was made for Mrs. Olds, it was his duty to give an opportunity for medicall attendance, if such was necessary, to be furnished by the town to! which she was properly chargeable. That town had the right toj furnish such attendance through its own agents; and if it did thus! furnish it, the town of Chesterfield could not be made liable to the plaintiff. Information having been properly communicated to the plaintiff that provision for medical attendance had been made, the plaintiff could not insist on continuing his attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">After ceasing, and thus affording an opportunity for other medical attendance, if he found that it was not furnished, the instruction permitted him to recover if he then attended her, she being in need. It could not be inferred from the statement of what the duty of the physician required, that the court intended to limit the statement of the law made elsewhere, that if Mrs. Olds was in want of medical aid, and neither Monterey nor Chesterfield furnished it, and the plaintiff did, he could recover after notice to Chesterfield, and that mere arrangements to furnish it would not be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">4. There was sufficient evidence to go to the jury upon the testimony of Meecham that if the plaintiff furnished the medical attendance upon an agreement that the plaintiff should be well paid for it if he cured Mrs. Olds, and if he failed that he should be paid nothing. If the services were and continued to be rendered under that understanding with Meecham, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover against the town, and this was the instruction. <em>Exceptions </em>overruled..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
