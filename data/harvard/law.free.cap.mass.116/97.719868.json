The plaintiff offered no other witness than herself, and she testified as follows;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-8\">\u201c \u2018 I had worked at Lewiston in the mills. I left there August 17, 1869. I boxed up the goods in question, which were my own and mostly my wearing apparel, in a large box, which was nailed and fastened with cleats, and delivered it to the defendant\u2019s office in Lewiston. The box was marked Edward Gough, Dexter, Maine. I have made efforts to find the box, but have never been able to do so. I have made inquiries at Lewiston and Dexter, at the offices of said express company, for this box. I have not received it or heard from it since. I made inquiries of the agent. I asked Edward Sands. He was in the express office. He was writing in the office. No one else was in charge. I also made inquiry of Gough about the box. I have not seen it since I sent it.\u2019 The rest of her testimony related only to the value of the contents of the box. No testimony was offered by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-9\">\u201c Upon this evidence the defendant asked the court to rule that the plaintiff had not offered sufficient proof to sustain her case. But the court refused, and submitted the case to the jury under instructions. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>N.

Giving the fullest effect to the testimony of the plaintiff, it had no more tendency to show that the box was withheld or had been lost by the defendant than by Gough. The burden in this respect was upon the plaintiff, and she failed to maintain it. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>First National Bank in Westfield, </em>99 Mass. 605. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
