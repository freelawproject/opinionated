On September 10, 1872, a petition was filed in the United States District Court by a creditor of Graves, asking that said Graves be adjudged a bankrupt, for causes set forth therein. Upon the filing of this petition, the court directed the entry of an order requiring the bankrupt to appear and show cause according to the provisions of \u00a7 40 of the U. S. St. of 1867, <em>c. </em>176, and issued a warrant to the United States marshal, commanding him \u201c to arrest the alleged bankrupt and him safely keep, unless he shall give bail to the satisfaction of the court for his appearance from time to time, as required by the court, until the decision of the court upon the petition, and until the further order of the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-10\">On September 23, 1872, Graves was adjudged a bankrupt upon the above petition, No arrest or service of the warrant was made until after said adjudication, and after a meeting of creditors had been held and an assignee appointed.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABS\">The 40th section of the bankrupt act relates to the preliminary proceedings upon the petition of a creditor to have his debtor adjudged a bankrupt; authorizes the court, on the filing of such a petition, to issue an order of notice to the debtor (to be served on him personally or by publication as therein directed) to appear, at the time specified in the order, to show cause why the prayer of the petition should not be granted; and also an injunction to restrain the debtor and any other person, in the mean time, from making any transfer or disposition of the debtor\u2019s property; and, if there is probable cause for believing that the debtor is about to leave the district, or to remove, conceal or fraudulently convey or dispose of his property, \u201c issue a warrant to the marshal of the district, commanding him to arrest the alleged bankrupt, and him safely keep, unless he shall give bail, to the satisfaction of the court, for his appearance from time to time, as required by the court, until the decision of the court upon the petition, or the further order of the court.\u201d U. S. St. 1867, c. 176, \u00a7 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The object of the provision for the arrest of the debtor is to secure his attendance at the hearing and adjudication upon the petition to have him adjudged a bankrupt, and to prevent him from meanwhile absconding or putting his property out of reach. The debtor is to be held in custody, or give bail for his appearance, only \u201c until the decision of the court upon the petition, or the further order of the court.\u201d The second alternative clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>relates to a time within, and not beyond, that of the first; and appears to have been inserted in the statute with the object of allowing the debtor to be discharged at the discretion of the court before the adjudication of bankruptcy, not of keeping him in custody or attendance after that adjudication and during the pendency of the proceedings in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">When the debtor has attended the court at the time of the order adjudging him a bankrupt, he has fulfilled the whole obligation imposed upon him by the statute. That obligation could not be enlarged or extended by the court by substituting \u201c and \u201d for \u201c or \u201d in its order and warrant, and ordering him to be committed, or give bail for his appearance, \u201c until the decision of the court upon said petition, and until the further order of the court.\u201d After the adjudication of bankruptcy, the mode of proceeding to compel him to submit to examination would be the same as in the case of a voluntary bankrupt, by petition under \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The arrest of the bankrupt after the adjudication of bankruptcy, upon the warrant of arrest issued before that adjudication, was therefore unauthorized by law, and the. bond given to procure his release from that illegal arrest was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
