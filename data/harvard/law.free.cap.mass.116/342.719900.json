That there are two different and distinct tenements described in the complaint and warrant, and that the officer\u2019s reten does not show from which of these tenements he seized the liquors described. 2. That the description of the place in the complaint and warrant is ambiguous and uncertain, and that the complaint and warrant are bad for duplicity.\u201d Allen, J., overruled the motion; the defendant was tried and found guilty, and alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-5\"><em>W.

The warrant directed the officer to enter and search \u201c the tenement \u201d so described, and thus authorized him to search only one tenement, leaving it to him to determine which of the two he should search, instead of clearly designating in the warrant the place to be searched, as the law required. The warrant was therefore illegal and void. St. 1869, <em>c. </em>415, \u00a7 46. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating </em>Liquors, 109 Mass. 371. <em>Same </em>v.
