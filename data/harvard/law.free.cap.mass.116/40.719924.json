Because in neither of the several counts does it negative the fact that he was then and there the apprentice of some one of the three persons named as owners, to -wit, Gustavus F. Swift, Edwin C. Swift and Josiah B. Hallett.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\">\u201c 2. Because in neither of the several counts does it allege that said Asa N.

Hallett.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\">This motion was overruled, the defendant was found guilty, and appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-8\"><em>J. A. </em>Titus, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao8\">The language of the indictment is not precise and conclusive in its attempt to negative the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>fact of apprenticeship. The defendant might have been an apprentice to one or two of the joint owners or copartners, and if so, then he would be exempt from the charge contained in the indictment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>15 Misso. 513. The indictment should also negative the consent of all and each of the joint owners or copartners.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-4\"><em>C. R. Train, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b57-9\"> This statute provides : \u201cIf an officer, agent, clerk or servant of any incorporated company, or if a clerk, agent or servant of any private person or copartnership, except apprentices and other persons under the age of sixteen years, embezzles or frandulently converts to his own use, or takes or secretes with intent so to do without consent of his employer or master, any property of another, which -'as come to his possession or is under his care by virtue of such employment, he shall be deemed guilty of simple larceny.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-5\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-x\">The relation, which is essential to the offence charged in this indictment, is that of clerk, agent, or servant by virtue of some contract or employment other than that of apprenticeship. The recitals, in the several counts of the indictment, set forth such a relation to the three persons whose joint property was alleged to have been appropriated by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">If he was an apprentice to one of them, the question would arise whether the property was intrusted to him in that capacity, or whether he received it by virtue of some other employment by the three owners. But that would be a question, of fact to be determined upon the evidence. It is not necessary to negative such a relation in the indictment, any further than it is negatived by the affirmative allegation of the relation, other than of apprenticeship, to the three owners of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Like considerations apply to the allegation that the defendant appropriated the property without the consent of the owners. If the consent of one of the three owners was given and was such as to bind the three, it was the consent of all the owners, and is negatived by the allegation in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The motion to quash was rightly overruled, and there must be</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
