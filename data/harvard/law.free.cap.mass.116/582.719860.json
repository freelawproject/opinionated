that on August 18, 1865, he leased the land on Commercial Street, with the mill and machinery and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>other property therein, hy written lease of that date to the defendant and one William Bassett, Jr., then copartners under the style of Breed &amp; Bassett, the lease being for the term of ten years from its date, and containing an agreement on the part of the plaintiff that the lessees therein named, or their legal representatives, might purchase the leased property, within three years from August 18, 1865, for the sum of $17,000 ; that in consideration of the lease and the covenants and conditions therein contained, the said Breed &amp; Bassett executed the aforesaid agreement; that on or about July 28, 1868, the firm .of Breed &amp; Bassett was dissolved, and Bassett sold and assigned his interest in the business previously conducted hy the firm and in the aforesaid lease and agreement to the defendant, and that at the same time the plaintiff, in accordance with the covenants of.,the lease and the assignment from Bassett to the defendant, conveyed to the defendant the said land and mill, and the machinery therein and other property described in the lease, and that since the last named date the defendant has been the owner and occupant of the land and mill, and from that time to the date of the filing this bill has been carrying on business at the mill; and that contrary to the aforesaid agreement has been largely engaged in the manufacture of shoe boxes and packing boxes for sundry persons and firms in Lynn and vicinity, not included in the exceptions in said agreement contained, using in the manufacture the mill and machinery ; that he has solicited and obtained in the business the patronage of the customers of the plaintiff, and in all ways has actively and persistently entered into competition with the plaintiff ; and that he has done large amounts of mill work for various parties in violation of the agreement, and has done planing for sundry parties for a less price than that fixed and charged by the plaintiff for like work; and has thereby prevented the plaintiff from receiving large gains and profits from his business, and has Otherwise greatly injured him, and that the defendant has refused (rnd still refuses to the plaintiff access to the books, containing the account of boxes manufactured by him, or to account for and pay over to the plaintiff any portion of the profits derived from the manufacture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-4\">The defendant demurred to the b\u00fcl, assigning the following among other causes of demurrer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>1. That the covenants and agreements of the defendant, as set forth in the said agreement, only related and referred to the time included in the term of the lease, and were wholly terminated and concluded upon the conveyance of the estate, as set forth in said bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-4\">2. That it is not alleged in the bill that the defendant has done any of the acts complained of, except at a time subsequent to the termination of said lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-5\">3. That the agreement, by its terms, as well as by legal and necessary conclusion, has no reference to any time after the end of the term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-6\">4. That the covenants of the defendant are not perpetual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-7\">The case was reserved by <em>Colt, </em>J., upon the bill and demurrer, for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-9\"><em>S. B. Ives, Jr. &amp; R. C. Lincoln, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-10\"><em>J. W. Perry &amp; L. S. Tuckerman, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b601-11\">Endicott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae87\">The question for decision is, whether the provision of the indenture, restraining the defendant from manufac.turing shoe and packing boxes upon the premises for certain parties, terminated with the lease, or continued in force after the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">By the terms of the lease, if the lessee exercised his option to purchase, and a conveyance was made, the lease terminated within three years ; if he did not, it expired by its own limitation in ten years. It was terminated in one manner contemplated. The option was exercised, and the plaintiff conveyed the premises to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">Upon a careful examination of the indenture, it is apparent that all its provisions relate to the leasehold property, the lumber to be used in connection therewith, and the business to be there carried on. It was made at the same time, in connection with and in reference to the lease, and in view of the fact, that the only legal relations existing between the parties were those of lessor and lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">The two papers must therefore be taken as parts of one transaction, executed at the same time, in the same capacity, and as intended to perfect and complete the original agreement made between the parties. <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>102 Mass. 326. Crom<em>wel\u2019s Case, </em>2 Rep. 69 <em>a. Hamilton </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>5 S. &amp; R. 375, They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>are to be construed together in determining what was the meaning and intention of the parties, in regard to the duration of the partial restraint of trade, upon which the indenture is silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The fair interpretation of the agreement on this point, as gathered from both papers, is, that when the relation of lessor and lessee should cease to exist, the restriction should no longer be in force. The restriction would clearly be terminated when the period of ten years expired; it is equally clear that it terminated when the other provision for the termination of the lease was executed by the conveyance of the premises. In the absence of express words, taken in connection with the fact that no mention of it was made in the deed of conveyance, it is not to be inferred that the restriction was intended to survive the lease and all the other provisions of the indenture.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The demurrer is therefore sustained, and the</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\n<em>Bill dismissed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
