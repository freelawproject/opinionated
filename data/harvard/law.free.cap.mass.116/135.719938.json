Trial in the Central District Court of Worcester, the judge of which allowed a bill of exceptions which stated that on the return day of the writ the plaintiff demanded a trial by jury, and that at March term, 1874, the parties submitted the case upon an agreed statement of facts, which was set forth at length, and by which the parties agreed that if the plaintiff was entitled to recover, he was to have judgment for a sum stated and costs; otherwise, there was to be judgment for the defendant for his costs. On the facts agreed, \u201c the judge ruled as a matter of law that the plaintiff could not maintain his action, and ordered a verdict for the defendant, and the jury returned their verdict accordingly.\u201d The plaintiff alleged exceptions to this ruling.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-9\"><em>B.

When the presiding judge had ruled that upon the agreed statement of facts the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, he had no authority except to render judgment accordingly. The fact that he went through the form of taking a verdict of a jury, in mere obedience to his ruling, and when there was no issue which could legally be submitted to them, is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The anomalous clause, inserted in some of the acts creating district courts, which allowed rulings of a local magistrate of inferior jurisdiction to be brought <em>per saltum </em>to this court for revision, is now repealed, and appropriate provision made for revising such rulings in the future in the Superior Court. St. 1874, <em>e. </em>336. <em>Exceptions dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
