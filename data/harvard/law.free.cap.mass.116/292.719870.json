It was also agreed that if the plaintiff was entitled to recover, judgment for $175 was to be entered for him. The Superior Court entered judgment for the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>on appeal to this court, that the facts would warrant a finding that the judgment below proceeded upon the inference of fact that the letter of the agent admitted a liability to some extent, and that the judgment should be affirmed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">Contract to recover the value of a trunk and its contents belonging to the plaintiff, and destroyed in April, 1873, while in the possession of the defendant company, in the course of transportation from Newark, New Jersey, to Boston. The case was submitted to the Superior Court, on an agreed statement of facts in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-7\">It is admitted for the purposes of this statement, that the defendant company, at the time of the loss in April, 1873, was a corporation capable of being sued, and doing the business of a common carrier between New York and Boston. On April 17, 1873, the plaintiff then residing in Newark, and being about to remove to Jamaica Plain, in Massachusetts, left an order at the office of the New Jersey Express Company in Newark, to call at his boarding-house in Newark, take the trunk and transport the same to Jamaica Plain. The plaintiff directed a servant at his boarding-house to deliver the trunk when called for, and take a receipt for it. The plaintiff then took the cars and went directly to Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-8\">The trunk was taken by the New Jersey Express Company and carried by it to New York, and was there delivered to the defendant company on April 18, 1873, for transportation to Boston <em>; </em>and while the said defendant company was so transporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the same from New York to Boston, on the cars of the Stoning-ton line of railroad, on the morning of April 19, a bridge on the line of the railroad, at Richmond Switch, was suddenly swept away by a flood, the cars fell through the opening in the bridge and accidentally took fire, and the trunk and its contents were thereby burned and destroyed, without any fault or negligence on the part of the defendant company or its servants, or of the railroad. Shortly afterwards the plaintiff called at the office of the defendant company in Boston, and inquired of one of the clerks if the company had lost anything at the Richmond Switch disaster; the clerk replied that it had, on referring to the books of the company, and said there was an entry of \u201c Edward W. Fox,\u201d and asked the plaintiff if it was a trunk; the plaintiff replied that it was. The plaintiff was then referred to R. P. Reed, assistant superintendent of the defendant company, who had in charge the settlement of all claims for losses arising out of the disaster.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-4\">Reed gave to the plaintiff two blank affidavits relating to the shipment and loss, to be filled out and sworn to by the plaintiff, as the shipper and consignor of said trunk. These affidavits were such as the company always require of the shipper and consignor in cases of lost property. Reed also requested the plaintiff to give him the original receipt given by the New Jersey Express Company. The plaintiff said he had no receipt himself, but supposed there was one at his boarding-house in Newark, where the trunk was taken by the New Jersey Express Company, and inquired if it was necessary to have it, and Reed answered that they wanted it on account of their insurance business. The plaintiff then told Reed that he would go to Newark and see if a receipt had been left there, which he did. At Newark, the plaintiff called at the office of the New Jersey Express Company, asked for a receipt, and stated that Reed wanted the receipt on account of insurance. The New Jersey Express Company thereupon gave to the plaintiff a receipt, marked \u201c Duplicate,\u201d a copy of which is in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>It is also agreed, if the same be competent, that the plaintiff stated to the New Jersey Express Company, at the time of taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the duplicate receipt, that no receipt was left at his boardinghouse in Newark, to his knowledge, and that he also so stated to the agent of the defendant company, after inquiry upon the subject, and after his visit to Newark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-4\">The plaintiff, after receiving the duplicate receipt, returned to Boston, and on May 5, 1878, delivered to Reed his affidavits and statement of loss, to which was attached the duplicate receipt. Reed examined the papers and told the plaintiff they were such as were necessary, and that he would write and let him know about the matter. The plaintiff afterwards received from Reed a letter, in which the company declined to pay more than $50 on the plaintiff\u2019s claim for his trunk, on the ground that the value was not declared at the time of shipment, and stating that this amount was at the office, subject to his order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">It is also agreed, if competent, that the company, to avoid all trouble and litigation in settling losses connected with this disaster, adopted a rule of paying $50 to all claimants, in all cases where no value was declared at the time of shipment. The plaintiff had no insurance on the trunk or its contents, and no value was declared by him at the time of shipment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">Upon the foregoing statement of facts, if the court is of opinion that the plaintiff can maintain his action, judgment is to be entered for him in the sum of $175 5 otherwise, judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">The Superior Court rendered judgment for the plaintiff for $175, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-8\"><em>H.
