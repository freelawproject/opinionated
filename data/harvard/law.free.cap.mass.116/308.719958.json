Platt and Edward A. Boyd, described in the writ as doing business in New York under the name and style of Platt &amp; Boyd. John B. Sowle and Joseph Ward were summoned as trustees. At January term, 1874, of the Superior Court, at which the writ was returnable, the trustees answered that at the time of the service of the writ upon them they had no effects of Isaac L. Platt and Edward A. Boyd in their hands; but in answer to interrogatories filed by the plaintiff, admitted that they had funds of John B. Platt and Edward A. Boyd, copartners of the firm of Platt &amp; Boyd, which funds, immediately after service of process upon them, they paid over to the firm of Platt &amp; Boyd, taking from them a bond of indemnity. After the filing of the trustees\u2019 answers to the interrogatories, the plaintiff had leave to amend his writ and declaration by striking out \u201c Isaac L.\u201d and inserting in place thereof \u201c John B.\u201d The Superior Court charged the trustees; the defendants were defaulted and execution ordered to issue against the defendants\u2019 effects in the hands of said trustees. The trustees appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-7\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUa\">The answer of the trustees admits that they were indebted to a firm of Platt <em>&amp; </em>Boyd. Boyd was correctly named in the writ, and the error in Platt\u2019s Christian name was cured by the amendment. The payment by the trustees, after service of the writ, and before the amendment, to the principal defendant, taking a bond of indemnity from him, did not alter their condition. Judgment against the trustees will protect them against any claim of the defendant. No other party having acquired intervening rights, by attachment or otherwise, the trustees were properly charged in the court below. Gen.
