The ownership by the plaintiff, a manufacturing corpora-. tian, of a tract of land in the southerly part of Worcester, in the village of Quinsigamond, lying on both sides of Blackstone River, having thereon a rolling mill, and tenement houses used by the workmen in the mill, and a dam across said river, and a pond of water for supplying water power for working said mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-10\">2. That the river is a natural stream of water, and the plaintiff is entitled to have the same flow through its estate pure and uncorrupted, and that it used the water thereof for the purpose of generating steam for the use of the mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>3. That on April 16,1867, the voters of the city of Worcester accepted the St. of 1867, e. 106, entitled, \u201c An act concerning sewers and drains in the city of Worcester.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-3\">4. That Mill Brook, mentioned in said act, is \u00e1 natural stream of water flowing through the populous parts of the city, and empties into Blackstone River a short distance above the premises of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\">The bill then set forth various orders of the city council whereby the channel of Mill Brook had in some places been changed, and it had been laid out and appropriated as a main sewer, connected with and emptying into which were about thirty-one miles of sewers. The bill then proceeded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">\u201c From the sewers and drains entering Mill Brook channel as aforesaid, great quantities of sewage matter and filth, both solid and liquid, are discharged and carried into the water of said brook in the new channel, and the same, flowing through said new channel, are discharged and carried into said river, and are thence deposited upon the plaintiff\u2019s said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">\u201c By means of this filthy and deleterious matter, the water of said river flowing through the plaintiff\u2019s premises is fouled and corrupted, and the plaintiff\u2019s mill-pond filled up, and the most noisome, offensive and unwholesome smells, vapors and gases are emitted and discharged upon said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">\u201c Thereby the plaintiff\u2019s said premises are rendered filthy, unwholesome and inconvenient, and the plaintiff and those occupying the premises are greatly annoyed and incommoded, and the water of said river is rendered unfit for the plaintiff\u2019s purposes, and the plaintiff is otherwise injured, and its said estate diminished in value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">\u201c All which acts and doings of the defendant and its officers and agents are unauthorized by law and in violation of the rights of the plaintiff, and constitute a nuisance both private and public, from which the plaintiff derives special damage as aforesaid, and the defendant intends to continue and maintain the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">The prayer of the bill was that the city be required to abate said nuisance, and discontinue said wrongful acts, and for further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">The defendant demurred for want of equity; and the case was heard by <em>Gray, </em>C. J., and reserved for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>G.

The plaintiff concedes that the city is not liable for such injuries to the stream below, caused by the construction of public works like sewers and streets, as would result to the riparian owner from the reasonable use of the stream above him by the inhabitants of a populous city, nor liable as a wrongdoer for any consequences of the execution with due care and skill of the lawful orders of the city council for the construction and maintenance of such works. The ground of the complaint is not the injury to the purity of the stream; but the injury to the atmosphere and the land, by discharging upon the plaintiff\u2019s estate, by artificial means, the sewage of a large city, to an extent which creates both a public and private nuisance. The demurrer confesses that by means of the defendant\u2019s structure \u2022 \u201c great quantities of sewage matter and filth, both solid and liquid, are deposited upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises; \u201d that \u201c thereby the plaintiff\u2019s mill-pond is filled up, the most noisome, offensive and unwholesome smells, vapors and gases are emitted and discharged upon said premises,\u201d the same \u201c thereby rendered filthy, unwholesome and inconvenient, and that this constitutes a public nuisance.\u201d Such acts are not within the right of the upper owner to a reasonable use of the stream. The upper riparian owner cannot do to the land of the lower what he could not do to his own. It is not within the power of the city council to authorize them. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>New </em>Bedford, 108 Mass. 208. <em>Child </em>v. Boston, 4 Allen, 41. <em>Merrifield </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>110 Mass. 216. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>10 Allen, 591. <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>104 Mass. 13. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>19 How. 263. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>6 Gray, 544.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-4\">2. The power to deposit upon the lands of private individuals the sewage of a city is not conferred by the St. of 1867, and has never been conferred by any sewer act within this Commonwealth. If the defendant can maintain this power, it can authorize the construction of a drain terminating in the cellar of an individual, or on a hillside above his dwelling.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-5\"><em>B. F. Thomas &amp; W. A. Williams, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b476-6\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiM\">Where a city, or a board of municipal officers, is authorized by the Legislature to lay out and construct common sewers and drains, and provision is made by statute for the assessment, under special proceedings, of damages to parties whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>estates are thereby injured, the city is not liable to an action at law or bill in equity for injuries which are the necessary result of the exercise of the powers conferred by the Legislature. But if by an excess of the powers granted, or negligence in the mode of carrying out the system legally adopted, or in omitting to take due precautions to guard against consequences of its operation, a nuisance is created, the city may be liable to indictment in behalf of the public, or to suit by individuals suffering special damage. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>New </em>Bedford, 108 Mass. 208. <em>Merrifield </em>v. <em>Worces</em>ter, 110 Mass. 216. <em>Brayton </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>113 Mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The case at bar, as now presented, does not require the court to define the limits of the application of either of these rules to the discharge of the Mill Brook sewer into the Blackstone River. The only acts charged against the city of Worcester in the bill before us are the converting of the channel of Mill Brook into a sewer, and the opening of other sewers and drains into the same. These acts were expressly authorized by the St. of 1867, <em>c. </em>106. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>112 Mass. The only further allegations in the bill consist of a conclusion of fact, that a nuisance to the plaintiff was thereby created; and a conclusion of law, that the acts of the city were unauthorized and in violation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. The bill does not allege any negligence of the city, either in the manner in which the sewage was discharged from the mouth of the sewer, or in omitting to take proper precautions to purify it. The necessary result is that the</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><em>Demurrer must be </em>sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
