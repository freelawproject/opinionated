At the trial in the Su perior Court, without a jury, before <em>Pitman, </em>J., the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-12\">The plaintiffs sold the defendant the goods described in the account on a credit of thirty days; and at the end of this time the plaintiffs received of the defendant a promissory note of J. G. Robinson in payment, and receipted the bill for the goods. There was evidence tending to show that the defendant made false and fraudulent representations to induce the plaintiffs to take the note. Before the note became due the plaintiffs discovered that the representations were false and notified the defendant, who said that, if the note was not paid at maturity he would see it paid. The note was not paid at maturity, and Robinson was then and has since been in - Canada insolvent. The plaintiffs have the note still in their possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-13\">\u201c The judge, not being satisfied as a matter of tact that the note was absolutely worthless, ruled that the plaintiffs could not recover of the defendant on the original cause of action, while the plaintiffs held the note in their possession, or until they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>made a tender thereof; and accordingly found for the defendant.\u201d The plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-4\"><em>D.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9k\">The plaintiffs in this case seek to recover on the original account, on the ground that they were induced to take the note of a third person in payment, through the fraud of the defendant. The plaintiffs have not proved that the note was absolutely worthless. They cannot therefore maintain this action without surrendering the note to the defendant. <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>1 Met. 547.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
