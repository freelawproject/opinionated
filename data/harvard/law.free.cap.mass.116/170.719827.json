J., the plaintiff introduced as evidence of the judgment declared on an exemplification of it which was partly printed and partly in writing. The defendant objected that the certificate of the clerk appended to the exemplification applied to the written part only. But upon inspection of the papers it was ruled that the certificate was intended to and did extend to the whole judgment roll.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-10\">The defendant offered to show that the real owner of the cause of action so sued upon in New York was Henry P. Smith, a citizen of that state, and that the nominal plaintiff took an assignment of this cause of action from Smith without any consideration, and for the purpose of having the suit brought in New York, between citizens of Massachusetts, in order to confer on the courts of New York final jurisdiction of the cause, and to defraud the defendant of his right to remove the case to the Circuit Court of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-11\">The defendant also offered to show that the nominal plaintiff was not the real owner of the judgment, that the real owner reside's in New York, and contended that the writ was defective in not setting forth the name of the real owner of the cause o\u00ed action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-12\">The evidence was excluded ; a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>W.

The only objection to its admission was, that the certificate of the clerk applied to the written part only. This is a matter to be determined by examination and inspection of the papers. No question of law is involved in the decision, and it is apparent that the certificate was intended to and does extend to the whole judgment roll. The ruling of the presiding judge admitting it in evidence was correct. <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Abell, </em>10 Allen, 485. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 504, 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The facts which the defendant offered to prove, if proper matter of defence, should have been presented in the original action. It was alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint in that action, that the contract and all rights of action arising thereon had, for a good consideration, been assigned to the plaintiff. This would authorize^ him under the laws of New York to bring an action in his own name. It is not denied that the court had jurisdiction of the parties. Process was duly served, the defendant appeared and made answer, raising no question upon the assignment. The case was tried by a jury upon the \"issues presented by the defendant. Judgment was rendered against him, which on appeal to the general term was affirmed. He is now concluded by that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">To allow this defence would not be giving full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of another state, when the court has jurisdiction of the parties, the subject matter, and its proceedings are not founded in fraud; and would open to defendants when sued on a judgment so obtained, any defence which they had neglected to make in the original. action. <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Bickford, </em>13 Gray, 591. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>6 Pick. 232. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The action is properly brought in the plaintiff\u2019s name, he being the judgment creditor, although another may be entitled to the avails of it. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>4 Allen, 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
