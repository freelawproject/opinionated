When I went in the defendant emptied the contents of a pitcher into a sink. Should say it was ale in the pitcher. Tasted of it and it was ale. There was a beer pump with beer on drought \u2014 this light baker\u2019s beer\u2014not intoxicating. No other kind of beer or liquor in the place. It was a regular drinking saloon. There were cigars on the shelves, and this beer pump with baker\u2019s beer on drought. Defendant said it was baker\u2019s beer in the pitcher which he had turned into the sink, but it was not; that the place was under attachment and he had been put in by the attaching officer as keeper. Smith Navin was present on October 3, 1873, and said he was the <em>owner; </em>the place had been attached and the defendant had been put in as keeper by the officer. I was in there several times \u2014 two or three times a week after July 5, and found nothing \u2014 n&lt;? liquor. October 3, called there about 7 o\u2019clock P. M.; the defendant was not present, he went out of the place sometime before I went in. Smith Navin was behind the bar. On the bar were tumblers, and in front men who had been in the process oj drinking.\u2019\u2019 There was no other evidence in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-10\">The defendant requested the presiding judge to rule that on these facts he was entitled to an acquittal, but the presiding judge declined so to rule, and permitted the evidence to go to the jury, giving them instructions, to which no objection was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>made.

The charge against the defendant was one which could be proved by circumstantial evidence. The circumstances described by the witness were proper for the consideration of the jury, and in the absence of any evidence on the part of the defendant would justify the inference of his guilt. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
