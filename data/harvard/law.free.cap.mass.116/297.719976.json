Wheeler.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b313-9\">Suffolk.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A2V\">November 12, 1874.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A88\">Wells &amp; Devens, JJ., absent.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b313-10\">On the issue whether the defendant made the contract sued upon, the plaintiff rested his case on an auditor\u2019s report in his favor; the defendant denied making the contract; the plaintiff then offered evidence as to what was said and done by the parties at the time when he contended the contract was made. <em>Held, </em>that this evidence was part of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and that it was within the discretion of the judge at the trial to exclude it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Contract on an oral agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-4\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Brigham, C. J., the plaintiff offered in evidence the report of an auditor, who found that there was an implied agreement on the part of the defendant to abide by and perform the contract set forth in the declaration. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated to the presiding judge, before resting his case on the report alone, that the plaintiff had other evidence of the contract relied on, which he might wish to put in after the defendant\u2019s case was closed; to which the judge replied that a plaintiff, having an auditor\u2019s report in his favor, had his election to put in his whole case, or to stand on the report alone in the first instance, and run the risk of being able to control the defendant\u2019s case in rebuttal; that such a course had its advantages and its disadvantages, and the counsel must elect which course to pursue, as it was within the discretion of the judge how far in such a case the plaintiff should be allowed to put in evidence to sustain the auditor\u2019s report not strictly in rebuttal of the defendant\u2019s testimony, and which would be competent for the plaintiff in the beginning. The plaintiff then rested his case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-5\">The defendant testified that she never made, consented to, or had any knowledge of, the alleged contract. After her evidence was all in, the plaintiff offered to put in evidence as to what was said and done between the parties at the time of making the alleged contract; but the judge refused to admit it, stating to the counsel for the plaintiff that this evidence made a part of his original proof which it was competent for him to put in in the first instance; and that, not having elected to put it in then, it was afterwards within the discretion of the judge to permit him to put it in or not; that under the circumstances of the case he should decline to admit any testimony not strictly in rebuttal, and as the testimony offered was not of that class he should reject it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\">The jury found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-7\"><em>C. P. </em>Hinds, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-8\"><em>P. E.
