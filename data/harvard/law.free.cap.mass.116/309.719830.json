The judge declined so to rule, but instructed the jury that in a sale of goods for cash the title did not pass to the purchaser, notwithstanding the goods had been delivered, until the money was paid for the same, or there was a waiver of the cash payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-6\"><em>G. </em>F.

The evidence at the trial tended to prove a sale for cash, and a delivery without condition. The instruction given to the jury implied that some other evidence of waiver was necessary to prevent the maintenance of the action. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
