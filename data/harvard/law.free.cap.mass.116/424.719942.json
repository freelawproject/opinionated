Jonathan E. testified that he procured the loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>from the savings bank, was present when said mortgage was executed, and that his father gave said mortgage at his request and to raise money for putting in said mill and machinery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-4\">\u201c There was evidence tending to show that in May, 1871, Jonathan E. set a steam-engine in said mill, on brick, and bolted down, which engine he bought of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">\u201c On September 14, 1871, he mortgaged said engine and boiler to the plaintiff as personal property, by a mortgage not under seal, to secure the price of the engine.

The judge stated, in substance, that he could not stop then to read them, but that he would consider them as handed in, and would charge the jury, and if there were any matters not covered by the charge, his attention could be called to them. The counsel for the defendants then called his attention generally to their requests by reading to him portions of them. The counsel for the defendants did not understand, as the matter was then left, that they were to call the attention of the judge again to their requests, in order to save their clients\u2019 rights in reference to the matters contained in the requests, in case the judge should not instruct the jury as requested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">\u201c The judge instructed the jury as to the conditions and circumstances under which this property in question would be real estate or personal property.

Janes, and that Jonathan E. Janes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>might remove the same at Ms pleasure, then it would not go with the real estate, but would remain the property of Jonathan B. Janes; that the question whether it was real estate or personal property must be determined by what took place before or at the time it was put upon the land, and that nothing had transpired since which could be considered by the jury as affecting this question; that the fact that the property was afterwards mortgaged to the savings bank without anything being said as to the boiler and engine not being real estate, would not be a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, but that the plaintiff might now come forward and show that when the mortgage was made it was personal property, and not real estate; that the defendants could not interpose the bank title as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-4\">\u201c The judge explained to the jury the effect of the admission of the subsequent mortgages by Jonathan E.

He charged the jury that they were not evidence of the fact that it was personal property, but were only admitted to contradict the witness Jonathan E. Janes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">\u201c After the judge had finished his instructions, the counsel for the defendants handed him two other requests, marked B. 1 and 2. To the request marked 1, the judge said that Ms charge covered it; and as to the one marked 2, he instructed the jury that the fact that Jonathan E. Janes was an only son of Lowell E. Janes, and lived in the same house with Ms father, did not authorize the implication that tMs property in question was personal nroperty when put upon the land, nor did it authorize the impliation that it was to be real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">\u201c <em>No </em>exceptions were taken by the counsel for the defendants <em>ic </em>the instructions given, except such as may be considered as taken by the facts above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-7\">\u201c I find that the jury were not instructed as requested in the requests marked B. 1 and 2, and that the exceptions to the instructions given on these points were properly saved and ought to be allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-8\">\u201c I find that, although the requests marked A. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 are not stated in the bill of exceptions precisely as handed to the judge, the jury were instructed substantially as requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>therein, and that no exceptions ought to be allowed on these points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-3\">\u201c I find that the jury were not instructed as requested in the requests marked A. 6, 8 and 9. I find that if the attention of the judge was not sufficiently called to these points by the requests handed to him before his charge, and by reading portions of them to him, it was called to the points therein after his charge by handing him the request marked B. 1; and therefore that the exceptions to the instructions given on these points were properly saved. I find that the requests 6, 8 and 9 were not stated in the bill of exceptions precisely as handed to the judge, but substantially the same. I therefore find that the exceptions to the instructions given on the points embodied in these requests ought to be allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-4\">\u201c I find that the bill of exceptions presented to the judge for allowance, and annexed to the petition, was not correct and ought not to have been allowed; that a true bill of exceptions requires the changes above stated, so that the bill will read as follows,\" namely, as above printed, excluding all the words printed in italics, and the letters and figures prefixed to the requests for instructions, and including the other words printed in brackets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">The judge who presided at the trial made, upon the bill of exceptions tendered to him, and ordered to be filed, the following certificate:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">\u201c The exceptions are disallowed. The evidence is incorrectly stated. On the part of the plaintiff, the evidence tended to show that the boiler was put into the building of the father with his consent, for the sole benefit of the son; that it was designedly so fixed, and the building so fitted, that it might be removed at the will of the son without injury to the freehold, and that all this was done with the consent of the father. There was no evidence that the savings bank had made any claim to the boiler. I do not remember any exception as to the admission of. other mortgages of the boiler by the son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">\u201c As to the written prayers for instruction, I stated to the counsel that if, after my charge to the jury, they should think there were any of their prayers not sufficiently covered by instructions, to call my attention to them. This was done in several instances, and further instructions were given and no exceptions were taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u201c The clerk may enter the exceptions disallowed, unless the parties make some other agreement, and file this paper.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-4\"><em>A.

Sts. <em>c. </em>115, \u00a711.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The certificate of disallowance, which the presiding judge is required by the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>115, \u00a7 8, to make in writing, is <em>prim\u00e2 facie </em>evidence that the exceptions presented are not conformable to the truth, though subject to be controlled by other evidence. <em>Bottum </em>v. Fogle, 105 Mass. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">If no objection is made to the form, the time of filing or the service of the petition, the practice is to refer it to a commissioner to hear the parties and report to the court the facts bearing upon the question whether the truth of the exceptions is established; but that question is a question of law, to be decided by the court upon the facts reported. <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>112 Mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The remedy is limited to exceptions taken at the trial and seasonably presented in writing to the presiding judge. <em>Joannes </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>6 Allen, 241. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Gills, </em>10 Allen, 248. <em>Bottum </em>v. <em>Fogle, </em>105 Mass. 42. And the substantial truth, though not the literal accuracy, of the exceptions as so alleged and tendered must be proved. If an exception alleged does not state the ruling excepted to, and the evidence to which it applied, with substantial accuracy, so as to present the same question, and in the same aspect, to this court as to the court below, the petitioner is <em>net </em>entitled to be heard in this court upon the exceptions, either in the form in which they were presented to the judge below, or in the form in which it is made to appear that they should have been presented; not upon the exceptions alleged, because they are not proved; nor upon the exceptions proved, because they were not alleged. <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>above cited. <em>Crow </em>v. <em>Stowe, </em>113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Mass. But the right of the excepting party to have an exception, duly alleged by him, considered by this court, is not to be defeated by mere verbal errors or unimportant differences in the form of statement. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Santom, ante, </em>120.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">If the bill, as tendered to the presiding judge, contains several distinct and independent exceptions, clearly and separately stated, the truth of one or more of them may be established, although the others are not proved as alleged, or are waived by the excepting party. Thus in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>15 Gray, 202, where a bill of exceptions alleged twelve distinct grounds of exception, stated and numbered separately, and the excepting party waived all but one, which related to a ruling upon a question of evidence, that exception was allowed and considered and sustained. The right to waive some of the exceptions alleged, and rely upon the others, on proving their truth, was recognized in the opinion of the court in <em>Bottum </em>v. <em>Fogle, </em>105 Mass. 42, 44; but, as no exceptions had been duly alleged in that case, the court had no occasion to consider this matter particularly. In <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>above cited, the bill tendered contained two matters of exception, wholly distinct from each other, the one to rulings as to the effect of an auditor\u2019s report, and the other upon a variance between the declaration and the proof; and, although the truth of the exceptions upon the first point was not established, the exception upon the other, being proved to be true, was considered and decided. But when true and false statements are blended or intermingled in the exceptions as tendered, the presiding judge is under no obligation to sift out the truth from the falsehood, and may properly disallow the whole bill of exceptions as not conformable to the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The case before us is an action of tort in the nature of trover for the conversion of a boiler, bought and set up by an only son in a building erected by him on the land of his father. The plaintiff claimed title under a chattel mortgage from the son. The defendants contended that the boiler was part of the land, and had passed with it by an earlier mortgage from the father to a savings bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The defendants\u2019 exceptions relate, 1. to the admission in evidence of mortgages from the son to other persons-of other machinery in the same building as personal property; 2. to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>effect of the original placing of the boiler by the son on his father\u2019s land; 8. to the effect of the mortgage of the land by the father, with the assent of the son, to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">1. The bill of exceptions tendered states that the other mortgages were admitted for the purpose of showing that the son had treated the machinery, put by him in the mill, as his personal property. It omits to' state, what appears by the commissioner\u2019s report to be the truth, that those mortgages, when first offered, were excluded ; that they were ultimately admitted for the sole purpose of contradicting the testimony of the son, and after he had been asked whether he had not made written declarations to other parties that this property was personal property ; and that the judge instructed the jury that the other mortgages were not evidence of the fact that the boiler was personal property, but were only admitted to contradict the witness. In short, the bill of exceptions untruly states the rulings of the court, and the state of the evidence at the time the rulings were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">2. Upon the question of the effect of the original placing of the boiler by the son on the land of the father, the statement, both of the evidence and the rulings, is also wide of the truth. The bill of exceptions omits an important portion of the evidence, as recited in the certificate of the judge, and reported by the commissioner ; and it states that the rulings requested on this part of the case were all refused, whereas it appears by the commissioner\u2019s report that they were given in substance, or with slight modifications. Indeed, the defendants\u2019 counsel at the argument waived his exceptions to all the rulings and refusals upon this subject, except to the alleged refusal to give one instruction requested, marked by the commissioner as B. 2. But even upon that the bill of exceptions fails to conform to the truth; for it merely states that upon the fact therein supposed the judge declined to instruct the jury that \u201c there is no implication that the boiler remained the personal property of the son; but the implication, if any, is that it became realty; \u201d and fails to state that the judge did rule that that fact did not authorize the implication that it was personal property, nor did it authorize the implication that it was real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">3. Upon the subject of the mortgage of the land by the father with the assent of the son, to the savings bank, it is unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>to consider the effect of the inaccuracy in the report of the testimony of the treasurer, of the variation between the requests as actually presented to the judge and as stated in the bill of exceptions, or of the including, in some of them, of recitals of evidence. It is sufficient to say that the request upon this point, found by the commissioner to have been presented to the judge at the conclusion of his charge, is not stated in the bill of exceptions as tendered; and that all those which are stated therein form part of one series of.requests presented to the judge as he rose to charge the jury, in which the requests as to the effect of the mortgage to the bank are so intermingled with those upon the effect of the original setting of the boiler on the land, that the whole series, and the rulings and instructions of the judge upon the matters which it embraces, must be treated as one subject, the exceptions relating to which must, so far as the question of their conformity with the truth is concerned, stand or fall together.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">For these reasons, we are of opinion that the whole bill of exceptions was rightly disallowed. In order to guard against misunderstanding, it is proper to add that we have great doubt whether, upon the commissioner\u2019s report of the facts and circumstances attending the presenting of the requests for instructions and the rulings upon the subject of those requests, there is anything which could in law be permitted to control the explicit certificate of the judge that no exception was taken to the refusal to give the instructions requested. But as, aside from this, the bill of exceptions is not conformable to the truth, we need not further consider that question. <em>Petition dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
