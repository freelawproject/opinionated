Both the defendants testified that Charles H. was never a partner with William A., but that he was employed by William A. on wages. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that he should not claim to hold Charles H. as partner in fact, but on the ground that he represented himself to the plaintiffs, before the purchase of the goods, to be a partner, and that the plaintiffs sold the goods confiding in such representations; and upon this branch of the case testimony was introduced upon both sides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-9\">The defendant, Charles H., requested the judge to instruct the jury that the plaintiffs could not recover under their declaration, in which they declared against \u201c W.
