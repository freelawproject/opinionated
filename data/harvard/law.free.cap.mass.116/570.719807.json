Writ dated July 14,1871. Answer: 1. A general <em>denial; </em>2. The statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-10\">The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, aftei judgment for the defendant, to this court, on appeal, on a statement of facts, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-11\">The accounts charged in the declaration were paid by the treasurer of the Commonwealth to said hospital at the dates mentioned, and under the acts and resolves referred to, as fol. lows: May 24, 1863, to October 1, 1863, St. 1862, <em>c. </em>223, \u00a7 11; October 1, 1863, to January 1,1864, St. 1863, <em>c. </em>240, \u00a7 9; January 1,1864, to January 1,1865, St. 1864, <em>e. </em>138, \u00a7 <em>1; </em>January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>1, 1865, to January 1, 1867, Res. 1865, <em>o. </em>16; January 1, 1867, to October 1, 1870, Res. 1867, c. 38.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-3\">Nancy Smith, was married in 1837 to Walter Brown, Jr., who died in 1838 or 1839, and never complied with or met any of the conditions which would have given him a settlement in his own right; and Nancy, after the death of her said husband, never complied with or met any of the conditions which would have given her a settlement in her own right. Walter Brown, Jr., had a derivative settlement in Ipswich from his grandfather, Stephen Brown, which was acquired in that town under the laws in force prior to the statute of 1793. Walter Brown, Sen., the father of Walter, Jr., became of age in 1809, and died in 1863. He lived in Ipswich during that interval, ten consecutive years, and paid taxes there for five of those years, prior to Walter Brown, Jr.\u2019s attaining his majority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-4\">Nancy Smith was committed to the lunatic hospital, at Taunton, by the judge of probate of Bristol County in 1856, as a person having no known settlement. She was removed to the hospital at Northampton in 1862, by the Alien Commissioners of the Commonwealth, under the provisions of the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>71, \u00a7 7. The records of the Taunton hospital show that Nancy was discharged to the Alien Commissioners, but there was no warrant, mittimus or other documentary authority for her removal, or for placing or detaining her in the hospital at Northampton. No notice whatever was given to the town of Ipswich that Nancy was in the hospital, or that that town was chargeable with her support, by either the hospital or the place of her residence, at the time she was placed in the hospital at Northampton; and no such notice was given to the town, or demand of payment made upon it, until May 24,1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-5\">If upon these facts the plaintiff is entitled to recover, judgment is to be entered for such sum as the court shall find the defendant liable for under the statutes above mentioned; otherwise judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-6\"><em>J. </em>Willard, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-7\"><em>C. A. </em>Sayward, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b587-8\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_X\">The pauper had a settlement in Ipswich; and that settlement still continues, if it has not been defeated by the St. of 1870, c. 392, \u00a7 2. She derived it from her husband, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>through an original settlement acquired by his father in that town, unless its acquisition in that mode was prevented by the existence of a previous settlement, which his father derived from his grandfather, by virtue of provisions of law in force prior to February 11, 1794. If the older settlement prevented the subsequent acquisition of the more recent one, the former is preserved by the exception in the St. of 1870. <em>Bellingham </em>v. <em>Hopkinton, </em>114 Mass. In either alternative the pauper is shown to have a present settlement in Ipswich.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">She was properly committed to the lunatic hospital at Taunton; and from there transferred to the hospital at Northampton in accordance with the provisions of the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>71, \u00a7 7. There was a change of the place, but not of the legal authority for the custody of the lunatic pauper. It was a continued maintenance of the same custody to which she had been committed in due form. No new mittimus was required. The statutes gave all the authority requisite for her transfer and subsequent detention at Northampton, under the original mittimus.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">There has been no repeal of the statute authorizing the recovery of these expenses from the town of the pauper\u2019s settlement. The St. of 1870, <em>c. </em>105, which is relied on as a repeal, merely changes the rate of compensation, and repeals acts or parts of acts inconsistent therewith. Such general language can have no effect beyond the necessary and natural result of the change which the new statute effected in the previous provisions of law relating to the subject matter of its direct provisions. The right of recovery given by the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>73, \u00a7 24, and the St. of 1862, <em>c. </em>223, \u00a7 11, is not inconsistent with the new provisions made by this statute. It is applicable to the liability, and is not affected by changes, from time to time, made in the rate by which the extent of liability is to be measured. The mention, in the St. of 1870, <em>e. </em>105, of the mode of remedy, is not the provision of a new remedy, nor a repeal or change of the existing remedy. It was probably intended to indicate that the compensation then provided for should be recovered in the mode authorized by the law as it already existed; which would have been the construction if this clause had not been inserted. <em>Gumming-ton </em>v. Wareham, 9 Cush. 585, 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The right of recovery in behalf of the Commonwealth is not governed by the provisions regulating claims between different towns. It is not limited by reason of want of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">But there is nothing in the nature of the claim, nor in the facts of the case, to take it out of the usual operation of the statute of limitations. The cause of action arose at the time the support was furnished. Ignorance of the fact of settlement makes no difference in the legal right; and does not bring the claim within the exceptions to the statute of limitations. Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>155, \u00a7 12. <em>Jennison </em>v. Roxbury, 9 Gray, 32. For the amount of the charges for support within six years of the date of the writ, there must be <em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
