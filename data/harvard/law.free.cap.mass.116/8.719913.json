Sampson, a state constable, testified as follows; \u201c On July 3, 1873, I took a search-warrant to search the premises of Michael Connor, opposite the Fitch Hotel; passed in through the front door into the bar room, and found the defendant and another man. On looking the bar over, found four small tumblers on a drainer, which smelt of liquor, and some sugar there in a drawer and a spoon in it, and all the implements for carrying on the trade.\u201d The witness being directed to state what he found, said he found a pail for rinsing; \u201c searched the cellar, and found on the cellar wall on the back stairs six bottles, four contained whiskey and two of them gin; that was all the liquor found. A door opened from the bar room into the cellar. There was a regular bar there, and beer tumblers ; no other business in that room, unless a few cigars on the shelf. There are two front rooms; front room used for sale of tobacco, cigars, . outs ; never knew of any oysters sold there. Two rooms in front, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>two doors, doors out of both rooms into the bar room. Joseph Kneeland was there with the defendant when I first went in. Have known the defendant at that place ever since I was appointed on the force, which was a year ago last June; Kneeland does not belong there. The defendant made this remark, that if I was as good to search other places as I was here I should find more liquor.\u201d On cross-examination, the witness testified that he returned these six bottles found on July 3, on the search-warrant, as the liquors of Michael Connor, and they were forfeited, no one claiming the same. On reexamination, the witness testified that the sign over the door was Shaw &amp; Connor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-4\">The defendant asked the presiding judge to rule that there was no evidence that the defendant owned or kept the liquor found there on July 3, or that he knew it was there. The presiding judge refused so to rule, but submitted the case to the jury under proper instructions. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">The second complaint charged the commission of the offence at Ware on September 3, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">At the trial in the Superior Court, on appeal, before <em>Dewey, </em>J., William E. Lewis testified for the government as follows: \u201c I know the defendant. He lived in Ware, in a house in the rear of Main Street, a house known as the \u2018 Old Barn.\u2019 I went on September 3, 1873, into his place with a search-warrant; part of his place is used for a tailor\u2019s shop. I had a search-warrant; I went in and found him upstairs; he came down as I went in. I told him what I had; he said,1 All right, look around.\u2019 As he came down he had a tunnel and measure in his hand. I looked around, and found over the sink in the kitchen several measures, some two or three measures, two tunnels. On that I went down into his cellar. I found in the cellar underneath his kitchen, buried in the ground, three jugs, buried, close by them, another three gallon jug, very nearly full; the jugs contained gin and whiskey. The way to get into this cellar was from the outside on the west side of the tenement occupied by the defendant as a dwelling-house. This cellar had been in disuse for quite a while , on a former occasion I tried to get in. I did not have any words with the defendant at that time ; afterwards he said it must be some that Webb left when he got through. This was a man who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>lived on the premises a year or two before. He said he thought he could tell me who it was that told me. The path leading into this cellar was from his back door ; it had the appearance of being used. There were footmarks on the cellar bottom leading from this outer door leading from these premises. The defendant\u2019s cellar is not used in common by any one ; not gone over by any other parties except by himself. I have been to his place so many times that I know his premises pretty well. Not far from this time I found strangers there, drunken people there; have arrested them.\u201d On cross-examination he testified: \u201c There are other tenants in the house ; don\u2019t know but one other tenant. I think the house is divided into two tenements ; there are only two front doors; I cannot say whether there are three tenants in the house or not. There are three cellars under the house; there is a cellar under the whole house, divided into three parts ; there may be three rooms in the front part, and a long cellar back of these two or three. There is a door leading out of the middle front cellar into the back cellar, through the partition. There is a door at the east end of this long cellar. There are two outside doors to this long cellar, and one door from the middle room. The cellars under the front part are used by the tenants. The northwesterly cellar is the defendant\u2019s.\u201d Reexamination : \u201c The door at the east end has been fastened for a long time. The door in the cellar is not used, the floor is covered with dust, and no footmarks leading to this.\u201d This was all the evidence introduced by the government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-4\">The defendant contended and asked the court to rule that there was no evidence that the defendant kept this liquor, or that he intended to sell the same; but the court declined so to rule, but submitted' the case to the jury\" with proper instructions. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">The third complaint charged the defendant with the same offence at Northampton on January 3, 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-6\">At the trial in the Superior Court, on appeal, before <em>Wilkinson, </em>J., Aaron R. Barton testified for the government as follows: \"\u2018 I know the defendant. He lives on the road running from Florence to Lonetown ; what is called Rum Row, three quarters of a mile from the brush shop in Florence. I don\u2019t know how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>long he has lived there ; some three or four years. I have been to his house several times ; went on the 3d of January. Elijah N. Sampson was with me. I left Sampson, who hitched his horse. When I got to the house, they locked the doors ; made considerable noise in shutting windows. I called for admittance to the house; very soon they let me in. Sampson ran around to the rear of the house. As I got in, there were two tumblers and a sugar bowl. Sampson brought around a piece of a jar and a tumbler ; had perhaps half a glass of whiskey. Tumblers had been used. A tumbler and sugar bowl was on the table in this room, a room occupied, I should judge, for a kitchen. There were three rooms on the lower floor, aside from the buttery; they run along in a row. The kitchen is the first room; the further room is the bar room, where they kept candies, cigars, tobacco, soda, small beer, small whiskey tumblers. The defendant, his wife, and a person called Jack Purcell were present. One tumbler had been recently used for liquor; the other had not. The sugar bowl had a spoon in it. Sampson found what was found outside of the house. The doors opened from all the rooms into the others, and were open at this time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-4\">Elijah hf. Sampson testified: \u201cI went with Barton on January 3. Barton went to the <em>house; </em>I stopped to hitch the horse. Heard a noise on the back side of the house, as if something had broken; there was a crash; I ran around. There was a stone jar broken, and small quantity of whiskey in the jar. The board was wet, where it had just been wet with this liquor, to all appearances. There was a broken tumbler there. I brought it around into the house. Saw a tumbler setting on the table. On some parts of the board, smelt the liquor very distinctly; I called t whiskey.\u201d This was all the evidence of the government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that there was not sufficient evidence upon which to convict the defendant. The judge declined so to rule, and submitted the case to the jury under proper instructions. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-6\"><em>D. W. </em>Bond, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-7\">C. <em>R. </em>Train, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth, was not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A23\">In each of these three cases, the sufficiency of the evidence to be submitted to the jury is so clear that a recapitulation or discussion of it could serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
