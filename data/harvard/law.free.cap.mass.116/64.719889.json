The defendant requested the court to instruct the jury that if he was the actual owner of the liquors, and there was no evidence that they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>been previously sold by him, a conviction could not be had under this complaint charging that he had reasonable cause to believe they were intended to be sold in violation of the laws of the Commonwealth, but that such conveyance could be criminal in such case only when the allegation in the complaint charged an intent to sell the same himself or to have it sold by another. The court refused to instruct the jury as requested, but instructed them that possession was <em>prim\u00e2 facie </em>evidence of ownership; that if the defendant was the owner of the liquors and intended to sell them to Bliss, or to have Bliss sell them for him, he was not liable under this complaint; but whether he was the owner or not, if he conveyed them to Bliss, having reasonable cause to believe that Bliss intended to sell them to some one else in violation of law, he would be liable under this complaint. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-4\"><em>J. </em>Brown, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-5\"><em>C.

If the defendant was owner, and intended himself to make an illegal sale to Bliss, to whom he was conveying the liquors, he was guilty of an offence against the same statute in another mode, not charged in the complaint. But that would not prevent his conviction for violation of the statute in the mode for which he was prosecuted. Exception8 <em>overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
