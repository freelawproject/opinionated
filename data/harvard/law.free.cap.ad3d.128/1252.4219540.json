As a result, a recommendation was made to have him placed in administrative segregation. Following a hearing, a Hearing Officer affirmed the recommendation and the determination was later upheld on administrative appeal. Petitioner then commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p><p id=\"b1125-5\">We confirm. The administrative segregation recommendation, together with the testimony of its author and the significant confidential information considered by the Hearing Officer in camera, provide substantial evidence supporting the determination that petitioner\u2019s \u201cpresence in [the] general population would pose a threat to the safety and security of the facility\u201d (7 NYCRR 301.4 [b]; <em>see Matter of Rivera v Prack, </em>97 AD3d 879, 880 [2012]; <em>Matter of Sutton v Selsky, </em>52 AD3d 1135, 1135-1136 [2008]). Petitioner\u2019s challenge to the reliability of the confidential information is unavailing given that the Hearing Officer conducted an independent assessment of the information, which came from multiple sources and contained sufficient detail to credibly establish that petitioner posed a threat to the safety of the facility <em>(see Matter of Mauleon v Goord, </em>29 AD3d 1241, 1242 [2006]; <em>Matter of Sattan v Goord, </em>17 AD3d 1125, 1126 [2005]). Moreover, we find no merit to petitioner\u2019s assertion that he was improperly denied witnesses inasmuch as their testimony would have been either immaterial or redundant <em>(see Matter of H\u2019Shaka v Fischer, </em>121 AD3d 1455, 1456 [2014], <em>lv denied </em>24 NY3d 913 [2015]; <em>Matter of Fludd v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>62 AD3d 1149, 1153 [2009], <em>lv denied </em>13 NY3d 705 [2009]). Likewise, there is no indication that the Hearing Officer was biased or that petitioner was otherwise denied a fair hearing <em>(see Matter of H\u2019Shaka v Fischer, </em>121 AD3d at 1457; <em>Matter of Fludd v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>62 AD3d at 1153). We have considered petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be unpersuasive.</p><p id=\"b1126-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>Peters, P.J., Garry, Egan Jr. and Clark, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the determination is confirmed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p><p label=\"*\">\n\n</p><p id=\"b1125-8\"> Although petitioner has been released from administrative segregation and transferred to another correctional facility, the proceeding is not moot given that he requests expungement of the determination from his institutional record (see <em>Matter of Hand v Prack, </em>114 AD3d 982, 982 n [2014]).</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
