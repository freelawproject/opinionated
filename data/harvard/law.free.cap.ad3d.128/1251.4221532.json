As a result, he was charged in a misbehavior report with assaulting another inmate and engaging in violent conduct. Following a tier III disciplinary hearing, petitioner was found guilty of both charges. The determination was subsequently reversed upon administrative appeal and a rehearing was ordered. Following the rehearing, petitioner was again found guilty as charged. That determination was affirmed upon administrative appeal, and this CPLR article 78 proceeding ensued.</p><p id=\"b1124-5\">We confirm. The misbehavior report, rehearing testimony and confidential information considered by the Hearing Officer in camera provide substantial evidence to support the determination of guilt <em>(see Matter of Lopez v New York State Dept. of Corr. &amp; Community </em>Supervision, 125 AD3d 1032, 1033 [2015]; <em>Matter of McCain v Fischer, </em>104 AD3d 1009, 1009 [2013]). Contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, \u201cthe Hearing Officer made an independent assessment of the reliability of the confidential information based upon his interview with the correction sergeant, who conducted the investigation\u201d <em>(Matter of White v Fischer, </em>121 AD3d 1478, 1479 [2014]; <em>see Matter of Spencer v Annucci, </em>122 AD3d 1043, 1044 [2014]). Nor are we persuaded by petitioner\u2019s claim that the rehearing was not conducted in a timely manner <em>(see Matter of Jay v Fischer, </em>120 AD3d 1466, 1466 [2014], <em>lv denied </em>24 NY3d 909 [2014]; <em>Matter of McFadden v Prack, </em>120 AD3d 853, 855 [2014], <em>lv dismissed </em>24 NY3d 930 [2014], <em>lv denied </em>24 NY3d 908 [2014]).</p><p id=\"b1124-6\">Peters, P.J., Lahtinen, Garry and Lynch, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the determination is confirmed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
