On appeal, he maintains that Iowa officials \u2014 by enforcing a policy that affected inmate access to religious services\u2014 violated his free exercise and equal protection rights, and violated a state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-18\">Regarding the free exercise claim, we note that Mr. Bear\u2019s complaint did not specify his faith, his beliefs under his faith, or how the policy in question conflicted with his beliefs. Regarding his equal protection claim, we note that there was no evidence in the record indicating that-differences in treatment were motivated by intentional or purposeful discrimination. Thus, upon careful de novo review, we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted. <em>See Brooks v. Roy, </em>776 F.3d 957, 960 (8th Cir.2015) (discussing free exercise claims); <em>Patel v. U.S. Bur. of Prisons, </em>515 F.3d 807, 815-16 (8th Cir.2008) (discussing equal protection claims); <em>Weir v. Nix, </em>114 F.3d 817, 821 n. 7 (8th Cir.1997) (violation of state statute, without more, is insufficient to establish \u00a7 1983 claim); <em>see also Fullington v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>720 F.3d 739, 747 (8th Cir.2013) (court of appeals may affirm for any reason supported by record). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-26\">. The Honorable Edward J. McManus, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
