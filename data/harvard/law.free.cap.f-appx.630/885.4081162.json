After review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b908-19\">A. Notice of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b908-20\">On September 14, 2009, the United States Department of Homeland Security issued Twum a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d). The NTA alleged that Twum, who had previously been admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant K-l on December 10, 2006, for a period not to exceed March 10, 2007, had remained in the United States beyond that date without authorization from the Citizenship and Immigration Service. The NTA further alleged that Twum had not been granted an adjustment of status, which would allow her to remain in the United States, and thus charged her as subject to removal under Section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). On October 13, 2011, Twum admitted the NTA\u2019s allegations and conceded her removability, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>requested an adjustment of status as relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">B. Adjustment of Status Hearing Before IJ</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">On October 29, 2012, Twum was given an adjustment of status hearing before an IJ. At the hearing, the IJ considered arguments as to whether Twum\u2019s previously failed attempts to have her status adjusted through 1-130 and 1-485 petitions were properly dismissed. The IJ also reviewed prior findings by immigration officers as to whether Twum\u2019s marriage to United States citizen Willey Smiley was bona fide, which is required for adjustment of status. <em>Matter of Sesay, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 431, 440 (BIA 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Later that day, the IJ issued an oral decision denying Twum\u2019s adjustment of status request and ordering her removed. The IJ concluded that Twum had failed to establish the bona fides of her marriage to Smiley that would warrant adjustment of status, stating that Twum had \u201cnot shown that this was a viable marriage for other than immigration purposes.\u201d In support of that conclusion, in addition to highlighting various discrepancies between Twum\u2019s and Smiley\u2019s testimony with respect to prior adjustment of status petitions, the IJ noted that Twum had failed to present documents that would establish the bona fides of Twum\u2019s marriage under the REAL ID Act or show reasonable cause why they were not presented, such as evidence of joint property or joint taxes or other such items.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">C. Appeal to BIA</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">On November 26, 2012, Twum filed a Notice of Appeal asking the BIA to review the IJ\u2019s decision. In her appeal brief, Twum explained why she believed she had met the requirements for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245, but did not address the IJ\u2019s findings with respect to the REAL ID Act\u2019s requirements for establishing a bona fide marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">On October 24, 2014, the BIA issued a decision affirming the IJ\u2019s decision and ordering that Twum\u2019s appeal be dismissed. The BIA \u201cagree[d] with the Immigration Judge that [Twum] failed to adequately establish the bona fides of her marriage.\u201d Citing the REAL ID Act, the BIA noted that Twum had failed to provide tax or insurance documents or other such evidence that would establish a bona fide marriage and that she provided no explanation for the absence of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">D.Motion to Reconsider</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">On November 24, 2014, Twum filed a motion to reconsider with the BIA asking it to reconsider her appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In her appeal brief, Twum reiterated arguments from her prior brief as to why her marriage should be considered to have been bona fide, and Twum made new arguments not made in her prior brief that the immigration officer had erroneously adjudicated her prior 1-130 petition and that the IJ lacked jurisdiction to reconsider her adjustment of status request. However, Twum did not challenge the BIA\u2019s application of the REAL ID Act and its findings regarding Twum\u2019s failure to present documentary evidence that would establish the bona fides of her marriage, or an explanation for their absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">On January 29, 2015, the BIA denied Twum\u2019s motion to reconsider explaining that Twum had \u201cnot identified any material error of fact or law in [its] prior decision.\u201d It stated that Twum\u2019s brief had reargued issues previously presented and raised new issues not previously present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>ed. On February 27, 2015, Twum filed a petition for review from the BIA\u2019s January 29,2015 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">A petition for review must be filed with the court of appeals no later than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The statutory time limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is mandatory and jurisdictional and is not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>677 F.3d 1043, 1045 (11th Cir.2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A motion filed with the BIA to reopen or reconsider the removal order does not toll the time for filing a petition for review with this Court. <em>See Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">A motion to reconsider \u201cshall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). \u201c[A] motion that merely republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place gives the tribunal no reason to change its mind.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Therefore, a motion to reconsider that merely reiterates arguments previously presented to the BIA does not specify errors of fact or law as required for a successful motion to reconsider. <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)). Additionally, a motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied. <em>Matter of O-S-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">To the extent Twum\u2019s petition should be construed as a challenge to the BIA\u2019s initial decision dismissing her appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for adjustment of status and order of removal, we must dismiss her appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The BIA dismissed Twum\u2019s appeal on October 24, 2014. Twum\u2019s motion to reconsider did not toll the time to petition for review from that order. <em>See Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3. Accordingly, to timely petition for this Court\u2019s review of the BIA\u2019s October 24, 2014 order, Twum would have needed to file a petition for review by November 23, 2014, which she did not do. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The petition that Twum filed was not filed until February 27, 2015, and only referred to the BIA\u2019s January 29, 2015 denial of her motion to reconsider. Therefore, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s denial of Twum\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">As to her motion to reconsider, Twum failed to identify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s initial order dismissing her appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision. In that order, the BIA agreed with the IJ that Twum had failed to adequately establish the bona fides of her marriage to Smiley and consequently failed to meet the requisites for adjustment of status. The BIA based its decision in part on application of the .REAL ID 'Act and Twum\u2019s failure to establish the bona fides of her marriage consistent with that act. As a result, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">In moving the BIA to reconsider its October 24, 2014 order, Twum needed to specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order drawing support by pertinent authority. INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(6)(C). But Twum did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>neither. Instead, Twum reiterated her bona fides arguments regarding her marriage that she had made previously, and she made new arguments regarding alleged errors in a prior 1-130 petition adjudication and the IJ\u2019s alleged lack of jurisdiction. As we explain above, such arguments do not specify relevant errors of fact or law sufficient for purposes of a motion to reconsider. And notably, Twum failed to challenge the BIA\u2019s application of the REAL ID Act in support of its decision. Twum points to no authority showing either that the BIA erred by basing its decision to uphold the IJ\u2019s decision in part on application of the READ ID Act\u2019s requirements or that it erred by misapplying its requirements. As a result, we cannot say that the BIA rested its October 24, 2014 decision on insufficient grounds. Therefore, we cannot say that the BIA abused its discretion in denying Twum\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-14\">.
