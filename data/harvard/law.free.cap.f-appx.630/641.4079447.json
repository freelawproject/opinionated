Rush pled guilty to one count of possessing a firearm and ammunition while an unlawful user of a controlled substance, and one count of possessing a firearm and ammunition as a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(3), 922(g)(1), and 924(a)(2). The district eourt<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sen-fenced Rush to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. Rush appeals his sentence. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this eourt affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-25\">Rush was an unlawful user of marijuana when officers patted him down and seized from his waist a Beretta pistol (which he admitted stealing): Three years later, officers responded to a report of a man with a gun. Rush matched the description and fled when officers approached him. Running away, he threw down a .380 pistol (which he admitted taking without the owner\u2019s consent). The district court granted an upward departure, increasing the Guideline range from 37-46 months to 57-71 months. The court sentenced Rush to concurrent 60-month sentences for each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-26\">Rush asserts no procedural error. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (the appellate court \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error\u201d). This court reviews \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence. [ ] under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An abuse of discretion happens if a district court \u201c(1) fails to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight; (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor; or (3) considers only the appropriate factors but in weighing those factors commits a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-27\">Rush primarily attacks the upward departure. The Government counters that any departure error is harmless because the district court said it would impose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>same sentence as a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Rush invokes <em>United States v. Davis, </em>690 F.3d 912, 929 (8th Cir.2012), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2852, 186 L.Ed.2d 903 (2013) (vacating in light of <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013)), <em>aff'd, </em>736 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir.2013). In <em>Davis, </em>the district court failed to retroactively apply the Fail\u2019 Sentencing Act. <em>Davis, </em>690 F.3d at 928. This court initially found that error harmless because \u201cDavis also fails to point to anything suggesting the district court would impose a different sentence on remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 929. On remand from the Supreme Court, this court again affirmed the sentence. <em>Davis, </em>736 F.3d at 785. This court found harmless any <em>Alleyne </em>error because the district court did not base the sentence on the mandatory minimum and closely analyzed the section 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Similarly here, any error in departing under the Guidelines was harmless. <em>See United States v. Grandon, </em>714 F.3d 1093, 1098 (8th Cir.2013) (\u201cBecause we conclude the district court did not abuse its substantial discretion in varying upward to 132 months imprisonment, any error in alternatively imposing an upward departure would be harmless because the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). The district court \u201ccarefully considered] each and every [section 3553(a) ] factor\u201d and varied based on Rush\u2019s serious criminal history, the likelihood of recidivism, and the danger to the community. The court cited \u201clenient treatment by the state courts\u201d that failed to change Rush\u2019s behavior, Rush\u2019s \u201ccomplete disrespect for the laws and for the individuals who enforce the laws,\u201d and Rush\u2019s \u201cusual thing\u201d of running from police. The court emphasized Rush\u2019s history of possessing stolen and defaced firearms \u2014 including a sawed-off shotgun \u2014 as well as his 14 criminal offenses as an adult. The district court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, highlighting the possession of at least one stolen firearm. The district court did not abuse its discretion in varying upward by fourteen months from the original Guideline range of 37-46 months. <em>See United States v. Bridges, </em>569 F.3d 374, 379 (8th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe district court has wide latitude to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in each case and assign some factors greater weight than others in determining an appropriate sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">5$\u00ed</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-22\">.
