Borda argues on appeal that the facts supporting his suit became apparent only during cross-examination of DEA agent Michael Chase, which took place within the limitations period. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo, </em>accepting the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Chappell v. Rich, </em>340 F.3d 1279, 1282 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, federal courts must screen prisoners\u2019 civil complaints against the government or its officers, dismissing any suits that are frivolous, malicious, or that fail to state a claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a)-(b). Expiration of the applicable statute of limitations warrants dismissal of a claim as frivolous. <em>Clark v. Ga. Pardons &amp; Paroles Bd., </em>915 F.2d 636, 640 n. 2 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\"><em>Bivens </em>actions are subject to the same statute of limitations that governs actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Kelly v. Serna, </em>87 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1996). Section 1983 actions are in turn subject to the relevant state\u2019s personal injury limitations period. <em>See Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 276, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1947, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985). Florida\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury claims is four years. <em>Chappell, </em>340 F.3d at 1283. Borda\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim is therefore subject to that four-year clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">That clock began to run when his cause of action accrued. Federal law determines when a federal claim accrues. <em>Rozar v. Mullis, 85 </em>F.3d 556, 561 (11th Cir.1996). Accrual occurs when \u201cthe facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561-62 (quotation omitted). In other words, the statute of limitations starts to run when a plaintiff knows or should know that he was injured and who inflicted that injury. <em>Id. </em>at 562. We must first identify the injury alleged, and then determine when Borda could have sued for it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">In December 2014, Borda filed a <em>Bivens </em>action against Chase and other government agents. Borda alleged that (1) Chase unreasonably seized his person in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and (2) Chase violated his Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights by knowingly making false statements in an affidavit supporting Borda\u2019s extradition from Colombia on drug trafficking charges. Borda claimed that the falsity of Chase\u2019s statements became apparent to him only during a <em>Brady </em>hearing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on December 12, 2011, when Chase was cross-examined about an alleged inconsistency between his field notes and the extradition affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">The alleged inconsistency was as follows. In \u00b6 10 of the extradition affidavit, dated January 14, 2009, Chase stated that (1) Borda met his co-cqnspirators at a restaurant in Mexico to discuss smuggling co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>caine into Mexico and the United States; (2) this meeting was observed by DEA agents; and (3) Borda agreed to arrange half of the 1,000-kilogram shipment. During cross-examination at the <em>Brady </em>hearing, Chase testified that the notes on which he based this extradition affidavit did not specifically say that Borda agreed to smuggle drugs into the United States. Instead, Chase\u2019s notes read: \u201cTony<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> authorized Junior<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to move dope to Monterray [sic].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tony told [confidential informant] that he gave trust to Junior and he blew it.\u201d Chase, admitted that his statement in the extradition affidavit interpreted what the informant had told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Borda attached to his <em>Bivens </em>complaint a letter from the government to his attorney, dated June 22, 2010. This letter, titled \u201cRE: Questions in regard to extradition affidavit,\u201d answered specific queries from Borda\u2019s attorney regarding the extradition affidavit, including one about \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">In screening Borda\u2019s case as required by \u00a7 1915A, the magistrate judge recommended that it be dismissed as barred by the four-year statute of limitations. The magistrate judge noted that Borda based his claim on an allegedly false affidavit dated January 14, 2009. The latest Borda could possibly have become aware of the affidavit was June 22, 2010, because the government\u2019s letter to Borda\u2019s counsel proved that Borda was aware of the affidavit\u2019s contents at that time, if not earlier. Yet Borda filed his complaint in December 2014, nearly six years after the affidavit and over four years after the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Borda objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s R &amp; R, arguing he was not actually aware that his constitutional rights were violated until the December 12, 2011 <em>Brady </em>hearing. However, Borda did not dispute the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that he was aware of the letter on June 22, 2010. He also acknowledged that he \u201cwas aware of some of the contents of the affidavit,\u201d but claimed he was not aware of \u00b6 10\u2019s alleged falsity. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s R &amp; R and dismissed Borda\u2019s complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">Borda misconstrues the test for accrual. Whether he was <em>actually </em>aware of the affidavit\u2019s alleged falsity is only one component of the test. The other is whether the alleged falsity; <em>should have been </em>apparent to a reasonably prudent person in his situation. <em>See Brown v. Ga. Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>335 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (\u201cWhat Brown ignores is the fact that the statute of limitations begins to run from the date \u2018the facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u2019 For the purposes of this case the operative phrase is \u2018should be apparent.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). Borda argues on appeal that \u201cthe factual background of the appellant\u2019s criminal case is entirely too complex,\u201d and nothing would \u201carouse the appellant\u2019s suspicion that potentially, one paragraph out of thousands of documents, was false.\u201d He claims that \u201cthe District Court erred in dismissing the action as time barred by failure to have looked to when the appellant <em>first realized </em>that he had been injured.\u201d But actual awareness is only half the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">Chase\u2019s extradition affidavit issued January 14, 2009. A letter to Borda\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>responding to specific inquiries about the extradition affidavit is dated June 22, 2010. Both in his objection to the R <em>&amp; </em>R and on appeal, Borda admits that he was generally aware of the extradition affidavit: \u201c[p]laintiff[ ]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> acknowledges that he was aware of some of the contents of the affidavit\u201d; \u201c[t]he letter in question generally informed the appellant that some of the intercepted wire taps were recorded, and would be interpreted by the government informant ...\u201d Borda has never argued that he was unaware of the affidavit\u2019s <em>existence </em>at least as of June 22, 2010 \u2014 only that he was unaware of its <em>falsity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The facts supporting Borda\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim would have been apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights as of at least June 22, 2010. Chase\u2019s allegedly false statement regarding Borda\u2019s drug smuggling activities occurred in \u00b6 10 of the six-page extradition affidavit. Borda acknowledged that he was generally aware of the affidavit. And as soon as he became aware of the extradition affidavit, which would have been discoverable to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights by at least the date of the letter to his counsel discussing it, Borda should have known that he was injured and who injured him. <em>See Rozar, </em>85 F.3d at 562. Assuming that Chase\u2019s statement actually was false, Bor-da should have immediately recognized this mischaracterization of his own activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">That Borda only later recognized the alleged falsity of \u00b6 10 is immaterial to the accrual test\u2019s second component. Cross-examining Chase at the <em>Brady </em>hearing may have revealed the reason for the purported falsehood: an inconsistency between Chase\u2019s field notes and the extradition affidavit. But no such inquiry was needed to identify the alleged falsehood itself \u2014 -which is the basis for Borda\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim \u2014 or who was responsible for it. The clock on Borda\u2019s claim thus began to run, at the latest, on June 22, 2010. By that time he should have been aware of the affidavit\u2019s contents, even if he was not aware of its alleged falsity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because Borda did not file his complaint until December 2014, it was barred by the four-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Borda\u2019s complaint also included a Fourth Amendment seizure claim, but he never stated when or how he was actually seized by Chase in violation of his rights. This claim was not addressed by the magistrate judge or the district court, and Borda does not challenge that omission or raise the claim on appeal. He has thus abandoned the issue. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">We conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Borda\u2019s action as barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-9\">. <em>Bivens v.
