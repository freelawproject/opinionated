The IJ\u2019s decision denied asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our lawful power to interfere is highly limited. No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA \u201cexpressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA adopted expressly the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusion that Hossain failed to demonstrate that the Bangladesh government was unwilling or unable to protect him, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">We review legal determinations <em>de novo. Id. </em>And we review fact determinations under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test\u201d whereby we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). In reviewing the agency\u2019s decision, we may not \u201creweigh the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1029. Instead, we \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027. \u201c[T]he mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To reverse a fact determination, we must conclude \u201cthat the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d that is, a person unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear or persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground, including political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status with specific and credible evidence. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Hossain, who is a member of the Bangladesh National Party (\u201cBNP\u201d), sought relief based on his political opinion; After Hossain was promoted within the BNP, he began receiving threatening calls from members of the opposing Awami League. Hossain contends that members of the Awami League also attacked his home on two occasions. During the first attack\u2014 which occurred when Hossain was away\u2014 Awami League members asked Hossain\u2019s family about Hossain\u2019s whereabouts, ransacked Hossain\u2019s house, and beat Hos-sain\u2019s parents. About the second attack, Hossain contends that twelve to fourteen members of the Awami League surrounded his house, but that Hossain escaped out the back door. The Awami League members then asked Hossain\u2019s family about Hossain\u2019s location, beat Hossain\u2019s parents and wife, and threatened to kidnap and kill Hossain\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Hossain reported neither attack to the police. Instead, Hossain reported the incidents to leaders within the BNP, who told him that the local police would not help because the Awami League was in power. Shortly after the two attacks, Hossain fled Bangladesh and entered the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">The IJ denied Hossain relief. The IJ concluded, among other things, that Hos-sain failed to demonstrate that the Bangladesh government was unable or unwilling to control a pattern and practice of violence committed by private parties against members of the BNP. The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s assessment of that dispositive issue and then declined to consider Hos-sain\u2019s other appellate arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">When a petitioner seeks relief based on alleged persecution by private actors, as in Hossain\u2019s case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the petitioner\u2019s \u201cfailure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>report persecution to local government authorities generally is fatal to an asylum claim.\u201d <em>See Lopez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1345 (11th Cir.2007). A petitioner\u2019s failure to seek government protection may be excused, however, \u201cwhere the petitioner convincingly demonstrates that those authorities would have been unable or unwilling to protect [him], and for that reason [he] could not rely on them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determination that Hossain failed to satisfy his burden of showing that the Bangladesh government was unwilling or unable to protect him. In denying Hossain relief, the IJ\u2014 relying mainly on a State Department Country Report on Bangladesh \u2014 determined that \u201cadministrative and judicial remedies are available for alleged wrongs in Bangladesh, and the government does not interfere with civil judicial proceedings.\u201d In addition, citizens can present cases for mediation through alternative dispute resolution proceedings. The IJ acknowledged that Bangladesh\u2019s judicial system is \u201cslow and cumbersome.\u201d Still, the IJ determined that the Bangladesh government\u2019s recognition of citizens\u2019 rights to seek remedies for human-rights violations demonstrated the government\u2019s willingness to control patterns or practices of violence committed by members of society.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">The IJ\u2019s factual findings, which were adopted by the BIA, are supported by substantial evidence presented in the Bangladesh 2013 Human Rights Report (\u201cCountry Report\u201d). And we have said that the BIA and the IJ are \u201centitled to rely heavily on\u201d such reports. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1354 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">On appeal, Hossain argues that the BIA and the IJ erred in failing to consider properly two pieces of evidence: (1) Hos-sain\u2019s credible testimony that he was told by BNP leaders that the police would not help protect him; and (2) information in the Country Report about human rights violations, politically motivated <em>violence </em>(including a government raid of BNP\u2019s offices), and the government\u2019s failure to investigate effectively extrajudicial killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">To the extent that Hossain contends that the BIA and the IJ \u201cignored\u201d or failed to consider entirely these pieces of evidence, his argument is refuted by the record. In its detailed order, the IJ determined that Hossain testified credibly that he was told by BNP leaders that the police would not help him. About the Country Report, the IJ acknowledged expressly the existence of \u201cwidespread official corruption and violence on behalf of opposing political parties,\u201d including the government raid of a BNP office. The IJ also noted that \u201cpolitical life in Bangladesh is historically rough and violent, and opposition parties strive to undermine the efficient functioning of the government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">In essence, Hossain\u2019s argument on appeal is that the BIA and the IJ ought to have given more weight to his credible testimony and to certain portions of the Country Report. Under our limited scope of review, however, we lack the authority to reweigh the evidence. <em>See Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1029. And, even where substantial evidence might exist to support an alternate finding, we cannot reverse the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s findings unless we \u2014 by the record \u2014 are compelled to do so. <em>See Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cOur inquiry is whether there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>substantial evidence for the findings made by the BIA, <em>not </em>whether there is substantial evidence for some <em>other </em>finding that could have been, but was not, made.\u201d). Here, substantial evidence in the Country Report does support the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s determination that Hossain failed to demonstrate convincingly that the Bangladesh government would have been unable or unwilling to protect him. The record does not command that the opposite conclusion is the only conclusion that necessarily can be rightly reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Hossain has failed to demonstrate that he is unable to obtain protection in Bangladesh. Thus, he is ineligible for asylum and for withholding of removal. We deny the petition and affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">PETITION DENIED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-18\">. Hossain raises no challenge to the portions of the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions denying relief under the Convention Against Torture; so that issue is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\">. Although Hossain contends that he and his family were attacked and threatened by mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>bers of the Awami League, he has not alleged \u2014 and nothing evidences \u2014 that his attackers worked for the government or that the attacks were otherwise sanctioned by the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b939-16\">. Hossain also challenges the BIA\u2019s statement that Hossain failed to contest the IJ's determination that the harm he suffered did not rise to the level of persecution. Because we affirm the BIA's decision on other independent grounds, we need not consider Hossain's alternate argument on appeal. - \u2022</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
