His counsel has moved to withdraw, and in a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), he challenges the substantive reasonableness of Fulks\u2019s sentence. In a pro se supplemental brief, Fulks argues that defense counsel railroaded him, with failed promises of sentencing leniency, into accepting a guilty plea on an unjustly brought charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-23\">Upon careful review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to vary below the Guidelines range, and that the resulting sentence is not substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (standard of review); <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>573 F.3d 586, 590 (8th Cir.2009). As to the pro se arguments, we decline to review any ineffective-assistance claims in this direct criminal appeal, <em>see United States v. Looking Cloud, </em>419 F.3d 781, 788-89 (8th Cir.2005); and to the extent Fulks suggests that his guilty plea was involuntary, this newly raised contention is not properly before us, <em>see United States v. Murphy, </em>899 F.2d 714, 716 (8th Cir.1990). Finally, having independently reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-24\">Accordingly, we affirm. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-20\">. The Honorable Timothy L. Brooks, United States District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
