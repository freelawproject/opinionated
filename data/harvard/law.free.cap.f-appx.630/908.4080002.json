The district court affirmed, and Plaintiff now appeals. Defendants Patricia Nelson Horne and Richard D. Horne<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cross appeal the district court\u2019s order denying them appellate attorney\u2019s fees. Defendants also filed a motion with this Court seeking attorney\u2019s fees for the present appeal. .</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">Defendants filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on January 10, 2011. This triggered an automatic stay of any litigation against Defendants under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the automatic stay, Plaintiff filed a civil action against Mr. Horne in state court. Defendants were discharged from bankruptcy on May 10, 2011. Plaintiff ignored requests to voluntarily dismiss the civil suit against Mr. Horne and maintained the action until it was dismissed in November 2011, more than 200 days after she initially filed her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-17\">Defendants filed a motion in bankruptcy court seeking damages from Plaintiff for violating the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. They later amended their motion to add a request for damages for Plaintiffs violation of the discharge injunction provision of the bankruptcy code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court granted Defendants\u2019 amended motion and awarded them $81,714.31 in damages, including $41,714.31 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-18\">Plaintiff appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s damages award, but the district court affirmed that award. The district court subsequently denied Plaintiff\u2019s motion for rehearing and awarded Defendants $34,551.28 in attorney\u2019s fees for defending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>the appeal, Plaintiff then filed two identical motions for recusal of the bankruptcy court judge: one in district court and one in bankruptcy court. Plaintiff sought re-cusal on the basis of \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that the bankruptcy judge was biased. Specifically, the judge\u2019s courtroom deputy is the sister of a paralegal for Defendants\u2019 bankruptcy counsel. The paralegal had offered affidavit testimony during the trial that contradicted Plaintiffs testimony. According to Plaintiff, the judge credited the paralegal\u2019s testimony over Plaintiffs. Plaintiff alleged that the connection between the courtroom deputy and the paralegal-witness at least gave the appearance of partiality and therefore warranted recusal and vacatur.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The bankruptcy court denied Plaintiffs motion for recusal. Plaintiff appealed that ruling and moved to consolidate it with her appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s damages award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court granted Plaintiffs motion to consolidate and affirmed , the bankruptcy judge\u2019s ruling on Plaintiffs motion for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Plaintiff then appealed various district court orders to this Court. We considered our jurisdiction to review the orders <em>sua sponte </em>and held that Plaintiff could appeal only the district court\u2019s order concerning recusal. Defendants cross appealed a second district court order that denied them appellate attorney\u2019s fees for defending against Plaintiffs appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s recusal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">II. RECUSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">The district court first concluded that recusal was not necessary under the federal judge recusal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). The district court then determined that, even assuming for the sake of argument the need for recusal under \u00a7 455(a), reversal for failure to recuse would not have been required under <em>Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., </em>486 U.S. 847, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 (1988). We review the district court\u2019s order concerning recusal for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Walker, </em>532 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">A. Recusal was not required under \u00a7 455(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">Under \u00a7 455(a), a federal judge \u201cshall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). The purpose of \u00a7 455(a) is \u201cto promote confidence in the judiciary by avoiding even the appearance of impropriety whenever possible.\u201d <em>Liljeberg, </em>486 U.S. at 865, 108 S.Ct. 2194. Recusal is thus warranted \u201conly if an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We do not consider the perceptions of idiosyncratic, hypersensitive, and cynical observers. <em>See Sensley v. Albritton, </em>385 F.3d 591, 599 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">We agree with the district court that recusal is unwarranted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To begin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>with, there is no evidence of a direct connection between the bankruptcy judge and the courtroom deputy\u2019s sister. And like the district court, we are unable to locate any cases suggesting that a judge\u2019s administrative employee\u2019s relationship with a witness is grounds for the judge\u2019s recusal. To the contrary, recusal is warranted on the basis of a judicial employee\u2019s relationships only when the employee has (or appears to have) a role in the substantive decision-making process. <em>See Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1100-02 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that the district court did not abuse its discretion by determining that a law clerk\u2019s prior employment with a law firm representing a party in the case did not call into question the judge\u2019s impartiality and thus did not warrant recu-sal), <em>abrogated on other grounds as recognized by Nurse v. Sheraton Atlanta Hotel, </em>618 Fed.Appx. 987, 990, 2015 WL 4153677, at *3 (11th Cir. July 10, 2015); <em>Parker v. Connors Steel Co., </em>855 F.2d 1510, 1523-25 (11th Cir.1988) (concluding that an appearance of impropriety existed because a law clerk\u2019s father was a partner in the law firm that represented the defendant, the law clerk held a hearing in the judge\u2019s absence, and the judge credited the law clerk in a footnote of the opinion); <em>Hunt v. Am. Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Baton Rouge, </em>783 F.2d 1011, 1015-16 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam) (holding that recusal was not required when two of the judge\u2019s law clerks had accepted employment offers from the law firm representing the defendants while the case was pending, or because the case had been assigned to one of those law clerks as a \u201cministerial\u201d matter before the law clerk was screened from it). The record does not indicate that the courtroom deputy had a role in the bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision-making process. Consequently, recusal was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">In addition to our own Court\u2019s authority concerning recusal, we find a recent case from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals particularly relevant and persuasive. <em>See Mathis v. Huff &amp; Puff Trucking, Inc., </em>787 F.3d 1297 (10th Cir.2015). In that case, the husband of the trial judge\u2019s law clerk had been hired by the defendant\u2019s insurer to monitor the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1304. The Tenth Circuit held that the judge did not err in declining to recuse himself because the law clerk did not have continuing substantial participation in the case, the insurer was not the defendant, the law clerk performed only ministerial acts at trial, and she did not participate in drafting post-trial findings and conclusions. <em>Id. </em>at 1312-13. As mentioned above, the record here is devoid of evidence that the courtroom deputy had any substantive role in the bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision. Moreover, the deputy\u2019s sister was merely an affiant, not the defendant. These facts lead us to agree with the district court that recusal was not warranted and indeed would have been inappropriate. <em>See United States v. Greenough, </em>782 F.2d 1556, 1558 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201c[A] judge, having been assigned to a case, should not recuse himself on unsupported, irrational, or highly tenuous speculation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">In sum, recusal is not required merely because the movant can \u201cdraw[ ] a line ... connecting a person within chambers to a person or firm related, no matter how remotely, to a party in the case.\u201d <em>Mathis, </em>787 F.3d at 1312 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>Hamid v. Price Water</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number><em>house, </em>51 F.3d 1411, 1417 (9th Cir.1995).) Because Plaintiff has done no more than identify a relationship between the courtroom deputy and a witness in the case, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that re-cusal was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">B. The absence of a \u00a7 455(a) violation ends our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The district court was not required to go further in its analysis once it concluded that recusal was unnecessary under \u00a7 455(a). Nevertheless, the court considered whether, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that re-cusal had been warranted under \u00a7 455(a), reversal would have been appropriate under <em>Liljeberg. </em>Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in making its recusal determination, we do not analyze whether, in a counter-factual world in which a \u00a7 455(a) violation had occurred, vacatur would be appropriate under <em>Lilje-berg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">III. APPELLATE ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Defendants cross appeal the district court\u2019s order denying them appellate attorney\u2019s fees incmred during Plaintiffs unsuccessful appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s recusal order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s order states that , because the underlying appeal \u201cinvolvefd] violation of the <em>discharge injunction,\u201d </em>attorney\u2019s fees are \u201cnot authorized.\u201d By that statement, the court was perhaps explaining that attorney\u2019s fees for litigation dealing with violations of the discharge injunction are discretionary. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105; <em>In re Hardy, </em>97 F.3d 1384, 1389-91 (11th Cir.1996). If so, the court was presumably exercising its discretion not to award attorney\u2019s fees for Defendants\u2019 expenses during the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">A problem with that analysis arises, however, due to the fact that the district court cites 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(k), which provides that \u201can individual injured by any willful violation of a stay ... <em>shall </em>recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d (emphasis added), which presumably means that an award of attorney\u2019s fees is mandatory for a stay violation, albeit only discretionary for a discharge violation. The distinct court declined to explain why Plaintiffs recusal motion did not involve the litigation over her stay violation, as well as her discharge violation. Instead, the court cites its order that ruled on the merits of the recusal appeal. But that order provides no help here. It says only that \u201c[Plaintiff] admits that she violated the automatic stay and seeks reversal only as to the violation of the discharge injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">The district court does not provide a citation or other support for the above statement. We have combed the more than 3,000 page record and are no more enlightened. Plaintiffs various motions and briefs suggest that she seeks a new trial for <em>all </em>issues litigated before the bankruptcy court, including the stay violation. For example, Plaintiffs motion for recusal alleges that as a result of the bankruptcy judge\u2019s alleged bias, Plaintiffs \u201ccredibility as <em>to all other issues </em>and areas of her testimony was damaged.\u201d Her reply brief in defense of her recusal appeal at the district court states that \u201c[i]t is obvious that [Plaintiff] is entitled both to a new trial and vacatur\u201d and \u201creversal and vacatur of [the bankruptcy judge\u2019s] prior <em>decisions </em>is mandated, recusal ordered, and a new bankruptcy judge appointed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>In sum, Plaintiff does not appear to have limited her motion for recusal and vacatur to the discharge injunction litigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">At times even the district court seems not to construe Plaintiffs motion for recu-sal so narrowly. In its order addressing Plaintiffs appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of her motion for recusal, the district court writes: \u201c[Plaintiff] argues that ... application of the correct legal standard [for recusal] should result in [the bankruptcy judge\u2019s] disqualification and vacatur of the sanctions award.\u201d Notably, Defendants\u2019 sanctions award included damages for Plaintiffs violation of both the stay and the discharge injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Perhaps the district court judge\u2019s thought process was as follows: <em>Plaintiff is alleging bias became the bankruptcy judge credited the courtroom deputy\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony over Plaintiffs. That testimony was relevant to the discharge injunction. Therefore, Plaintiff seeks re-cusal only with respect to the discharge injunction judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">But even if Plaintiff is challenging the bankruptcy judge\u2019s impartiality based on his treatment of her testimony concerning the discharge injunction, Plaintiff has not so limited her recusal motion, as amply demonstrated in the foregoing paragraphs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She apparently seeks to have the entire damages award vacated and retried. In any event, we cannot ascertain a basis in the record for the district court\u2019s conclusion that the recusal appeal involved only the discharge violation and not the stay violation. We therefore remand this cross appeal to the district court with instructions to reconsider the Defendants\u2019 motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees in light of a substantiated recitation of the facts and application of the law to those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s ruling on Plaintiffs motion for recusal and REMAND Defendants\u2019 cross appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying appellate attorney\u2019s fees for Plaintiffs appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s recusal decision. Having remanded Defendants\u2019 motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the district court, we DENY without prejudice Defendants\u2019 amended motion for appellate attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>fees incurred in the present appeal before our Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-11\">. Richard Horne died during the pendency of this lawsuit. Although Patricia Nelson Horne was substituted as his personal representative, this order uses \"Defendants\u201d for ease of exposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-12\">. Section 362 states that a bankruptcy petition operates as a stay of, among other things, \"the commencement or continuation ... of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor____\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b931-21\">.Section 524 states that a discharge from bankruptcy \"operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action ... to collect, recover, or offset any [discharged] debt as a personal liability of the debtor.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b932-8\">. A final judgment had not been entered on Plaintiff's earlier appeal of the damages award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b932-9\">. Plaintiff sought recusal on the basis of \u00a7 455(a) alone. Section 455(b) sets forth several other grounds for recusal. Because Plaintiff relied exclusively on \u00a7 455(a), we do not consider other possible bases for recusal under \u00a7 455(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b932-16\">.Plaintiff's main argument for recusal is that the bankruptcy judge had an undisclosed connection to a witness. We address this argument below. Plaintiff also cites numerous adverse rulings by the bankruptcy court judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>that allegedly evidence his bias. As the district court noted, \"judicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.\" <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). The district court was correct, and we readily reject Plaintiff\u2019s argument that the bankruptcy judge\u2019s adverse rulings warrant recusal. \u2022</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AvM\">. Defendants seek a total of $14,918.60 in fees associated with the district court proceedings concerning recusal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b935-8\">. However, during the course of her appeal to this Court, Plaintiff has changed her tune, ultimately adopting the district court\u2019s conclusion. Plaintiff's first brief argues that \"[Plaintiff] has substantial grounds for remand for a new trial and to vacate the tainted judgments based on the appearance of impropriety under Section 455(a).\u201d Plaintiff does not focus on the judgment for the discharge injunction violation but on the entire damages award, including the award based on her stay violation. Even in her brief in response to Defendants\u2019 brief, Plaintiff suggests that she was originally seeking \"vacatur of the entire sanctions judgment affirmed in the first appeal,\u201d including both \u201cthe discharge injunction and the automatic stay\u201d decisions. But in her response to Defendants' amended motion for attorney\u2019s fees, Plaintiff writes that \"Appellees have cross-appealed the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys fees as they relate to the violation of the discharge injunction only.\u201d Nevertheless, as far as we can tell, when the issue of attorney\u2019s fees for Plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the recusal order was before the district court, Plaintiff did not construe her appeal as concerning only the trial of the discharge injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b935-14\">. As noted, Plaintiff has, in her latest brief, suggested that the recusal order pertained only to the discharge injunction violation and not the stay violation. This after-the-fact adoption of the district court\u2019s framing of the issue does not control whether Plaintiff\u2019s re-cusal appeal concerned the stay violation. Plaintiff's and the district court\u2019s contemporaneous statements are relevant and telling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
