Cooper appeals after the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint and denied his motions for appointment of counsel and for leave to amend his complaint. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Cooper\u2019s complaint sought po.stconviction access to DNA testing of certain evidence used at his criminal trial. Upon de novo review, this court concludes that the dismissal was proper. <em>See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, </em>557 U.S. 52, 69, 72-75, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009) (discussing contours of substantive and procedural due process rights related to postconviction access to DNA testing); <em>Schaaf v. Residential Funding Corp., </em>517 F.3d 544, 549 (8th Cir.2008) (grant of motion to dismiss is reviewed de novo). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cooper\u2019s motions. <em>See Phillips v. Jasper Cty. Jail, </em>437 F.3d 791, 794 (8th Cir.2006) (abuse-of-discretion standard applies to denial of motion for appointment of counsel; discussing relevant factors); <em>Joshi v. St. Luke\u2019s Hosp., Inc., </em>441 F.3d 552, 555, 557-58 (8th Cir.2006) (abuse-of-discretion standard applies to denial of motion for leave to amend complaint; denial may be justified by futility of amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aiv\">. The Honorable Susan O. Hickey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
