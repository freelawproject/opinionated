In declining to reduce Corbett\u2019s sentence, the district court found that a reduction was not warranted in light of his lengthy criminal history, the likelihood of recidivism, and the risk to public safety presented by his prison conduct. We conclude that there is no basis for reversal, as the district court\u2019s finding that a reduction was not warranted was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (\u00a7 3582(c) authorizes district court to reduce sentence by applying amended Guidelines range as it if were in effect at time of original sentencing, and leaving all other Guidelines determinations intact as previously determined); <em>United States v. Long, </em>757 F.3d 762, 763 (8th Cir.2014) (de novo review of whether \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes modification, and abuse-of-discretion review of decision whether to grant authorized \u00a7 3582(c)(2) modification). The judgment is affirmed, <em>see </em>8th Cir. R. 47B, and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-11\">. The Honorable Linda R.
