By moving to proceed IFP, Julian is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">A sentencing court is under no obligation at all to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to grant such a motion is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011). If the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and at least implicitly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, then there is no abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Whi-tebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Review of the record in light of pertinent authority shows-no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s disposition of Julian\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Although Julian was eligible for a reduction, the district court was not required to give him one. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. The district court explicitly noted that it took the \u00a7 3553(a) factors into account when considering the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Additionally, it noted his prior offenses and that he manufactured methamphetamine in proximity to a small child and pregnant woman. These facts go to the \u00a7 3553(a)(1) concerns of \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d Consequently, the district court acted properly by taking them into consideration. <em>See Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010. When considered' as a whole, the record shows that the district court thoughtfully deliberated upon the motion before denying it and thus did not abuse its discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Julian has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
