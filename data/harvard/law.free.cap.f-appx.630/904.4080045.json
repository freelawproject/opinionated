Lindamood, who was sixty years old when her employment was terminated, alleges that she was discriminated against based on her age, in violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.10(l)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was by a comprehensive and reasoned, written order. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">For purposes of summary judgment, the parties stipulated that Lindamood had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination and that the Department had provided a legitimate, age-neutral reason for terminating Lindamood\u2019s employment: poor job performance. On the sole issue remaining on summary judgment, the district court concluded that Lindamood failed to present sufficient evidence to show that the Department\u2019s age-neutral reason for terminating her employment was a pretext for discrimination. In ruling on the Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court cited to and applied the proper legal standard, viewing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Lindamood.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-16\">Because Lindamood\u2019s claim is based on circumstantial evidence, we apply the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc); <em>see also Zaben v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>129 F.3d 1453, 1455 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997) (age-discrimination claims brought under the FRCA are examined using the same framework used to decide actions brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act). Under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination, which creates a presumption of unlawful discrimination against the employee. <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024. The burden then shifts to the employer to \u201carticulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">To survive a motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must then \u201cintroduce significantly probative evidence showing that the asserted reason is merely a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n, </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006). A plaintiff may show pretext \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Kragor v. Takeda Pharms. Am., Inc., </em>702 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2012). The plaintiff must show <em>both </em>that the employer\u2019s stated reason is false <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real\u2019 reason for the adverse action. <em>Brooks, </em>446 F.3d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">A plaintiff cannot show pretext by recasting an employer\u2019s stated nondiscriminatory reason or by substituting her business judgment for that of the employer. <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030. \u201cProvided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>446 F.3d at 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Lindamood was hired in 2006 as a senior attorney in the Department\u2019s Division of Real Estate. One of Lindamood\u2019s main responsibilities was to handle cases before the Florida Real Estate Appraisal Board (\u201cBoard\u201d); the Board addresses complaints about licensed appraisers.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">The Department contends that Linda-mood\u2019s employment was terminated based on her poor performance presenting cases at a December 2011 Board meeting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In an affidavit, the Department\u2019s Deputy Secretary (the Department\u2019s second in command) said that Lindamood appeared \u201cvery disorganized and unprepared for her presentations\u201d and that he considered her performance to be an embarrassment to the Department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sometime during the two-day Board meeting, the Deputy Secretary expressed his concern about Linda-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>mood\u2019s performance to the Department\u2019s General Counsel, L. Layne Smith, describing Lindamood\u2019s presentations to the Board as \u201cdreadful.\u201d In the light of the Deputy Secretary\u2019s expressed concerns,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Smith decided to terminate Lindamood\u2019s employment, effective January 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Because Lindamood\u2019s alleged poor performance at the December 2011 meeting alone could motivate a reasonable employer to terminate her employment, Linda-mood must rebut the Department\u2019s proffered reason head on. <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030. Lindamood failed to do so. Lindamood presented no argument rebutting that the Deputy Secretary told Smith \u2014 or that Smith believed in. good faith \u2014 that Lindamood\u2019s presentation at the December 2011 Board meeting was \u201cdreadful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Instead, Lindamood contends that she had historically performed well at her job and challenges whether the Deputy Secretary was actually present at the December 2011 meeting. That Lindamood considers herself a good employee has no bearing on our analysis of pretext. <em>See Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1266 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cThe inquiry into pretext centers on the employer\u2019s beliefs, not the employee\u2019s beliefs, and ... not on reality as it exists outside of the decision maker\u2019s head.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">The Deputy Secretary\u2019s actual attendance at the December 2011 meeting is also immaterial. \u201cAh employer may fire an employee for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based on erroneous facts, or for-no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Smith was entitled to terminate Linda-mood\u2019s employment based on his honest belief (even if mistaken or unfair) that Lindamood performed poorly at the December 2011 meeting or based on his belief that the Deputy Secretary was dissatisfied with Lindamood\u2019s performance. <em>See id. </em>Lindamood has presented no significantly probative evidence showing that the Department\u2019s proffered reason was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Lindamood also attempts to show pretext by asserting that she was treated differently from a similarly-situated employee outside of her protected class. In determining whether employees are similarly situated for purposes of showing circumstantial evidence of discrimination, we must \u201cconsider whether the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways.\u201d <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cWe require that the quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct be nearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Lindamood has failed to demonstrate that her proffered comparator, Nicole McLaren, was similarly situated. The record shows that McLaren was' fired \u201cfor failing to take responsibility, failure to follow directions, multiple and consistent errors, inability to effectively handle her caseload, and for being untruthful.\u201d Nothing evidences that McLaren performed poorly at a meeting in front of the Board and the ASC or that Smith received complaints from the Department\u2019s Deputy Secretary about McLaren\u2019s performance. Because Lindamood has failed to identify a truly similarly-situated employee outside her protected class who was treated more favorably, she has raised no genuine issue of material fact about pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">Lindamood has failed to demonstrate either that the Department\u2019s legitimate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>non-discriminatory reason for terminating her employment was false or that discrimination was the real reason for her termination. <em>See Brooks, </em>446 F.3d at 1163. We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-11\">. Lindamood has abandoned expressly, her claims against the Department for disability discrimination under the FCRA and under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-17\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b928-6\">. The Department identified three other reasons for the decision to fire Lindamood, including deficiencies in Lindamood\u2019s legal drafting and presentation skills, that two of Lindamood\u2019s cases resulted in petitions for attorneys' fees being filed against the Department, and the overall performance issues within Lindamood's division. Because Linda-mood has failed to rebut sufficiently the Department\u2019s first legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her employment (poor performance at the December 2011 Board meeting), we need not consider the Department\u2019s additional reasons. <em>See Crawford v. City of Fairburn, Ga., </em>482 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2007) (\"If the employer proffers more than one legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the plaintiff must rebut each of the reasons to survive a. motion for summary judgment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b928-12\">. Also of importance was that members of the Appraisal Subcommittee (\"ASC\u201d), the federal agency responsible for overseeing the Department, were in attendance at the December 2011 Board meeting as part of the Department's biennial compliance audit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b929-8\">. In district court, Plaintiff did not assert that the Deputy Secretary was using Smith as a \"cat\u2019s paw\u201d to give effect to discriminatory animus.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
