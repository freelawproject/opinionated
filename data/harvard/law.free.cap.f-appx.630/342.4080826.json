The district court sentenced Thomas to 57 months of imprisonment based, in part, upon a two level adjustment for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. She argues on appeal that the district court erred in making the \u00a7 3C1.1 adjustment because she made statements in a verified objection to her presentencing report that prove that she did not \u201cwillfully\u201d take any actions to obstruct or impede the administration of justice. According to Thomas, because the Government failed to submit any evidence to rebut the statements in her verified objection, the district court erred in making the adjustment.-</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">This court reviews \u201cthe district court\u2019s legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>681 F.3d 678, 712 (5th Cir.2012). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is implausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Huerta, </em>182 F.3d 361, 364 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cWhen making factual findings for sentencing purposes, a district court may consider any information which bears sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga, </em>720 F.3d 587, 590 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); \u00a7 6A1.3 (court may consider \u201crelevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Generally, \u201ca PSR bears sufficient indicia of reliability, such that a sentencing judge may consider it as evidence in making the factual determinations required by the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Huerta, </em>182 F.3d at 364. A district court, therefore, may adopt the facts contained in a PSR \u201cwithout further inquiry if those facts have an adequate evidentiary basis with sufficient indicia of reliability and the defendant does not present rebuttal evidence or otherwise demonstrate that the information in the PSR is unreliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>702 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Facts in a PSR that do have an adequate evidentiary basis can only be refuted by the defendant with \u201crebuttal evidence demonstrating that those facts are \u2018materially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable.\u2019\u201d <em>Harris, </em>702 F.3d at 230 (quoting <em>Huerta, </em>182 F.3d at 364). A defendant\u2019s \u201c[m]ere objections do not suffice as competent rebuttal evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 329 (5th Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Puig-Infante, </em>19 F.3d 929, 943 (5th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">In making a \u00a7 3C1.1 upward adjustment to Thomas\u2019s sentence, the district court relied upon the findings contained in her presentencing report. Those findings had an \u201cadequate evidentiary basis with sufficient indicia of reliability,\u201d <em>Harris, </em>702 F.3d at 230, based upon the statements made by the Government at Thomas\u2019s sentencing hearing. Although Thomas\u2019s sworn objection contained statements which refuted the findings of the presen-tencing report, Thomas did not testify at the sentencing hearing and she otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>offered no evidence in support of her objections. Because Thomas failed to refute the facts in her presentencing report with evidence demonstrating that those facts are \u201cmaterially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable,\u201d <em>Huerta, </em>182 F.3d at 364, Thomas cannot establish that the district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous or implausible in light of the record as a whole. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s assessment of a two-level upward adjustment on the basis of \u00a7 3C1.1 and corresponding refusal to make any downward adjustment based on \u00a7 3E1.1 were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
