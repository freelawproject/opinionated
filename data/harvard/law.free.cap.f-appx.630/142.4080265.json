For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">On March 11, 2015, Rhett filed a proposed complaint and application to proceed in forma pauperis in the District Court. The District Court granted Rhett\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis and screened the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Although the District Court could discern that the allegations in the complaint appeared to relate to the administration of Rhett\u2019s late mother\u2019s trust, the District Court concluded that the complaint was essentially incoherent and lacking in any viable claim. Accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), the District Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice and provided Rhett 45 days to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Rhett subsequently filed an amended complaint. In screening the amended complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2), the District Court once again concluded that it similarly failed to state any claim upon which relief could be granted. Noting that the amended complaint appeared to present numerous unconnected grievances against various entities and individuals, interspersed with \u201csnippets of laws, receipts, grocery purchases, electricity bills, newspaper clippings, paychecks, and various applications,\u201d the District Court determined that Rhett did not provide any comprehensible allegations or \u201cdigestible set of facts\u201d from which it could discern any plausible federal cause of action. Accordingly, the District Court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Rhett appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Rhett\u2019s amended complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e). <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). Upon review, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s decision because the appeal does not raise a substantial question. 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">The District Court properly dismissed the amended complaint. Even construing the amended complaint liberally, <em>see, e.g., Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam), Rhett fails to state any cognizable claim for relief. Instead, Rhett\u2019s pleadings contain mostly unintelligible allegations against multiple disparate entities and individuals, including' the United States of America, New Jersey state and county agencies, medical doctors, insurance entities, an electric company, and Rhett\u2019s sister. The convoluted and largely incomprehensible amended complaint appears to raise various unconnected grievances against these defendants related, in part, to insufficient disability payments, misdiagnosis of an injury that occurred in 1998, loss of power at an apartment building, and the administration of his late mother\u2019s trust. Absent from the amended complaint, however, are any comprehensible, viable claims for relief. Moreover, given that Rhett was previously provided an opportunity to amend his complaint, the District Court did not err when it declined to grant Rhett further leave to amend and dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002) (explaining that leave to amend need not be granted if amendment would be futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. We also deny Rhett\u2019s pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-22\">This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\">. He also submits several documents in support of his appeal and presents several motions, including a motion to temporarily receive a monthly medical allowance and a motion to deviate from normal appellate practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
