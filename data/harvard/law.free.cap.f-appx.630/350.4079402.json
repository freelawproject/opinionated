The revocation was based on Taylor\u2019s possession and use of cocaine, in violation of the express conditions of his release. Taylor contends on appeal that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to explain adequately its reasons for imposing an above-guidelines sentence. Taylor failed to lodge an objection following the imposition of the challenged sentence, so we review the district court\u2019s decision for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\u201cA district court may impose any sentence upon revocation of supervised release that falls within the statutory maximum term allowed for the revocation sentence, but must consider the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the policy statements before doing so.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 646 (5th Cir.2010). A court must provide some explanation if it imposes a revocation sentence outside the advisory guidelines range, but that burden is not an onerous one. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 261-62. Moreover, appellate review of supervised release revocation sentences is more deferential than is appellate review of original sentences. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">Taylor\u2019s 12-month sentence falls within the statutory maximum term of revocation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). He nevertheless contends that the district court\u2019s bare-bones reference to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors of deterrence and protection of the public, without specific application to the facts of his case, failed to explain adequately its decision to impose an above-guidelines sentence in light of the compelling reasons favoring a within-guidelines term. The revocation hearing transcript reflects that the district court heard argument from Taylor\u2019s counsel in favor of a sentence within the guidelines range. In addition, the district court had before it evidence of Taylor\u2019s possession and use of illegal drugs \u2014 in direct contravention of the supervised release conditions \u2014 which included his affirmative admission of guilt. The district court also implicitly considered the supervised release violation report\u2019s guidelines calculation of three to nine months. Given these facts, the court\u2019s decision to impose an above-guidelines sentence represents an implicit rejection of Taylor\u2019s pleas for leniency. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 524-26 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Although brief, the district court\u2019s stated reasons \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Accordingly, the sentencing court did not commit clear or obvious procedural error with respect to its explanation of Taylor\u2019s above-guidelines revocation sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
