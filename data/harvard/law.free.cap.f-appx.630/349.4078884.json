The district court attributed the upward variance to, <em>inter alia, </em>Rodriguez\u2019 serious and ongoing criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-22\">Rodriguez appealed from his sentence, maintaining the Government erred in failing to move for a third acceptance-of-responsibility point at sentencing, which would have resulted in a lower advisory sentencing range: 30 to 37 months, rather than 33 to, 41. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Gallegos, </em>581 Fed.Appx. 378, 379 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-23\">In considering Rodriguez\u2019 sentence, our court noted: \u201cThe district court\u2019s remarks convincingly demonstrate^] that [it] would have imposed an upward variance even if the sentencing reduction had been applied\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 380 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, because our court \u201cc[ould] not state with the requisite certainty that the sentence ultimately imposed was not influenced in any way by the erroneous Guidelines calculation\u201d, Rodriguez\u2019 sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-24\">On remand, Rodriguez\u2019 Pre-Sentence Investigation Report was amended, resulting in the above-described advisory sentencing range of 30 to 37 months. But, citing Rodriguez\u2019 serious criminal history, the court adopted the same reasons for an upward variance stated in the first sentencing hearing, and again sentenced him to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. Rodriguez challenges his sentence, contending it is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-25\">Non-Guidelines sentences are reviewed for reasonableness, in the light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In analyzing a substantive-reasonableness challenge, we \u201cconsider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines [sentencing] range\u201d. <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The record reflects the district court did not: fail to account for a factor that should have received significant weight; give weight to an improper or irrelevant factor; or clearly err in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>E.g., United States v. Chandler, </em>732 F.3d 434, 437 (5th Cir.2013). Moreover, we defer to district court\u2019s determination that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on balance, justify the extent of the upward variance imposed. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 437-38 (citing <em>United States v. Broussard, </em>669 F.3d 537, 551 (5th Cir.2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
