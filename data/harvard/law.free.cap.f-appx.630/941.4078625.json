After careful review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Machado was ordered removed from the United States for having remained for a time longer than permitted. During removal proceedings before an immigration judge (IJ), Machado applied for cancellation of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). The IJ found Machado ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had been convicted of an offense that the IJ determined was a crime involving moral turpitude: grand theft in the third degree, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.014(1)(a). <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">In an appeal to the BIA, Machado contended that he was eligible for cancellation of removal due to the \u201cpetty-offense exception,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> despite his conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude. On December 13, 2013, the BIA dismissed Machado\u2019s appeal. The BIA disagreed that the petty-offense exception applied but also found that Machado would be ineligible for cancellation of removal even if it did. Because Machado had not shown that he was eligible, the BIA did not address the other requirements for cancellation of removal, including good moral character and whether his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a United States citizen relative. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">On January 8, 2014, Machado filed a timely motion to reopen and reconsider the BIA\u2019s decision. He contended that the petty-offense exception applied and that his children would suffer hardship due to his removal. On February 6, 2014, the BIA denied the motion to reconsider because the same arguments had been addressed in the BIA\u2019s initial decision, and it found no basis to reopen proceedings because Machado had not submitted any new' evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">On October 1, 2014, Machado filed another motion to reopen and reconsider, largely raising the same arguments as before. The BIA denied the motion on January 12, 2015. As a motion to reconsider, the BIA found that it was untimely and barred by regulation. As a motion to reopen, the BIA found that it was untimely and failed to present new evidence. Finally, the BIA declined to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reconsider or reopen removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Machado now brings this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of motions to reopen and to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th Cir.2007). We liberally construe pleadings filed by <em>pro se </em>parties. <em>See Lorisme v. I.N.S., </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444 n. 3 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">A motion to reconsider a final order of removal must be filed within thirty days of the date of the order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6). Only one motion to reconsider may be filed, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(A), and a party may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). \u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). A motion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>simply rehashes arguments previously rejected by the BIA does not present grounds for reconsideration. <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">An alien may also file one motion to reopen, which must be filed within ninety days of the date of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C). A motion to reopen must be \u201csupported by affidavits or other evidentiary material, and it must state new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.\u201d <em>Verano-Velasco v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>456 F.3d 1372, 1376 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">The BIA also has authority to reopen or reconsider a case at any time on its own motion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). But because there is no \u201cmeaningful \u00a1standard against which to judge\u201d the BIA\u2019s exercise of this discretionary authority, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen or reconsider <em>sua sponte. Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1293-94 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied Machado\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Machado\u2019s October 2014 motion was untimely filed well over thirty days after the BIA\u2019s February 2014 decision, and he has presented no explanation for the delay. \u2018 <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B). To the extent Machado moved to reconsider the BIA\u2019s denial of his previous motion to reconsider, he was prohibited by regulation from doing so. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion when it denied Machado\u2019s second motion to reopen, because, like his motion to reconsider, it was untimely, as it was filed well beyond the ninety-day time limit. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C). Further, Machado failed to present new facts and new evidence that were not available and could not have been presented at his hearing. As the BIA noted, the psychological report he attached to his motion was available before his underlying merits hearing and had been submitted to the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Finally, to the extent that Machado\u2019s arguments could be construed as challenging the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen,or reconsider <em>sua sponte, </em>we do not have jurisdiction to review that determination. <em>See Lenis, </em>525 F.3d at 1293-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">In sum, we DENY Machado\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-6\">. An alien is eligible to apply for cancellation of removal despite a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude if the maximum penalty for the crime of conviction did not exceed one year\u2019s imprisonment and the actual sentence received did not exceed six months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b964-14\">. Machado petitioned this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s February 6 decision. We dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction because it was untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
