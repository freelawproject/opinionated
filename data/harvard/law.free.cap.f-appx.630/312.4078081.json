Because Evans has failed to plead sufficient facts to support his claim, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\"><em>Pro se </em>Plaintiff-Appellant Donovan Evans filed a civil rights action, which consisted of a number of difficult-to-decipher letters, against the Meridian Police Department and several \u201cnameless police\u201d officials on November 13, 2013. Asserting that he was found not guilty of simple assault and \u201cMalicious Misc.,\u201d Evans requested \u201c3000,99.9 Trillion to Plaintiff for A Not GUI Case.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Evans filed a number of letters with the district court, he never described a specific occurrence or set of circumstances that gave rise to the instant litigation. He apparently takes exception to being arrested for, but found not guilty of, simple assault and malicious mischief. After filing his initial complaint, Evans was taken into custody on an unrelated matter and filed several letters with the district court relating to his treatment while incarcerated at the Lauderdale County Detention Facility. In its answer to Evans\u2019s complaint, Defendant-Appellee City of Meridian (the \u201cCity\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requested that Evans\u2019s complaint be dismissed, arguing that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">The district court \u201cliberally construed the Complaint and all of Evans\u2019s submissions\u201d as a \u201cclaim ... for false arrest under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\u201d against the City, based on Evans\u2019s assertion that he was found not guilty of simple assault and malicious mischief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Citing <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), the district court found that \u201cEvans\u2019s filings contain no \u2018factual content that allow[edj the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant [was] liable for the misconduct alleged.\u2019 \u201d The court further determined that Evans\u2019s allegations concerning his treatment at the Lauderdale County Detention Facility had \u201cno bearing on his claims against the City of Meridian.\u201d Based on the dearth of factual allegations supporting Evans\u2019s claim, the district court granted the City\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and dismissed Evans\u2019s case without prejudice on October 28, 2014. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Evans timely appealed on November 12, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court may dismiss a complaint for \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). Dismissal is appropriate only if the complaint fails to plead \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether a complaint satisfies this standard, we accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and view those factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>True v. Robles, </em>571 F.3d 412, 417 (5th Cir.2009). A complaint \u201cdoes not need detailed factual allegations,\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, but \u201cit must allege enough facts to move the claim \u2018across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Turner v. Pleasant, </em>663 F.3d 770, 775 (5th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Moreover, \u201c[tjhreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">III. EVANS FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM FOR A \u00a7 1983 VIOLATION</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Although Evans\u2019s complaint contains no reference to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we, like the district court, liberally construe Evans\u2019s claim as one for false arrest under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services of City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), the Supreme Court explained that \u201ca local government may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents.\u201d It is only when the \u201cexecution of a government\u2019s policy or custom ... inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court has previously explained that \u201c[pjroof of municipal liability sufficient to satisfy <em>Monell </em>requires: (1) an official policy (or custom), of which (2) a policy maker can be charged with actual or constructive knowledge, and (3) a constitutional violation whose \u2018moving force\u2019 is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>policy (or custom).\u201d <em>Pineda v. City of Houston, </em>291 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2002). This court has further explained that when a plaintiff alleges false arrest as the constitutional violation supporting a \u00a7 1983 claim, \u201c[the plaintiff] must show that [the arresting officers] did not have probable cause to arrest him.\u201d <em>Haggerty v. Tex. S. Univ., </em>391 F.3d 653, 655 (5th Cir.2004); <em>see also Brown v. Lyford, </em>243 F.3d 185, 189 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe \u2018constitutional torts\u2019 of false arrest ... and false imprisonment ... require a showing of no probable cause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Based on the proof a plaintiff must provide to support a false arrest claim under <em>Monell, Pineda, </em>and <em>Haggerty, </em>we agree with the district court that Evans\u2019s filings contain no \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129. S.Ct. 1937. Evans never alleged that the City had any kind of \u201cofficial policy (or custom)\u201d of arresting people without probable cause. <em>Pineda, </em>291 F.3d at 328. Nor did he allege that any \u201cpolicy maker\u201d had \u201cactual or constructive knowledge\u201d of a policy of this type. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, he never alleged that he suffered the constitutional tort of false arrest as a result of any municipal custom or policy. <em>Id. </em>Even if Evans had alleged some facts that would support the inference that he was arrested as a result of a municipal policy, his filings contain nothing that suggests that the officers who arrested him did not have probable cause to do so. <em>See Haggerty, </em>391 F.3d at 655. While Evans may have been found not guilty of the crimes for which he was arrested, this does not establish that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">\u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements\u201d are not sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. Given that Evans\u2019s filings lack even a \u201c[t]hreadbare recital[ ] of the elements,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, of his claim, these filings have certainly failed to \u201callege enough facts to move [his] claim \u2018across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Turner, </em>663 F.3d at 775 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Therefore, the district court properly dismissed this case for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-12\">.

Although Evans filed a complaint against the Meridian Police Department and several nameless police officials, the defendant is properly identified as the City of Meridian, as a city\u2019s police department is not a separate entity under Mississippi law. <em>See, e,g., Stewart v. Jackson Cnty., </em>No. 1:07cv1270, 2008 WL 4287112, at *1 (S.D.Miss. Sept. 16, 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b335-18\">.Evans references \"civil rights\u201d and \"42 U.S.C. 1983\u201d in a letter filed on June 17, 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\">.

On appeal, Evans refers to false arrest and false imprisonment claims. His false imprisonment claim is waived since he failed to raise it in the district court. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). However, assuming that this claim is not waived, our analysis of his false arrest claim applies with equal force to his false imprisonment claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\">. We agree with the district court that Evans\u2019s allegations regarding his treatment at Lauderdale County Detention Facility have no bearing on his claim against the City, and we do not address those allegations here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
