After a hearing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that commitment was appropriate, and Keys appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Having reviewed the record, we find no clear error. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>299 F.3d 673, 676 (8th Cir.2002) (factual determinations underlying \u00a7 4246 decision are clearly erroneous when reviewing court is left with definite and firm conviction that mistake was made). The mental health professionals who evaluated Keys diagnosed schizophrenia and antisocial personality disorder, and opined that, because records revealed a link between Keys\u2019s violent behavior and mental illness, his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious property damage. Keys refused to be evaluated by an independent psychologist, who could not render an opinion. Given Keys\u2019s diagnosis and evidence demonstrating his lack of insight concerning his mental condition and a history of noncompliance with treatment and related deterioration of symptoms and behaviors, we reject Keys\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 676-77; <em>United States v. Ecker, </em>30 F.3d 966, 970 (8th Cir.1994). We also reject his pro se arguments on appeal related to the timing of the hearing, the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, the conditions at the treatment facility, his counsel\u2019s performance, and his completion of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The judgment is affirmed. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-5\">. The Honorable M. Douglas Harpool, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable David P. Rush, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
