After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">In his underlying criminal case, a jury convicted Dames of three counts of distributing cocaine within 1,000 feet of a public playground in September 2011 and one count of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a public playground in November 2011, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 860(a). The first three counts represented separate drug transactions involving Dames and a confidential informant in September 2011 at his residence near a park in Opa-Locka, Florida. The fourth count represented the drugs found in Dames\u2019s residence in November 2011, when he was arrested just before a planned fourth drug transaction. Although the jury convicted Dames on all four counts, it found in favor of Dames as to a fifth forfeiture count involving his residence. Dames was later sentenced to a mandatory-minimum ten years\u2019 imprisonment. This Court affirmed Dames\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Dames, </em>556 Fed.Appx. 793 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, Dames v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 198, 190 L.Ed.2d 153 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-17\">In April 2013, Dames filed the instant <em>pro </em>se<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> civil rights complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> naming three defendants: (1) Sergio Lopez, a police detective in Hollywood, Florida; (2) the City of Hollywood, Florida; and (3) the City of Plantation, Florida.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his complaint, Dames raised claims related to his underlying criminal case, including allegations about falsified court documents, false statements, auto theft, false imprisonment, and a \u201cpossible hate crime.\u201d Dames alleged that he had mailed packages to the \u201cjudge[sj and involved people in case\u201d that showed \u201call burden of proof.\u201d As relief, Dames requested that his criminal convictions be overturned, that criminal charges be brought against the individuals involved in his entrapment and car theft, monetary damages, and any other appropriate mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-18\">Without requiring a response from the defendants, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R\u201d), recommending that Dames\u2019s complaint be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The R &amp; R determined that Dames had stated his claims \u201cin a completely conclusory fashion\u201d and appeared to be attacking his federal criminal convictions \u201cin which it appears his car was forfeited.\u201d Accordingly, the R &amp; R recommended the complaint be dismissed because Dames failed to state a claim and because his claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and were more appropriately raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. The R <em>&amp; </em>R noted that any \u201c[c]laims related to the alleged unlawful forfeiture of his car or any other property must be raised in a forfeiture action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Overruling Dames\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R and dismissed his complaint without prejudice on August 22, 2013. On September 3, 2013, Dames\u2019s notice of appeal was filed in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Six days after Dames filed his notice of appeal, he filed a post-judgment pleading in the district court titled \u201cMotion to be Loaned or Furnished the Record on Appeal.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Filed with this motion was, among other things, a copy of a second civil rights complaint dated August 31, 2013, in which Dames named the same three above defendants plus a fourth, new defendant, Detective Tom Bradford. In the portion of the form complaint asking about previous lawsuits, Dames listed the instant action, Civil Action No. 0:13-cv-60865, which he said involved the same facts. With respect to the disposition of the instant action, Dames stated that the case was \u201cclosed and pending appeal.\u201d In his motion for a copy of the record, Dames did not mention, nor ask for relief as to, this second complaint filed with the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">The district court granted Dames\u2019s motion for a copy of the record on appeal, and did not mention Dames\u2019s second complaint filed with that motion. The district court also granted Dames leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>determining that his appeal was not frivolous. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">A. Original Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">In this case, we find no merit to Dames\u2019s argument that <em>Heck </em>does not apply to his claims attacking his federal criminal convictions and seeking his release from federal prison. In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-15\">[I]n order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-16\">512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. If such a \u00a7 1983 action is brought before the challenged conviction or sentence is invali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>dated, it must be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. Thus, \u201cthe district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Here, Dames\u2019s claims in- his original complaint \u2014 which essentially allege that the defendants falsified documents and evidence in his prosecution \u2014 necessarily implicate the validity of his underlying federal convictions for distributing cocaine. Absent the invalidation of his convictions, which had not occurred, Dames\u2019s claims were barred. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, we agree with the district court that the allegations in Dames\u2019s original complaint were completely conclusory. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dames\u2019s original complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">B. Second Complaint Filed Post-Judgement</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">In his appellate brief, Dames for the first time on appeal essentially asks this Court to treat the second complaint, filed post-judgment, as an amended complaint in the instant action. Dames refers to his \u201camended allegations\u201d and argues that \u201chis original complaint must be read in conjunction with, what is the functional equivalent of, his amended complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">In this second complaint, Dames alleged that: (1) in September 2011 Detectives Lopez and Bradford conducted a search and seizure at his home without a warrant \u201cto create a crime\u201d to arrest him; (2) Lopez and Bradford physically beat a confidential informant over a period of days in order to coerce the informant to entrap Dames into selling drugs; (3) law enforcement officials provided false information about the \u201cVIN # \u201d of Dames\u2019s car to the state court; (4) state officials used a \u201cfalse court motion to claim [his] Mercedes Benz from [the] FBI after [his]-arrest on November 2, 2011 after trial in 2012\u201d; and (5) the \u201cspecial verdict jury instructed that all [Dames\u2019s] property be returned and Sergio Lopez #2649 refuse[d] to do so as the Federal Jury requested.\u201d As relief, Dames sought compensation for the loss of \u201cproperty, time, and employment and back pay owed on mortgage,\u201d and his \u201c[r]elease [from] false imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">In this case, the district court never addressed Dames\u2019s \u201camended\u201d complaint, which Dames filed after he filed his notice of appeal. Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction \u201cover the aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Diveroli, 729 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, to the extent Dames intended for his motion for a copy of the record on appeal, with which he filed the second complaint, to amend his original complaint, the district court had no jurisdiction to consider those amended allegations. And, because Dames\u2019s claims in the \u201camended\u201d complaint were not before the district court, we ordinarily would not review those claims on the merits. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>S.W. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that this Court will not consider issues on appeal that were not fairly presented below).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Nonetheless, we do recognize that Dames now has counsel on appeal and that Dames\u2019s brief on appeal argues, for the first time, that his claims in the second complaint concerning the illegal seizure of his car under the Fourth Amendment are not Heck-barred because his car was not forfeited as part of his federal criminal case, but as part of a state forfeiture case. <em>See Hughes, </em>350 F.3d at 1160-61 (discussing whether certain claims are <em>Heck-barred). </em>Contrary to Dames\u2019s assertions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>the claims in the second complaint essentially complain about falsified documents, evidence, or acts in the federal prosecution against him and are Necfc-barred. As to his claims about his car, Dames\u2019s federal indictment and the jury\u2019s \u201cSpecial Verdict Form\u201d show that the federal government sought to forfeit Dames\u2019s residence and the jury returned a special verdict as to the residence located at 17910 NW 81st Avenue, Opa Locka, Florida.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His car, however, was not part of that forfeiture or the federal jury\u2019s verdict in his favor. In any event, Dames\u2019s second complaint is too conclusory to state a cognizable cause of action with respect to any forfeiture outside his federal criminal case. Moreover, his second complaint makes no allegations at all against the new defendant, Detective Bradford, or the two defendant municipalities. And, his allegations about Detective Lopez are conclusory and no better than his original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-11\">. Although Dames proceeded <em>pro se </em>in the district court, this Court appointed Dames counsel for his appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b974-12\">.

Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), the district court correctly concluded that Dames's action against state actors was properly brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b974-20\">.The magistrate judge also identified Matthew Rasnake, an employee of the \"Forfeiture and Seized Property Unit,\u201d as a defendant, but Dames's complaint merely listed Rasnake as a defendant in a previous lawsuit, not as a defendant in the instant action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b975-7\">.
