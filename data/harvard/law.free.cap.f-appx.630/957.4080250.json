On appeal, Wingfield argues that the district court violated his due process rights by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on whether Wingfield was originally sentenced as a career offender and is therefore ineligible for a sentence reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion or violate Wingfield\u2019s due process rights by declining to-hold an evidentiary hearing. Wingfield was given (1) adequate notice of the government\u2019s and the probation office\u2019s position on his motion and (2) an opportunity to respond. <em>See United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201c[E]ach party must be given notice of and an opportunity to contest new information relied on by the district court in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.... [Although a hearing is a permissible vehicle for contesting any new information, the district court may instead allow the parties to contest new information in writing.\u201d). Furthermore, an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary because both the district court and this Court previously held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Wingfield\u2019s sentence was based on the career offender provisions of \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Wingfield, </em>468 Fed.Appx. 937, 938 (11th Cir.2012) (unpublished) (\u2018Wingfield\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our precedent. A defendant sentenced as a career offender, whose guideline range was not based on the offense level for crack cocaine, is ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d). Because Wingfield presented no argument suggesting that an exception to law-of-the-case doctrine applies, Wingfield\u2019s claim is barred. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>429 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe law-of-the-case doctrine bars relitigation of issues that were decided, either explicitly or by necessary implication, in an earlier appeal of the same case.\u201d); <em>United States v. White, </em>846 F.2d 678, 685 (11th Cir.1988) (listing exceptions to law-of-the-case doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-10\">. Wingfield does not directly argue the merits of the district court\u2019s decision but rather challenges propriety of the district court\u2019s reaching its decision without first holding an evi-dentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b980-18\">. We review for abuse of discretion the district court's decision not to hold an evidentia-ry hearing. <em>See United States v. Yesil, </em>991 F.2d 1527, 1531 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
