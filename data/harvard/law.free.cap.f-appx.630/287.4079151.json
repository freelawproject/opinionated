In contending the combined 58-month sentence was greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), Moreno maintains the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because the sentencing ranges: lacked an empirical basis; double-counted his criminal history; overstated the seriousness of his illegal reentry (which he asserts was, fundamentally, only a non-violent, international trespass); and failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection, as in this instance, to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to' impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. CisnerosGutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). As noted, Moreno contests only the substantive reasonableness of his sentences; he does not claim procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">As for Moreno\u2019s 46-month sentence imposed for his illegal reentry, it was within the advisory-Guideline range (at the low end after a 12-level enhancement for a prior crime-of-violence conviction). Therefore, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">First, the presumption of reasonableness is not overcome simply because the advisory Guideline is not empirically based; Moreno concedes this issue is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Sentencing is traditionally left \u201cto the discretion of district courts, [which are] close to the ground and more cognizant of the details of offender and offense\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 530-31. Additionally, Moreno\u2019s contentions that double-counting prior convictions necessarily l-enders a sentence unreasonable, and that the Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry, are also foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 529-30; <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). (He presents these three foreclosed issues only to preserve them for possible future review.) And, the benign motive Moreno provided for returning to the United States, to visit his terminally ill mother, is insufficient to rebut the presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). The court considered, but rejected, Moreno\u2019s attempt to minimize the seriousness of his illegal reentry. Finally, Moreno does not demonstrate the court failed to consider any significant factors, gave undue weight to any improper factors, or clearly erred in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Moreno also fails to show that his 24-month revocation sentence, of which 12 months are to be served concurrently with his illegal-reentry sentence, was substantively unreasonable. (Because there is no substantive unreasonableness, we need not reach whether Moreno\u2019s revocation was \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). Nor does Moreno make that claim.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Moreover, the court acted within its discretion in ordering the sentences to be served, in part, consecutively. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 260 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) &amp; cmt. n. 4. In addition, Moreno\u2019s sentence fell within the advisory-sentencing range, and was consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy on consecutive sentences; therefore, it also is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006). Moreno \u201cmakes no independent argument\u201d concerning his revocation sentence. <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808-09 (5th Cir.2008). For the above-discussed reasons, he fails to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the court abused its discretion by imposing the in-part consecutive sentence, and to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
