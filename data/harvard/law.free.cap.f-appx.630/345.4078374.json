He contends that the district court committed numerous calculation errors under the Sentencing Guidelines and that his sentence is unreasonably long in light of the facts of the case. The Government moves to dismiss the appeal based on the appellate waiver contained in Blackston\u2019s plea agreement or, in the alternative, for summary affirmance. Blackston opposes the Government\u2019s motion, arguing that the waiver should not be enforced. We agree with the Government and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Our review of the relevant portion of the record \u2014 which includes the written plea agreement, the plea agreement supplement, and the transcripts of the plea hearing and sentencing \u2014 demonstrates Black-ston\u2019s clear understanding that he had the right to appeal and that he was giving up that right by pleading guilty. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 n. 2 (5th Cir.2005). At no time did Blackston betray any hesitation or equivocation regarding his understanding of, or accession to, the terms of the appeal waiver. We are thus satisfied that Blackston\u2019s waiver of his appeal rights was \u201ca voluntary, knowing, and intelligent act.\u201d <em>United States v. Guerra, </em>94 F.3d 989, 995 (5th Cir.1996). Moreover, the plain language of the waiver provision \u2014 the breadth of which Blackston does not challenge \u2014 provides that, by pleading guilty, he expressly waived the right to appeal his sentence \u201con any grounds whatsoever,\u201d with the sole exception of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which he does not raise. The waiver thus applies to the circumstances in this case. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Reviewing the record de novo, we hold that the appeal waiver contained in Blackston\u2019s plea agreement is enforceable as to the instant appeal. <em>See United States v. Keele, </em>755 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1174, 191 L.Ed.2d 132 (2015); <em>Bond, </em>414 F.3d at 544. Blackston\u2019s arguments to the contrary are without merit. <em>See United States v. Pino Gonzalez, </em>636 F.3d 157, 160 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Cobos, </em>255 Fed.Appx. 835, 837 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir.1992). Because the Government seeks enforcement of the waiver, we GRANT the motion to dismiss the appeal. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, </em>741 F.3d 648, 651 (5th Cir.2014). We DENY the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
