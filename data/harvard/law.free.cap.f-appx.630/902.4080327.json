After Mr. Bailey pled guilty to one count of bank theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>court ordered Mr. Bailey to forfeit $66,-613.63 \u2014 an amount equal to what Mr. Bailey embezzled from his employer, First Partners Bank \u2014 to the United States pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(C) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461(c). Prior to being indicted, Mr. Bailey had voluntarily paid $65,500 to First Partners Bank. As part of his judgment, Mr. Bailey was also ordered to pay the remaining $1,113.63 to the Bank in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">On appeal, Mr. Bailey argues ordering him to pay forfeiture, after he voluntarily paid restitution, is against public policy. Mr. Bailey further argues the substitute property forfeiture provision is inapplicable in this case because the proceeds of his crime are now with the victim, First Partners Bank, and to \u201cthe extent that the Government claims that it has some entitlement ..to that money, the Government knows exactly where to find it.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding forfeiture. <em>See United States v. Puche, </em>350 F.3d 1137, 1153 (11th Cir.2003). For the reasons which follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s forfeiture order.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">According to the applicable civil forfeiture statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(C), \u201c[a]ny property, real or personal, which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to a violation\u201d of a qualifying offense is subject to forfeiture to the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(C) (alteration added). Among the qualifying offenses for which the- statute authorizes forfeiture is a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, involving bank theft. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 981(a)(1)(C) <em>&amp; </em>1956(c)(7)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">As we have explained, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461(c) \u201cmake[s] criminal forfeiture available in every case that the criminal forfeiture statute does not reach but for which civil forfeiture is legally authorized.\u201d <em>United States v. Padron, </em>527 F.3d 1156, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2008) (alteration added; citation omitted). \u201cIf the defendant is convicted of the offense giving rise to- the forfeiture, the court shall order the forfeiture of the property as part of the sentence in the criminal case.28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461(c) (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">Under \u00a7 2461(c), the procedures for criminal forfeitures are governed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853. In turn, \u00a7 853(p) allows the forfeiture of \u201csubstitute property\u201d in certain situations, including when the defendant\u2019s actions have caused the property subject to forfeiture to be \u201ctransferred or sold to, or deposited with, a third party,\u201d \u201csubstantially diminished in value,\u201d or \u201ccommingled with other property which cannot be divided without difficulty.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(p)(l). In such a case, \u201cthe court shall order the forfeiture of any other property of the defendant, up to the value\u201d of the original property subject to forfeiture. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 853(p)(2). Once funds have been ordered forfeited, the Attorney General is authorized, in her discretion, to retain the forfeited property rather than transfer it as restoration to the victim of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(e)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">Turning first to Mr. Bailey\u2019s public policy argument against paying both forfeiture and restitution, we have refused to offset the required forfeiture by restitution already paid to victims, recognizing that forfeiture and restitution are separate concepts serving different goals. <em>See United States v. Hoffman-Vaile, </em>568 F.3d 1335, 1344 (11th Cir.2009) (rejecting argument that appellant\u2019s forfeiture amount should be reduced because she had already paid restitution to the other victims,- noting, \u201c[although \u2018this might appear to be a \u2018double dip,\u2019 restitution and forfeiture serve different goals.\u2019\u201d) (brackets added and omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Leahy, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>464 F.3d 773, 793 n. 8 (7th Cir.2006)); <em>United States v. Joseph, </em>743 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201cWe have held that a defendant is not entitled to offset the amount of restitution owed to a victim by the value of property forfeited to the government, <em>or vice versa, </em>because restitution and forfeiture serve distinct purposes.\u201d) (emphasis added; citations omitted). \u201cWhile restitution seeks to make victims whole by reimbursing them for their losses, forfeiture is meant to punish the defendant by transferring his ill-gotten gains to the United States Department of Justice ____\u201d <em>Joseph, </em>743 F.3d at 1354 (alteration added; citations omitted). Consistent with this principle, we have held that preindictment, voluntary restitution does not affect the amount of any forfeiture. <em>See United States v. Browne, </em>505 F.3d 1229, 1280-81 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Having concluded that our precedent mandates the order of forfeiture here, and that the amount of forfeiture is not to be offset by Mr. Bailey\u2019s voluntary restitution, we turn to Mr. Bailey\u2019s argument against the applicability of the substitute property forfeiture provision. Mr. Bailey claims that the government knows the disposition of the stolen property, and that he is not alleged to have comingled the money, hidden the money, or used the money to buy real or personal property that needs to be liquidated. This representation appears to be in direct contrast to the government\u2019s contention it is unable to trace the location of the stolen funds because once Mr. Bailey transferred the funds out of the bank, into his personal accounts, and to a credit card company to pay off his debts, the funds were transferred to a third-party and commingled with other property. Indeed, Mr. Bailey\u2019s plea agreement reflects his admission to using approximately $60,000.00 of the embezzled funds toward paying his personal credit card accounts. The government therefore maintains the substitute property forfeiture provisions, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(p)(l)(B) and (E), are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">The final order of forfeiture permits the government to move, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(e), to amend the order to apply to substitute property-to satisfy the forfeiture money judgment in whole or in part. As of yet, however, the government has not taken any action to enforce the forfeiture judgment and the district court has not ruled on the question of whether the property has been transferred to a third party, or become so commingled that it may not be forfeited directly such that substitute property must be forfeited instead. Thus, the issue is not ripe at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">In sum, the district court did not err in ordering forfeiture in the amount of $66,613.63. Accordingly, we affirm the forfeiture order.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
