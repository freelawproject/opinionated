Ryals, Texas prisoner # 1940539, challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. Ryals raises the following arguments on appeal: that the district court erred by dismissing his due. process and equal protection claims; that Texas law regarding sex offender registration is preempted by federal law; that his obligation to register as a sex offender expired in March 2013; and that the district court erred in handling his discovery requests and motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">We review the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) de novo. <em>Lampton v. Diaz, </em>639 F.3d 223, 225 (5th Cir.2011). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as time, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This court also reviews a district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissal de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>See Stauffer v. Gearhart, </em>741 F.3d 574, 581 (5th Cir.2014); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). A district court may grant summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 if the record demonstrates \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P, 56(a); <em>Stauffer, </em>741 F.3d at 581. \u201cA genuine issue of material fact exists if the record, taken as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>a whole, could lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Harris v. Serpas, </em>745 F.3d 767, 771 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct 137, 190 L.Ed.2d 45 (2014). In reviewing both a motion to dismiss. under Rule 12(b)(6) and a motion for summary judgment, we will construe the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Kitchen v. Dallas Cty., Tex., </em>759 F.3d 468, 476 (5th Cir.2014); <em>Leal v. McHugh, </em>731 F.3d 405, 413 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">To the extent that Ryals challenges the district court\u2019s summary judgment' dismissal of his due process claim, he fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s reasoning, nor does he meaningfully challenge the district court\u2019s reasoning. Issues not addressed in a brief are abandoned. <em>Raj v. Louisiana State University, </em>714 F.3d 322, 327 (5th Cir.2013). Similarly, mere recitations of law and \u201cabrupt assertions\u201d of wrongdoing do not present issues for appeal. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Thus, he has waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissal of his due process claim. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>964 F.2d 365, 371 (5th Cir.1992). Similarly, to the extent he challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his equal protection claim for failure to state a claim, he fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis. Ryals\u2019s challenge consists entirely of unsupported legal conclusions and citations to various sources without any explanation of the sources cited. Thus, he has also abandoned any challenge to the dismissal of his equal protection claim. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748; <em>Green, </em>964 F.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Next, Ryals\u2019s argument that federal law preempts Texas\u2019s Sex, Offender Registration Program (TSORP) is also unavailing. The district court determined that no such preemption applied. In his brief, Ryals cites to no authority that supports his argument. To the extent that Ryals briefs the issue at all, he fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis or show that he is entitled to relief on the issue, and he has thus abandoned the issue. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Ryals also challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his sex offender registration obligation ended in October 2013, and he maintains that his obligation actually expired in March 2013. Ryals\u2019s argument, however, is not supported by the record. Under the Texas Sex Offender Registration Program, for individuals not required to register for the duration of their lives, the obligation to register \u201cends on the 10th anniversary of the date on which the person is released from a penal institution <em>or </em>discharges community supervision ... whichever date is later.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.101(b) (emphasis added). Whether or not Ryals was released from prison in March 2003, as he claims, the evidence is uncontroverted that Ryals discharged his community supervision in October 2003 upon reaching majority age. Ryals has shown no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Finally, Ryals challenges the district court\u2019s rulings on several' discovery matters, as well as the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for appointed counsel. Having reviewed the challenged rulings and Ryals\u2019s arguments thereon, we conclude that Ryals has failed to identify how the district court\u2019s discovery rulings were \u201carbitrary or clearly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </em>392 F.3d 812, 817 (5th Cir.2004). Likewise, with respect to Ryals\u2019s motion for appointed counsel, because Ryals failed to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>exceptional circumstances, the district court\u2019s denial of the motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 126 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
