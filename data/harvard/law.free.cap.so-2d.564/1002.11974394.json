Appeal of that conviction was made to this Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>James v. State, </em>494 So.2d 808 (Ala.Cr.App.1986). In October 1987, the appellant filed the Rule 20 petition <em>sub judice, </em>alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and alleging numerous errors by counsel in support of his claim. The appellant\u2019s petition was denied after an evidentiary hearing, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-30\">Although the appellant has argued several alleged errors by trial counsel, because one if these grounds requires remand of this case, the remaining grounds will not be addressed at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>While he does not expressly state that he was not represented by counsel at the time of prior convictions, the appellant argues that the documents offered by the State to prove prior convictions for purposes of sentence enhancement do not show that he was represented by counsel or that the right to counsel was waived. The State concedes in its brief that the documents pertaining to the appellant\u2019s two prior convictions in Florida do not affirmatively show representation of counsel or waiver of such representation, and the State requests remand of this cause for such a determination to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">It is therefore ordered that this case be remanded to the trial court with instructions that a hearing be held on this issue. At this time, the State shall be afforded the opportunity to offer further proof that the appellant was represented by counsel at the time of these convictions, or that this right was waived. In the event that the State is unable to affirmatively show representation, the trial court is also instructed to resentence the appellant in a manner compatible with the provisions of the Habitual Felony Offender Act, \u00a7 13A-5-9(b), <em>Code of Alabama </em>(1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1114-6\">All Judges concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">ON RETURN TO REMAND</p>\n<author id=\"b1114-8\">McMILLAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">We remanded this case to the trial for a hearing to be held on this issue, finding the reeord unclear as to whether the appellant was represented by counsel or whether counsel had been waived in two prior Florida convictions that were used to enhance his sentence. On return to remand, the trial court held that the two Florida conviction had been improperly used to enhance the appellant\u2019s sentence and resentenced the appellant, without sentence enhancement, to life imprisonment. As this is within the range of punishment for a Class A felony prescribed by \u00a7 13A-5-6(a)(l), <em>Code of Alabama </em>(1975), this Court will now address the remaining issues raised in appellant\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">The appellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective. In <em>Hope v. State, </em>521 So.2d 1383 (Ala.Cr.App.1988), Judge Bowen, writing for this Court, reiterated the burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-11\">\u201cIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel a defendant must prove, first,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-12\">\u201c \u2018that counsel\u2019s performance was so deficient as to fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. Counsel\u2019s conduct must be considered within the context of the facts of the particular case and as of the time of the alleged misconduct. Second, petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived petitioner of a fair trial. Prejudice is shown when, absent the errors, there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u2019 <em>Ex parte Baldwin, </em>456 So.2d 129, 134 (Ala.1984), affirmed, 472 U.S. 372, 105 S.Ct. 2727, 86 L.Ed.2d 300 (1985), applying the test of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-13\">\u201cA defendant must prove that counsel\u2019s incompetence resulted in prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-14\">\u201c \u2018In order to establish ineffective representation, the defendant must prove both incompetence and prejudice. <em>[Strickland v. Washington</em>] 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct., at 2065. There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance falls within the \u201cwide range of professional assistance,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct., at 2065; the defendant bears the burden of proving that counsel\u2019s representation was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms and that the challenged action was not sound strategy. <em>Id., </em>at 688-689, 104 S.Ct., at 2065-2066. The reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance is to be evaluated from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time of the alleged error and in light of all the circumstances and the standard of review is highly deferential. <em>Id., </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct., at 2065. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>The defendant shows that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s ineffectiveness by demonstrating that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. See also, <em>id., </em>at 695, 104 S.Ct., at 2069 (Where a defendant challenges his conviction, he must show that there exists \u201ca reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt\u201d). And, in determining the existence <em>vel non </em>of prejudice, the court \u201cmust consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.\u201d <em>Ibid.\u2019 Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 2586-87, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-4\">\u201cA defendant must show that counsel\u2019s unprofessional error resulted in injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AczL\">\u201c \u2018Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that defendant\u2019s counsel erred and that this error was professionally unreasonable, that would not in and of itself warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error did not affect the judgment. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at 691 [104 S.Ct. at 2066], The defendant must affirmatively prove prejudice; that is, he \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability, that but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at 694 [104 S.Ct. at 2068]. \u201c[A] court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at 689 [104 S.Ct. at 2065], Strategic choices made after a thorough investigation of relevant law and facts are virtually unchallengeable and those strategic decisions made after less than complete investigation are \u201creasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at 691 [104 S.Ct. at 2066].\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\"><em>Id., </em>at 1384-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">The appellant, a black male, assigns error to counsel\u2019s failure to object to the State\u2019s alleged use of its peremptory challenges to remove blacks from the venire. In so arguing, appellant appears to contend that counsel\u2019s performance should be judged based on his conduct pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">The adequacy of counsel\u2019s performance must be determined by the law in effect at the time of the appellant\u2019s trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Jordan v. State, </em>548 So.2d 1059, 1061-62 (Ala.Cr.App.1989). At the time of the appellant\u2019s trial, the State\u2019s use of its peremptory challenges to strike black veniremen was governed by the rule of law established in <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965). Under <em>Swain, </em>a defendant alleging that the prosecution exercised its peremptory challenges to discriminate unlawfully against a particular group had to demonstrate that the State had systematically excluded members of that group from juries over a period of time. <em>Id., </em>380 U.S. at 221-22, 85 S.Ct. at 836-37. See also, <em>Project: Criminal Procedure, </em>76 Geo.L.J. 921, 969 n. 2203 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">At the appellant\u2019s evidentiary hearing, the Houston County circuit clerk testified that the appellant\u2019s jury venire included two blacks. She testified that the State used its first two strikes to remove these blacks from the venire without objection by the appellant\u2019s trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">Although this testimony may have established a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination by the State in its use of its peremptory challenges under <em>Batson, </em>supra, 476 U.S. at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1722, it falls far short of proving a violation of <em>Swain, </em>supra. Thus, even if counsel\u2019s fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>ure to object to the State\u2019s use of its peremptory challenges constitutes \u201cprofessional error,\u201d the appellant has still failed to satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel established by <em>Strickland, </em>supra, 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Moreover, the failure to raise a <em>Batson </em>claim in a <em>pre-Batson </em>case did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Morrison v. State, </em>551 So.2d 435 (Ala.Cr.App.1989); <em>Poole v. United States, </em>832 F.2d 561 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">The appellant further argues that trial counsel, who also represented him on appeal, erred by failing to raise a <em>Batson </em>claim by way of a supplemental brief while his certiorari petition was pending before the Alabama Supreme Court. The <em>Batson </em>decision was released during that period. In support of his argument, appellant relies on <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987), and <em>Ex parte Jackson, </em>516 So.2d 768 (Ala.1986), which held that <em>Batson </em>should be applied retroactively to cases pending on direct review or whose judgments were not yet final when <em>Batson </em>was announced. In deciding this issue adversely to the appellant, however, it is not necessary for this Court to reach the merits of his claim. A criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to counsel to pursue discretionary state appeals. <em>Ross v. Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974). Because the appellant had no constitutional right to counsel to pursue his petition for writ of certiorari, he could not be deprived of the effective assistance of counsel due to his attorney\u2019s failure to file a supplemental brief that raised a <em>Batson </em>claim. See generally, <em>Wainwright v. Torna, </em>455 U.S. 586, 102 S.Ct. 1300, 1301, 71 L.Ed.2d 475 (1982); <em>Bies v. State, </em>418 So.2d 940, 942 (Ala.Cr.App.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">The appellant contends that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of unauthenticated convictions from the State of Kentucky for use in sentence enhancement, as well as by counsel\u2019s failure to object to the State\u2019s alleged failure to give him notice as to which of his prior convictions would be used to enhance his sentence. As previously stated, however, the record on return to remand indicates that the appellant was not resen-tenced under the Habitual Felony Offender Act. Rather, he was sentenced, without enhancement, for a Class A felony. We, therefore, do not need to address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">The appellant next argues that trial counsel failed to investigate whether the search of his apartment was valid, but instead relied upon erroneous information provided by witnesses for the prosecution. Specifically, appellant contends that the apartment lease, which was admitted into evidence at the hearing on his Rule 20, A.R.Cr.P. Temp, petition, was in his name, and that Amy Lamb did not have authority to consent to a search of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">\u201cIt is well settled that warrantless searches of a home are valid where a co-occupant consents to the search.\u201d <em>Dixon v. State, </em>476 So.2d 1236, 1239 (Ala.Cr.App.1985) (citations omitted). \u201cThe consent of one who possesses common authority over premises or effects is valid as against the absent, non-consenting person with whom that authority is shared. <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974).\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>527 So.2d 764, 769 (Ala.Cr.App.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">Regardless of whether the lease of the apartment where the search occurred was in Amy Lamb\u2019s name, it is clear from the record that Ms. Lamb was a co-occupant of the premises. Ms. Lamb\u2019s trial testimony indicated that she lived in the apartment and that she paid its rent with money she received from the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>counsel\u2019s knowledge of the correct leaseholder of the apartment would have had no bearing on the outcome, since Lamb\u2019s status as a co-occupant authorized her to consent to the search. <em>Matlock, </em>supra; <em>Williams, </em>supra; <em>Dixon, </em>supra. Thus, the appellant again fails to satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d requirement of <em>Strickland, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-11\">The appellant contends that his arrest warrant was invalid because it was executed in Pike County, but was not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>dorsed by a magistrate or judge of that county, as required by \u00a7 15-10-10, <em>Code of Alabama </em>(1975), and because he was never brought before a judge or magistrate in Houston County, where the warrant issued, as required by \u00a7 15-10-12, <em>Code of Alabama </em>(1975). He argues that, had counsel investigated the circumstances of his arrest, he \u201cwould have been released.\u201d Appellant therefore contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"ASku\">Even if counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the validity of appellant\u2019s arrest warrant rises to the level of professional error as contemplated by <em>Strickland, </em>supra, the appellant once again fails to show how counsel\u2019s error deprived him of a fair trial. <em>Id., </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. He does not allege, and neither does the record suggest, for example, that incriminating evidence was obtained as a result of his arrest. At worst, the appellant suffered the loss of whatever temporary freedom he might have enjoyed until a second arrest warrant could be issued. Cf. <em>Holloway v. State, </em>38 Ala.App. 501, 88 So.2d 700 (1956). Further, because the appellant\u2019s arrest warrant is not included in the record, there is nothing for this Court to review to determine its validity. <em>Sandifer v. State, </em>535 So.2d 203, 205 (Ala.Cr.App.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The appellant complains that counsel failed to object to comments by the prosecutor, such as \u201cLook at the defendant sitting there smiling after committing the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">\u201cThe conduct of the accused or the accused\u2019s demeanor during the trial is a proper subject of comment.\u201d <em>Wherry v. State, </em>402 So.2d 1130, 1133 (Ala.Cr.App.1981). See also, <em>Haywood v. State, </em>501 So.2d 515, 520 (Ala.Cr.App.1986). \u201cStatements made by a prosecutor are not evidence, <em>Henry v. State, </em>468 So.2d 896 (Ala.Cr.App.1984), cert. denied, <em>Ex parte Henry, </em>468 So.2d 902 (Ala.1985), and must be evaluated at their true worth rather than as factors in the formation of a verdict. <em>Orr v. State, </em>462 So.2d 1013 (Ala.Cr.App.1984).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">The comments of the prosecutor in this case do not create grounds for reversible error, and counsel did not err in failing to object. Neither does this Court agree with the argument advanced by the appellant that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks constituted an impermissible reference to his failure to testify. Appellant\u2019s argument as to this issue must therefore fail. Although the appellant raises additional claims for this Court\u2019s review, they find little support in the record of this case and do not merit further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">The evidence in the present case fails to support appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court is correct and is due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">OPINION EXTENDED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">All the Judges concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
