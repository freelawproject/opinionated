W.

That court, so far as the charges against the judge of the Superior Court were concerned, evidently proceeded upon the- opinion that the obligation of attorneys and counsellors imposed upon them from their office was, among other things, to observe at all times, both in their manner and language, the respect due to courts of justice and judicial officers; and. that insulting and defamatory language, prompted by malice, respecting their conduct in court, was a breach of that obligation, for which they could properly be disbarred. It declared that the attorney\u2019s privilege does not permit him to enter the courts and spread- upon the judicial records charges of a shocking and felonious character against brother attorneys,- and against judges engaged in the administration of justice, upon mere rumors coupled with facts which should of themselves create no suspicion of official corruption in a just and fair mind. The applicant affirms that the order of disbarment was unwarranted, arbitrary, tyrannical and oppressive, and asks the interposition of this court by mandamus for his relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We cannot give him the aid he seeks by that writ,: whatever may be the ground upon which the state court proceeded, and in whatever light its action may be regarded. A writ of mandamus can only .be issued from this court in aid of its .appellate jurisdicti\u00f3n, except in a few enumerated cases, not embracing the one before us. The Judiciary Act of 1789, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>adopted at the first session of Congress, after declaring that the Supreme Court should \"have appellate jurisdiction from the Circuit Courts and courts of the several States, in certain cases,. provided that it should have power to issue writs of mandamus in cases, warranted by the principles and usages of law, f&lt; to any courts appointed, or persons holding office, under the authority of the United States.\u201d And the Revised Statut\u00e9s (\u00a7 688) reenacted this- provision in a modified form, without. removing the limitation as to the courts to which and the officers to. whom it may issue. If the applicant has any remedy in this court for his alleged grievance, upon which we express no opinion, it must be sought in another way.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b351-5\">Mr. Justice Gray was absent at the time of the submission and decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
