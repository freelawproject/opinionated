The vessel took fire, and, in order to save it, it was scuttled and sunk, and the fire thus extinguished. It was then raised, taken to port, and repaired. The loss by fire, exclusive of the expense of raising the vessel, etc., was $15,364.78. The owner made claim upon the insurers for this amount for \u201closs and damage by fire and water as per agreement,\u201d stating that he would make further claims \u201c for expenses of raising the propeller,\u201d and was \u201c preparing the statement of such expenses to submit with his subsequent claim.\u201d The companies declined to pay such subsequent claim, but paid in advance the amount of the loss by fire so stated, taking receipts, expressed to be in full of all claims for loss or damage by fire, and in which it was further stated that the policies were cancelled and surrendered. The parties further signed a paper in which \u201c the loss and damage by fire \u201d was certified at that aggregate amount, \u201c payable without discount upon presentation,\u2019\u2019 and the amount was apportioned among the several companies.

The action was begun in November, 1884, upon two policies of fire insurance written by the Fire Insurance Association, defendant, upon the propeller St. Paul, of which defendants in error were owners, one of such policies being for $3500, and the other for $1500. On the same day actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>were begun against six other insurance companies upon their policies on the same vessel, and an order was subsequently made that all the actions so commenced should abide the event and final determination of the one which the plaintiffs should elect to try. The following facts appeared upon the trial: In 1883, the plaintiffs, who were the owners of the propeller St. Paul, engaged in navigating the great lakes, obtained upon her fire insurance policies in ten companies, to the amount of $40,000. Plaintiffs also had $45,000 of insurance by marine policies on the same vessel at the same time. In all of these policies save one, it was provided that in case of loss, by fire, the loss should be payable in sixty days after proofs of loss had been filed with the company. On November \u202210, 1883, while on a voyage from the lower lakes to Lake Superior, a fire broke out in the hold of the vessel, and to save her and her cargo she was scuttled and sunk, and the fire thus extinguished. She was subsequently raised and brought to Detroit for -repairs, where she arrived on the 19th of November, and immediately began to discharge her cargo. A few days thereafter, and while her cargo was being unloaded, another fire broke out in her hold, and she was again sunk' for the purpose of saving her, and was afterwards raised at considerable expense. On the 15th of December, a written agreement was entered into between the plaintiffs and the adjusting agents of the several insurance companies for the purpose of appraising the amount of loss caused by these fires, with a stipulation that the agreement should be \u201c of binding effect only as far as regards the actual'cash value of or damage to such property covered by policies of said companies issued at their various agencies.\u201d It was further -added that \u201c the property on which loss or damage is to be estimated and appraised, is the hull of the propeller St. Paul, including the tackle, awnings, furniture, engine and boiler connections and. appurtenances thereto belonging,\u201d with a further memorandum, following the signature of Wickham, but preceding those of the insurance companies, that \u201c this agreement does not apply to or cover any question that may arise for saving boat and cargo.\u201d The adjustment under this' agreement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>direct loss by fire was completed December 26, and formal proofs of loss were also sent to the several insurance companies, in New York, and were received in due course of mail. The amount of the loss according to the report of the appraisers, exclusive of the expense of raising and saving the vessel and cargo thus adjusted, aggregated '$15,364.78, and the amount proportioned to the plaintiffs in error was $1920.60. The adjusting agent in sending proof of loss to the companies accompanied the same with the following letter to each of such companies:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-4\">\u201cBuffalo, January 12,1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-5\">\u201c Gentlemen: I enclose herewith proofs, John W.

The plaintiffs were never requested to compromise or release their claim for the expense of raising and saving the vessel, nor was the release or compromise of such claim spoken of except by Wick-ham when he offered to settle, as hereinbefore stated, which offer was declined by the committee, as above stated, upon the ground that they had no authority to consider the matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-5\">Plaintiffs also offered evidence to show that, at such interview, Mr. Oakley, in behalf of the Mechanics\u2019 Insurance Company, gave to Wickham a check for the amount of the loss adjusted as aforesaid against the company, being $960.30, and Wickham then signed the aforesaid receipt for that amount to the company; and after the receipts were signed and delivered, the paper, Exhibit QQ, was prepared under the direction of Oakley and given to Wickham to exhibit to the representatives of other companies, to show the amount of the adjusted loss which had been apportioned against the companies respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-6\">The defendant objected to the introduction of this parol testimony as tending to contradict the receipts and drafts given in evidence and the certificate of January 19th, Exhibit QQ, showing the apportionment of the loss to be paid by the several companies, upon the ground that such evidence was not admissible in the absence of fraud, misrepresentation and mistake. These objections were overruled by the presiding judge, and the evidence was received and submitted to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-7\">Upon the question of the admissibility of this testimony, however, there was a difference of opinion between the Circuit and the District Judges; and the following question was certified for the opinion of this court: \u201c On the facts stated in the foregoing record, was the parol testimony offered in evidence by the plaintiffs admissible to vary and contradict the certificate of January 19th, Exhibit QQ, and the receipts and drafts hereinbefore set forth <em>% </em>\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-8\">This testimony having been introduced, the defendant offered evidence tending to contradict the same, and to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>whole matter arising out of the loss was intended to be compromised and settled by what took place between the parties at the meeting in New York. There was no evidence that the agreement, Exhibit QQ, or the receipts and discharges executed by the plaintiffs, were obtained by any fraud or misrepresentation of the defendants or their agents.- The amount thus paid to the plaintiffs upon the settlement in New York was the exact amount claimed in the proofs of loss, but it'was paid about fifty-five days before the same was due and payable, as by the terms of all the policies, save one, the amount of the loss was not payable until sixty days after the proofs of the loss were furnished to the insurance companies, and this was not earlier than January 14. In the charge to the jury, the court instructed them that this payment before the amount became due was a good consideration for the settlement and discharge of the whole claim, if such settlement were actually made, and if it were so understood and agreed by the parties. The defendant claimed that the certificate and apportionment of January 19, together with the receipts and drafts, as a matter of law, showed a full settlement of the entire claim, and an accord and satisfaction thereof. The plaintiffs claimed that the settlement related solely to the loss covered by the proofs of loss, and was not intended to, and did not, embrace the claim for raising the vessel and cargo, and saving the same. The question what the parties intended by said settlement-was submitted to the jury under the charge of -the court, and upon such parol testimony and papers a verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs for the sum of $2^97.65, and a judgment for this amount was accordingly entered. A second question was certified, as to whether the defendant was entitled to a verdict under the facts in said record therein set forth; -but upon a motion to dismiss, this court held the question to have been improper. 128 U.

Assuming that the insurance companies were liable for all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>losses occasioned by fire, such losses were not payable until sixty days after the filing of proofs of loss in the offices of the several companies. These proofs were forwarded from Buffalo on Saturday, January 12, 1884, and could not have been received at the offices in New York before Monday, January 14. Most of the payments were made on the 19th of January, five days after such proofs of loss were filed, and fifty-five; days before any payments became due thereon. The last payments were made January 31, nineteen days after the filing of such notice, and forty-one days before the payments became due. The payment of the money in advance of its being due -was a good consideration for the discharge of the entire claim ; although the payments were for a much less sum than was actually due. <em>Pinnel's Case, </em>5 Rep. 117; <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>White, </em>2 Met. 283; <em>S.

The doctrine, as very clearly stated by Judge Story, is as follows: \u201c Parol evidence is .not admissible to contradict, qualify, extend or vary written instruments, and the interpretation of them must depend upon their own terms.\u201d 2 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 1531.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-6\">Nowhere has this doctrine been more clearly recognized than in the decisions of this court. In an early case, Chief Justice Marshall said: \u201cIt is a general rule, that an agreement in .writing v&gt;r an instrument carrying an agreement into execution, shaT not be varied by parol testimony, stating conversations or circumstances anterior to a written instrument.\u201d <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rousmanier, </em>8 Wheat. 174. See also <em>Bank of the United States </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>6 Pet. 51, 56; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>20 How. 442, 447; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>12 Wall. 232, 244, 245; <em>Specht </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>16 Wall. 564; <em>Burnes </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>117 U. S. 582; <em>Boffinger </em>v. <em>Tuyes, </em>120 U. S. 198, 205.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The cases are very numerous in the state courts where the same doctrine has been clearly stated and enforced. <em>Corse </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>102 N. Y. 513; <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Potruff, </em>55 Michigan, 129; <em>Highstone </em>v. <em>Burdette, </em>61 Michigan, 54.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-4\">Of course there are exceptions to and qualifications of this rule. Thus, as stated by Judge Story and Chief Justice Marshall, that in cases of fraud, misrepresentation or duress, this may be shown by parol testimony for the purpose of showing the contract to be void and of no effect. So, if a written contract has been executed and delivered, but with a clear and'distinct understanding that it was not .to have effect until a certain condition had been performed or until a certain event had happened, this may be shown by parol. <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>128 U. S. 596; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>110 N. Y. 654. These cases are upon the clear and sensible doctrine that no contract was ever actually made, or had taken effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-5\">Another clearly recognized exception is, that oral testimony is admissible to contradict or vary the terms of simple receipts for money, and'this upon the ground that they are informal, and are not in the nature of contracts, and, as said by Parsons, they are hardly \u201c an instrument at all,\u201d and have little more force than an oral admission of the party receiving. 2 Parsons on Contracts, 555; 2 Whart. Ev. 920, 1064; Greenleaf\u2019s Ev. \u00a7 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-6\">\u2022 If a receipt is connected with a contract, the receipt may be varied or contradicted by parol, but not the contract. The authorities upon this subject are very clear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-7\">In the argument in the court below, the counsel for the plaintiffs insisted, that by the decisions of the State of New York, a contract or receipt like the one in question can be contradicted in all its parts. We have examined the New York cases cited, and we submit that a careful examination will show that they are in harmony with our position in this case, and we call attention to them. See <em>Egleston </em>v. <em>Knickerbacker, </em>6 Barb. 458, 466; <em>Coon </em>v. <em>Knap, </em>4 Selden, 402; <em>S. C. </em>59 Am.

Y. 635; <em>De Lavallette </em>v. <em>Wendt, </em>75 N. Y. 579.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>None of the later cases in other States are inconsistent with the earlier New York cases. <em>Tisloe </em>v. Graeter, 1 Blackford, 363; <em>Dale </em>v. Evans, 14 Indiana, 288; <em>Alcorn </em>v. Morgan, 77 Indiana, 184; <em>Fay </em>v.

S. 426,) that the second question, was improperly certified and could not be answered, the only question now presented for decision is the first, namely: \u201c On the facts stated in the foregoing record, was the parol testimony offered in evidence by the plaintiffs admissible to vary and contradict the certificate of January 19, Exhibit QQ, and the receipts and drafts hereinbefore set forth ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">. We have.no disposition to overrule or qualify in any way the general and familiar doctrine enforced by this court in repeated decisions, from the case of <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rousmanier, </em>8 Wheat. 174, decided in 1823, to that of <em>Seitz </em>v. <em>Brewers\u2019 Refrigerating Company, ante, </em>510, decided at the present term, that parol testimony is not admissible to vary, contradict, add <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>to or qualify the terms of a written instrument. The rule, however, is subject to numerous qualifications, as well established as the general principle itself, among which are that such testimony is admissible to show the circumstances under which the instrument was executed, or that it was in fact without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">It was not seriously contended in this case that the defendant was not- legally liable upon its policies for the expenses, clearly incidental to the fire, of raising' and saving the vessel, as well as for the direct injury to the vessel in consequence of the fire, and if the plaintiffs were induced to settle their claims for one-half the amount that was due them, and there was no consideration for the relinquishment of the other half, this suit will lie for the recovery of the amount. The rule is well established that where the facts show clearly a certain sum to be due from one person to another, a release of the entire sum upon payment of a part is without consideration, and the creditor may still sue and recover the residue. If there be a <em>bonafide </em>dispute as to the amount due, such dispute may be the' subject of a compromise' and payment of a certain .sum as a-satisfaction of the entire claim, but where the larger sum is-admitted to be due, or the circumstances of the case show that there was no good reason to doubt that it was due, the release of the whole upon payment of part will not be considered as a compromise, but will be treated as without consideration and</p>\n<p id=\"AZm\">void. As was said by Chief Justice Waite in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bostwick, </em>94 U. S. 53, 67: \u201c Payment by a debtor of a part of his debt is not a satisfaction of th\u00e9 whole, except it be made and accepted upon some -new consideration: \u201d although it was subsequently held in <em>Baird </em>v. <em>United States, </em>96 U. S. 430, 431, that if the debt be unliquidated and the amount uncertain, this rule does not apply. \u201c In such cases the question is, whether the payment was in fact made and accepted in satisfaction.\u201d The authorities upon this point are numerous and decisive. <em>Pinnel's Case, </em>5 Rep. 117; <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>5 East, 230; <em>Harriman </em>v. <em>Harriman, </em>12 Gray, 341, 343; <em>Redfield </em>v. <em>Holland Ins. Co., </em>56 N. Y. 354; <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>48 N. Y. 204; <em>American Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>13 Kansas, 35; <em>White </em>v. <em>Jor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>dan, </em>27 Maine, 370; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Day, </em>26 Maine, 88; <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Couch, </em>134 Mass. 26; <em>Foakes </em>v. <em>Beer, </em>9 App. Cas. 605.</p>\n<p id=\"AUWt\">In this case theye were two distinct and separate claims of similar amount, namely, $15,364.78, one of which was for .the direct loss and damage to the property insured by the fire, and the other was fpr the incid\u00e9ntal cost of raising the propeller and her cargo. ' The plaintiffs assumed, upon the face of the receipts, to settle with the' defendant for both of these claims by the payment of the exact amount of one of' them. In-other words, they assumed to settle for a moiety of their entire claim \u2014 a claim the legality and justness' of which was so far beyond dispute that it could hardly fail to. be recognized by the. agents of the insurance companies who were present at the meeting in New York. Th\u00e1t they intended and supposed they were making a settlement of the plaintiffs\u2019 entire claim against them is probably true. But, aside from the parol tes- \u25a0 timony given by Wickham of the conversation at the meeting, the admissibility of which is the question in dispute, there was some evidence tending to show that the plaintiff Wickham may have supposed that he was settling only for the direct loss by the fire in the agreement for the survey or appraisement of the damages signed by both parties, which provided that it should not \u201capply to or cover any question that may arise for saving boat and cargo.\u201d There were also other circumstances tending to show that the agents of the companies might, have known that Wickham supposed.he was settling only for the direct loss. First, in the letter of Allen, the adjuster, who, in transmitting proofs of loss to the various companies, stated that \u201c the assured will, make further claims for expenses of raising the propeller, and is now preparing the statement of such expenses to submit with his subsequent claim.\u201d And secondly, in the memorandum of the meeting of the companies, January 18, Exhibit PP, in which, after reading a communication, from an adjuster at Detroit in relation to the salvage- expenses, a motion was carried \u201cthat the request; of the assured to help him out is not granted, but the companies are recommended to. pay the amount of claim as set forth in the proofs of loss.\u201d These items .pf testimony are in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>consistent with the idea that the agents of the companies did not know of the further claim, and are also pertinent upon the \u25a0question, whether .Wickham understood that he was settling that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">(1) But assuming that the receipts upon their face show a \u2022complete settlement of the entire claim for one-half the total amount, what was the consideration for the release of the \u25a0other half <em>% </em>The only one that is put forward for that purpose is that payment was made five days after proofs of loss were furnished, or fifty-five days before anything was actually due by the terms of the policy. \u2022 That prepayment of part' of a \u2022claim may be a good consideration for the release of the residue is not disputed; but it is subject to the qualification that nothing can be treated as a consideration that is not intended ns such by the parties. Thus in <em>Philpot </em>v. Gruninger, <em>14 </em>Wall. 570, 577, it is-stated that \u201cnothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties.\u201d To constitute a valid agrees m\u2019ent there must be a meeting of minds upon every feature and -element of such agreement, of which the consideration is one. The mere presence of sonie incident to a contract which might under certain circumstances be upheld as a consideration for a promise, does not necessarily make it the consideration for the promise in that contract. To give it that effect it must, have, been offered by one party and accepted by the other as one ele-' ment of the contract. In <em>Kilpatrick </em>v. <em>Muirhead, </em>16 Penn. St. 117, 126, it was. said that \u201cconsideration, like every other part of a contract', must be the result of agreement. The parties must understand and be influenced to -the particular action by something of value or convenience and inconvenience recognized by all of them as the moving cause. That which is a mere fortuitous, result..flowing accidentally from an arrangement, but in no degree prompting the actors to it, is not to be esteemed a legal consideration.\u201d See also 1 Addison on Contracts, 15; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Clark. </em>110 Mass. 389. Now evidence oi what took place at the meeting, if admissible for no other purpose, was competent as bearing upon the question whether the prepayment was mentioned or treated as an inducement or consideration for~the release of the residue of the claim.. It certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ivas not so stated in the defendant\u2019s plea, which set forth that the defendant \u201c paid to said plaintiffs a valuable consideration, to wit, the sum of $1920.60, in full accord and satisfaction, etc., ... for losses and damages by fire, at the several times in said plaintiffs\u2019 declaration set forth, . . . which valuable consideration or sum of money, so paid as aforesaid, was then and inhere accepted and received by said plaintiffs of and from said defendant in full payment, satisfaction, release and discharge of the said two policies of insurance,- . . . and in consideration of said money so paid and received as aforesaid said plaintiffs then and there released in writing the said defendant,\u201d etc. Therte is no mention here of the prepayment of this sum as a consideration for the release of the residue. The oral testimony upon this point was conflicting; the plaintiffs -swearing that the committee stated that the companies, were ready and willing to pay the cost of making repairs, and would waive any right they might have under the clause making the loss payable in sixty days from the time the proofs were furnished. There is no doubt that this right to delay payment was a stipulation which .the insurer could waive at his option, <em>Insurance Company </em>v. Norton, 96 U. S. 234, 240, and if, as the plaintiffs stated, the insurance companies did exercise this option, and agree to waive their right to the sixty days, the prepayment cannot be regarded as a consideration -to support the alleged compromise. It is a-familiar doctrine'that parol evidence is competent to show a want of consideration. 1 Greenl. Ev. secs. 284, 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The court charged the jury upon this point that the payment of the policy fifty-five days in advance of the time when the same would become due, without discount for interest, was, by itself, a sufficient consideration for waiving the plaintiffs\u2019 further claim in the policies, if it was understood as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The question was a proper one for the jury to pass- upon, the charge was' sufficiently favorable to the defendant, and their conclusion, whether correct or riot, cannot be the subject of review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">(2) Aside from this, however, the circumstances attending the execution of a receipt in full of all demands may be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>in evidence to show that by mistake it was made to express more than intended, and that the cr\u00e9dito- had in fact claims that were not included. Thus in <em>Simons </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>3 B. &amp; Ad. 175, which was an action of covenant, defendant pleaded a release, which recited that various disputes were existing between the parties, and that actions had been brought against \u25a0each other which were still pending, but that it had been agreed between them, that, in order to put an end thereto, the defendant should pay the plaintiff \u00a3150, and that each should release the other from all actions, causes of action and \u2022claims brought by him, or which he had against the other, and the instrument then proceeded to release \u201c all claims, demands, actions whatsoever.\u201d It was held that parol evidence was admissible to show that the claim upon the covenant was not intended to be included in the release, Littledale, J., saying: \u201cThere can be no doubt that the matter contemplated in this release was tjie actions there referred to, and parol evidence was admissible to show that the subject matter of the present action was not involved in them.\u201d Other cases to the same effect are: <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Schuylkill Navigation Co., </em>4 Wash. C. C. 562; <em>Payler </em>v. <em>Homersham, </em>4 M. &amp; S. 423; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stackhouse, </em>1 Cowen, 122; <em>Grumley </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>44 Missouri, 444; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Treat, </em>29 Nebraska, 536; <em>St. Louis, Wichita &amp;c. Railroad </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>35 Kansas, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The appraisement, the letter of Allen transmitting the proofs of loss and the memorandum of the meeting of the underwriters\u2019 agents are all corroborative of the testimony of the plaintiffs that the committee replied to Wickham, when he asked them for a contribution for the expenses of raising and saving the vessel, that the companies were not liable for such expenses, and that they had no authority whatever for considering the claim for raising and saving the steamer. If this be true, it requires no argument to show that the claim for salvage service was not intended to be included in the receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">There is no doubt that when a receipt also embodies a contract the rule applicable to contracts obtains, and parol evidence is inadmissible to vary or contradict it. But the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>clause in these'receipts which can possibly be claimed to partake of the nature of a contract is that providing for a cancellation and surrender of the policy. There was a similar provision endorsed on the policies. These, however, were inserted in pursuance of a clause in the policy to the effect, that the insurance might be terminated at any time, at the option of the company, upon giving notice to the insured and that in such.case he should be entitled to claim a ratable proportion of the premium for the unexpired term for which the policy was to run. The court instructed the jury correctly upon this point, that if they found that the policies were surrendered in consideration of the unearned premiums stated in the receipts, endorsed on the policies, the surrender was nodefence ; and while it had a tendency to show the plaintiffs\u2019' relinquishment of all their rights under the policy, it was not. conclusive, if the jury found that it was made in consideration of the unearned premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\u25a0 There was nothing in the nature of a contract on plaintiffs\u2019part' in the certificate of settlement, Exhibit QQ; it was a. mere admission that the- loss and. damage by fire had been adjusted at a certain sum, and should be construed in connection with the submission of December 15, which showed that, it did not apply to any question that might arise for saving- \u2022 boat and cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The question certified should, therefore, be answered in the affirmative, and as this was the opinion of the presiding judge, and the case was submitted to the jury upon that theory, the-judgment of the court below will be</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">\n<em>Affirmed*</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b606-8\">Mr. Justice Bradley and Mr. Justice Gray did not hear the argument nor take part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
