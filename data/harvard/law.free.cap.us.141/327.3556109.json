Molohon, alleged to have been occasioned;- by the negligent management of an engine at a public crossing. At the time the cause of action arose Thomas M. Cooley was receiver of the road under an order made by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Illinois, in a suit to foreclose a mortgage upon the road. Judge Cooley having resigned his receivership, plaintiff in error, John McNulta, was appointed his successor, and was in possession of and operating the road at the time the suits were brought. Demurrers were interposed to the declarations, and overruled, and the. suits^were subsequently consolidated by agreement of parties, tried, and a verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff for six thousand dollars. This judgment was subsequently affirmed by the' Appellate Court -of the Third District, and again by the Supreme Court of the State. Defendant thereupon sued out this writ and assigned as error, first, that the Supreme Court erred in holding that, under the act of Congress above cited, the plaintiff was entitled to maintain the action, when it appeared from the record that McNulta was not the receiver when the cause of action accrued; and second, in holding that, under said act, -McNulta could be sued as receiver with respect to any act or transaction which occurred before his appointment, without previous leave of the court of the United States by which he was ap-. pointed. Defendant in error thereupon xhoved to dismiss upon the ground that no Federal question was involved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-5\"><em>Mr. James. W.

True, it may be said plaintiff in error was exempt from suit, without leave of the court appointing him, before the passage of the act of Congress; but while that act, as we contend, permitted suits to be brought against a receiver without leave of the court appointing him \u201c respecting any act or transaction\u201d of the receiver sued, it in terms preserved that immunity from suit to a receiver whose \u201c act or transaction \u201d was not the cause of the injury complained of, and the Supreme Court of Illinois having construed the act. of Congress, and having denied to plaintiff in error the immunity claimed under that act, the correctness of that decision is a proper subject of review in this court. '</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b353-6\">Mr. Justice Brown,</author>\n<p id=\"AAH\">after stating the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The substance of the first assignment\u2019of error is that under the act of March 3, 1887, plaintiff was not entitled to maintain a suit against McNulta, as receiver, for a cause of action \u25a0which accrued when the road was in possession of and operated by a former receiver. This is clearly not a Federal question, but a question of general law, viz.: whether one person holding the office of receiver can be held responsible for the acts of his predecessor in the same office. The substance of the second assignment is that the Supreme Court'of Illinois efred in holding that such suit could be maintained against the present receiver for the acts of his predecessor without the previous leave of the court appointing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>(1) Plaintiff in error relies in this connection upon the act of Congress of March 3,1887, c. 373, 24 Stat. 552, determining the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts, which provides in section 3, that \u201c every receiver or manager of any property, appointed. by any court of the United States may be sued in respect of any act or transaction of his in carrying, on the' business connected with such property, without the previous leave of the-court in which such receiver or manager was appointed.\u201d It is difficult to see what fight can be -claimed by the receiver under this act. The right he claims is immunity from suit without the prior leave of the court appointing him; but this is a right \u00a1 not given by the statute, but in. obedience to a. general and familiar principle of law recognized by this court in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>16 Wall. 203; and <em>Barton </em>v. Barbour, 104 U. S. 126. The right conferred by the statute to sue without the prior leave of the court, is not given to the defendant, but. to the plaintiff, and the only question which could properly arise under the act in this case is, whether the receiver so sued could be held liable-for the acts of a prior receiver. The act-does not deprive any one of the right to sue where such right previously existed, but gives such right, in certain cases, and it was for the court to say whether the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action fell within the statute, or .whether the defendant was entitled to the exemption given him by the general law. . Had the.Supreme Court of Illinois decided that under this act the defendant could not be sued without the prior leave of the Federal court, the plaintiff -might doubtless have obtained a writ' of error from this court upon the ground that he -had\" been denied a right given him by a \u201cstatute\u201d of.the United States (Rev Stat. \u00a7 709), but it. does not follow that the other party is entitled to the same remedy. \u2022 The case in this particular is analogous to that of <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Andriano, </em>138 U. S. 496, decided, at the last .term, in which we held that it was only the' party whose right under a statute had been denied who was entitled to a writ of error to review the final judgment of the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">(2) But, while we think that plaintiff in error is not entitled to iifimunity by virtue of the statute of 1887, we are authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>by Eevised Statutes, sec. 709, to review the final judgment or decree of a state court where \u201c any title, right, privilege ormmunity is claimed under . . . any . . . <em>authority </em>exercised under the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege or immunity specially set up or claimed by either party under such . . . authority, . . .\u201d etc. Now, as McNulta was exercising an authority as receiver under an order of the Federal court, and claimed immunity as such receiver from suit without the previous, leave of such court, and the decision was adverse to such claim, he is entitled to a review of such ruling whether his claim be founded upon the statute or upon principles of general jurisprudence. We regard this as a legitimate deduction from the opinions of this court in <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Colbath, </em>3 Wall. 334; <em>Feibelman </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>109 U. S. 421; <em>Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, </em>115 U. S. 1; <em>Etheridge </em>v. <em>Sperry, </em>139 U. S. 266; and <em>Bock </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>139 U. S. 628. The motion to dismiss must therefore be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">(3) But, as there was, for the reasons above stated, color-for the motion to dismiss, we are at liberty to inquire whether-there is any foundation for the position of the receiver in this case that he is not liable to suit without permission of the-Federal court, and we are of the opinion that there is not. The act of March 3,1887, declares that \u201c every receiver . . . may be sued in respect of any act or transaction of his in carrying on the business connected with such property, without the previous leave of the court in which said receiver or manager was appointed.\u201d We agree with the Supreme Court \u2022of Illinois that it was not intended by the word \u201c his \u201d to limit, the right to sue to cases where the cause of action arose from the conduct of the receiver himself or his agents; but that, with respect to the question of liability he stands in place of the corporation. His position is somewhat analogous to that .of a corporation sole,- with respect to which it is held by the authorities that actions will lie by and against the actual incumbents of such corporations for causes of action accruing under their predecessors in office. <em>Polk </em>v. <em>Plummer, </em>2 Humphreys, 500; <em>Jansen </em>v. Ostrander, 1 Cowen, 670. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>actions were brought against the receivership generally or \u00e1gainst the corporation by name, \u201c in the hands' of,\u201d or \u201c in the possession of,\u201d a receiver without stating the name of the individual, it would more. accurately represent the character or status of the defendant. So long as the property of the corporation remains in the custody of the court, and is administered through the agency of a receiver, such receivership is continuous and uninterrupted until' the court relinquishes its hold upon the property, though its <em>personnel </em>may be subject to repeated changes. Actions against the receiver are in law actions against the receivership, or the funds in the hands of the receiver, and his contracts, misfeasances, negligences and liabilities are official and not personal, and judgments against him as receiver are payable only from the funds in his hands. As the right given by the statute to sue for the acts and transactions of the receivership is unlimited, we cannot say that it should be restricted to causes of action arising from the conduct of the receiver against whom the suit is brought, or his agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The defence is frivolous, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois must be \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-6\">The Chief Justice and Ms. Justice Gray, having been absent when this case was submitted, took no part in its decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
