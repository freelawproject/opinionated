He asserts that the district court abused its discretion in denying his modification motion that was based on a post-sentencing amendment to the guidelines affecting the determination of the quantity of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) to be used in calculating sentences. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Pardue pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute approximately 16 grams of LSD in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. He filed a motion for modification of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), requesting that his sentence be reduced in light of an amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). The subject amendment incorporated a new method for calculating the quantity of LSD to be used in determining a defendant\u2019s offense level and guideline range. The district court initially granted the motion and referred the case to the Probation Office to recalculate the sentencing range in accordance with the revised guideline provision; however, the court then changed its ruling and denied the motion after the Probation Office reported that the new guideline could not be applied retroactively to Pardue because he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum incarceration of ten years. Pardue timely appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Pardue argues that (1) the district court committed reversible error when it held that the mandatory minimum contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 overrode the amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Guidelines; (2) this ruling violated his right to due process; (3) the rule of lenity should govern because the provisions of \u00a7 2D1.1 and \u00a7 841 are ambiguous; and (4) the mandatory minimum of \u00a7 841 constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in light of the amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">Section 3582(c)(2) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-15\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The decision to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28 (5th Cir.1994). We therefore review challenges for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-17\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion applies only to guideline amendments that operate retroactively, as listed in the policy statement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d). <em>United States v. Miller, </em>903 F.2d 341, 349 (5th Cir.1990). The amendment to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) regarding the calculation of the quantity of LSD (Amendment 488) is one of the guideline amendments that operates retroactively according to that policy statement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-18\">The amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-19\">[i]n the case of LSD on a carrier medium <em>(e.g., </em>a sheet of blotter paper), do not use the weight of the LSD/carrier medium. Instead, treat each dose of LSD on the carrier medium as equal to 0.4 mg of LSD for the purposes of the Drug Quantity Table.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-20\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 488. Pardue argues that the district court should have reduced his sentence to fall within the guideline range produced by using this method of calculation. The district court held that it could not reduce Pardue\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tence \u2014 which, at 120 months, was already at the mandatory minimum of ten years \u2014 below the mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">This is an issue of first impression in our circuit. We conclude that the district court\u2019s ruling is correct based on a logical reading of the policy statement to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). This policy statement provides that the new approach to calculating the amount of LSD \u201cdoes not override the applicability of \u2018mixture or substance\u2019 for the purpose of applying any mandatory minimum sentence <em>(see Chapman; </em>\u00a7 5G1.1(b)).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (backg\u2019d.). The <em>Chapman </em>citation refers to <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 460-62, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1925, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991), in which the Supreme Court held that the term \u201cmixture or substance\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) required the weight of the carrier medium for LSD to be included for purposes of determining the mandatory minimum sentence. The citation to \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) refers to the sentencing guideline provision which states that, if the statutorily required mandatory minimum is greater than the upper end of the guideline range, the mandatory minimum becomes the guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">A common sense interpretation of this policy statement leads to the inescapable conclusion that the mandatory minimum of \u00a7 841, calculated according to <em>Chapman, </em>overrides the retroactive application of the new guideline. We take additional comfort in the fact that two other circuits have reached this same conclusion. <em>See United States v. Dimeo, </em>28 F.3d 240 (1st Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Boot, </em>25 F.3d 52, 53 (1st Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Mueller, </em>27 F.3d 494, 495-97 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"A4qp\">Pardue\u2019s other arguments, advancing issues of due process, cruel and unusual punishment, and the application of the rule of lenity, are raised for the first time on appeal. We need not and therefore do not consider these issues first raised on appeal, but note in passing that similar arguments were considered and rejected by the two circuits cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
