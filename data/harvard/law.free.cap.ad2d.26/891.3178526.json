Memorandum: The statement of appellant\u2019s attorney, made upon information and belief, that the contents of appellant\u2019s product is a trade secret, is insufficient to establish such fact <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>Pannia, </em>7 A D 2d 886). The allegations of respondents\u2019 complaint sufficiently show the materiality and necessity of disclosure of the contents of appellant\u2019s product. \u201c A liberal and practical view should be taken of what is necessary. There is so much merit in a disclosure of the facts in advance of trial that it should be allowed wherever legitimately sought.\u201d <em>(Marie Dorros, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dorros Bros., </em>274 App. Div. 11, 13-14.) The fact that <em>the </em>information sought is available from sources other than appellant is not alone reason for denying the disclosure (3 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, New York Civil Practice, par. 3101.09). It may well be that appellant on another motion could establish its claim that the content of its product is a trade secret, and in such case it would be entitled to reasonable protection against disclosure thereof. <em>(Drake </em>v. <em>Herrman, </em>261 N. Y. 414, 418; 3 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, New York Civil Practice, par. 3101.10; 17 ALR 2d 383.) Williams, P. J. concurs in result. (Appeal from order of Monroe Special Term denying defendant\u2019s motion for a protective order.) Present \u2014 Williams, P. J., Bastow, Goldman, Henry and Marsh, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
