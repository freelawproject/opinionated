Judgment reversed on the law, and a new trial ordered with costs to abide the event. No questions of fact have been considered. The evidence most favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>to plaintiff reveals that at the time of the alleged accident he was engaged in the removal of 200-pound barrels of .sheepskin hides from a pallet pn board the track of the defendants. The procedure used for the loading of the barrels Was dangerous and had been objected to by plaintiff. He had nevertheless been instructed by the driver of the truck, who had assumed supervision over plaintiff, to continue the loading. Under such circumstances, it cannot be held as a matter of law that the plaintiff is guilty of contributory .negligence, <em>(Broderick </em>v. <em>Cauldwell-Wingate Co., </em>301 N. Y. 182.) Beldock, P, J\u201e Christ, Hill, Rabin and Benjamin, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
