Oh February 21, 1962 he sustained a second heart attack from which he died. His widow thereafter filed a claim for compensation arising out of the death of the deceased. Following hearings at which considerable medical opinion evidence was adduced on the subject of accidental causation, the Referee dismissed the claim. Upon review the board reversed the Referee\u2019s decision making an express finding that the death was causally related to the aeei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>dental injury sustained by decedent in November, 1958 and restored the ease to the Referee\u2019s Calendar for an appropriate award. The medical opinion evidence was in sharp conflict. The board\u2019s choice of Doctor Young\u2019s testimony in favor of causation was within its fact-finding power <em>(Matter of Palermo </em>v. <em>Gallueci &amp; Sons, </em>5 N Y 2d 529). It can well be argued that the more convincing evidence supported the Referee\u2019s finding of no causal relation but that accepted by the board is not incredible as a matter of law <em>(Matter of Ernest </em>v. <em>Boggs Lake </em>Estates, 12 N Y 2d 414) and must be accounted substantial evidence supportive of the board\u2019s finding. Decision affirmed, with costs to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. Gibson, P. J., Herlihy, Reynolds and Aulisi, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
