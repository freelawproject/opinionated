The receivership having been twice vacated by this court (24 A D 2d 736; 24 A D 2d 860) the Receiver has been grossly and inexcusably lax in failing to wind up the matter, as previously directed by this court, and turning back the funds to defendant. It is only the stipulation between plaintiff and defendant with respect to payment of any charges appropriate to the receivership out of the funds in question that suggests there should not be an immediate turnover. However, the proceedings before the Special Referee should be terminated with utmost expedition and the balance of the funds turned over to defendant. If for any reason not due to the fault of the defendant the proceedings cannot be terminated within 20 days after service of the order herein with notice of entry thereof, then the funds should be returned to defendant forthwith by order of the court with appropriate provisions for claims of third parties entitled to recognition, if any.
