STATE.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b287-9\">\u25a01. When the defendant in a criminal case is not entitled to twenty peremptory challenges and a jury list of thirty-six names has been drawn, such list cannot be added to by the sheriff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b287-10\">2. <em>Qtuxi'e. </em>It is a matter of doubt whether an indictment which charges a rape, and also avers that the girl was under sixteen, can be altered by the court so as to expunge the charge of rape and convert it into an indictment for the statutory offence of carnally abusing such girl.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b287-11\">\u20223. It is also a matter of doubt, whether, if the charge in the indictment for such statutory offence was accomplished <em>without </em>the consent of the girl, the state can succeed when it appears that the offence was with her consent.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-12\">\u25a0On error to the Mercer Quarter Sessions.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-13\">Argued at November Term, 1889, before Beasley, Chief \u2022Justice, and Justices Depue and Scudder.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>For the plaintiff in error, <em>II.

It is only when the defendant has-twenty challenges that this can be done; in this case the defendant was not so entitled; he was tried, not for rape, but for a statutory misdemeanor. In that situation the thirty-six jurors were sufficient; and there is no law authorizing a single-additional juror to be added. See <em>Rev., p. </em>280, \u00a7 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">It is not necessary to decide the other questions raised by counsel. It may, however, be well to say, that I have much doubt whether the state could convict without showing that the carnal abuse was as charged in the indictment, <em>without </em>the consent of -the girl. The word \u201c without \u201d may not have been necessary, but it seems to be <em>descriptive, </em>and, therefore,, material, as all matters of description are. A man charged with stealing a black horse cannot be convicted of stealing a white one. The adjective \u201cblack\u201d is unnecessary, but it is-material, as it is matter of the description.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">If the defendant should be indicted again for criminal intercourse <em>with the consent </em>of the girl, this indictment and judgment could not be pleaded without explanatory averments, as-the second prosecution would, on the record, appear to be for a different transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">Also, it seems doubtful whether the charge of rape can be struck out of the indictment; it was the principal charge found by the grand inquest, and the charge that is left seems subsidiary and immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
