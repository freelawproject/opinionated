A piece of timber projected from one of the cars of a train so as to sweep over such platform, and the plaintiff, in order to avoid being struck by the-projecting timber, was obliged to throw herself on the platform. She did so, and the timber passed over without touching her. By reason of the shock to her nervous system,, occasioned by this peril, her health was seriously impaired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">The verdict was in her favor.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">Argued at November Term, 1889, before Beasley, Chief Justice, and Justices Depue and Scudder.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-7\">For the rule, <em>Peter L. Voorhees.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-8\">Contra, <em>J. W. Weseott.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b292-10\">Beasley, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A5D\">This rule should be discharged. The suit was not on the single ground that the-plaintiff had been frightened. There was a basis for the action in the carelessness of the company which compelled the jdaintiff to throw herself upon the platform, as such carelessness, leading to that result, was <em>per se </em>actionable. The fright was an incident to such cause of action, and a mere-aggravation of the tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">It is not- necessary in this case to decide whether mere fright caused by a wrongful accident, which results in physical injury, as, for example, sickness, is or is not- actionable,</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">Let the rule be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
