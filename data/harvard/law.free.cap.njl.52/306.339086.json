Be it ordained by the board of excise commissioners of the city of Camden, that no person or persons shall sell, offer or expose for sale or deliver, at any place within the city of Camden, any spirituous, vinous, malt or brewed liquors in quantities less than one quart, to be drunk on or about the premises where sold, without a license first had and obtained as direcled by this ordinance; and any person or persons selling, or offering or exposing for sale any of the liquors aforesaid in quantities less than one quart, without a license first had and obtained, shall pay a fine of fifty dollars and costs of prosecution, or in default thereof be committed to the county jail for a period of three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The defendant, on the trial, produced a certificate of license to sell by retail from the board of excise of the city of Camoden. It was admitted that the license was duly granted, but the defendant was convicted because he permitted the liquor \u2022to be taken from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">The Camden ordinance is similar in language to the first \u25a0section of the act of March 20th, 1889. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>77. It has been held at some of the Circuits, that a license under this law to sell by less measure than one quart authorizes the sale only to be drunk on the premises where sold. <em>N.

He maybe-indictable or otherwise punishable, yet, if he has not violated the ordinance, the conviction cannot be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The entire scope of the ordinance is, that no person shall sell in quantities less than one quart, to be drunk on or about the premises where sold, without- license first had.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">There is no prohibition in the ordinance of sales by less-measure than one quart, to be taken fr.om the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">The defendant had license to sell by less measure than one-quart, to be drunk on or about the premises, and thereby fully complied with the requirements of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Pie has done no act in violation of' the ordinance, and,, therefore, the conviction is illegal, and must be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
