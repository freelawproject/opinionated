Thereupon Gustavus A. Muller, an executor of Henry Muller, deceased, appointed in the State of Pennsylvania, appeared before the justice and moved to quash \u2022the writ. The justice denied this motion, but permitted the plaintiffs \u201c to amend their action by substituting in addition \u2022the name of Gustavus A. Muller, executor of the estate of Henry Muller,\u201d and proceeded to judgment \u201cagainst the \u25a0defendant.\u201d The executor prosecutes this writ of <em>certiorari </em>to set aside the entire proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">Plainly the proceedings must be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">Writs of attachment can issue only against persons, natural \u2022or artificial, and an estate is not a person. Nor did the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ment, by the substitution of the name of the executor, help 'the matter. For there was no affidavit that the executor either had absconded or was not resident in the state, and only against persons in these conditions can the writ be employed. Moreover, our statute does not purport to authorize the issuing of attachments against executors or administrators, except in the case of joint debtors. <em>Haight </em>v. <em>Executors of Bergh, </em>3 <em>Gr. </em>183.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Let the proceedings of the justice be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
