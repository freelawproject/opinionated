The action was tried at a special term in Wayne county, and the court made findings from which it appears that Julia A. Freer, of the town of Ontario, in Wayne county, was, in her lifetime, seized in fee simple and in possession \u25a0of the real estate described in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and that she died on the 13th day of September, 1891, leaving no parent, husband, or child, her \u2022surviving, but leaving as her only surviving heirs at law one brother, who is one of the plaintiffs, and two sisters, one of whom is plaintiff Jane E. Jackson, and the other a defendant herein, Delia 0. Hicks. On the 23d day of August, 1891, the testatrix executed her last will and testament, which is fully set out in the complaint. The will was admitted to probate by the surrogate of Wayne county, and letters testamentary were issued to the defendant John O. Howk, who qualified and entered upon the discharge of his duties as executor. It is found as a fact that Oscar F. Whitney, Edwin Harrison, and Edson Howk are trustees of the church society known as the \u201cPresbyterian Church of Ontario Center.\u201d It is also found \u201cthat the said society was originally incorporated as a Congregational society, but that thereafter its form of government was duly changed to Presbyterian, and it has since been known as and called a Presbyterian church. It was the church attended by the testatrix in her lifetime, and the only one of that name in the vicinity of her late residence.\u201d It was also found that the personal estate of the testatrix was more than sufficient to discharge in full all debts, claims, and legacies against said estate. The court found as conclusions of law, viz.: \u201c(1) That the fourteenth clause of said last will and testament of Julia A. Freer, by which the disposition of the residuum of her estate is attempted, is not invalid by reason of the creation of an unlawful suspension of the power of alienation of the estate bequeathed, but that, on the contrary, said clause operates to vest such estate in the trustees of the Presbyterian Church (or Congregational) of Ontario Center, subject to the contingent interest therein of the Board of Home Missions and the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church, and to the duty imposed upon said trustees by the fifteenth clause of said will. (2) That said fourteenth clause is not void by reason of the fact that said will was executed within two months of the death of the testatrix. (3) That the plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief demanded in their complaint.\u201d And the court ordered judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and, in accordance with the findings, the judgment was entered from which the plaintiffs appeal.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1106-10\">Appeal from special term, Wayne county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1106-11\">Action by George H.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZcJ\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint particularly described two parcels of real estate owned by the deceased at the time of her death, and is framed for the purpose of having partition of such real estate between the plaintiffs and the defendant Delia C. Hicks, who are alleged to be the heirs at law, and to whom it is alleged the property \u25a0of the testatrix descended. The prayer of the complaint, among other things, asks that \u201cthe pretended devise to the trustees of the Presbyterian Church at Ontario Center,\u201d mentioned in the will, \u201cbe declared null and void, and that the said instrument, so far as the said bequest to said trustees and to said church is concerned, be adjudged to be invalid, and in no wise to affect the disposition of her said real estate.\u201d It demands further relief according to the usual \u2022course and practice in an action to partition. Upon the trial, proof was given tending to show that in 1844 the Ontario Congregational .Society was organized at Ontario Center, and that in 1868 the form of the government of the church was changed, voluntarily, from Congregational to Presbyterian, and that thereafter the church was known .as \u201cThe Presbyterian Church.\u201d It was shown by the evidence that there was no other church known or called \u201cThe Presbyterian Church\u201d in the town of Ontario, and that the testatrix for many years attended that church; being a member thereof, and being \u201ca resident and regular attendant upon the church services\u201d until a few weeks before her death. Apparently the church was incorporated under the statute of 1813 (chapter 60, Laws 1813). Union Church v. Pickett, 19 N. Y. 482. The statute of 1813, as amended by chapter 79 of the Laws of 1875, gave to the church power to\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-9\">\u201cTake and receive by bequest or devise any real or personal estate, the net .annual income of which shall not exceed $12,000. Subject, however, to the provisions of chapter 300 of the Laws of 1800, entitled, \u2018An act relating to wills.' \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">See, also, chapter 443 of the Laws of 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">In the fourth section of the act of 1875 it was provided, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-12\">\u201cThe trustees of any church, congregation or religious society, incorporated under said section three of the above mentioned act, shall administer the temporalities thereof, and hold and apply the estate and property belonging thereto, and the revenues of the same, for the benefit of such corporation. <em>:\u2018,i </em>:1s * )&gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1107-14\">The proofs given at the trial were sufficient to warrant the finding that the Congregational Society had changed to Presbyterian, and that the Presbyterian Church mentioned in the will was the one known in law as the \u201cOntario Congregational Society,\u201d and that the misnomer does not affect or defeat the intention of the testatrix. Le<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>fevre v. Lefevre, 59 N. Y. 440. In the fourteenth clause of the will-the testatrix uses this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-3\">\u201cI give and bequeath the use or interest of all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, both real and personal, to the trustees of the Presbyterian Ghurch at Ontario Center, N. Y., which is to be used by them to help-defray the expense of preaching the gospel in said church from year to year. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">It is contended in behalf of the appellants that the effect of the language used is to create a trust in the trustees named. It is quite apparent, however, that the language used, which has just been quoted, together with the other language found in the will, was employed by the testatrix for the purpose of giving to the corporate-body the property mentioned in the will, and that the property vested: at the close of the testator\u2019s life. In re Wesley (Sup.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 304; Currin v. Fanning, 13 Hun, 458; Institution v. How\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 10 N. Y. 84; Chamberlain v. Chamberlain, 43 N. Y. 424; Wetmore v. Parker, 52 N. Y. 450. In the further provisions of the will the testatrix authorized her executor to convert all of her estate, real and personal (not otherwise disposed of), into money, and gave to him authority to bargain, sell, and alien, in fee simple, all of her lands,, and gave to him full power and authority to grant, bargain, alien, sell, and convey and assure \u201call the same lands to any person or persons, and their heirs forever, in fee simple.\u201d This language does not seem to be used for the purpose of creating a trust in the executor for the benefit of another person. It seems to be used for the purpose of granting a power to enable the beneficiary to have and enjoy the estate of the testatrix intended to be carried by the residuary clause of her will to the church. The language of the will is sufficient to confer upon the residuary legatee \u201cthe use and interest of all the rest, residue, and remainder of the estate, both real and personal\u201d;: and by the use of this language there was a gift, by implication, of' the corpus of the estate to the church, for the purpose of aiding the corporation in the discharge of some of its corporate functions. Bird v. Merklee, 144 N. Y. 544, 39 N. E. 645; Paterson v. Ellis, 11 Wend. 298; Smith v. Post, 2 Edw. Ch. 526; Hatch v. Bassett, 52 N. Y. 359-362. That case was approved in Locke v. Trust Co., 140 N. Y. 146, 35 N. E. 578; Whitney v. Whitney, 63 Hun, 59, 18 N. Y. Supp. 3, and cases cited at page 78, 63 Hun, and page 3,18 H. Y. Supp. The foregoing views lead to the conclusion that the special term committed no error in stating the conclusions of law found in its decision, and the judgment thereon should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">2. Upon affidavits presented at a special term held by the same-judge who heard the case on the merits, an application was made for an additional allowance. Affidavits were read in behalf of the defendants tending to show the value of the property involved, and a moderate allowance was authorized, to wit, $150. Ho conflicting, affidavits appear in the record, and we discover nothing, upon an inspection of the affidavits used, and the circumstances disclosed by the appeal book, indicative that the special term abused its discretion. We therefore should sustain its order. Burke v. Candee, 63 Barb. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>552; Delcomyn v. Chamberlain, 48 How. Prac. 413; Tolman v.
