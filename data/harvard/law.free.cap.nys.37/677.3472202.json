The defense was that, as the . price exceeded $50, and none of the provisions of the statute of frauds (2 Rev. St. p. 136) was complied with, there was no valid contract, and hence no cause of action. It appears that on July 24,1895, plaintiff called at defendant\u2019s place of business, and interviewed defendant\u2019s representative, Mr. Vetter, regarding the purchase of some potato bags, and offered to buy 10,000 at 5j cents a bag. He was told to call next day, and receive his answer. He did so, and an agreement was entered into between plaintiff and defendant that plaintiff would buy and defendant would sell 10,000 blue-stripe potato bags at 5J cents a bag; defendant to notify plaintiff when bags were ready for shipment, and receive from plaintiff shipping directions. The plaintiff sought to meet the requirements of the statute by offering in evidence certain writings, which will be referred to in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">On July 26, plaintiff wrote to defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-17\">\u201cNew York, July 26, 1895.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-18\">\u201cF. Walter, Esq.\u2014Dear Sir: Please notify me by mail when you are ready to have me receive the 10 M potato bags bought of you July 25th, at 514.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-19\">\u201cM. P. Hutchison.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>On the following day this letter was returned to plaintiff with a pencil memorandum written at the bottom, not signed, in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201cThe bags shown you had blue stripe, and on going over our stock we find we have only red-stripe bags. These are precisely alike, except stripe. Will this be satisfactory? If so, kindly give the shipping instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Later, on the same day, another memorandum was left on plaintiff\u2019s desk by defendant\u2019s agent. This memorandum was subscribed, referred to the unsigned memorandum of the morning, and was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">\u201cWe left a memo, on desk this a. m. This stated that we had only red-.striped bags on hand. (When we opened the bales which we thought contained blue bags, it was discovered that they were red bags.) A party wants these bags, and we told them that they may have them if you do not want them. Kindly let us know at once, as other party are waiting for answer, and oblige Frank Walter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">\u201cW. J. V.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">\u201cMr. M. P. Hutchison.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The memorandum written at the end of plaintiff\u2019s letter is insufficient to meet the requirements of the statute, and does not bind the defendant on the contract. The statute requires the note or memorandum of the contract to be subscribed by the party to be charged therewith. 2 Rev. St. p. 136, \u00a7 3; James v. Patten, 6 N, Y, 9; McGivern v. Fleming, 12 Daly, 289; Coe v. Tough, 116 N. Y. 273, 277, 22 N. E. 550. The signed writing sent by defendant to plaintiff does not bind him, for it is in no sense a contract or a memorandum of a contract. The alleged contract was for 10,000 blue-stripe bags. Defendant\u2019s memoranda speak of red-stripe bags (a different subject-matter), of which the defendant had only 8,000, and these the plaintiff refused to accept. Hence there is nothing in the signed memorandum which aids the previous writings.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">There being no valid contract, the defendant was not liable to plaintiff, and the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
