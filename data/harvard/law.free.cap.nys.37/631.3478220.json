It was explained by the landlord that the paper alluded to had been signed hurriedly, by reason of the tenant\u2019s haste, and that it was mutually apprehended to be merely a receipt for a payment made by the tenant at the time. The justice below was satisfied with this explanation, and with the parol evidence of the actual agreement; and, upon the record, we do not find reason to hold that the conclusion in favor of the landlord was unauthorized, since that conclusion could properly be reached upon evidence which, although not of the character required by law, was to be considered as properly in the case, through the failure of the opposing party to call for its exclusion.

In the absence of an agreement by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>landlord to repair, he is not answerable to the tenant for damage resulting to the latter from a want of necessary repairs.
