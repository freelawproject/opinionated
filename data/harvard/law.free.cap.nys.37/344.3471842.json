J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9c\">The plaintiffs, as administrators of one O\u2019Con-nor, deceased, sued the savings bank for funds deposited by deceased, and this defendant sought, and was allowed, to interplead instead of the bank, upon his claim that deceased, just before his death, had given and delivered to him the bank book containing these deposits. The record shows that this defendant had first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>brought action against the bank, making the same claim in that action that he does in this, and that, upon the trial of that first action, the fact was disclosed that the deceased had made what purported to be his will, which was witnessed by the plaintiff therein (the defendant herein). The record of the trial now under review shows as follows: Plaintiff\u2019s Attorney: \u201cNow, I call on counsel to produce an alleged will, spoken of by this witness [Miss King] on her direct examination, drawn by A. J. Gorton at that time, and signed by her.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Attorney: \u201cTo which request counsel remains mute.\u201d Whereupon plaintiff\u2019s attorney called as a witness the defendant\u2019s attorney, and .questioned him, as follows: Q. \u201cMr. Goldsmith, have you in your possession a paper testified to by Miss King as having been drawn up by A. J. Gorton and signed by her ?\u201d Defendant\u2019s Attorney: \u201cI object to it, as immaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent.\u201d \u201cObjection sustained. Exception.\u201d Q. \u201cHas there been delivered to you by your client a paper purporting to be the will of O\u2019Connor?\u201d \u201cSame objection, ruling, and exception.\u201d. These rulings cannot be sustained, in view of the fact that Miss King was the sole witness as to the circumstances attending the dying O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s gift to Gorton, and she says that Gorton, at O\u2019Connor\u2019s request, at that time drew up what purported to be O\u2019Connor\u2019s will, which was witnessed. It must be assumed that defendant\u2019s counsel had this paper with him in court. The plaintiff had a right to have the paper if it was in court, in order that he might cross-examine Miss King as to the circumstances attending the drawing up of the same, and to offer it in evidence if its contents went to show that the deceased did not make the gift to Gorton. And, at folio 135, the witness was asked to state the contents of this paper purporting to be deceased\u2019s will, but defendant objected, and was sustained. The defendant\u2019s attorney contends, upon this appeal, that the record does not show that any proof of servjce of notice to produce this paper was made; but the record does not show that he made such objection at trial, and, moreover, if the paper was in court (and it must be assumed that it was), no notice to produce was necessary. The record shows other errors against plaintiff, which it is not necessary to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
