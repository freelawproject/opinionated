Buttner [Com. Pl.] 26 N. Y. Supp. 52), and must be reversed. It is not enough that property is found in the hands of the judgment debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Besides, the proceedings appear to have been dismissed by an order of Justice Conlan, and in proper form. If there was any irregularity in the mode of dismissal, plaintiff could only take advantage of it by application to set it aside, and revive the proceedings. Without such, the court had no jurisdiction, and could not punish the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Order is therefore reversed, vacated, and set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
