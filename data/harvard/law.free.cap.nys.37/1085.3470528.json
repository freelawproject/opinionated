J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa1x\">In order that the moving party can succeed in a motion of this description, it is necessary for him to show that he has a valid levy upon the property upon which the attachment sought to be set aside has been levied. In the case at bar it appears that the attachment of the moving party was issued on the 17th of December, 1895, and that the affidavit upon which the appellant moved to set aside the respondents\u2019 attachment was made on the 5th of February, 1896. More than 30 days had elapsed between the granting of the appellant\u2019s attachment and the making of the affidavit, and such affidavit fails to show that at the time it was made the service of the summons was made personally upon the defendant, or service by publication begun. In order that the lien of an attachment shall continue, it is necessary, under section 638 of the Code, \u25a0 that within 30 days after the granting of such attachment the summons shall be either personally served upon the defendant, or service \u2022 by publication begun. The provision of the section in question is that a warrant may be granted by a judge of the court, or by any county judge, to accompany the summons, or at any time after the commencement of the action, before final judgment. Personal service of the summons must be made upon the defendant against whose property the warrant is granted within 30 days after the granting thereof, or else, before the expiration of the same time, service of the summons by publication must be commenced, or service thereof must be made without the state, pursuant to an order obtained therefor as prescribed in this act, and, if publication has been or is thereafter commenced, the service must be made complete by the continuance thereof. There being no evidence of a compliance with this section, there is no proof that the lien of the appellant\u2019s attachment continued; and consequently he is not in a position to attack the respondents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>attachment, even if there should be any defects in his papers or procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
