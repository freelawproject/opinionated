It appears from the printed case that, after the jury had retired to deliberate, one of the number sent, by an officer in charge, two questions to the court, asking further information on matters involved in the case. The court indorsed on the paper containing the questions \u201cthat he had no further charge to make than as already charged,\u201d and caused it to be returned to the jury. This was in the absence of counsel, and it is claimed on the part of the appellant that this was an error for which the judgment should be reversed. We do not think the point contended for is sustained by the authorities cited. In Taylor v. Betsford, 13 Johns. 487, the justice went-into the room with the jury, at their request, and, privately and apart from the parties, answered questions put to him by the jury. In Loan Co. v. Mix, 51 N. Y. 558, the court caused to be answered the inquiry, \u201cwhether the witness Moffott proved positively on cross-examination that Harris did not leave the money on the counter,\u201d by informing them that \u201cno such question was asked.\u201d This was in the absence of the plaintiffs and their counsel. In High v. Chick, 81 Hun, 100, 30 N. Y. Supp. 652, the justice went into the juryroom, against the protest of counsel for the defendant, and closed the door behind him, and while there answered questions as to the effect of the verdict. It will be seen that in all these cases there was some actual \u25a0communication between the court and jury bearing on the matter \u25a0submitted to them. In the case at bar, there was no communication -on the subject of the inquiry. The most that can be said is that the .court caused the information to be sent to the jury that he declined to communicate. It is not incumbent on a party claiming an irregularity to show that the act complained of was prejudicial, but rather for the person claiming the regularity of the proceeding to show that it was not; but where it appears affirmatively that it could not have affected the result, it is not a sufficient reason for directing a new trial. Mahoney v. Decker, 18 Hun, 365. The refusal of the court to instruct the jury in the present case was within the exercise of sound discretion, and not such an irregularity as to warrant the reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
