To grant the defendant\u2019s motion to open the default without requiring it to furnish security of some sort to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s \u2022claims, costs, disbursements, etc., would, in effect, defeat the plaintiff in the collection of .its claim, and give other execution creditors <em>a, </em>preference over plaintiff. Under the circumstances, the requirement of the deposit with the clerk of this court of the sum mentioned in the order, to secure the plaintiff\u2019s claim, costs, disbursements, and -expenses of sale, as a condition of opening the default and setting aside the judgment and execution, was not unreasonable; but the .same was a fair exercise of the court\u2019s discretionary power in the premises, and the same should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-17\">The other condition imposed upon the defendant by the terms of said order, viz. that it consent that the verdict of the jmy upon the trial of the action should be final, and no appeal taken therefrom for any reason, affects a substantial right, of which no litigant should be deprived. We are therefore unable to sustain that part of the \u2022order.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-18\">Order of September 27, 1895, appealed from, affirmed, without sosts, except as to that part thereof which required the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>consent that the verdict of the jury shall be final, and no appeal taken therefrom for any reason. Let the defendant (appellant) have 10 days from the date of the service of the order on this appeal within which to comply with the conditions of said order opening the default; and let the trial of the actions be set down for Monday, February 17, 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The conditional order of September 27, 1895, having been affirmed in part only, it follows that the final order of October 8,1895, must be reversed. The same is accordingly reversed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
