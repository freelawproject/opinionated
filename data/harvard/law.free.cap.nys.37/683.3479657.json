The defenses litigated were eviction and a cancellation of the contract, and the justice below found in favor of the defendants. The record satisfies us that this conclusion was not incorrect, since, while there was the customary conflict of evidence as to the main facts, ample grounds for finding a constructive eviction appeared. It appears, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>according to the defendants\u2019 evidence, which the justice was authorized to credit, that the plaintiff, who resided continuously upon the premises, was a person of hasty temper, prying and officious, and rendered the condition of tenancy, through unreasonable demands and repeated discourtesy, undesirable, if not unbearable. The culmination of the difficulties was reached during the last month of the defendants\u2019 occupancy, when a violent attack, not only verbal but physical, was made by the plaintiff upon Mr. Russell. Thereupon notice was given of the defendants\u2019 election to terminate the tenancy. The plaintiff expressed her determination that they \u201cmust go,\u201d and the premises were abandoned at the end of that month, up to which time rent had been paid in advance. Upon this state of facts, if there were not a good defense of constructive eviction, through the lessor\u2019s breach of the covenant of quiet and peaceable enjoyment, that covenant might properly have been omitted from the lease in question. The case falls most fittingly within the ruling of Cohen v. . Dupont, 1 Sandf. 263, which was, indeed, a case not so strong for the tenant as the present, since there no actual violence was indulged in by the landlord, a series of minor annoyances alone being held to constitute an eviction. See, also, Sully v. Schmitt, 147 N. Y. 248, 41 N. E. 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
