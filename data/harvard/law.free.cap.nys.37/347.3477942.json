The insurance was upon a dwelling, and the fire which caused the loss took place about three months after the last tenant permanently moved out. It is conceded that there was no furniture or other material except a blanket in the premises insured during all that time. Among the provisions contained in the policy was this one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-17\">\u201cThat if a building herein described, whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant, be or become vacant or unoccupied, and so to remain for ten days, the policy shall be void, unless provided otherwise by agreement indorsed hereon or added to.\u201d \u00b0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-18\">We think the trial justice should have dismissed the complaint at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, and also at the close of the entire case. The testimony of Mary A. Stapleton and James D. Du Bois was insufficient, and did not relieve the plaintiffs from the effect of the condition of the policy of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Earl, J., in Herrman v. Insurance Co., 81 N. Y. 184, at page 188,. says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\">\u201cA dwelling house is unoccupied when no one lives therein, but is not then necessarily vacant. * * * To avoid the policy, the premises must not only be unoccupied, but also vacant. Force should be given to both words. This-is not a casual contract drawn in haste, in which language has been carelessly used; but it is a form of contract used by the defendant in its business,, probably adopted with great deliberation, every word of which, as we may\" suppose, has been carefully weighed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">These premises were both unoccupied and vacant. Herrman v. Insurance Co., 85 N. Y. 162, 168, 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Plaintiffs made a breach of a binding condition, and must abide-the unfortunate consequences. This being material error, judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the-appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
