The action is brought by the plaintiff to recover from the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>fendant rent of a flat, in the premises known as No. 23 West 20th street, in the city of N\u00e9w York, for the months of August and September, 1895, covenanted to be paid by defendant, in a written lease, for the term of two years from November 1, 1894. The action is brought on an express covenant to pay rent. In such an action, plaintiff in his complaint need not allege or prove that the defendant occupied or enjoyed the premises. Gilhooley v. Washington, 4 N. Y. 217. For that reason, the denial in the first paragraph of defendant\u2019s answer does not avail him. It appears, therefore, that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, as set up in his complaint, is fully admitted by the answer. Defendant must therefore rely upon the affirmative defense set up in the third paragraph of his answer, to wit, surrender and acceptance. This defense, as pleaded, did not arise until August 12, 1895, while the rent for the month of August was payable on August 1st, in advance, so that plaintiff was clearly entitled to a direction for One month\u2019s rent. To the motion for judgment on the answer, which was granted, defendant took a general exception, thereby disputing that plaintiff was entitled to any judgment at all, wdien he was clearly entitled to judgment for one month\u2019s rent, and wholly failed to raise the specific question of defense to the rent for the month of September. Defendant omitting to call the attention of the court to the question of the liability for the rent for the month of September upon the trial, it is too late to raise it on appeal. Tuers v. Tuers, 100 N. Y. 196, 2 N. E. 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
