This motion the court denied, and the defendant excepted. The only question, as conceded by the parties, was whether or not the building destroyed was the building insured by the defendant. We think that this motion should have been granted, and that there was no evidence to justify a finding of the jury that the building that was destroyed by fire was the building insured. The evidence in the case is substantially uncontradicted as to the situation of the premises at the time the policy of insurance was issued. Upon one side of the road was a building that the witness described as \u201ca story and a half or two-story house, with these additions,\u2014one story additions.\u201d \u201cThe main part of the house was a story and a half, or two stories.\u201d It was in this building, thus described as a house, that the insured and her family lived, and the only building upon the place that could be called a residence. Upon the opposite side of the highway from this building designated as a dwelling house were two buildings,\u2014one-called by the witness \u201cBarn No. 1,\u201d and the other a wagon house. They were separated from each other. The barn was composed of three connected buildings; the wagon house, one building, standing by itself. A diagram was admitted in evidence, which showed the location of these buildings with the highway, and which was testified to as correct by the person who made it. With this situation of the property, there was one building on which the owner resided, another building which was used for barn purposes, and another that was used as a wagon house. The insured applied to the defendant for insurance upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>all the buildings, and in consequence of that application the policy in question was issued. That policy insured $500 on barn Ho. 1, occupied by a tenant, $650 on hay and grain in barn Ho. 1, $200 on wagon house, and $450 on wagons, carriages, and horses in the barn, but contained no insurance upon the dwelling. The building that was destroyed by fire was the building standing by itself, which was the only building on the premises used as a dwelling. Bearing in mind this situation of the premises, and the absence of any evidence showing a contrary intention, we think it is clear that the building insured was not the building occupied by the owner as a residence, but was the building that was designated on the plan as \u201cBarn Ho. 1.\u201d The' policy expressly insured wagons and sleighs, carriages and harness, in the barn. The horses and cattle were kept in this building designated as \u201cBarn Ho. 1\u201d upon the diagram. Hone of these things was kept in the building known as the \u201cdwelling house.\u201d There was also insured the grain kept in the barn Ho. 1, and the evidence is that there was no grain kept in that barn, but that the grain was kept in a part of the building designated as a \u201cdwelling house.\u201d While the description used in the policy is to some extent ambiguous, at the same time the distinction is drawn in the form of the policy itself between a dwelling house, a barn, and a wagon house. In it the dwelling was not insured, yet, strictly speaking, the building that was burned was a dwelling house; for in it the owner dwelt, and there was no other place upon the premises that could come within that description. On the other hand, the building known as \u201cBarn Ho. 1\u201d was a barn used for the purpose of keeping cattle, and in it was kept straw, although no grain was kept there. Considering this condition of the premises in question, no one reading this'policy could understand, where a dwelling house was not insured, and a barn was, but that the policy applied to the building that was not destroyed, and not to the building that was.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">We think, therefore, that the court erred in refusing to direct a verdict for the defendant upon the whole evidence, and that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appeh lant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
