Julian Held, upon whom the summons was served, was not an officer of the defendant company at the time of the service. The summons was served on November 2, 1895. On November 8, 1895, at 6 o\u2019clock p. m., Justice Botty granted an order to show cause, with a stay, which was attempted to be served on November 9, 1895, at 8:55 o\u2019clock a. m., at plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s office, by inclosing copies thereof, with affidavit upon which they were granted, in an envelope addressed to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s office, and depositing them, through a slit in the door of said attorney\u2019s office, into his office. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney had then no letter box in his office, and his office was closed. At 9:50 a. m. of that day, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, without having had any notice whatever of the stay, as granted by the court, entered up judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Under this statement of facts, I hold that the'service of the orders to show cause, with the stay, was not served in compliance with sub-division 3 of section 797 of the Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was not binding on the plaintiffs or their attorney. Livingston v. Railroad Co. (Sup.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Considering, in addition, that defendants appear to have had no defense upon the merits of the cause of actions, and the motions to set aside the summons in which the stay had been given were after-wards, on a deliberate investigation by a referee, denied, and considering, further, that by vacating these judgments subsequent creditors would gain an undue advantage over these plaintiffs, it would be an injustice, instead of justice, to reverse these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Order appealed from affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-15\"> The statute provides that service of papers on an attorney whose office is not open, and who has no office letter box, shall Be made at his residence, on a person of suitable age and discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
