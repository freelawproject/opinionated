Nathan Beman, being the owner of the premises, did, February 15, 1870, enter into a contract in writing under seal with Henry Yell, Amos Yell, and Joseph Sampica, whereby Beman agreed to sell to the Yells and Sampica said premises for $1,000, $50 of which they then paid, and agreed to pay the balance in five equal, annual, successive payments, with interest; and, upon payment being fully made, said Beman was to execute and deliver to the vendees a good and sufficient deed of the premises. That November 5, 1870, Beman assigned the contract and ail his interest in and to the premises therein to Wead, whose administratrix afterwards, and on July 2, 1884, assigned the same to plaintiff. The premises consist of 110 acres of uninclosed, unoccupied wood and swamp land in Clinton county. Some payments-were made by the vendees, but there remained due and unpaid on the contract, November 20, 1894, when the action was tried, $1,019.03, principal and interest. September 11, 1873, a judgment was entered and docketed in Clinton county for $1,600.83 against the vendor, Nathan Beman, in favor of Seba Johnson and Darius Ayer, and execution afterwards issued thereon against the property of said Nathan Beman, under which execution the sheriff soldi the premises described in said contract to William S. Douglas and John W. Beman, and afterwards in due time gave them a sheriff\u2019s deed thereof, which, deed they recorded in the Clinton county clerk\u2019s office, August 11, 1870. March 18, 1880, John W. Beman conveyed his interest to said Douglas. There is no evidence that Beman or Douglas, up to the time of receiving the-sheriff\u2019s deed, had any notice of the contract of sale or of any claim of thevendees therein named to the premises. The defendant Martha is the widow,- and Hiram and Effie Douglas are the children, of said William S. Douglas, who died intestate March 24, 1887, and they defend, alleging that by virtue-of the sheriff\u2019s deed to said Douglas and John W. Beman, and the due record thereof without notice of the said contract, they are the owners of the premises, and that their title is not affected by said contract. The court held otherwise, and they appeal.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b886-5\">Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b886-6\">Action by Samuel S.

There is no evidence that William S. Douglas- and John W. Beman, the purchasers at the sheriff\u2019s sale, had notice, or were charged with notice, of the contract, or of the rights or claims of any of the parties to it. They bid and paid $327 for the-land. This is some evidence\u2014perhaps as much as it is reasonable to expect\u2014in support of a negative sought to be proven after the-death of the purchaser. We think that the finding of the learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>trial judge that William S. Douglas was not a bona fide purchaser, and was not without notice of the lien of the contract, cannot be sustained. This finding seems to be based upon the assumption, stated in the opinion of the learned judge, that \u201cthe case is entirely barren of evidence in that particular.\u201d But the burden of showing notice rested upon the plaintiff, who sought to impeach the record purchaser\u2019s good faith. Brown v. Volkening, 64 N. Y. 76. Assuming that William S. Douglas was a purchaser in good faith, and not charged with notice of the contract, then we think that the sheriff\u2019s deed to him and Beman was within the protection of the recording .act. It is the law of this state that, in the absence of fraud, a judgment only takes effect upon the actual interest in land which the judgment debtor has at the time of the recovery of the judgment. Banking Co. v. Duncan, 86 N. Y. 221; Frost v. Bank, 70 N. Y. 553; Clute v. Emmerich, 99 N. Y. 342, 2 N. E. 6. The judgment debtor, Nathan Beman, had the legal title, but had sold the equitable title. This naked legal title, destitute of any beneficial interest, the sheriff sold upon the execution to Douglas and John W. Beman. Apart from the recording act, Douglas and John W. Beman practically acquired nothing. They recorded their deed, and, being purchasers in good faith, without notice of the equities arising under the contract of sale, they acquired by their priority of record the better title. Hetzel v. Barber, 69 N. Y. 1. If Nathan Beman, instead of giving a contract \u25a0of sale, had first given a deed of the land to the plaintiff, and he had failed, to record it, the subsequent recorded deed to the defendants would be preferred. If the unrecorded deed is not protected, much .less the contract for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The judgment should be reversed, new trial granted, costs to abide event.
