On May 4, 1893, Messrs. Shrimpton &amp; Sons, of New York City, delivered at that place to the defendant, for transportation, a case of goods addressed to the plaintiff in Brooklyn. The defendant was an expressman, the proprietor of Dunlap\u2019s Express, with a license for and doing business in New York City only. He did business with Shrimpton &amp; Sons under an agreement \u201cto receive freight from them and deliver it in the city, and to forward other goods that they would give us to \"other points outside of our territory.\u201d There was no special agreement to deliver in this case, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>defendant proved that, in accordance with the established usage and custom, he delivered the goods the same day he received them, at the end of his route, to the Windsor Express, a connecting carrier doing business in Brooklyn, for delivery to the plaintiff there. That the goods were safely delivered to the Windsor Express by the defendant is clear, for that concern tendered them to the plaintiff at their place of destination. The plaintiff refused to accept delivery for some reason that does not appear. After such tender the godds were lost or disposed of by the Windsor Express. Since the plaintiff intrusted the shipping of the goods to Shrimpton &amp; Sons, they, in so shipping, acted as his agents, and as such had power to bind him in contract with the carrier as to the 'terms and conditions of transportation. Root v. Railroad Co., 76 Hun, 23, 27 N. Y. Supp. 611; Jennings v. Railway Co., 127 N. Y., at page 447, 28 N. E. 394; Shelton v. Transportation Co., 59 N. Y. 258; Nelson v. Railroad Co., 48 N. Y. 498; Rawson v. Holland, 59 N. Y., at page 617. Under these circumstances Dunlap undertook the responsibility only of carrying the goods as far as his route extended, and there delivering them to and forwarding them according to the established usage by the next connecting carrier; and this he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The judgment must therefore be reversed1, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
