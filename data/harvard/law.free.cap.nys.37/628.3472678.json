The county seat of Westchester county is convenient to New York City. These cases are not so exceptional as to cause a departure from the rule. The long distances in the country, which cause change of venue, do not exist hereabouts. It cannot be said to be any grave inconvenience to go a distance which takes only an hour or less. The strong tone of the brief submitted is quite unnecessary. It stands on the alleged right of the defendants, whereas it is not a matter of right. The alleged injustice is imaginary. Motions all denied.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b654-7\">Appeal from special term, Westchester county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-8\">Action by Carrie Archer Brink against the Home Insurance Company of the city of New York, impleaded with the Bank for Savings of the city of New York, on a fire insurance policy.
