Thes\u00e9 latter do not affect the question before the court, viz. whether security is necessary to perfect such an appeal. Section 1340 of the Code (amended, Laws 1895, p. 840, c. 940) provides for appeals (such as the present) from \u201cinferior and local courts heretofore heard by the court of common pleas for the city and county of New York,\u201d etc., to the supreme court, after January 1,1896; and the hearing and determination of such appeals is had at the appellate term. Code, \u00a7 3191, subd. 1. To perfect such an appeal, security is not required. Code, \u00a7 1341. Under former statutory conditions, security to perfect an appeal from a judgment of the city court of common pleas was held to be essential. Carling v. Purcell, 3 MisC. Rep. 55, 22 N. Y. Supp. 558. But by the amendment noted the call for such security was made to cease with the existence of that court, and with the beginning of the present appellate practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
