The ninth provision, of said policy provides: \u201cDeath of the member by his own hand, whether voluntary or involuntary, sane or insane, at the time, is not a risk assumed,\u201d etc.; but, in case of such, there shall be payable a sum equal to the amount of the assessments paid by said member with 0 per cent, interest. It is therefore quite clear that, under said policy, suicide by the insured was not a risk assumed. The evidence in this case shows that the insured shot himself, and died eight days subsequently, from the effects of such shot. Therefore, he was a suicide, and under its policy the defendant was only required to repay the amount of the assessments paid in and 6 per cent, interest; and for that amount, only, was the plaintiff entitled to a verdict herein. The trial justice directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $2,000 and interest. Because of the reasons above stated, it was error for him to have done so. He should only have directed a verdict for the assessments paid in and 6 per cent, interest thereon, as he was requested to do by the defendant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
