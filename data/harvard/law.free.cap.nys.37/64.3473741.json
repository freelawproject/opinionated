Prior to January 1, 1892, plaintiff had been for a long time general manager of defendant\u2019s office, at 924 Broadway, in the city of New York, at an annual salary of $2,500. In March, 1892, a new corporation was formed,\u2014the Wakefield Rattan Company of New York,\u2014which took over the New York business of the defendant. The title to the property in New York was transferred to it, and it opened a bank account in its own name. Plaintiff became the president and a director of this company. No salary attached directly to the offices, but his old. one continued in force, and was paid by checks of the New York company. His duties remained, in character, the same; but his services now forwarded a business which, in name, belonged, not to defendant, but to the New York company. On February 15, 1893, defendant wrote to plaintiff, requesting his resignation as president and director of the New York company, and that his connection with the business cease upon its acceptance. The next day he wrote, tendering his resignation unconditionally. The day succeeding, defendant wrote, accepting the resignation, authorizing him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>draw Ms salary to March 1st, and directing him to terminate his connection with the company at the close of business the next day, February 18th. He sues to recover the unpaid balance of salary for the year 1893 at the rate of $2,500 per annum. He was defeated upon the ground that he entered the service of the New York company on March 11, 1892, and that the defendant ceased to be liable to him from that date.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b90-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Appeal from circuit court, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-12\">Action by Simon M.

It was properly dismissed, if, for any reason, the plaintiff had no legal claim against the defendant. Now, assuming that the contract relation between the parties was unaffected by the formation of the New York company, or by the position in that company which the plaintiff took, still that contract relation terminated by what transpired when the plaintiff finally retired.' At that time he not only resigned from the New York company, but completely severed his connection with the defendant\u2019s business. He' did not resign with a reservation, did not even suggest a continuing contract with the defendant, and never again offered hisjservices. On the contrary, although his resignation occurred on the 18th of February, he accepted his salary for the current month, namely, until the 1st of March, and then, without a word of complaint or objection, turned over to his successor the keys of the store, and the books of account and papers in his possession. It is quite immaterial h\u00f3w the resignation was brought about. The defendant requested it, and the plaintiff gave it. Possibly,\u2014 probably, even,\u2014a refusal to resign \"would have been followed by a dismissal, but still there was no compulsion. There was a strong intimation of what was impending, but there was in fact no dismissal and no breach. The contract was canceled by mutual consent,, and that is necessarily the end of plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The complaint was properly dismissed, and the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
