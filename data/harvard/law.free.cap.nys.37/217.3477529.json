The question of fact whether the person served was an officer of the company at the time of service was referred to a referee, who reported in the affirmative, after the most elaborate investigation, both as to questions of fact and of law. The report is so exhaustive that the court could not improve on it. It was adopted by the judge who denied the motions. Orders affirmed, with costs. All concur. '</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
