The summons and complaint were served on defendant on November 9, 1895. The time to answer expired on November 15th. On November 16th the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, not aware that any settlement of the action had been effected between the parties, and the defendant having made default in appearing and answering, entered judgment by default for the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and interest, viz. $291.85, and $20.96, costs and disbursements,\u2014total, $312.81,\u2014and issued execution thereon. The defendant then moved at special term to vacate and set aside said judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>execution, on the ground that, on November loth (on the day when the time to answer expired), the defendant had paid to plaintiff the sum of $291.00 in full settlement of the action, and the plaintiff and defendant had entered into a stipulation to discontinue the action, without costs to either party as against the other. The court made an order denying the motion, unless the defendant paid the plaintiff\u2019s attorney the sum of $20.96 costs, and also the sum of $27.64, sheriff\u2019s fees, incurred under the execution, and directed that, on payment of the same, the judgment be satisfied, and, in default of payment of such costs and disbursements, plaintiff be at liberty to&gt; collect the same by levy and sale under the execution issued in this-action.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In view of the fact that plaintiff\u2019s attorney had no notice of the settlement of the action, I think it was both regular and proper to enter up judgment. The defendant, having settled with the plaintiff without notice to the attorney, did so at its own risk. Such a settlement cannot affect the rights or claims of the attorney upon his client\u2019s cause of action for compensation, which are secured him by virtue of section 66 of the Code. It is a well-settled rule of practice that the attorney\u2019s lien for costs in an action is absolute, and he should be protected to the fullest extent in the enforcement of his right in the premises. Nothing could be gained by vacating: the judgment, and then compelling plaintiff\u2019s attorney to apply to the court for leave to prosecute the action for the enforcement of his claim for costs, which application, if granted, could only result, unless the attorney\u2019s costs were paid, in a re-entry of judgment in. plaintiff\u2019s favor, and the issuance of an execution thereon for the collection of the amount due the plaintiff\u2019s attorney for costs, etc. Under the circumstances, the order made at special term, in so far as it protects the attorney for the enforcement of his claim for costs- and disbursements, incurred for sheriff\u2019s fees, etc., was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Order appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
