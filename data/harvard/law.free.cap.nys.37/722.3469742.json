The only grounds upon which we are asked to reverse this judgment are exceptions by the defendant to rulings upon questions of evidence. Most of these objections related to the limiting by the court of the cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel of certain witnesses sworn in behalf of the plaintiff. We have examined these exceptions, and do not think that any of them require us to reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">The principal objections and exceptions of the defendant are presented upon the cross-examination of Jacob Vogel, a witness called by the plaintiff. He testified, on the trial, to an interview between the plaintiff and the defendant and himself, when the plaintiff introduced the witness to the defendant, stating to him: \u201cHere are my parties. I am in this. Now I have done my share. Now I leave you.\u201d Whereupon plaintiff left, and the witness and his brother remained, and had a conversation with the defendant which resulted in the transaction being carried out from which defendant realized the commission, half of which plaintiff seeks to recover. On cross-examination, the witness was asked about the interview that he subsequently had with the defendant, and testified to his recollection as to those interviews. He swore that he could not say what the conversation was, exactly, but could give the substance of it, which he proceeded to do. This was an interview that took place after the transaction had been consummated, and it was stated by the defendant\u2019s counsel that he intended to see if he could not bring out some conversation between the defendant and the witness to show that the witness had a hostile feeling towards the defendant. There was considerable conversation between the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>and the defendant\u2019s counsel, in which the court expressly stated to defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cYou may prove they had a difficulty; but antecedent to that, no.\u201d The counsel for the defendant then asked several questions having relation to this interview about which the witness had testified upon the cross-examination, the questions being solely for the purpose of impeaching the witness, and showing that he had a bias or prejudice against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">It is well settled that the extent of a cross-examination, and the method by which it should be conducted, are largely in the discretion of the trial court, and a court, on appeal, has no right to review that discretion, unless it has been abused. In this case the witness was asked the details of this conversation, and had given them, so far as he remembered, at the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel ; and we think it was within the discretion of the trial court to restrict the defendant\u2019s counsel, in his examination of the witness, as to what took place at those interviews. As before stated, the witness had stated his recollection of what took place at the interviews in question; and, after these questions were excluded, he was again allowed to answer the question as to whether he had a conversation with defendant in which the defendant charged the witness with having made misrepresentations, at the time he entered into the lease, concerning the amount that he was worth, to which the witness stated he did not remember ever having had a conversation with him in regard to making a misstatement, or anything of the sort. And the witness also said that he did not remember that the defendant said to him that he had made a misstatement concerning what he was worth. All of these questions that had been excluded appear to have been answered several times, and a consideration of the whole testimony, with the questions excluded, satisfies us that there was no abuse of the discretion vested in the court regulating the cross-examination of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">There was also an objection to a question asked Mr. Louis Vogel, another witness called on behalf of the plaintiff: \u201cWere you then in the market?\u201d This question was asked, on redirect examination, by plaintiff\u2019s counsel; and on cross-examination the witness had testified that a Mr. Strauss called on him on behalf of the defendant, and that he (the witness) had told Strauss that he was not in the market. It was entirely incompetent for the plaintiff, on redirect examination, to ask whether or not he was actually in the market for a place on Broadway between Thirty-Third and Thirty-Fourth streets at that time, and to explain why he had made the statement to Strauss, the statement having been drawn out on cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel for the purpose of affecting the credibility of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">We do not think that the exception by the defendant to the striking out of certain questions and answers by the court is available. After the question was answered, the counsel for the plaintiff moved to strike it out, he not having objected to the question. The court offered to allow the plaintiff an exception to the question, and to allow the answer to stand, and to that counsel for the defendant objected, whereupon the court struck the answer out, notifying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>defendant\u2019s counsel that he could ask the question again, and the court would admit it, it having been stricken out merely for the purpose of allowing the plaintiff to make a timely objection to the question. To that the counsel for the defendant excepted, and refused to repeat the question. This was a mere matter of procedure upon the trial, and was within the power of the court; and the defendant, having refused to ask the question again, waived any objection to striking the testimony out as it stood. The court expressly stated to the counsel for the defendant that he could ask the question again, and that the court would allow it; and the defendant, having refused to avail himself of this permission, cannot now urge his objection or exception to the striking out of the testimony. The testimony was not very material, and we cannot see that it would have had any effect upon the verdict if it had been allowed to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\">We have examined the other objections to the testimony, and think that none of them are material, or call for any extended examination. No error has been called to our attention, by the defendant, of sufficient importance to justify us in reversing the judgment. We think, therefore, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
