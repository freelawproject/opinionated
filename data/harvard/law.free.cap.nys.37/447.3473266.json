When the case is heard in surrogate\u2019s court it may be shown0 that all of the facts which the appellant asserts should have been alleged in the petition actually exist, and so the case will be brought within section 2474 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and then the surrogate\u2019s court may, if it is deemed proper, permit the amendment of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
