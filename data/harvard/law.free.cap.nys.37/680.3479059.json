There was evidence that the covers were of the same leather as the sample marked \u201cApproved,\u201d and plaintiff, as a witness, denied.that he would call the sample book better than those tendered. There was also a comparison of the books as to appearance at the trial. <em>Held, </em>that there was some evidence to support a verdict for plaintiff, though the evidence tended strongly to show that the books tendered were quite inferior to such sample.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b706-10\">Appeal from city court of New York, general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b706-11\">Action by Thomas J.

The contract was entered into in June, 1893, and called for the furnishing of 1,000 blank books, to be made according to sample, and delivered \u201cas soon as possible, which will be about August 1st. \u201d These books were to be covered with leather of a kind according to a sample which defendants had marked \u201cApproved,\u201d and were to \u201clook as good\u201d in this regard as the sample book, which was covered with a different quality of leather. About the 10th of August delivery was made of 200 books, which were rejected by the defendants, principally, it appears, because the covers were not satisfactory, and also because the pages were not numbered. This last defect the plaintiff offered to remedy at once, but the defendants still refused to accept the delivery. Up to this date no question as to the time of performance had been raised, and the plaintiff\u2019s readiness to correct the defect of paging before the time for performance had expired, according to the parties\u2019 understanding of what that period was, could be taken as a substantial performance so far. Miller v. Benjamin (Sup.) 21 N. Y. Supp. 1116. What attitude was taken as to the time of delivery could have been inferred from the defendants\u2019 letter of August 22d in which they said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">\u201cWe want you to send for the books, as we told you and Mr. Wakeman both, as we will not take the books unless as agreed, and up to sample.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">It was thus inferable that the defendants had looked upon the time of performance, at that date, as unexpired, and since they then would not accept the books as tendered, the plaintiff could consider the contract broken, cease further delivery, and recover damages if he could maintain his position that the books were according to sample and \u201clooked as good\u201d as the model in the way of binding. Soltau v. Vulcanite Co., 12 Misc. Rep. 131, 33 N. Y. Supp. 77. There was evidence that the covers of these books were actually of the same leather as the sample which had been marked \"Approved\u201d by the defendants, and whether or not the appearance of the goods was as pleasing as that of the sample book, the court and jury below had an opportunity to discover, since there was an ocular comparison at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The evidence contained in the record tends very strongly to show that the books furnished were quite inferior to the sample in appearance, this being caused by the effect of the binding process upon the cheaper leather; but there is some contradiction as to this in the plaintiff\u2019s denial that he .would call the sample book better than his own production. Our conclusion must be that there was some evidence in support of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and that the court did not err in refusing a nonsuit at the trial. This is as far as we may look into the facts of the case (Claflin v. Watch Co., 7 Misc. Rep. 669, 28 N. Y. Supp. 42), whatever may be our view of the justice of the verdict as based upon the preponderance of proof. .</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
