It was upon \u201cdue consideration \u201d (so they say) of this record, in connection with the testimony, that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>determined that he \u201cwas guilty as charged.\u201d This was clearly erroneous. People v. French, 119 N. Y. 505, 23 N. E. 1061; People v. MacLean, 57 Hun, 141, 10 N. Y. Supp. 803. The record was not introduced upon the trial, and the accused had no opportunity of explaining it. It was read and considered in his absence and without his knowledge; and certainly it was highly prejudicial, for there was a close question of veracity between the relator, the relator\u2019s witnesses, and the complaining witness. It may well be that, notwithstanding the numerical preponderance of testimony upon the relator\u2019s side, this record turned the scale. , If the record should be treated as the knowledge of the commissioners, in that it is part of the records of the department, still it was improperly considered, for, as was said in People v. French, supra, \u201cthey may neither act upon their own knowledge nor supplement the evidence with their own knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\">&lt; The proceedings had should be annulled, and the relator reinstated, with $50 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
