The evidence was conflicting, and the learned court, in a charge as favorable to the defendant as he could ask, submitted both questions to the jury for determination. There is evidence to sustain their verdict for the plaintiff, and, in our opinion, the evidence is preponderatingly in favor of the finding of the jury. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">There are no exceptions that require discussion, and the judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
