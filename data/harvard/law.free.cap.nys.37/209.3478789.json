The very nature of the work to be done required that some one should furnish the plaintiffs necessary information, or, as plaintiffs designate it, the \u201cnecessary material,\u201d to construct a geological map of New York state, as required by said contract. As the contract failed to show whose duty it was to furnish such information, it was proper to admit oral evidence to establish that fact. It also appears that the failure of the plaintiffs to finish their work within the time fixed was due to the failure of the defendants\u2019 agent to furnish the plaintiffs with the information which it was necessary for him to furnish, and was apparently no fault of the plaintiffs. The evidence shows that he never furnished such information, and for that reason they were not able to complete their contract, and thus were compelled to bring this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>action for damages caused them by reason of the violation of such contract by the defendants\u2019 default.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">As to the question of partnership raised by the answer of the defendant Barnes, I think the evidence submitted justifies the conclusion that he was a partner of the other defendants. The testimony of the defendant Parsons tending to prove such copartnership was admissible, because it corroborated the other testimony upon that question given in the plaintiffs\u2019 behalf. Standing alone, it would, perhaps, not have been sufficient, but was a strong link in the chain of evidence submitted by plaintiffs to prove affirmatively, by a preponderance of evidence, that issue, as they were required to do under the pleadings. The testimony also shows that this action was commenced within six years after the cause .of action herein accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The whole record, I think, shows that the case was fairly and fully tried, and that the verdict was justified by the evidence given to the jury; and we think no error was committed that should entitle the appellant to a new trial, and therefore the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
