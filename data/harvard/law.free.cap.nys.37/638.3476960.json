No questions other than those touching the negligence of the defendant and the contributory negligence of the plaintiff are-brought before us by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">The facts upon which the judgment is based are that the plaintiff was driving his vehicle, between 8:30 and 9 o\u2019clock in the evening of July 1, 1895, it being, at the time, quite dark; that the defendant was engaged, during the daytime, in repairing the side.wallts of the park, and had left piles of asphalt in the gutters of the roadway, at the locality of the accident, with a light upon each pile. The bank of sand and gravel, which caused the damage, had been deposited by the defendant midway between two piles of asphalt, each being 20 feet, respectively, from such bank; but the latter was about 4 feet from the gutter, and thus nearer the middle of the road than were the asphalt piles. This sand and gravel mound was, in appearance, like the bed of the road, and the plaintiff, proceeding in a line parallel with the lighted piles, drove upon it, without having any warning of his danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">We fail to find any reason for this appeal upon the facts, since the justice below could most properly find, from the evidence, that the defendant was negligent in its manner of maintaining the locality, thus rendered dangerous by the work in progress, and that the plaintiff used due care under the circumstances. There is no reason why the plaintiff\u2019s testimony in this case should not have been believed by the justice, and that testimony quite fairly shows an absence of any contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
