The sum in suit was discovered by the defendant lying in the safe in which his employer ordinarily kept articles of value to his business, the safe having been habitually maintained .unlocked at all times by the latter, who had asserted that he had \u201chonest people around here,\u201d alluding to the premises in which the business was conducted. The defendant notified his employer of the discovery of this money, which he had replaced in the portion of the safe where it had lain. Some days subsequently it was missing from the safe, and upon the defendant\u2019s failure to pay the equivalent over to the plaintiff upon a demand made after Whisten\u2019s death, this action was brought to charge the defendant either upon an admission of liability or for negligence as a bailee.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">With regard to the admission of liability there was a direct conflict of evidence, resolved, and not, as we may say, improperly, in the defendant\u2019s favor, but the plaintiff contends that there was negligence upon the defendant\u2019s part in that he did not bank the fund, rather than leave it as it was found in a receptacle which had neither an available combination lock nor a key. We are quite satisfied, however, with the manner in which the case was determined below. The defendant\u2019s duties, of course, called for ordinary care in preserving the fund in question, but that \u201cordinary care\u201d was the degree of caution which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under the existing circumstances, and no more. The presumption in favor of the performance of duty cast the burden of proof with regard to the defendant\u2019s negligence, his omission to exercise ordinary care, upon the plaintiff (Claflin v. Meyer, 75 N. Y. 260; Bailey, \u201cOnus Probandi,\u201d 31); and the record before us is destitute of all support in that respect. Here the defendant but followed in the footsteps of his employer, whom naturally he would imitate in the temporary conduct of the business devolving upon him. His employment would not ordinarily call for greater circumspection than the employer applied to the security of his possessions. ' We cannot infer from the record that the employer\u2019s sense of security was of a Utopian or eccentric character, because the evidence fails to apprise us that the premises in which the employer\u2019s business was conducted, and the safe contained, were more than ordinarily exposed to the successful efforts of persons affected with marauding proclivity. The deposit of the money in bank was but one of many means of securing the fund against theft, and it does not follow that the defendant was guilty of negligence because he did not resort to the particular means of security pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>ferred by the plaintiff, but, instead, followed the example of his employer. Without knowing more of the premises where the safe was contained than the plaintiff cared to show upon the trial, we cannot say that the defendant omitted the caution of an ordinarily prudent person, and so that, as matter of law, he was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">No exceptions were urged upon this appeal, and, upon the evidence, the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
