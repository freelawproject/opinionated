That the party of the second part will, at his own expense, manufacture and sell, and advertise largely the merits of, said belt, and will promptly fill all orders therefor, keeping accurate books of account, in which all manufacture and sale thereof shall be set down, with the prices realized, for the term of fifteen months from October 1, 1893, unless this agreement shall be canceled or abrogated as hereinafter set forth.

The complaint alleges, after setting up the contract between the parties, that the defendant has failed and refused to account or make payments under the contract, and continues and threatens to continue the manufacture and sales of the patented articles, in violation of the contract. On the trial, the principal controversy seems to have been as to whether or not the defendant was entitled to manufacture into certain skirt belts, known as the \u201cUniversal Skirt Belt,\u201d which was the patented article in question, certain elastic material which had been purchased by the defendant for the purpose of manufacturing the said belt. The court in its decision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">\u201cThe undisputed evidence shows that the total sales during the 15 months amounted to 187 gross and IIV12 dozen belts. On these the defendant paid the stipulated royalty, and, on the trial of the action, further accounted for his sales to and including the 30th day of April, 1895. On or about said last-mentioned date, the defendant had on hand 4727/! 2 dozen manufactured belts and 6,950 yards of elastic, purchased by him exclusively for the purpose of manufacturing said belt. There were no belts on hand on that date in an incomplete or partial state of manufacture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">The decision then states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-12\">\u201cPlaintiff contends that the defendant should be enjoined from manufacturing into belts any part of the elastic in question, which, she testifies, is equivalent to between 434 and 435 gross of belts. Defendant, on the other-hand, testifies that this elastic is within the purview of the terms of the agreement, relating to the sale of stock in process of manufacture, and that, as such, he should be permitted to manufacture the same into belts, and sell the same under said agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-13\">The decision then continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-14\">\u201cI am of the opinion that the contention of the defendant is right, and that he should be permitted to manufacture the elastic into belts, and dispose of the same under the agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-15\">It would thus appear that the defendant had accounted for the sales made by him under the agreement, and that the defendant was entitled to continue to manufacture the belts, or the elastic purchased by him into belts, and sell the same under the agreement. There is no evidence that the defendant intended or threatened to manufacture or sell any other belts, except from the elastic so purchased, and it would seem, from this decision, that no relief should have been grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ed to the plaintiff. Thus having decided the case in favor of the defendant, however, the court directs an injunction to be issued as prayed for in the complaint, the defendant, however, to have leave to sell all belts manufactured and on hand on May 1,1895, and also to manufacture into belts and sell all elastic which he had on hand on said date, on condition of his being permitted to sell and manufacture said belts and elastic, he to pay, in advance of such manufacture and sale, to the plaintiff, a royalty of three dollars per gross. Judgment was thereupon entered, requiring the defendant, within 90 days, to pay to the plaintiff, not only the royalty upon the belts manufactured and not sold, but also the royalty on all stock of manufactured belts, and of all elastic to be used in the manufacture of the said belts. The judgment further provided that, after the payment of the said royalty, and receipt thereof by the plaintiff, the defendant should be at liberty to sell and dispose of the belts in his possession on May 1, 1895, provided, however, said defendant should' sell and dispose of all said belts not later than the 1st day of May, 1897, from and after which date the judgment should become absolute and unconditional. And the judgment provided that the defendant, his servants, agents, and employ\u00e9s, and all persons acting in his behalf, be permanently enjoined and restrained from manufacturing and selling, or offering for sale, the belts described in the complaint. And this judgment was without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Thus it would seem that, after deciding all of the contested questions in favor of the defendant, a judgment was granted which enjoined the defendant from doing what he never intended, or threatened, or claimed he had a right to do, and added to the contract an entirely new clause, by which a time limit is added to the contract; and the defendant was enjoined from manufacturing and selling the belts after May 1, 1897, when, under the contract between the parties, there is no such limit. We think this judgment entirely unauthorized, and that, upon the decision of the court, there should have been judgment for the defendant. There is not a particle of evidence to justify any judgment against the defendant, adopting the decision of the controversy as to the right of the defendant to manufacture into belts the elastic purchased by him prior to the making of the agreement sued on. The plaintiff does not appeal from the decision of the question in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The judgment entered should therefore be reversed, and judgment directed for the defendant, with costs of the appeal only, in favor of the defendant, and against the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
