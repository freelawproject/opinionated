The plaintiff was awarded recovery of $20, and the judgment is assailed upon two grounds: Firstly, that, inasmuch as</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">it was undisputed that the plaintiff failed to give possession of the demised apartments upon the defendant\u2019s demand after the commencement of the term, and while the former occupant continued in possession, no recovery whatever should have been allowed; and, secondly, that an incorrect measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damages was applied. Neither ground is well taken. The controversy was to be determined by the rules of law which ordinarily prevail in the cases of contracts. The defendant\u2019s repudiation of the contract, though before the commencement of the term, constituted a breach of performance on his part, which entitled the plaintiff to maintain an action forthwith for the resulting damages. Howard v. Daly, 61 N. Y. 362. The case cited was one of a contract of service, but in principle it is not distinguishable from the one at bar. No sound reason caq be advanced why an employ\u00e9 should not be required to await his employer\u2019s change of mind while the lessor should be subject to the caprice of his lessee at the risk of being unable to let his premises to another after the time for the commencement of the term has arrived; and the principle laid down in Howard v. Daly was applied to -the case of a vendor and vendee, where it was held that the vendee\u2019s notice of his intention, before the time fixed for the delivery of the goods, not to accept them, entitled the vendor to treat the contract as broken, and to maintain an action for damages for such breach. Windmuller v. Pope (N. Y. Ct. App.) 14 N. E. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damages for the defendant\u2019s breach of contract was the rent reserved for the term, less the payment on account, and the amount received for the use and occupation of the demised premises during the term, from others. Gear, Landl. &amp; Ten. \u00a7 12; Cleveland v. Bryant, 16 S. C. 634. At the time of the trial in the case at bar the term had expired. It was not shown that the plaintiff occupied the demised apartments or otherwise derived any advantage therefrom during the term, and the recovery was limited to the balance of the rent which the defendant had agreed to pay. No error with regard to the computation of the damages awarded therefore appears. Bassett v. French, 10 Misc. Rep. 672, 31 N. Y. Supp. 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Obviously, the question which the defendant\u2019s counsel sought to raise upon the argument of this appeal\u2014whether, in the case of a lease of such short duration that the incoming lessee may not avail himself of existing remedies to secure possession from a third person wrongfully withholding it, before the expiration of his term, there is not imported into the contract an implied undertaking on the part of the lessor to deliver such possession, contrary to the rule adjudged in the case of a lease for a longer period (Insurance Co. v. Scott, <em>2 </em>Hilt. 550)\u2014is not presented by the facts determined upon the trial as they appear from the record. The contract of lease was terminated by the defendant\u2019s breach before the commencement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>term; and, should we assume the rule to be consistent with the contention of the defendant\u2019s counsel, it remains that it was optional with the plaintiff to waive the defendant\u2019s breach, and to reinstate the contract with its original effect. After a breach of the contract by one of the contracting parties, it is not competent for him to place the other, whose performance was prevented by the breach, in default, by a tender of performance. Windmuller v. Pope, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
