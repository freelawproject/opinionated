It appears, from the undisputed evidence, that up to about December, 1890, the defendants were copartners in business, and that subsequently the defendants William H. Gedney and son, with the knowledge of his codefendant herein, and under the firm name, conducted the business transactions in question by permitting the old firm name to be so used by Wiliam A. Gedney; and, business under said firm name being carried on as usual, William H. Gedney, the retired partner, is estopped from denying such co-partnership. It was his duty to see that William A. Gedney ceased using the old firm name, and ceased doing business under that name. His failure to do so precludes him from denying the copartnership, and he must suffer the result of his own negligence or indifference. The plaintiff was certainly justified in assuming that existence of such copartnership. Norquist v. Dalton (City Ct. N. Y.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 351; Dreher v. Connolly, 16 Daly, 106, 9 N. Y. Supp. 635. Besides, the case fails to contain the statement that all the evidence is contained therein. We must, therefore, assume that sufficient evidence of the copartnership in question was submitted, and for that reason the ruling of the trial justice above referred to was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The judgment must be sustained, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
