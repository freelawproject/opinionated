Under the issue so framed, the plaintiff was required to prove that he' sold and delivered the goods in question to the defendant. The entire testimony shows that he did not do so, and could not have done so, for the simple reason that the defendant was not incorporated until several months after such sale and delivery. Evidently, the sale was made to Mr. Nelke, who did business under the name of the Nelke Company, even, perhaps, under a name like defendant\u2019s name; but that fact would not entitle him to judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff is correct in his contention that he is not required to, prove the defendant\u2019s incorporation, because defendant did not specifically deny its incorporation. He was, nevertheless, under the issues framed, as before stated, required to prove a sale and delivery of the goods to the defendant corporation. The justice who tried this case dismissed the complaint because of .plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove such sale and delivery to defendant, and he was right in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-16\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
