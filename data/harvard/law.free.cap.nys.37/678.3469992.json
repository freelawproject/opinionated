The mere fact of the overflow established no wrong against the defendant. Spencer v. McManus, 82 Hun, 318, 31 N. Y. Supp. 185; Clarke v. Anderson, 2 City Ct. R 115, 229; Loeber v. Roberts (Super. N. Y.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 378, affirmed 138 N. Y. 606, 33 N. E. 1082; Bernhard v. Reeves (Wash.) 33 Pac. 873. The plaintiff was bound to go further, and establish that the overflow was caused by some negligence on\u2018the part of the defendant; and this he failed to do. He undertook to show that the cause of the damage was a leak in a pump supplying the closet on defendant\u2019s loft with water, but the preponderance of evidence establishes that the cause was a hole made in the pipe during the night by rats,\u2014a thing which, according to the plumber\u2019s testimony, occasionally happens in such cases. The water rushed out of this hole (which was under the floor) with force, and as soon as the plumber soldered it the trouble practically ceased,\u2014a circumstance which makes defendant\u2019s theory significant, if not almost incontrovertible. The dripping from the pump continued, but no damage came from it, as the quantity was to small to do harm. The defendant inspected his premises before he left them for the evening, and found nothing out of order. It does not appear that he omitted any precaution that a reasonably discreet man would have adopted. There is certainly no evidence establishing negligence, the gravamen of the plaintiff\u2019s case. The damage evidently came from a cause unexpected, and not generally guarded against even by prudent persons. It follows that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All \u2022 concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
