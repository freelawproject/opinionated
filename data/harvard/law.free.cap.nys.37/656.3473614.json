Failing to record above saving, machine to be removed at your expense. S. G. Bayne.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The burden of proving performance of the condition that the governor would demonstrate, after 30 days\u2019 fair trial, a saving of from 15 to 40 per cent, in the consumption of gas, rested upon the plaintiff. Governor Co. v. Glenby, 4 Misc. Rep. 532, 24 N. Y. Supp. 575. Mr. O\u2019Keefe, an employ\u00e9 of the plaintiff, testified that he tested the governor, ,and that it effected a saving of 32 per cent.; and Mr. Patterson, who is also connected with the plaintiff, testified that the defendant Samuel G. Bayne told him he was perfectly satisfied with the work of the governor, and that the company was not notified to take it away. On the other hand, the defendant Sam-uel G. Bayne testified that he never expressed himself satisfied with the governor; that it impaired the quality of the light, which was not as good after the governor was put on as it had been previously. In short, he contended that the only effect of the govern- or was to check the pressure of the gas, and that any saving accomplished resulted from the want of that quantity and brilliancy of light which he had theretofore enjoyed. The plaintiff was never officially notified of any imperfection in the governor, or called upon to take it away; and, so far as the return discloses, it is still in use by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The action, though nominally brought against Mr. Bayne and his wife, was treated throughout as a litigation against him alone. He was the only one served with process, and judgment was not entered against her. No motion was made to dismiss the action against the wife, and she was practically regarded as being out of the case; so that there is nothing to review as against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">The issue narrowed itself down to a question of fact, which the justice decided upon conflicting evidence; and, while we might have reached a different conclusion, it does not follow that the justice erred. The judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
