There can be no question as to the value of the services in suit, since the defendant himself admitted in court that their value was in the amount above stated; but the appeal is based upon the claim that the defendant, in making the contract for the work, acted as agent for a corporation, and that the weight of the evidence is in his favor upon this defense. A consideration of the record makes it apparent, however, that there was merely a conflict of evidence touching this point, and the probabilities are not against the plaintiffs\u2019 positive evidence that the defendant acted as an individual, pledging his own credit, in the course of the transaction. It may be, as contended, that the plaintiffs had reason to be cognizant of the claim that the defendant was acting as agent; but this was subsequent to the contract and performance, if at all, and the plaintiffs were not restricted to an action against the concealed principal, when finally discovered. The question of the weight of evidence must be resolved impartially by the appellate court, and cannot be determined merely as a reflection of the appellant\u2019s reliance upon the value of his allegations and proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
