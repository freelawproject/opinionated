The plaintiff cannot know the facts on. this head, nor has he the means of readily proving them. The d\u00e9fendant, of course, knows just when and where the productions in question were given. If the plaintiff is right in lys general contention, he will be entitled to the specific sum of $50 per week for-every week during which the defendant produced other adaptations of the pieces already adapted by plaintiff\u2019s assignor under the contracts sued upon. The examination should, however, be limited to this one specific subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">The order appealed from should be modified so far as to require the examination of the defendant upon the point indicated, and, as. modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">INGRAHAM, J., taking no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
