The first paragraph of the complaint contains an allegation of the mutual promises of marriage, \u201con request,\u201d made by plaintiff and defendant. .The second paragraph alleges the readiness and willingness of the plaintiff to fulfill her promise. The fifth paragraph alleges a request made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>by plaintiff on defendant to fulfill Ms promise, and Ms refusal to comply, and consequent' breach of his promise. These allegations make a good complaint of a cause of action of \u201cbreach of promise of marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The allegations in paragraphs 3 and 4 are set up in aggravation of damages. Wells v. Padgett, 8 Barb. 323. They do not constitute a cause of action in plaintiff \u201cfor seduction\u201d; because a person seduced cannot maintain an action for seduction. Hamilton v. Lomax, 26 Barb. 615. She can only maintain an action for personal injury when a rape has been committed upon her, and that action is given her by statute. Koenig v. Nott, 8 Abb. Prac. 384, 388. The complaint contains but one cause of action. It follows, therefore, that the order appealed from must be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer overruled, with costs, and leave is given to defendant to answer plaintiff\u2019s complaint within six days after service of the order to be entered on this appeal, on payment of said costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
