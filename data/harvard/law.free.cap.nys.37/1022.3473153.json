They also believed that he was the person who procured Drabble Bros, to purchase goods from the defendants to the extent of $60,000, which entitled him to the verdict rendered. There is ample testimony to sustain these beliefs of the jury, and, besides, we think the record shows that the plaintiff was equitably entitled to the commission on the sales made by defendants to said firm of Drabble Bros., because they never were customers of defendants\u2019 firm until after their orders were solicited by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-21\">We find no error in the printed record, and the judgment is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
