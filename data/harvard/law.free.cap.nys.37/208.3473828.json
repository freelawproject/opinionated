The defendant moved upon the merits to vacate said attachment, and the questions of fact were sent to a referee to hear and determine. He reported in favor of the defendant, vacating the attachment, and his report was duly confirmed, with $10 costs and $660 disbursements, the latter being the referee\u2019s and stenographer\u2019s fees; and from the order so made, this appeal is taken. The special term justice certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>had the right to refer the disputed questions of fact upon the motion in question to a referee for his determination. See section 3172. Code Civ. Proc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to the referee\u2019s and stenographer\u2019s fees, it was agreed between the attorneys for the plaintiff and the defendant that the successful party upon the reference would pay the same, and, having done so, it was proper to enter in the order such fees, and tax the same against the unsuccessful party. The referee was right in vacating the attachment, as the testimony certainly shows that the plaintiff failed to sustain the charge made against the defendant, and upon which he received the attachment, and the order appealed from, therefore, is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-17\"> Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3172, is as follows: \u201cThe court may, of its own motion, or upon the \"application of either party, without the consent of the other, by order, direct a reference, to determine and report upon a question of fact, arising upon a motion, in any stage of an action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
