Upon the occurrence of that event, said chattel mortgage was to be redelivered to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor. It would thus appear that said mortgage never had a legal existence, and therefore the provision in the policy of insurance herein sued upon was never violated. There is ample \u2022evidence in plaintiff\u2019s behalf that would justify the jury in finding that said instrument was not to have legal vitality unless said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>indorsed notes were not delivered as agreed upon; that it was merely delivered in escrow, and subsequently became a nullity, because of the compliance by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor with the condition just mentioned. I think it was proper to allow- the testimony which was objected to by the defendant\u2019s attorney, showing that the chattel mortgage was delivered in escrow, as in no other way could that fact be proven. The jury having so determined the question just mentioned,\u2014i. e. that the mortgage was held in escrow, and subsequently became a nullity, as above shown,\u2014their verdict was certainly justified by the evidence, which would have entitled them to find in even a larger amount in plaintiff\u2019s favor. Defendant\u2019s appeal (judging from its brief) seems to be based upon the theory that a reversal should be had herein because the insured property became incumbered by a chattel mortgage while insured. As we have pointed out, the jury must have determined under the judge\u2019s charge, as before stated, that the insured never has so incumbered, and thus it appears to us that the jury found exactly contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, and they had a right to so do under the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">We have carefully read over the appeal record, and, in our judgment, it shows no error that would justify us in reversing the judgment; and it is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
