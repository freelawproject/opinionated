Jones appeals from his sentence for bank robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. While fleeing from the bank robbery, Jones fired his gun at the pursuing police officers, one of whom was injured by glass from the windshield, which had been shattered by Jones\u2019 bullets. Based on this event, Jones was given a two-level sentence enhancement for causing bodily injury to a victim, pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A), as well as a three-level enhancement for assaulting an official victim, pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 3A1.2(b). As a result, Jones was sentenced to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment for the bank robbery count and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutively, for the firearm count. For the following reasons, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>On appeal, Jones argues that the imposition of both enhancements for the same conduct against the same victim constituted impermissible double-counting. We review the application of the Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 432 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">Whether the imposition of both \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A) and 3A1.2(b) for a single victim constitutes double-counting is an issue of first impression in this circuit. However, the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have both held that such an action does not constitute double-counting, because each enhancement applies to different aspects of the same conduct. <em>See United States v. Swoape, </em>31 F.3d 482, 483 (7th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Muhammad, </em>948 F.2d 1449, 1458 (6th Cir.1991). In addition, the Guidelines section entitled, \u201cQuestions Most Frequently Asked About the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d contains a hypothetical scenario identical to the instant ease, and concludes that both enhancements may be applied because the assaultive behavior against the police officer, as punished by \u00a7 3A1.2, is not specifically incorporated into \u00a7 2B3.1. U.S.S.G.App. E., no. 54 (Nov. 1995) (citing Muhammad). However, as stated by the disclaimer, this Guidelines section is merely instructive and is not meant to be binding on the courts. <em>Id. </em>at cover; <em>see United States v. Parks, </em>924 F.2d 68, 73-74 (referring to Questions Most Frequently Asked About the Sentencing Guidelines section as \u201cadvisory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">This court has held that \u201cdouble counting is prohibited only if the particular guidelines at issue forbid it.\u201d <em>United States v. Morris, </em>131 F.3d 1136, 1139-40 (5th Cir.1997) (citation omitted) (noting that \u00a7 2A2.2 of the Guidelines does not expressly prohibit double-counting), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 1546, 140 L.Ed.2d 694; <em>see also United States v. Box, </em>50 F.3d 345, 359 (5th Cir.1995). As the Guidelines do not specifically prohibit double-counting in regards to the imposition of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A) and \u00a7 3A1.2(b), we need not decide whether the imposition of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A) and \u00a7 3A1.2(b) for a single act against a single victim constitutes double-counting, for even if this were true, such double-counting would be permissible under the Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court did not err in applying both guidelines in Jones\u2019 sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">. This conclusion was also reached by the Fourth Circuit, which reasoned that, even if the imposition of \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A) and 3A1.2(b) for a single victim constituted double-counting, it was nonetheless permissible because it was not specifically prohibited by the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Livingston, </em>56 F.3d 62, 1995 WL 318592, at **2 (4th Cir.1995) (unpublished opinion); <em>United States v. Latimer, </em>46 F.3d 1128, 1995 WL 19342, at **2-3 (4th Cir.1995) (unpublished opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
