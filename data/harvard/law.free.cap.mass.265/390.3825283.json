The case was referred to a master. There were no exceptions to his comprehensive report, which supported in the main the allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s bill. In the absence of a full report of the evidence, these findings must be accepted as true and must be the basis of the final decree, unless on their face they are inconsistent, or contradictory, or substantially incomplete as to essential issues. <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Waltham, Laundry Co. </em>235 Mass. 330, 334. <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>National Shawmut Bank, </em>263 Mass. 505, 511. <em>DeVeer </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>222 Mass. 167, 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">An interlocutory decree was entered confirming the master\u2019s report. Thereafter, on May 9, 1928, an order was entered for a final decree specifying its terms in adequate detail. Seven days later, on May 16, 1928, an appeal from this order was filed by the defendant. Three days after that, on May 19,1928, a final decree was entered conforming to the terms of the order. No appeal has been taken from that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">It is contended by the defendant that facts exist which are the equivalent of such appeal. These facts are that the counsel of record for the defendant wrote to the clerk of courts a letter dated May 17,1928, received on the following day, asking for an estimate of the expense of preparing the papers for appeal, \u201cso that I may forward to you this amount.\u201d Reply conveying the requested information was sent on May 21, 1928. The defendant himself, on June 6, 1928, sent to the clerk of courts a check for the stated sum, together with a letter referring to the case by name and saying that the money was sent \u201cto cover expense of printing the record for the appeal brought by me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">It is assumed in favor of the defendant, but without so deciding, that these letters, although not embodied in a report made by the judge or in the bill of exceptions, may be considered. See \u201cGeneral Rule as to the Records of the Supreme Judicial and the Superior Courts\u201d, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 7, 11, printed on pages 60, 61, 64 of 1926 Rules of the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Judicial Court and in 252 Mass. 613, 614, 615. See <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Musterole Co. Inc. </em>235 Mass. 587, 589; <em>Montague </em>v. <em>Silsbee, </em>218 Mass. 107, 111; <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>236 Mass. 556, 561; <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>239 Mass. 443, 445; <em>Pizer </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>253 Mass. 321, 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">It is plain that the only appeal taken by the defendant was from the order and not from the final decree. The letter of the defendant to the clerk of courts enclosing a check cannot be treated as an appeal from the final decree. It is neither in form nor in substance an appeal from the final decree. It refers in specific terms to \u201cthe appeal brought by me.\u201d The only appeal susceptible of being so described is the appeal filed on May 16 from the order for a final decree. That was the only appeal ever \u201cbrought\u201d or filed by the defendant. It could not apply to a final decree entered on a later date. <em>Martin\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. 402, 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The plaintiff on June 29, 1928, filed a motion to dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal from the order for a final decree on the ground that the defendant had failed to enter and prosecute an appeal from the final decree. A decree was entered denying this motion. The plaintiff excepted to the denial of this motion. The question thus is raised whether the case is rightly before us on appeal from the order for final decree which specified the terms of the final decree in adequate terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The order for a final decree was not in itself a final disposition of the case. <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>239 Mass. 443, 445. It is the general rule that \u201cSuits in equity are not properly before this court as of right upon any appeal except from a final decree.\u201d <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>212 Mass. 118, 120. <em>Forbes </em>v. <em>Tuckerman, </em>115 Mass. 115, 118, 119. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>165 Mass. 1. <em>Worcester Board of Health </em>v. <em>Tupper, </em>210 Mass. 378, 380. <em>Romanausky </em>v. <em>Skutulas, </em>258 Mass. 190, 192, and cases cited. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">That general rule, however, was changed by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 96, 144. By \u00a7 96 it was provided amongst other matters that \u201ca party aggrieved ... by any order decisive of the case founded upon matter of law apparent on the record in any proceeding, may appeal therefrom to the Supreme Judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>cial Court.\u201d Section 96 was by \u00a7 144 expressly made applicable to proceedings in equity. An order for final decree of the tenor here in question was in substance and effect an order within the descriptive words already quoted from \u00a7 96. It was a ruling of law as to the decree to which the plaintiff was entitled upon the facts found by the master. It follows that the defendant rightly could appeal from such an order, and, since the case was, pursuant to a further provision of \u00a7 96, \u201cin all other respects ripe for final disposition by the Superior Court,\u201d he could enter the case in this court. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>257 Mass. 166, 170. See <em>Samuel </em>v. <em>Page-Storms Drop Forge Co. </em>243 Mass. 133, 134. The whole question at issue between the parties may be determined on this record. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 124. It follows that the judge rightly refused to dismiss the appeal and the plaintiff\u2019s, exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The general equity practice to the effect that equity cases can come before this court as of right only by appeal from a final decree has been restored by St. 1928, c. 306. See Third Report of Judicial Council, pages 64, 65. That act, however, is not applicable to the case at bar because by its express terms it did not become operative until September 1, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The findings of the master in substance were that the land of the defendant is somewhat higher than that of the plaintiff; that there is a retaining wall on land of the defendant built partly of loose stones, no part of which at its base is on the plaintiff\u2019s land, but the stones of which in some portions are bulged and overhang land of the plaintiff and some of the stones become loose from time to time and fall on the land of the plaintiff; that the defendant maintains the roof or roofs of buildings without eaves troughs, so that rain water and snow collected thereby fall on the top of the wall or a few inches from the plaintiff\u2019s land and run onto it and in some instances fall directly upon his land, and that some rain water or water from melting snow is collected by eaves troughs from other parts of the defendant\u2019s buildings and deposited on the ground a few feet from the plaintiff\u2019s line and spreads in a fan shape, and flows with the natural slope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>of the ground toward the top of the wall, whence some of it goes over the face of the wall and the rest seeps through its stones onto the plaintiff\u2019s land; and that water flowing into the cellars of the plaintiff\u2019s houses comes from land of the defendant, except the natural fall of rain and snow upon the land of the plaintiff. The plain inference from the master\u2019s findings is that by far the larger part of the water flowing into the cellars of the plaintiff\u2019s houses comes from surface water artificially collected by the defendant so near the boundary line that it would inevitably flow upon the plaintiff\u2019s land. If such water is collected and deposited so near as inevitably to run upon the land of the plaintiff, that constitutes a tort; it need not be directly upon his land to give rise to a cause of action. It is not necessary further to summarize findings of the master. They are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has suffered damages from the tortious conduct of the defendant. The case at bar falls within the authority of numerous decisions. <em>Field </em>v. <em>Gowdy, </em>199 Mass. 568. <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>203 Mass. 528. <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>233 Mass. 147. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Andreson, </em>257 Mass. 107. <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>258 Mass. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">No error of law is apparent in the assessment of damages. That was a pure question of fact when once it was established that by tortious acts of the defendant water flowed upon premises of the plaintiff and into the cellars of his houses. The circumstance that possibly other causes beside the conduct of the defendant may have contributed in some part to the plaintiff\u2019s injury is not decisive on this record. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>American Woolen Co. </em>195 Mass. 591, 603, and cases collected. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Royal Worcester Corset Co. </em>200 Mass. 1. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Andreson, </em>257 Mass. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\n<em>Order for final decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
