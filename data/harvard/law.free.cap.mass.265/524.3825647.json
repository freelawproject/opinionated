The amusement company admitted that coal was being delivered to it to fill an order previously given, and that the company furnished heat for the entire building. The coal company admitted that the wagon with the load of coal in question at the time of the accident was owned by it, and that delivery was being made by its driver. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, each defendant filed a motion for a directed verdict. The motions were allowed subject to the exceptions of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The amusement company had a right to make a reasonable use of the street adjoining its land so long as it did not unnecessarily obstruct or render it unsafe for public travel. <em>O\u2019Linda </em>v. <em>Lothrop, </em>21 Pick. 292. <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Carney, </em>1 Cush. 285. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>183 Mass. 27, 28. The delivery of coal across a sidewalk by means of a chute, as in this case, with nothing to show that it has taken an unreasonable time, is only a mere temporary inconvenience to travellers and hence not an unlawful occupation of the way; nor does it constitute a nuisance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>14 Gray, 69, 75. <em>Lorenzo </em>v. <em>Wirth, </em>170 Mass. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">There is no evidence to show that either defendant was responsible for the presence of snow and ice in the street where the plaintiff fell. <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Boylston Market Associatian, </em>14 Gray, 249,252. <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>McKeagney, </em>229 Mass. 300. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>235 Mass. 243. <em>Robrish </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>252 Mass. 92. We need not decide whether the ordinance was properly admitted in evidence. If it was competent and was violated by the defendant coal company, such violation would not be evidence of liability in either of these actions. The plaintiff\u2019s injury was due to slipping and falling upon ice in the street. It is plain that a violation of the ordinance was not the direct and proximate cause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>accident. It had no causal connection with the injury sustained by the plaintiff. <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Boylston Market Association, supra. Glassey </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>185 Mass. 315, 316. <em>Dahlin </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>192 Mass. 163. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>John L.
