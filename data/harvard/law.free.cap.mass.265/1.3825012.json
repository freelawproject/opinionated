There was evidence that the defendant might reasonably have ascertained the defect and remedied it by the use of reasonable diligence, and that the plaintiff was in the exercise of proper care. The plaintiff was injured on August 21, 1925. The written notice to the defendant accurately described the place and cause of the injury, but stated that the accident happened on August 12,1925. The defendant moved for a directed verdict; the motion was denied and the defendant excepted. The jury found for the plaintiff. The judge reserved leave under the statute to enter a verdict for the defendant. The judge ordered the verdict for the plaintiff to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Under G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 18, a person who suffers injury by reason of a defect in a public way, in order to recover damages, must give notice to the county, city, town or person by law required to keep the way in repair, of the time, place and cause of the injury. It is provided in this section that the notice shall not be invalid solely by reason of any inaccuracy in stating the time, place, or cause of the injury, if it is shown that there was no intention to mislead and that the party entitled to notice was not in fact misled thereby. The defendant does not contend that there was any intention to mislead. In his charge to the jury the judge said: \u201cNow as to the question of the intent to mislead, I understand that the defendant makes no question; that there was no intent to mislead.\u201d This statement was not excepted to, the defendant\u2019s contention being that there was no evidence that the officers of the town who were entitled to notice under the statute were not in fact misled by the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">There was evidence that the superintendent of streets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>who testified that his duty as such officer was to supervise construction and maintenance of sidewalks under the direction of the road commissioners, saw the alleged defect on August 18,1925, and, within a few days after the plaintiff was injured, he learned \u201cThat Mrs. Ferguson fell down opposite the store in a hole in the sidewalk.\u201d He testified: \u201cI think I informed the road commissioners\u201d of the fact \u201cat the next meeting.\u201d One of the street commissioners testified that on August 17 he received information of the defect in the sidewalk. On this evidence the jury would be warranted in finding that \u201cthe party entitled to notice was not in fact misled \u201d by the inaccuracy in the time of the accident as given in the notice. The existence of the defect was known by the officials of the town before the plaintiff was hurt, and the superintendent of streets knew within a day or two after the accident the place where it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The defendant argues that the \u201cparty entitled to notice\u201d was the \u201cselectmen, town treasurer, or town clerk,\u201d and as there was no evidence that the information received by the superintendent of streets, of the time when the- accident occurred, was communicated to the town treasurer, town clerk, or any member of the board of selectmen, or that they had any notice of the time except as contained in the written notice, there was no evidence to show that the \u201cparty entitled to notice\u201d was not in fact misled by the statement in the notice that the accident was on August 12, 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The knowledge of the time when the plaintiff was injured was known to the superintendent of streets; he also knew of the defect before she was injured. It was said in <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>154 Mass. 520 at page 523, that knowledge of the existence of a defect by a city\u2019s superintendent of streets is the city\u2019s knowledge. In <em>Naze </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>250 Mass. 368, it appeared that the place where the accident occurred was shown to the defendant\u2019s superintendent of streets soon after the plaintiff was injured; it was decided that a verdict for the defendant could not be directed on the ground that the notice was insufficient, citing <em>Conners </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>158 Mass. 336, <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Hyde Park, </em>162 Mass. 51, <em>Carberry </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>166 Mass. 32, <em>Winship </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>201 Mass. 273. It could be found as a fact that a town required by law to keep its highways in a reasonably safe condition for public travel is not in fact misled as to the time of an accident when its superintendent of streets had information of the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury within a day or two after its occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
