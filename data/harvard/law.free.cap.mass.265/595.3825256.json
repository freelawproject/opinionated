One of the documents is called a \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>lease \u201d and provided for the conditional sale of the sedan to the plaintiff at the price of $3,136. The other documents are the \u201ccontract\u201d and a note for $1,936. The paper spoken of as the \u201ccontract\u201d contained a stipulation that a coupe automobile would be taken in trade, for which there was to be credited to the plaintiff $1,200; \u201cNotice of 30 days to be given Mr. Skilton before we take the car.\u201d The lease did not contain such a provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The master found that after the parties had signed the paper called the \u201ccontract\u201d and before the \u201clease\u201d was signed, the plaintiff\u2019s agent directed the defendant\u2019s attention to the fact that the \u201clease\u201d did not mention that the coupe was to be taken and a credit of $1,200 given; that thereupon the defendant\u2019s agent said that for purposes of banking and discounting \u201csaid note the defendant could not have said clause in the Tease.\u2019 \u201d The master also found that the plain-. tiff\u2019s agent objected to signing the \u201clease\u201d unless it was understood that the \u201ccontract\u201d governed, and upon being assured that it did, the plaintiff\u2019s agent signed the \u201clease\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>and note; that the defendant has never given the plaintiff thirty days\u2019 notice of its intention to take the coupe; that on November 1, 1927, the plaintiff did not tender payment on the note, the defendant having notified her, on October 10, that it refused to take the coupe automobile; and that on December 6 the defendant replevied the sedan.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\">In the Superior Court a decree was entered requiring the defendant to deliver the sedan to the plaintiff, and directing the plaintiff to deliver to the defendant the coupe mentioned in the \u201ccontract\u201d and to pay the defendant $736, and interest; the defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff $300 as damages, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The three documents were executed together as parts of the same transaction. They may all be considered in determining the real contract of the parties; and the stipulation in one of the papers, that the coupe was to be taken in trade and credited to the plaintiff at $1,200, was as much a part of the contract as it would be if the entire contract were written on one piece of paper. <em>Payson </em>v. <em>Lamson, </em>134 Mass. 593. <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>48 Fed. Rep. 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The defendant replevied the sedan and we understand that this action is now pending. But it is not argued by the defendant that the action at law is a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s relief in equity, and the defendant went to trial without raising this question. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Annelin, </em>228 Mass. 591. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Grow, ante, </em>578.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Apparently the contention of the defendant is that the \u201clease\u201d and \u201ccontract\u201d were separate contracts; that the \u201clease\u201d and note control; that the paper called the \u201ccontract\u201d was of no effect. What has been said disposes of this argument. The findings of the master show that the three documents were parts of the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
