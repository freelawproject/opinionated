In the counts charging assault it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>alleged it was by force likely to produce great bodily injury. At the first trial of the charges the jury disagreed. At the second trial with a jury defendant was acquitted of the offenses charged in counts I, II, IV, and V and convicted of the offense charged in Count III. He appeals from the judgment and the order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Defendant is the husband of Trinidad Vera. Celia and Jessie Sanchez are Trinidad\u2019s children by a prior marriage. Celia was 9% and Jessie 12 years of age at the times in question. Defendant, Trinidad, Celia, Jessie, and six children of defendant and Trinidad lived together in Norwalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Prior to the present prosecution Trinidad had been convicted by a jury of having assaulted Celia by inflicting injury to various parts of her body by use of a garden hose. At the trial of that charge Celia and Jessie testified it was their mother, Trinidad, who had beaten Celia with a rubber hose. Defendant also so testified at that trial. After Trinidad had been convicted of that and other offenses, defendant was charged with the offenses noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">At the trial of the present case Trinidad testified against defendant. On direct examination she testified that on one occasion in 1954 defendant had hit Celia on the head and on the side of the shoulders with a long stick; he had hit Celia \u201ca lot of times\u201d on the back and \u201call over the body\u201d with a rubber hose; on more than one occasion he had twisted Celia\u2019s arm. She also testified that at the time she was arrested she told the police she was the only one who had hit Celia, that she had beaten her with a rubber hose for two or three months before her arrest; she had lmocked Celia\u2019s teeth out, causing her to bleed, and had opened a wound in her scalp with the rubber hose; she had burned her with an iron, broken her arm, and bitten her nails off. She also had told the police at that time that defendant had not done any of these things\u2014that she alone \u201chad been responsible for all the beatings.\u201d She testified at the trial of the present case that she had lied to the police at that time. She had been confined about eight months in a state institution for women at the time she testified at the latter trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">On cross-examination Trinidad testified she heard defendant testify against her at her preliminary hearing; she \u201cwasn\u2019t mad\u201d at him after she heard him testify; during the trial of the ease against her she had not said that if she ever got her hands on defendant she would kill him; she asked \u201cto come in to testify against him\u201d; about two weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>before she testified an officer told her she did not have to testify against him if she did not want to; she wanted to testify against him. Trinidad further testified that the first time after her arrest she told anybody that defendant had been inflicting injuries on Celia was at her preliminary hearing; she told the policewoman who took her there.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On redirect examination Trinidad testified this was not the first time she ever told anyone defendant had struck Celia; at her preliminary hearing she told Officers Uttke and Earner that defendant \u201chad also hit Celia\u201d; she talked to a public defender before her preliminary hearing; she had no objection to the public defender disclosing any information she related to him. Whereupon the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u201cQ. By Mb. Busch : Mrs. Vera, this conversation that you had with Josephine Uttke and Mrs., or Miss Earner, on April 28, 1954, was that before Joe Vera testified against you at the preliminary hearing? A. To be honest, I don\u2019t remember whether it was before or after.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u201cQ. Do you recall whether or not your preliminary hearing was on May 6th, 1954 ? A. I know it was in May, but I don\u2019t remember the date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u201cQ. And was the conversation that you had with your lawyer, was that before Mr. Vera testified against you in the preliminary, or testified in the preliminary hearing. A. No, because I talked to him before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">\u201cQ. You talked to the lawyer before Mr. Vera testified? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">\u201cMb. Marcus: Your Honor, may my objection be noted to this entire line of interrogation at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">\u201cThe Court: So far as relates to subject matter as to statements made in the past on the same subject matter, I think it all comes within the rule as to, let\u2019s call it rehabilitation. If there is any additional objection, why you can introduce it as we go along.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">\u201cGo ahead. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-14\">\u20181Q. By Mr. Busch : Did you have a conversation with your attorney, the Public Defender, before the preliminary, wherein you discussed whether or not Joe Vera hit Celia? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-15\">\u201cQ. And did you have a conversation with your attorney before the preliminary hearing wherein it was discussed whether or not Celia had ever complained to you that Joe Vera had molested her? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">On recross-examination Trinidad testified that at her preliminary hearing she told the public defender defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\u201chad committed the act upon Celia\u201d; she realized then \u201cthat the promise Mr. Vera had made me to get me an attorney had turned me down. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">; As part of the People\u2019s case in chief, after Trinidad had testified, Josephine Uttke, a deputy sheriff, over objection, was permitted to testify that when Trinidad saw defendant in the courtroom before her preliminary hearing she said, \u201c \u2018You\u2019know, he\u2019s responsible for most of this.\u2019 And I said, \u2018What do you mean by that?\u2019 She said, \u2018He tried to molest \u2022her.\u2019 And, when she told me about it, which is referring to Celia, she said, \u2018 Since then, he has been very mean to her, and he has\"beat her up as much as I have.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, you think he\u2019s responsible for this, too?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Yes, I do.\u2019 \u201d In the presence of Sergeant Earner, another deputy sheriff, Trinidad said, \u201c \u2018My husband Joe is responsible as much for this as I am. He tried to molest the girl, and she told me it, and since then, he has been very mean and vicious to her, and he has beat her up as much as I have. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Sergeant Earner, also over objection, testified, \u201cI asked Mrs. Vera what it was she wanted to talk to me about, and she told me that she hadn\u2019t told us the whole truth, that Joe was responsible for part of Celia\u2019s injuries. I asked her was [sic] he had done, and she said, well, he had mistreated \u25a0Celia the same as she had, and I asked her how it had come about. She said that Celia had told her that Joe had molested her, and after that Joe had started whipping her and using the hose on her. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t told us that before. She said because she was afraid of him, and because he had told her that, due to his previous record, it would go harder on him. I told her to be sure that she told her attorney about\" that, and that was about the sum and substance of the conversation, because right after that her Public Defender, wanted to talk to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The deputy public defender who represented Trinidad at her preliminary hearing testified, over objection, that prior to that hearing Trinidad told him'defendant had struck Celia with a rubber hose, injuring her' eye, breaking her nose, and knocking - out two .of her upper ineis\u00f3rs, and \u201cshe also said that about a week prior to her arrest that she had the feeling that Joe was concerned about the possibility of Celia\u2019s condition being discovered, and told her at that time that if any arrest were made, that she should take the full responsibility, that because of his prior record- things would be much hotter for him than for her if he were arrested ;\u25a0 and that1 if it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>occur he would get a lawyer for her, and see that she was taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The only assignment of error is that the court erred in permitting Trinidad to testify to her conversations with Officers Uttke and Earner and the public defender and in permitting them to testify to those conversations.' '</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">We are' compelled to hold the court did not err 'in admitting the testimony. The \u25a0 precise question was decided adversely to defendant\u2019s contention by the Supreme Court in the recent case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>47 Cal.2d 36 [301 P.2d 247], a prosecution for bribery. The court declared (pp. 40-43):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">\u201cThe defendants next urge that the court committed prejudicial error in admitting certain evidence claimed to be self-serving and hearsay. The contention arises out of attempts by the prosecution to rehabilitate their witnesses Stubblefield and Griffin. On cross-examination of these witnesses the defendants attempted to show that their testimony might have been fabricated and that they might have been biased and prejudiced towards the defendants. On redirect examination of the witness Stubblefield, the prosecution was allowed, over objection, to introduce certain prior consistent statements of the witness for rehabilitating his testimony. The court at that time instructed the jury that the evidence was being admitted not to prove the truth of the statements but for the limited purpose of refuting any suggestions or inferences that the witness had \u2018fabricated\u2019 his testimony at the trial or that his testimony had been actuated by \u25a0 bias or ulterior motives. The rehabilitating evidence showed that Stubblefield had placed an endorsement on the back of the $125 check before he cashed it, reading \u2018paid Vince Walsh $125.00 for fixing job 38 &amp; Pacific, San Pedro job.\u2019 Also evidence was introduced to the effect- that Stubblefield had, on a prior occasion, told his general contractor that he had paid the inspector $125 to clear the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">\u201cLikewise there was an attempt on cross-examination to impeach the testimony of the prosecution\u2019s witness Griffin and to show a recent fabrication on his part. As rehabilitating evidence, after such cross-examination, the prosecution introduced a check stub made out by Griffin at the time he wrote the $50 check with the notation thereon \u201cL.A. City Inst. Pay-off $50.00,\u2019 and he was allowed to explain that \u2018Inst.\u2019 meant \u2018Inspector.\u2019 Also, a store clerk who had cashed \u2022the check testified that Griffin had remarked at the time that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>it was for the purpose of a pay-off. Again, the jury was admonished by the court that this evidence was admitted for the limited purpose of \u2018refuting the suggestions or inferences, if any, that this witness had beforehand or at the trial fabricated his testimony, or that his testimony was actuated by bias or ulterior motives, and it is introduced and received into evidence to prove the state of mind of this witness on a date prior to this trial for the purpose of determining whether his state of mind at that time was the same as disclosed at this trial, and to prove that his testimony at this trial was not a fabrication. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">\u201cAt the conclusion of the trial the court instructed the jury again as to the limited purposes for which rehabilitating evidence had been admitted, using substantially the same language as above set forth and as approved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Weatherford, </em>78 Cal.App.2d 669, 697 [178 P.2d 816].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">\u201cIt is the rule generally and in this state that where the opposition has assailed the testimony of a witness as being of recent fabrication, an exception to the hearsay rule allows the admission of evidence of statements or conduct prior to the claimed fabrication and consistent with the testimony of the witness at the trial, \u2018not to prove the facts of the case, but as tending to show that the witness has not been controlled by motives of interest and that he has not fabricated something for the purpose of the case.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kynette, </em>15 Cal.2d 731, 753-754 [104 P.2d 794]; see also <em>Sweazey </em>v. <em>Valley Transport, Inc., </em>6 Wn.2d 324 [106 P.2d 567, 111 P.2d 1010, 140 A.L.R. 1]; 140 A.L.R. 93.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">\u201cThe defendants contend that the court improperly applied the \u2018prior consistent statement\u2019 rule; that an express limitation upon the use of this exception to the hearsay rule is that such prior remarks must have been made \u2018prior to the time when the motive of interest existed\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kynette, supra, </em>15 Cal.2d 731, 754; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Vestal, </em>88 Cal. 396, 398 [26 P. 213, 22 Am.St.Rep. 310]; <em>Barkly </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>74 Cal. 1, 5 [15 P. 307, 5 Am.St.Rep. 413]); that it is evident that these witnesses were as much biased and prejudiced at the time they made the prior statements as they were during the trial, and that the jury was confused and misled by the instructions of the court that the evidence was admissible to refute inferences that the witnesses had \u2018at this trial\u2019 fabricated their testimony or that \u2018at this trial\u2019 their testimony was actuated by bias or ulterior motives. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">\n<em>(\u00cd</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>\u201cWith reference to the questioned rulings and instructions it is to be noted that it is not necessary that the party desiring to impeach should expressly state that he seeks to prove a fabrication of recent date. It is sufficient if the record indicates a purpose to prove a recent fabrication. <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>88 Cal.App. 67, 78-79 [262 P. 1106]; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>188 Mass. 475 [74 N.B. 687]; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Broadway &amp; S.A.R. Co., </em>9 Misc. 20 [29 N.Y.S. 40]; <em>Sweazey </em>v. <em>Valley Transport, Inc., supra, </em>6 Wn.2d 324 [106 P.2d 567, 111 P.2d 1010, 140 A.L.R. 1]; 140 A.L.R. 152 and cases collected at pp. 153-154.) In the present case inferences of fabrication since the alleged bribes could be fairly drawn by the jurors in addition to those which would tend merely to impeach the witnesses\u2019 general reputations or otherwise east doubt upon their testimony. We find no error in admitting evidence of prior consistent statements for the limited purpose of refuting inferences of subsequent fabrication and to show a prior state of mind consistent with that shown by the witnesses when testifying.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The cross-examination of Trinidad was in part an attempt to show that her testimony that defendant had caused the injuries to Celia was of recent fabrication brought about by the fact that defendant had testified against her at her preliminary hearing and at the trial of the charges against her. Thus, under the rule \u201cthat where the opposition has assailed the testimony of a witness as being of recent fabrication, an exception to the hearsay rule allows the admission of evidence of statements or conduct prior to the claimed fabrication and consistent with the testimony of the witness at the trial\u201d as applied by the Supreme Court in Walsh, the testimony of Officers IJttke and Earner and of the public defender as to the conversations with Trinidad before her preliminary hearing were admissible for the sole purpose \u201cof refuting inferences of subsequent fabrication and to show a prior state of mind consistent with that shown\u201d by her when testifying at the trial of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The judgment and the order denying a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Wood (Parker), J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b671-9\">SHINN, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-T\">I concur in the judgment. It is well settled that where the circumstances are such as to reasonably support a claim that the testimony of a witness at the trial is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>a <em>recent </em>fabrication evidence that the witness previously made statements substantially corresponding with his testimony may be received to meet the claim of recent fabrication. There is a vast difference between a claim of recent fabrication and the usual cross-examination, the invariable purpose of which is, of course, to discover any untruth in the testimony. .If no facts are brought out to indicate that the testimony may be of recent invention, and not merely untruthful, the rule has no application. , I can think of no more dangerous or unsupportable rule of evidence than one that would permit the testimony of a witness to be bolstered by evidence that he had previously made statements consistent with his testimony for the sole reason that he had been cross-examined with the hope of proving the falsity of his testimony. I do not believe that it will ever become the law in California that the testimony of every prosecuting witness whose veracity is challenged can be fortified by evidence that on a former occasion he wrote down in a diary, or on a calendar or some scrap of paper his unsworn version of the occurrence. Such an extraordinary departure from the fundamental rules, of evidence would open the way to the unlimited manufacture of- evidence. No justification for it can be found in the mere fact that the witness was cross-examined, not as to facts of recent occurrence which might have influenced his testimony, but only as to testimony given in the course of his direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">It is clear to me that the majority opinion does not impliedly endorse the proposition that rehabilitating evidence may be received when there is in evidence no circumstance or event of recent occurrence, such as a desire for revenge, self-interest or pressure, which might have caused the witness to give testimony he would not have given otherwise. But I would point out that the opinion should be carefully read in the light' of all the facts of the present case, as they are stated, for an understanding of the reasons for affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
