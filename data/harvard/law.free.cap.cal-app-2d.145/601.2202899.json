J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgB\">Appellant, a liquor licensee, was charged by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control with selling beer to a minor, one Gilbert Monson. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 25658, subd. (a).) He had previously been convicted of that offense in the municipal court. Following an administrative hearing on the accusation pursuant to the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>proposed by the hearing officer, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control made its order revoking appellant\u2019s license. On appeal, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board (hereinafter called \u201cthe Board\u201d) duly affirmed the department\u2019s order. Appellant then petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate directing the department to set aside its-order of revocation, in reply to which, respondent Board filed its opposition to the issuance of the writ along with a copy of its own decision. Having duly considered the pleadings and the administrative proceedings, the court denied the petition for the writ of mandate. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">As an off-sale, retail liquor licensee, appellant operated a store adjacent to a public street in Los Angeles. Gilbert Monson, a minor of 15 years, entered the store and purchased three one-quart bottles of beer from appellant. On former occasions, Gilbert had purchased cigarettes from appellant but'had never been asked to exhibit a driver\u2019s license or other evidence of his \u2018majority. Acting upon complaints about appellant\u2019s liquor sales to minors, the Los Angeles Police Department stationed two officers in waiting when Gilbert called at appellant\u2019s store August 6, 1954, to make such a purchase. The merchant was then charged with a sale of alcoholic beverage to a minor in violation of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23000 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">He was convicted by the municipal court and sentenced to serve 60 days in the county jail. There he lingered when the hearing before \u25a0 the administrative board proceeded to investigate the abuse of his license by the sale of beer to the youth. Although appellant was in jail at the time of the hearing, he was represented by his counsel. No motion for a continuance was made in order that appellant might be present at the trial, but his lawyer \u201cin lieu of appellant\u2019s testimony\u201d introduced the reporter\u2019s transcript of appellant\u2019s trial in the municipal court for the sale of the three quarts of beer to Monson for. the \u201ccourt to see what the defendant\u2019s version of the case is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Statutes Involved</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">The law applicable to the conduct of a liquor dealer in selling beer to- a minor is found in certain decisions hereinafter cited, and in the Constitution and in certain statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>sections of the Business and Professions Code printed for the sake of brevity on the margin below.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Appellant contends that the findings do not support the order.  The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is an agency of the state created by the Constitution for the very purpose of investigating charges of misconduct brought against licensees under the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of 1935. (Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22.) Thus, its decision after an administrative hearing without prejudicial error will not be upset when supported by substantial evidence even though contradicted. <em>(Covert </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>29 Cal.2d 125,131 [173 P.2d 545].)  It must be sustained, provided it has committed no error of law, if the evidence is sufficient to support its findings of fact. <em>(Griswold </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>141 Cal.App.2d 807, 810 [297 P.2d 762].) As in other actions, all substantial conflicts must be resolved in favor of the findings of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The evidence adduced is abundant to support the findings. Two officers saw Gilbert make the purchase; the evidence is conclusive that the boy was only 15 years of age; there was testimony that the beverage purchased was \u201cbeer\u201d; the youth testified that he indeed bought the \u201cbeer\u201d from appellant ; in fact, appellant made various admissions of his sale of the beverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Appellant seeks to defend his actions on the ground that Gilbert had been in his store a week before the three-quart sale when he identified himself as being past 21 years. On that occasion he exhibited a driver\u2019s license which purportedly proved his majority. Appellant testified that he relied upon such prior exhibition of documentary proof in making the sale which has resulted in the revocation of his license. His theory is that this conduct brings him within the terms of Business and Professions Code, section 25660, providing a defense when the vendor has been exhibited a \u201cmotor vehicle operator\u2019s license.\u201d To prevail under that section it was incumbent upon the merchant to demand documentary proof of the customer\u2019s majority \u201cbefore furnishing any alcoholic beverage to a minor.\u201d The hearing officer and the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control did not believe appellant\u2019s story. Therefore, his defense under section 25660 was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Finally, appellant contends that he is entitled to a writ of mandate for the reason that no proof was ever made that the \u201cbeer\u201d he sold Gilbert Monson contained one-half of one per cent or more of alcohol.  Whenever the term \u201cbeer\u201d is used without words of qualification, it signifies a malt liquor and an intoxicating beverage. (See <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>State, </em>77 Ga.App. 435 [49 S.E.2d 157, 158]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>73 Ga.App. 421 [36 S.E.2d 839, 840]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Schrader, </em>243 Iowa 978 [55 N.W.2d 232, 236]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Winter, </em>- Mont. - [285 P.2d 149, 151].) In the Williams case, <em>supra, </em>the court rejected the argument that the indictment was defective because it did not specify the variety of beer sold, and held that the term \u201cbeer\u201d is in general usage to designate any and all malted liquors within the purview of the state liquor laws which declare that \u201cbeer\u201d signifies \u201cfermented beverages made wholly or in part from malt or any similar fermented beverage.\u201d The Montana liquor law includes beer in its definition of intoxicating liquors, without specifying the percentage of alcohol therein. The Winter case, <em>supra, </em>construing that statute, held that \u201cbeer\u201d in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>ordinary meaning, when used in connection with laws involving the sale of alcoholic beverages, implies a malt liquor and an intoxicating beverage. This malt liquor, under the generic name \u201cbeer,\u201d is used in both Europe and America as a common beverage. The word \u201cbeer,\u201d like the words \u201cbrandy,\u201d \u201cwhisky,\u201d \u201cgin,\u201d and \u201crum,\u201d is held universally to be an intoxicating liquor <em>per se </em>for the reason that it is within the common knowledge and ordinary understanding that it is an intoxicating liquor. <em>(Briffitt </em>v. <em>State, </em>58 Wis. 39 [16 N.W. 39, 46 Am.St.Rep. 621].)  Therefore, when a person is accused under section 25658, <em>supra, </em>of having sold \u201cbeer,\u201d the court takes judicial notice that it means an intoxicant. In short, the business and Professions Code, section 23006, defines \u201cbeer\u201d as \u201cany alcoholic beverage obtained by the fermentation of any infusion or decoction of barley, malt, hops, or any similar product ...\u201d Such authorities should be conclusive that whenever merchandise is sold as \u201cbeer\u201d it could not mean anything but an intoxicating beverage. Moreover, while appellant was on the witness stand in the municipal court he might have testified that Gilbert called for \u201croot beer,\u201d \u201cginger beer\u201d or for one of the other varieties of nonintoxicating beer, if such was a fact. Having sworn to tell the whole truth then, his contention now that.it was not proved to be intoxicating must be regarded as so much bluster. It must now be presumed that if he knew the beer was nonintoxicating he would have so testified at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Dub Process Denied?</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Surely, appellant could not mean that he was denied the right of \u201cdue process of law.\u201d He was represented at the administrative hearing by a member of the bar who actively participated in the proceedings, cross-examined witnesses, introduced evidence and made use of all available facts or authorities to effectuate appellant\u2019s exoneration of the accusation. The attorney made no motion for a continuance to enable appellant to be present in person, but he offered in evidence the transcript of the proceedings of appellant\u2019s trial in the municipal court for the purpose of proving his itinoeence. He is in no position now to complain of his failure before the Department.  A proceeding before an administrative agency to determine whether a license should be revoked is not a criminal or quasi-criminal prosecution. <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 161, 166 [170 P.2d 510].)  As in any other civil action, a litigant may appear solely by his counsel to defend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>charges against him. Having done so, his fortunes are linked with the ensuing judgment. In the absence of reversible error at the hearing, his litigation has become history.  There is no statute that requires a party to an administrative hearing to be personally present. On the contrary, he may be present by his attorney. (Gov. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a711505, 11509.)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Appellant\u2019s attorney had notice of the accusation, appeared at the time and place designated for the hearing and participated without ever registering an objection on the ground that the Department had no jurisdiction. Appellant does not claim that the attorney was not authorized to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Order denying alternative writ of mandate affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Pox, J., and Ashburn, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 24, 1956.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Business and Professions Code sections as they read in 1954 when appellant sold the beer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u00a7 25658. \u201c(a) Every person who sells, furnishes, gives, or causes to be sold, furnished, or given away, any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21 years is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">\u00a7 25660. \u201cIn any criminal prosecution or proceeding for the suspension or revocation of any license based upon violation of Section 25658, proof that the defendant licensee, or his agent or employee, demanded and was shojm, before furnishing any alcoholic beverage to a minor, a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license or a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service Act or other bona fide documentary evidence of majority and identity of the person, is a defense to the prosecution or proceeding for the suspension or revocation of any license. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">\u00a7 24200. \u201cThe following are the grounds which constitute a basis for the suspension or the revocation of licenses: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">11 (b) Except as limited by Chapters 11 and 12 of this division, the violation or the causing or the permitting of a violation by a licensee of this division, any rules of the board adopted pursuant to Part 14 of Division 2 of the Bevenue and Taxation Code or any rules of the department adopted pursuant to the provisions of this division, or any other penal provisions of law of this State prohibiting or regulating the sale, exposing for sale, use, possession, giving away, adulteration, dilution, misbranding, or mislabeling of alcoholic beverages or intoxicating liquors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">California Constitution, article XX, section 22, fourth paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-15\">\u201c. . .
