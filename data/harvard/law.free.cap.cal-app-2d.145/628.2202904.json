Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>in this case a 1936 partnership consisting of four general partners was formed. The business was conducted under the name of \u201cMacintosh Studio Clothes.\u201d In June of 1950, Walter Macintosh, one of the partners, died intestate, his wife succeeded to his interest, and his brother Richard acted as administrator of the estate which passed to Walter\u2019s wife. No change in the conduct of the business resulted from Walter\u2019s death nor did the partnership formally dissolve. The business was continued exactly as it had been before except that Walter was no longer a partner. The business had employed about 80 persons prior to his decease and the same number afterwards. Many of these employees earned over $3,000 during the year 1950. The partnership only paid unemployment insurance taxes on the first $3,000 paid to each employee during that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The Director of Employment made an assessment against the plaintiffs for the sum of $2,522.82, plus penalties, which sum was the tax alleged due from the successor partnership on the first $3,000 in wages paid by the successor to each employee during the year 1950. It was the Director of Employment\u2019s contention that after the death of Walter Macintosh, \u201cMacintosh Studio Clothes\u201d constituted a new employing unit and was liable for the tax on the first $3,000 of wages paid by it to each employee. The main question here is whether the death of this general partner resulted in such a new employer or employing unit as is contemplated by the tax statute. There can be little doubt that the death of Walter resulted in a new entity being created, but whether or not that entity is such as to constitute a new employing unit is the matter here for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Section 11, subdivision (a) of the California Unemployment Insurance Act, 3 Deering\u2019s General Laws, Act 8780d, section 11, here under consideration, provided that contributions be made by employers to the defendant based on wages paid by the employer. The statute excluded from the definition of the term wages remuneration in excess of $3,000 paid to every individual by an employer in any calendar year. The cited section read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cExcept as hereinafter in the section provided the term \u2018wages\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">\u201c (1) All remuneration payable for personal services, whether by private agreement or consent or by force of statute, including commissions and bonuses, and the cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>value of all remuneration payable in any medium other than cash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-3\">\u201c(e) If, when, and during such time as the definition of the term \u2018wages,\u2019 as contained in the Federal Unemployment Tax Act excludes from \u2018wages\u2019 any one or more of the following types of payments, then such type or types of payments as are so excluded shall likewise be excluded from the definition of wages as contained in subsection (a) of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">\u201c (1) That part of the remuneration which, after remuneration equal to three thousand dollars ($3,000) has been paid to an individual by an employer with respect to employment during any calendar year is paid after December 31, 1939, and prior to January 1, 1947, to such individual by such employer with respect to employment during such calendar year; . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Appellant urges that the mere change in entity is sufficient to require this court to hold that there was a change in the employing unit and in support of its position cites section 15031 of the Corporations Code which deals with the dissolution of a general partnership where the death of a partner results in the dissolution, and further relies upon the case of <em>State of California, Dept. of Emp. </em>v. <em>Fred S. Reynauld &amp; Co. </em>(1950), 179 F.2d 605, where the federal court held that a successor corporation to a partnership, where the stock interest was the same as in the partnership, was a new employing unit for the purpose of the unemployment insurance tax. In this ease the federal court did not consider as binding upon it two California cases decided by the superior court of San Francisco; <em>Barrett et al., </em>v. <em>California Emp. Com., </em>C.C.H. Unemployment Insurance Reporter, California, Par. 1205.116 (1945), and <em>California Emp. Com. </em>v. <em>Ransohoff, Inc., et al., </em>C.C.H. Unemployment Insurance Reporter, California, Par. 1205.115 (1944), both of which cases held that successor entities were not new employing units but constituted a single employer. In the Reynauld case the court held that a partnership and the corporation which succeeded it were separate units and, as a reason for this construction, stated that it would facilitate administration \u25a0 of the Act. Thereafter, however, the ease of <em>McHenry\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>California Emp. Stab. Com., </em>112 Cal.App.2d 245 [246 P.2d 76], was decided. In that case a husband and wife, each of whom had invested separate and community funds in a business subsequently incorporated the business, and stock was issued to each of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>individually. The business continued exactly as it had been before the incorporation except that the legal form had been changed. The court said that the terms \u201cemploying unit\u201d or \u201cemployer\u201d as used in the unemployment insurance statute refer to the unity of enterprise and are not concerned with the shifting of management or the legal form of the same enterprise. The court held that for the purpose of the unemployment insurance tax only one employer existed in the year the business was incorporated. At page 249 the court, in outlining certain aspects to be considered in determining whether or not a new entity arose, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\u201cThere was likewise no change in the type or location of the business. Also the actual management was conducted by plaintiff in the same manner as it had been during the operation of plaintiff\u2019s predecessors. The identity of the business was carried on under the same name and was not altered or otherwise affected by the transfer. Therefore, there was no change in the employing unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">It is our opinion that in the instant case, as in the McHenry case, the only change made was one of form and not of substance. In both of these cases there was, it is true, a new legal entity, but this legal entity conducted the business in exactly the same manner as its predecessor. Only a change in the identity of one of the partners is here apparent, namely the widow of the deceased partner succeeding to his share. The change was one in form only and was not one of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Van Dyke, P. J., and Peek, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-14\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
