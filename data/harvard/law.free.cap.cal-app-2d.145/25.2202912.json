Green, acquired by grant deed certain vacant property in Arcadia, California, from a brother and sister-in-law, William and Letha Green. The purchase price was $2,500, instalment payments thereon being made by Martha and Stanley DeGroof, and not by decedent. At the time of decedent\u2019s death on December 3, 1954, there remained an unpaid balance of $1,289.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Construction loans were secured by the decedent and later paid off by the proceeds of a California Department of Veterans purchase contract, instalment payments thereon being made by Martha and Stanley DeGroof, which payments included principal, interest, taxes, and the premium on a policy of life insurance on decedent\u2019s life. At the decedent\u2019s death a balance of $6,937.60 was paid off in full by the life insurance, and on June 10, 1955, the Department of Veterans Affairs conveyed the property to \u201cThe Heirs or Devisees of Jack H. Green, Deceased.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">It appears that the decedent had executed a purported \u201cLast Will and Testament\u201d which, however, was invalid, having been notarized instead of being attested by witnesses. In this document, introduced in evidence, the decedent states that \u201cThe house and lot known as 1600 So. 6th Ave., Arcadia, Calif, although in my name is in fact the property of Constant and Martha DeGroof (who has been my constant companions for a number of years because all monies invested in construction, repair, upkeep, insurance, etc. have been paid by the DeGroofs with not one cent invested by me. The time I have invested in this project was and is a gift to them as a token repayment of care and kind consideration of me by them. Household furnitures are also included on above. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">An action was filed by the DeGroofs to enforce in the alternative a resulting or an express trust in the property. The time for the administratrix, decedent\u2019s daughter Annetta Green Whiting, to answer or otherwise plead to this action was extended by stipulation in view of pending negotiations for compromise; no pleading was ever filed by the administratrix and a compromise agreement eventually was executed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Appellants, Gladys L. Green, a creditor, and Ernest Green, an heir at law, appeared as objectors at the hearing for approval of the compromise. The matter was thereafter taken under submission, written points and authorities were filed, and the compromise ultimately approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In approving the compromise, the trial court found that the value of the property in question was between $12,500 and $15,000; that the DeGroofs had \u201cmade payments on the purchase of said property believing that they were the owners of said property, \u2019 \u2019 and that Jack L. Green, deceased, \u201cintended to hold title to the real property for the benefit of Stanley and Martha DeGroof.\u201d The court further found that \u201cIt is to the advantage and benefit of the estate and the parties interested in the estate that the suit (by the DeGroofs) against the Administratrix be compromised and settled,\u201d and that the proposed compromise \u201cprovides for a fair and reasonable settlement for said litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The compromise thus approved, and which is objected to by appellants, provides that the DeGroofs shall pay to the Estate of Jack H. Green, the sum of $300, and that the administratrix shall convey the property by grant deed to the DeGroofs. It is further provided that the DeGroofs shall hold the estate \u201charmless from any and all liability to William and Letha Green or for their account which . . . may have arisen by reason of the purchase of said property and . . . shall be required by secure ... a full and complete release by said parties of any and all claims that said parties have filed against the estate.\u201d The DeGroofs \u201cfurther release their Creditor\u2019s Claim heretofore filed against the estate. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">It is appellants\u2019 contention that before a compromise is approved, it must appear that it is \u201cof advantage and benefit to the Estate and those interested therein, that the administratrix in proposing it is exercising good sound business judgment and is not actuated by sentiment.\u201d More specifically, appellants argue that the consideration received \u201cshould be adequate and when it appears that the Estate is to receive $300.00 for clear property having a value of from $12,500.00 to $15,000.00, the inadequacy of such consideration in and of itself is sufficient to reverse the order approving such a compromise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Appellants further affirm that \u201cThe power to compromise does not include the power to make presents\u201d; that in the present case, \u201cunder the guise of compromise,\u201d the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ministratrix is merely seeking to carry out the provisions of \u201cdecedent\u2019s abortive will.\u201d In this connection it is said that the administratrix did not sufficiently investigate or \u201cimpartially appraise the DeGroof\u2019s litigation\u201d; that the court \u201cdid not evaluate\u201d such litigation, and that \u201cit is apparent that said action could be successfully defended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In view of the state of the record, the appellants\u2019 contentions must be deemed untenable.  As stated in <em>Estate of Vedder, </em>121 Cal.App.2d 402, 406 [263 P.2d 58], the approval of a compromise \u201cis within the discretionary power of the administrator and of the probate court, and upon appeal the judgment will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion is clearly shown.\u201d In the instant case, no such abuse of discretion has been shown. On the contrary, the record affords substantial evidence in support of the trial court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The situation is not, as appellants contend, a mere matter of giving away estate property valued at from $12,500 to $15,000 for the small sum of $300, which would, indeed, shock the conscience. If, as the proof indicates, the property in question was paid for by the DeGroofs, and because of such payment was considered by the decedent to be \u201cin fact the property of Constant and Martha DeGroof,\u201d it was not in equity and good conscience a proper asset of the decedent\u2019s estate but, as the trial court found, a situation where the decedent \u201cintended to hold title to the real property for the benefit of\u201d the DeGroofs. As pointed out in the respondent\u2019s brief, in the case of a resulting trust or an express trust, defense to the DeGroofs\u2019 action would be difficult if not impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The trial court had before it and considered both oral and documentary evidence; a fair and full hearing was had, and it cannot be said that the order approving the compromise was unreasonable or arbitrarily entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">White, P. J., and Pourt, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
