(See Rules on Appeal, rule 10(a), 22 Cal.2d 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">The motion must be granted on the ground stated but there is another and more important reason for the dismissal of the appeal on the court\u2019s own motion, to wit, that the defendant corporation filed the notice of appeal in the superior court and its opposition to the dismissal in this court in propria persona. Such notice and opposition are void by reason of the corporation\u2019s lack of power to represent itself in an action in court. Defendant was represented by an attorney at the trial but his services apparently terminated with the entry of judgment in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">A composite of the rule in the decided cases, overwhelmingly sustained by the authorities, may be thus stated: A natural person may represent himself and present his own ease to the court although he is not a licensed attorney. A corporation is not a natural person. It is an artificial entity created by law and as such it can neither practice law nor appear or act in person. Out of court it must act in its affairs through its agents and representatives and in matters in court it can act only through licensed attorneys. A corporation cannot appear in court by an officer who is not an attorney and it cannot appear in propria persona.

(22 U.S.) 738, 830 [6 L.Ed. 204, 226].)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">The federal courts have held that the provisions in the statute that \u201cthe parties may plead and manage their own cases\u201d or by attorney ([Rev. Stats. \u00a7 747], 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 394) does not authorize a corporation to plead and manage its case personally or through an agent who is not an attorney of the court. <em>(Mullin-Johnson Co. </em>v. <em>Penn. Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(D.C. Cal. 9 Fed.Supp. 175; <em>Brandstein </em>v. <em>White Lamps, Inc. </em>(D.C.N.Y.) 20 Fed.Supp. 369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The two cases that have come to our attention which express a different view are <em>A. Victor &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Sleininger, </em>255 App. Div. 673 [9 N.Y.S.2d 323], and <em>Sellent-Repent Corp. </em>v. <em>Queens Borough Gas &amp; El. Co., </em>160 Misc. 920 [290 N.Y.S. 887]. These eases. are against the weight of authority and are contrary to the New York decisions above cited. The Victor case advances the curious argument that a corporation should be permitted to appear <em>in propria persona </em>because (1) it might be too impoverished to employ a lawyer and (2) it might have a large claim it believed to be just but could find no lawyer who would accept employment, believing the case to be hopeless. In the Sellent-Bepent case a corporation was permitted to appear in person, the court stating that the act of its officer in appearing for it was an act of the corporation. The later New York cases have negated this concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The ease of <em>Prudential Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Small Claims Court, </em>76 Cal.App.2d 379 [173 P.2d 38, 167 A.L.R. 820], contains nothing contrary to what has been said in this opinion. Several of the cases above cited are mentioned with the comment that they deal with courts of record and with the general common-law principles that in the absence of statutory authority a cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>poration cannot practice law even in its own behalf. The decision holds that by reason of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, to which reference is made, a corporation may appear in person in the small claims court.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Moore, P.
