Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was predicated on allegations of negligence in failing to \u201csecure sufficient or any supervision or protection for the plaintiff\u201d; more specifically, in failing to have a sufficient number of guards present to prevent reckless skating by other patrons, and by reason of the failure of the guards present to take any action or precautions after respondent had fallen and lay helpless on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">The dimensions of the appellants\u2019 skating rink are 100 feet by 200 feet, and a central portion approximately 50x100 feet had been marked off for fancy skating and backward skating. However, there was evidence that, three weeks prior to respondent\u2019s accident, the floor had been sanded and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>line separating the central portion had been obliterated. The number of skaters present on the floor at the time in question was variously estimated at from 250 to 398, and the number of guards then present was likewise variously placed at from two to four. The record discloses that, after skating for a time with respondent, the witness Janet Endelman saw the respondent lying on the floor approximately 10 or 15 feet from the rail on the south side of the rink. This witness testified that no guards or attendants came over there but that groups of people collected around respondent; that while the witness was kneeling beside plaintiff, a sailor, skating backwards, and apparently pursued by another skater, fell on top of Mrs. Endelman and the respondent. Mrs. Endelman testified that the respondent had been lying on the floor from three to five minutes before the crash, after which the floor manager came over and respondent was carried to the first aid room. Respondent\u2019s injuries included a double fracture at the head and neck of the right femur which resulted in a permanent crippling and shortening of the leg; intense pain caused by the injury and by a metal plate inserted to hold the parts together, continuing at the time of trial some 16 months after the injury, and requiring a further operation. After trial by jury, a verdict was rendered in favor of respondent for $25,006.83, and the present appeal is from the judgment entered thereon. As noted in the respondent\u2019s brief, there is no complaint that the amount of the verdict was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The appellants\u2019 brief contains but three assignments of errors: (1) \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error in permitting an expert witness on behalf of respondent to testify as to what are the proper practices and safeguards for the protection of skaters\u201d; (2) prejudicial error \u201cin sustaining an objection to the hypothetical question propounded to (appellants\u2019) expert witness\u201d; and (3) prejudicial error in instructing the jury \u201cthat appellant did not assume the risk of reckless action of other skaters capable in the exercise of ordinary care, of being prevented by guards who were stationed upon the floor for the protection of the patrons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error relates to the testimony of one John Niddiffer, floor manager, who, after testifying to several years experience in the operation of skating arenas, was then permitted to state that \u201cThe proper safeguard (for protection of skaters) is that you have a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>number of men, and also that those men are capable of performing their duties as guards, and immediately upon any accident a man is to be there immediately to prevent a pileup,\u201d etc. The witness further stated that with an attendance of 250 people, \u201cit would take a man every 50 feet, plus the floor manager\u201d to handle the crowd and effectuate those objects; or five men besides the manager. The floor manager then testified that on the night in question, \u201cto the best of my memory, there were three (floor guards), including myself.\u201d It is contended by appellants \u201cthat the trial court, in permitting the lone expert, summoned by the plaintiff, to testify as to what are proper practices in safeguarding skaters, in effect allowed that witness to determine for the jury the ultimate fact in question\u201d; that \u201cin the absence of such testimony no ease would have been made out sufficient to go to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\">The respondent\u2019s brief, however, suggests that \u201cThe short form of the question, using the word \u2018proper\u2019 in place of the detailed expression in regard to precautions exercised by other similar businesses in the locality has been used many times without disapproval.\u201d For example, in <em>Thurman </em>v. <em>Clune, </em>51 Cal.App.2d 505, 507 [125 P.2d 59], involving an action for personal injuries sustained by a spectator at an ice hockey game, the court said: \u20181 The practice in other places relative to the safeguarding of ice hockey rinks and the opinion of experts relative to the <em>proper </em>safeguards to be taken ... is evidence which is admissible and is entitled to consideration with other evidence on the query of whether defendant in a particular instance has properly safeguarded the ice hockey rink in question.\u201d (Italics added.) In the instant case, as mentioned in respondent\u2019s brief, there appears to be no particular dispute as to the duties of floor guards, although there was a certain conflict of testimony as to the number of guards required and the number actually present. Respondent\u2019s cause of action, moreover, was not predicated alone upon the number of guards, and the record includes other evidence bearing on the issue of negligence, for example that at the time of the accident, the floor manager was drinking coffee at a soft drink stand, and had only a \u201climited view\u201d of the skating floor; that the one gaurd who saw respondent lying on the floor made no effort to go to the scene of the accident and that respondent was permitted to remain in such a dangerous position for a space of from three to four minutes without protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>In view of these facts, appellants\u2019 objection, going as it does to the terminology used by the expert witness, cannot be said to have been prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Appellants\u2019 second complaint relates to the sustaining of an objection to appellants\u2019 hypothetical question propounded to the witness Albert Baker. The question assumed the dimensions of the skating rink, an attendance of 398 persons and the presence of four guards, and inquired whether or not \u201cin this locality and in the practice of rinks in this locality there was a sufficient and adequate number of guards for that crowd.\u201d The trial court sustained an objection thereto, \u201cupon the ground that no foundation has been laid,\u201d and declined to permit appellants\u2019 attorney to approach the bench for the purpose of arguing the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The record discloses that the witness Baker had had about four years experience as manager of a rollerdrome located at Culver City; that the witness had \u201conly visited one or two rinks since I have been there because I have been busy enough attending to my own business. \u2019 \u2019 The trial court evidently felt that this limited experience was not sufficient foundation to entitle the witness to express an opinion as to \u201cthe practices of rinks in this locality,\u201d and stated: \u201cit is a perfectly obvious proposition, it seems to me it does not require any argument.\u201d Moreover, as mentioned in respondent\u2019s brief, \u201cno separate offer of proof was made from which it might be inferred that testimony favorable to the appellant would have been produced by the response if one were permitted. \u2019 \u2019 Also, \u201cthe most that would have been elicited from the witness was that the four guards referred to in the question were a sufficient and adequate number, \u2019 \u2019 and four other experts had given similar testimony on behalf of appellants. Under these circumstances it cannot be assumed that the admission of the testimony in question would have affected the verdict of the jury. In this connection respondent\u2019s brief calls attention to the fact that \u201cNo number of guards employed . . . would affect the findings of negligence if those employed were not performing their duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Finally, prejudicial error is claimed to have resulted from the giving of an instruction \u201cthat appellant did not assume the risk of reckless action of other skaters capable in the exercise of ordinary care, of being prevented by guards who were stationed upon the floor for the protection of the patrons.\u201d This instruction was given, as appellants\u2019 brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>avers, \u201cafter properly instructing the jurors on the doctrine of assumption of risk.\u201d The instruction in question is in accord with the language used in <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Studio Amusements, 50 </em>Cal.App.2d 538, 543 [123 P.2d 552], where the court said: \u201cOne of respondent corporation\u2019s defenses was the assumption by appellant of the risks incident to skating upon such a rink; but it cannot be argued that one of the normal risks involved is the reckless action of other skaters capable of being prevented by guards who are stationed upon the rink for the protection of patrons. While the operator of a skating rink is not an insurer of the patrons\u2019 safety, nevertheless, he owes a duty to protect them from risks other than those normally incident to the sport.\u201d The appellants\u2019 attempt to distinguish the Thomas case from the present situation by claiming that, notwithstanding respondent\u2019s testimony that \u201cshe skated about without noting anything unusual until she was suddenly and unexpectedly struck,\u201d nevertheless, because of the fact that other witnesses testified to observing two sailors skating recklessly just before the accident, \u201cit is a fair inference that she (respondent) saw them,\u201d is not persuasive. No prejudicial error is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 2, 1948, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 8,1948.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
