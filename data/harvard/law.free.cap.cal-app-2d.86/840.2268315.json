Plaintiff appeals from the judgment that followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Quoting from appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cIt is the Appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court committed <em>reversal </em>errors of law upon an undisputed record of facts. The issues resolve themselves into certain basic questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-8\">\u201c1. Does the Appellant, in a cause of action of unlawful eviction, have the legal right to pray for judgment in damages for injuries to his health directly caused by said unlawful eviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-9\">\u201c2. Does the Appellant, in a cause of action for unlawful eviction have the legal right to compensation for pain and injury as a part of exemplary and punitive damages to be included in a judgment if he prevails in proving an unlawful eviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-10\">\u201c3. Can the trial court, when the issues of fact are being tried by a jury, invade the province of that jury and decide the issues of fact by way of sustaining a motion for nonsuit?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Quoting from appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cRespondent Grace B. Wilton had a room for rent at 2128 South Western Avenue, Los Angeles, and told Respondent Marie Mayberry she could rent it for $19.00 per month and Mrs. Mayberry told Mr. Coeply she had a room to rent. Then Mr. Coeply took the Appellant to Mrs. Mayberry and Appellant paid her $19.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>for first month\u2019s rent and $7.50 for broker\u2019s fee and cleaning. Mrs. Mayberry gave the money to Mrs. Wilton who rents and collects rents from all the tenants of the building. The rent was paid July 19, 1946, and tenancy began on July 20, 1946, and Appellant paid the rent each month up to and including November 20, 1946. On the evening of October 20, 1946, he returned to his apartment and found his padlock had been removed off the door, and another padlock put on. Respondent Mayberry and a Mr. Cihok went over, after Mr. Cihok had told Mayberry he had opened the door, and Mayberry and Cihok went into Appellant\u2019s room and removed his personal property.\u201d It further appears that the room had previously been leased to Cihok but that during Cihok\u2019s absence of a few months respondent Mayberry, at the request of appellant\u2019s friend Coeply, had rented the room to appellant. When Cihok returned, appellant\u2019s possessions were removed. In this regard, appellant testified to a conversation with Mayberry and Cihok after the \u201ceviction\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">\u201cA. She said she had merely rented a room to me as a personal favor to Mr. Coeply, and I was supposed to be in there only sixty days and I didn\u2019t get out, and so Mr. Cihok had a lease signed by Mrs. Wilton that was made in July, and she had absolutely no right whatever to rent the room to me at all, but she had rented it as a favor to Mr. Coeply and me because she thought I was a nice fellow, but when the sixty days was up and another thirty days they decided, Mr. Cihok wanted the room back, he had a lease on it, he was the legal tenant, and they moved my stuff out while I was gone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">On cross-examination appellant testified to a conversation with Mrs. Mayberry had between about the middle of August and the middle of September while driving in an automobile in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Mindlin : It was some time during the drive, Mr. Bohart, you and Mrs. Mayberry had a conversation about the room? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">\u201cQ. And did she tell you during this drive the room belonged to Mr. Cihok who was out of town? A. She referred to it as Gy\u2019s room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">\u201cQ. And did she during this drive ask you if you had looked for another room ? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-10\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Mindlin: Did she tell you when Mr. Cihok was expected back in the city ? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-11\">\u201cQ. How did that subject come up? A. She just said it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>was Cy\u2019s room and he would be coming back some time; she didn\u2019t say when.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-6\">\u201cQ. And was the matter dropped then, or did she say anything further about the room ? A. Dropped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-7\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t ask her what would happen to you when Mr. Cihok would come back? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-8\">\u201cQ. You did know you would have to vacate the room when Mr. Cihok came back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-9\">\u201cMe. Rochester : I object to that as calling for a conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-10\">\u201cThe Court : The objection is sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">The ruling was error and the evidence improperly excluded. Appellant testified to another conversation had with respondent Mayberry over the telephone as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-12\">\u201cQ. Now, after you had mailed her this money order around September 19th and prior to October 20th, during that period did you have any further conversation with Mrs. May-berry about the room ? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-13\">\u201c Q. By Mr. MinPlin : What was said in the course of your telephone conversation? A. I told her I needed clean linen, and she said she wouldn\u2019t give me more clean linen and that was Cy\u2019s room and I would have to get out sooner or later and she wouldn\u2019t give me any clean linen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-14\">\u201cQ. What else was said? A. That was all that was said, and I hung up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">The cross-examination of appellant was constantly and prejudicially restricted and handicapped by invalid objections and erroneous rulings obviously due to a misunderstanding as to the distinction between proper cross-examination and impeachment, a misunderstanding which, incidentally, is not uncommon among judges and lawyers generally. Nevertheless, it is evident, from a review of the record, that the court\u2019s ruling on defendants\u2019 motion was proper. Without going into further detail, it is sufficient to note the trial court\u2019s determination that no agency existed is supported by the record, which conclusion disposes of appellant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-17\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-18\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 11, 1948, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 13,1948. Carter, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
