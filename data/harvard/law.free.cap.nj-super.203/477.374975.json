De-. fendant installs and services burglar alarm systems. One of its systems was installed in plaintiff\u2019s premises. After an undetected break-in, plaintiff sued defendant for its losses, charging breach of contract, negligence and \u201cgross and wanton negligence.\u201d A second count was abandoned at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">The break-in occurred during the term of the third annual contract between the parties. At the beginning of the first contract, defendant sold and installed sensitive listening equipment in various parts of plaintiff\u2019s shop at a cost to plaintiff of $800. Defendant then provided continuous central station monitoring of the listening equipment during plaintiff\u2019s off hours so that it could detect any sounds of a break-in and immediately alert plaintiff and the police. The monitoring charge was $50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>per month. Plaintiff additionally paid the telephone company\u2019s charges for a trunk line connecting its premises with the monitoring station.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The evidence at trial permitted the conclusion that the break-in occurred about one and a half hours before defendant recognized and reported it; that the burglars first broke a substantial amount of skylight glass and then gained entry by smashing through a block wall with a sledge hammer; that a wall of metal shelves holding paint cans was thrown over and that a good deal of noisy activity took place over a long period of time in the shop. Defendant\u2019s monitoring employee failed to detect the break-in because she turned down the sound volume on the listening equipment to avoid hearing sounds she considered non hostile, including the barking of plaintiff\u2019s guard dog, which defendant\u2019s employees had previously adjudged overexcitable. She was finally awakened to the true situation only when an independent perimeter alarm was set off by the burglars\u2019 raising an overhead door to drive away a customer\u2019s Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In answer to the court\u2019s special verdict questions, <em>R. </em>4:89-1, the jury found that defendant failed to perform its contract obligations reasonably, diligently and competently; that losses of the nature incurred by plaintiff were foreseeable as a result of a contract breach, and that losses were incurred by plaintiff as a result of defendant\u2019s failure to perform. The jury was not asked if defendant was guilty of the complaint\u2019s charge of \u201cgross and wanton negligence.\u201d The jury was not asked to fix the quantum of damages. Instead, the court entered judgment for $250, for reasons which occasion plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Each of the three yearly contracts between the parties contained a provision limiting defendant\u2019s liability to $250. Among other things, they said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">If Sonitrol should be found liable for loss or damage due to the failure of its services in any respect, even if due to Sonitrol\u2019s negligence, its liability shall be limited to a sum equal to ten percent of the annual monitoring charge for the premises or $250 whichever is greater, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty,____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>The first two yearly contracts were accompanied, however, by a separate guarantee. It promised that, if there was an undetected and unreported forcible entry, defendant would make good plaintiff\u2019s losses and damages up to $5,000. Partway through the second contract, defendant revoked the guarantee. When it came time to sign the third contract, plaintiff asked for the elimination of the provision limiting defendant\u2019s liability in view of the withdrawal of the $5,000 guarantee. Defendant declined to remove the provision, and plaintiff nevertheless signed the contract. It was satisfied with defendant\u2019s services and was mindful of its own $800 investment in equipment, which it was afraid would be rendered useless by ending defendant\u2019s services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The clause purports to be a liquidated damage clause, justified, according to its own language, by the parties\u2019 agreement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">that Sonitrol is not an insurer, ... that the amounts payable to Sonitrol ... are based on the value of the services and ... it is impractical, if not impossible, to fix the actual damages____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In real effect, however, it is an exculpatory clause, because it denies liability for all but a nominal amount of damages. The limit of $250 is obviously not the result of an effort to fairly estimate plaintiff\u2019s likely damages from a break-in. Defendant\u2019s service cost $800 at the outset and $600 per year plus telephone company charges. It is unlikely that a business would spend those amounts to protect $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The trial court held that the contractual limitation on liability was enforceable and, in the circumstances revealed by the proofs, limited plaintiff\u2019s damages. We agree. Exculpatory clauses like this one are valid where they do not adversely affect the public interest, where the exculpated party is not under a public duty to perform, as in the case of a public utility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>or common carrier, and where the contract does not grow out of unequal bargaining power or is otherwise unconscionable. These principles have grown out of cases involving burglar alarms, <em>Foont-Freedenfeld Corp. v. Electro-Protective Corp., </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254 (App.Div.1973), aff'd o.b., 64 <em>N.J. </em>197 (1974); fire alarms, <em>Abel Holding Co., Inc. v. American Dist. Telegraph Co., </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137 (Law Div.1975) aff\u2019d 147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>263 (App.Div.1977); and lease provisions assigning to an industrial or commercial tenant the risk of loss of its goods however caused. <em>Midland Carpet Corp. v. Franklin Assoc. Properties, </em>90 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42 (App.Div.1966). Such a clause will not be enforced in the case of a residential apartment lease where suitable living quarters are at a premium and unequal bargaining power results, <em>Kuzmiak v. Brookchester, </em>33 <em>N.J.Super. </em>575 (App.Div.1955), or where the limitation clause is hidden in a provision ostensibly conferring a benefit on the buyer of fire protection equipment. <em>Jutta\u2019s, Inc. v. Fireco Equipment Co., </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The cited cases do not determine what effect the clause has on plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. Neither <em>Foont-Freedenfeld </em>nor <em>Abel Holding Co. </em>nor <em>Midland Carpet </em>involved allegations of the kinds of extreme departure from diligent contract performance charged in the present complaint. Plaintiff charged defendant, not only with breach of contract and negligence, but also with \u201cgross and wanton negligence.\u201d The present contract clause limits damages recoverable for its failures \u201cin any respect, even if due to Sonitrol\u2019s negligence.\u201d The clause thus applies to a default in any aspect of Sonitrol\u2019s service, and it is not rendered inoperative if the default was negligently caused. The clause does not purport to limit liability for willful and wanton misconduct. Although plaintiff\u2019s complaint is inarticulately drawn, we read it to charge willful and wanton misconduct in addition to a high degree of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"> An exculpatory clause that purports to shield a commercial landlord from liability to tenant for negligence must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>plainly say so, unless the intent to do so is evident from the arrangement of the parties. <em>Carbone v. Cortlandt Realty Corp., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>366, 368 (1971); <em>Freddi-Gail v. Royal Holding Corp., </em>34 <em>N.J.Super. </em>142 (App.Div.1955). <em>See also Rubin v. A.M.C. Home Inspection &amp; Warranty Service, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315 (Law Div.1980), involving a home inspection service contract. We hold that an exculpatory clause may expressly excuse or limit liability for negligent contract performance, but that such a clause does not operate to bar a claim of willful and wanton misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In <em>Kuzmiak v. Brookchester, </em>33 <em>N.J.Super. at </em>580, this court stated in <em>dictum </em>that, although a promise not to sue for simple negligence may be valid, an attempted exemption from liability for intentional tort or willful act or gross negligence is generally declared to be void. In <em>Swisscraft Novelty Co. v. Alad Realty Corp., </em>113 <em>N.J.Super. </em>416 (App.Div.1971), this court quoted the <em>Kuzmiak dictum </em>and held that an exculpatory lease clause that was sufficient to bar damage suit for lessor negligence would not bar a complaint alleging willful and wanton misconduct or gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Willful and wanton misconduct is different in kind from negligence. It is defined in <em>McLaughlin v. Rova Farms, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>288, 305 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">[I]t must appear that the defendant with knowledge of existing conditions, and conscious from such knowledge that injury will probably or likely result from his conduct, and with reckless indifference to the consequences, consciously and \u2022 intentionally does some wrongful act or omits to discharge some duty which produces the injurious result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\"><em>See also Tabor v. O\u2019Grady, </em>59 <em>N.J.Super. </em>330, on reh. 61 <em>N.J.Super. </em>446 (App.Div.1960). Thus, a contract clause that bars suit for negligent failure to perform contract responsibilities does not bar suit for willful and wanton misconduct. Gross negligence, however, is different from negligence only in degree. There is no reason why that difference should have an operative effect in the circumstances of this case. <em>Cf. Di Giovanni v. Pessel; </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>188 (1970). The difference has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>vitality under the comparative negligence statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1, <em>Draney v. Bachman, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503 (Law Div. 1976). We hold that an exculpatory clause which bars suit for negligent performance of contractual duties also bars suit for very negligent or grossly negligent performance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In other jurisdictions, the better authorities support our views. In <em>Peacock\u2019s, Inc. v. South Central Bell, </em>455 So.2d 694 (La.App.1984), a telephone company tariff which limited liability for negligent performance did not bar suit charging the company with willful misconduct in connecting a burglar alarm system. In <em>Morgan Co. v. Minnesota Min. &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>310 <em>Minn. </em>305, 246 <em>N.W.</em>2d 443 (1976), an exculpatory clause in a burglar alarm contract which excused negligent nonperformance did not bar suit charging intentional misconduct and \u201cwillful and wanton negligence.\u201d The court did not define the latter term. In <em>Shaer Shoe Corp. v. Granite State Alarm, Inc., </em>110 <em>N.H. </em>132, 262 A.2d 285 (1970), a sprinkler system contract which limited liability for \u201cwillful default or negligence\u201d was held effective to bar suit for both causes of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In <em>Lenny\u2019s Inc. v. Allied Sign Erectors, Inc., </em>170 <em>Ga.App. </em>706, 318 <em>S.E.2d </em>140 (1984), a provision in a lease of a fire detection system limited damages for negligent performance. The provision was held ineffective in a case of willful and wanton conduct. In <em>Carriage Meat Co., Inc. v. Honeywell, Inc. </em>442 So.2d 796 (La.App.1983), a contract to monitor the temperature of a commercial freezer limited liability for negligent nonperformance. The clause was held not to apply to willful failure to perform or other deliberate disregard of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Florida has held that an exculpatory clause in a burglar alarm contract barring suit for negligent performance also bars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>suit charging gross negligence, but not intentional tort. <em>L. Luria, &amp; Son, Inc. v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>460 So.2d 521 (Fla.App. 1984); <em>Rollins, Inc. v. Heller, </em>454 So.2d 580 (Fla. 3rd DCA 1984), reh. den. 461 So.2d 114 (Fla.1985). One federal court, applying Pennsylvania law, has ruled the other way in a case factually like this one. <em>Douglas W. Randall, Inc. v. AFA Protective Systems, </em>516 <em>F.Supp. </em>1122 (E.D.Pa.1981), aff\u2019d 688 F.2d 820 (3 Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The trial court ruled that plaintiff\u2019s evidence, viewed most favorably and indulgently, was insufficient to show \u201creckless disregard of consequences.\u201d We agree that there was insufficient evidence for the jury reasonably to have found willful and wanton misconduct. Defendant\u2019s conduct was, at worst, negligent misjudgment in interpreting the sounds emanating from plaintiff\u2019s premises during the break-in. For that reason, the trial court was correct in limiting plaintiff\u2019s recovery to the amount permitted by the contract in cases of defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\"> The trial court correctly viewed plaintiffs $800 investment in equipment as insufficient to estop defendant from terminating the $5,000 guarantee. It also correctly found no element of coercion or unequal bargaining power in the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> To that extent, we are constrained to disagree with portions of <em>Kuzmiak v. Brookchester, supra, </em>and <em>Swisscraft Novelty Co. v. Alad Realty Corp., supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\"> We do not decide whether such a broad exculpatory clause would be enforceable in New Jersey. We merely note that the parties and the court recognized that there were two distinct causes of action and dealt with them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
