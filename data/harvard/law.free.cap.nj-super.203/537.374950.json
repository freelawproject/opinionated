The remittances, with interest, totaled $101,603.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-16(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-13\">(e) any employing unit or any officer or agent of an employing unit, employer or person failing to remit, when payable, any employer contributions, or worker contributions (if withheld or deducted), or the amount of such worker contributions (if not withheld or deducted), or filing or causing to be filed with the Division of Employment Security of the Department of Labor and Industry of the State of New Jersey, any false or fraudulent report or statement, and any person who aids or abets an employing unit, employer, or any person in the preparation of filing of any false or fraudulent report or statement with the aforesaid division with intent to defraud the aforesaid division or the State of New Jersey or an employment security agency of any other State or of the Federal Government, or with intent to evade the payment of any contributions, interest or penalties, or any part thereof, which shall be due under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>provisions of this chapter-(R.S. 43:21-1 et seq.), shall be liable for each offense upon conviction before any County Court, county district court, criminal judicial district court, or magistrate\u2019s court, to a fine not to exceed $1,000 or by imprisonment for a term not to exceed 90 days, or both, at the discretion of the court. The fine upon conviction shall be payable to the unemployment compensation auxiliary fund of the Division of Employment Security of the Department of Labor and Industry of the State of New Jersey. Any penalties imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to those otherwise prescribed in this chapter. (R.S. 43:21-1 et seq.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The six complaints were filed April 30, 1980 and the case was listed for hearing on June 17, 1980. The record reveals that a number of adjournments were granted and the matter was rescheduled for September 24, 1980. The taped record of that hearing (or the typist\u2019s interpretation of it) is not of good quality. The transcript before us is sometimes difficult to follow but what occurred at that hearing we translate as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">On that date defendant appeared without a lawyer. He explained that the lawyer had \u201cpulled away from the case\u201d because he had not been paid, defendant stated he had no money to pay a lawyer and he explained that he had only \u201cfound out two days ago he [the lawyer] wasn\u2019t going to stay on the case because of nonpayment.\u201d Defendant asserted he had \u201ccalled the court [that] morning and found out his court case was on today.\u201d He explained that his mail, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cParker Avenue Contracting mail was being sent to One Century (phonetic) City\u201d and \u201c[t]hey are not accepting the mail, so I never got notice.\u201d He sought another adjournment. The State objected on the ground that the case had been scheduled June 17th, July 7th, August 4th and then September 24th. Apparently there were other adjournments necessitated by a conflict defendant\u2019s original attorney had whereby he could not appear in the matter. This conflict caused the retention of another attorney, the one who did not appear because he was not paid. The prosecutor acknowledged that defendant\u2019s second attorney had \u201csent a letter which was received by my office yesterday pertaining that (undiscernible) did not receive this retainer____\u201d Apparently the prosecutor had a copy of another letter that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>attorney had sent to the court dated August 7th seeking an adjournment (of the September 24th date?); the record does not disclose what action was taken on that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">It is difficult to get much from this rather poor record but defendant apparently was then without a lawyer and the lawyer had withdrawn two days before the hearing because defendant did not or could not pay his retainer. Defendant, if credible, had no notice as to when the matter was to be heard, apparently because mail was sent to a place which refused to accept it; defendant also claimed he had \u201cbeen calling the court every week to find out when this case was on\u201d and that he claimed he finally found out the morning of the hearing that the case was on that very day. We cannot assess defendant\u2019s credibility as to those assertions but he apparently also attempted to state that he had a defense, that he had \u201cpapers\u201d he wanted to bring into court \u201cbecause there is criminal charges here and that is the part that bothers me.\u201d Just what that defense was is impossible to apprehend from this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">It is apparent that the municipal court judge was frustrated with the numerous adjournments and particularly annoyed with defendant\u2019s latest request. It is also obvious that he felt defendant probably had no defense to the charges, as the following colloquy demonstrates.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">THE COURT: You can\u2019t put off the inevitable here by continually asking for an adjournment, by not paying an attorney, by putting it off and putting it off. Eventually you are going to have to face this situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">MR. PALADINO: Your Honor to be very honest with you because I didn\u2019t have the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">THE COURT: Well that is the problem that you are here for right? You don\u2019t have money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">MR. PALADINO: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">THE COURT: That is why the State is on your back, right? Alright now [the prosecutor] has in my experience has handled the situation in a way that I always thought was fair and one of the things he has been able to do is that once a guilty plea has been entered I can postpone sentencing and allow you an opportunity to pay the monies that you owe to the State. That is one alternative. The other alternative is for you to try this case today and prove to me that you don\u2019t owe them money which on the record, I will tell you frankly, I know you are going to have a heck of a problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>MR. PALADINO: Your Honor may I ask a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">THE COURT: Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">MR. PALADINO: Being that I don\u2019t have an attorney I am looking for both of you gentlemen to help me out a little bit okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">MR. PALADINO: If I plead guilty to the charges what I understand Parker Avenue General Contracting does owe this money in fact, I am not going to deny that, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">MR. PALADINO: But if I did plead guilty today and would I have time to bring the documents and everything in to a regular Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">THE COURT: It would not change the verdict. Once you plead guilty you would be guilty. Then you still have the problem of paying the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">\u00ab\u00a1je******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\">MR. PALADINO: Well I could get the money your Honor from the Continental Bank. You see Mr. Slater for RSK Construction for which I subcontracted for is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, so whatever the bank was doing they just stopped dispersing funds for that reason.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>THE COURT: Well the point is that this complaint against you must be heard today, either you are going to try it and say I am not guilty and try your case, or you are going to enter a plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">MR. PALADINO: Well your Honor to be honest with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t have any other choices is what I am telling you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Thereafter the judge again denied defendant\u2019s request for an adjournment and told defendant \u201cyou are left with a choice of trying this case on your own <em>pro se. </em>\u201d When defendant asked what would happen if he pleaded guilty the judge stated that although he could not tell him the sentence in advance, \u201cI can tell you that it has been my custom not to incarcerate anyone if there is no prior violation.\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cI will plead guilty okay. <em>I will go through the motions and then who do I see after that to get this money collected?\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">In our view of the matter, the portion we have emphasized illustrates defendant\u2019s probable state of mind toward the dilemma he was in: he could not personally try the case; he was told he probably would not go to jail; he did not feel he was personally guilty (see the footnote, <em>ante)] </em>he could not afford to pay the large sum due to the State, but he thought he could get the persons responsible to come up with restitution. We note that at an earlier point he had asked the judge whether \u201cif I did plead guilty today and would I have time to bring the documents and everything in to a regular court?\u201d Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the judge then told him that once he pleaded guilty he would \u201cstill have the problem of paying the money\u201d it is apparent that defendant nevertheless believed the burden of restitution would not be his to bear. As we shall shortly demonstrate, he misapprehended the effect of his guilty plea; he was given a suspended 90 day sentence and placed on probation for one year conditioned upon payment, within that time, of the more than $100,000 due to the State. Our view is also borne out by the fact that after the judge explained that under the law the court could fine defendant $1,000 and impose up to 90 days in jail on each charge, defendant remarked that he understood but he wanted nevertheless \u201cto get the money.\u201d No one explained to defendant that while he might not go to jail he could be subject to an order requiring him to personally pay, $101,-603.41, within one year, as a condition of probation. <em>R. </em>7:4-2(b) requires the court when taking a plea to determine, among other things, that the plea is made \u201cvoluntarily with understanding of ... the consequences of the plea.\u201d <em>Cf. State v. Kovak, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>476, 484 (1982) (sentence improperly imposed pursuant to a plea agreement where defendant had no understanding that a period of parole ineligibility could accompany the sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Defendant then pleaded guilty, his plea was accepted and sentencing was scheduled for October 29, 1980. No attention was paid to the requirement of <em>R. </em>7:4-2(b) that the court \u201cshall not accept such plea without first addressing the defendant personally and determining by inquiry of the defendant and of others in the court\u2019s discretion that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea and that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> We pause in our recitation of the facts of this case to observe that the rule is clear and needs no case citation to support its mandate that a plea of guilty must be supported by the establishment of a factual basis for that plea. We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>observe that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-16(e) imposes the duty to remit \u201cemployer or worker contributions upon any\u201d employing unit \u201cor any officer or agent of an employing unit.\u201d An employing unit is defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(g) as \u201cany individual or type of organization ... which had in its employ 1 or more individuals performing services within this State.\u201d This was not factually developed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(h)(1), (2) and (3) gives three specific definitions of the term \u201cemployer\u201d, none of which was here factually demonstrated. Most importantly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-16(e) is clearly not a <em>per se </em>or strict liability statute, the intent to evade or defraud the State is the essential element of a charge brought pursuant to that section of the act. <em>State v. Witrak, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>526, 529-532 (App.Div.1984). The question of defendant\u2019s intent, as it applies to the apparent facts of this case, becomes more important as we will illustrate by continuing our discussion of what happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Sentencing was postponed to December 10, 1980. Defendant appeared on that date with an attorney other than the one who presently represents defendant, one \u201crecently\u201d retained. It was then that defendant\u2019s possible defense to the charges was indicated. The attorney moved for the withdrawal of the guilty plea. He explained that at the previous hearing of September 24,1980 defendant \u201cwas to be represented by an attorney [who] was to be paid by some other company and [the attorney] was not paid and [defendant] was unable to afford an attorney at that time.\u201d He urged that defendant was not guilty because although he was \u201cin charge of disbursing and paying taxes,\u201d his \u201cposition is that the money was never paid to him by the corporations that were to pay the taxes in. Consequently, he never paid these taxes out.\u201d The attorney explained that defendant contended \u201che never saw ten cents of this money ... he was a middle man and the money never came to him, so he couldn\u2019t pay the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">We again interrupt the narration of facts and procedure to observe that the somewhat sketchy representations made to support the informal motion to withdraw defendant\u2019s guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>plea are similar to the more extensive recitation of the facts of defendant\u2019s defense set forth in our footnote on pages 542-543. Those assertions, if true, suggest defendant was the nominal president of what may be a paper corporation created by Slater, a principal of Orangegate Construction Inc., to function as a \u201cpayroll service\u201d for Orangegate to issue checks to Orangegate\u2019s employees. Although this arrangement <em>may </em>have put an obligation on defendant to see to the payments required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-16(e) (the State so contends), that question cannot be determined on this record. We observe that defendant\u2019s apparent defense is that his function was ministerial, <em>i.e., </em>neither he nor \u201chis\u201d corporation was the \u201cemployer\u201d or an \u201cemploying unit\u201d of the workers being paid and because Orangegate never funded his corporation\u2019s account with the sums required to be remitted to the State, he could not pay the contributions required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-16(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">It is unfortunate that full inquiry was not made before the plea was accepted on September 24, 1980. Equally lamentable, is the refusal of the same municipal judge, who when later faced with an outline of a defense on the motion to withdraw the plea made before sentencing, failed to consider the possibility that he had perhaps acted preciptitiously on September 24, 1980 when he was displeased with the number of adjournments and apparently felt that defendant was, as he noted, \u201cgoing to have a heck of a problem\u201d proving his claimed innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The State opposed the motion to permit withdrawal of the guilty plea by emphasizing the number of previous adjournments, and arguing that defendant had a nondelegable duty to remit the required contributions. Defendant\u2019s counsel urged that the facts of the defense were complicated and although his client \u201ccan try to explain them\u201d but if there were a trial or at least a hearing, \u201cat least the court would, firsthand, have witnesses to testify as to exactly what the situation is ... at least the court [would have] the benefit of knowing the factual basis or the factual situation in imposing sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The judge held that \u201cthere was undue delay in bringing this matter to a conclusion.\u201d He held \u201cthe statute is clear\u201d and, primarily on those bases, denied the motion to retract the plea. He sentenced defendant to concurrent 90 day terms on the six complaints and placed him on probation for one year conditioned upon defendant making restitution of the more than $100,000 figure \u201cduring that period.\u201d No hearing was held to determine if defendant was capable of paying such a sum in that relatively short time.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The process of ordering restitution implicates due process rights. <em>State in the Interest of D.G.W., </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>488, 501, 503 (1976). Although a court may have the discretionary right to impose restitution as a condition of probation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, <em>State v. Harris, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>586, 591-593 (1976), settled law requires the court to conduct at least a summary hearing. Restitution is regarded as rehabilitative in nature, it is not punitive nor is it retributive. <em>State v. Harris, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 592-593. Thus, a determination of the amount the defendant can pay and the time within which he can reasonably do so is implicated in the process. <em>State in the Interest of D.G.W., </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 504-505.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In sum, the procedures here followed by the municipal court both in the taking of the plea and in the sentencing process were clearly contrary to established due process created to serve the interests of justice, those of an ordered society and to protect the rights of defendants as well. Had the matter been timely presented to the Law Division, pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:23, reversal of the conviction and a remand should have been a foregone conclusion. Regrettably, that was not the course taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">For reasons not explained, no appeal was taken from the judgment of conviction entered on December 10, 1980. The next action undertaken occurred on May 25, 1983 when defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ant\u2019s present counsel brought a motion in the same municipal court, but before a new judge, for a \u201cnew trial\u201d pursuant to <em>R. </em>7:4-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The motion was supported by a memorandum which argued the absence of a factual basis for defendant\u2019s plea and that Parker Avenue General was never an \u201cemployer\u201d or an \u201cemploying unit\u201d as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-16(e). The memorandum added the additional but as yet unsupported fact that defendant as its president and Patricia Caruso, another officer, were paid for the services they rendered by Orangegate Construction, Inc. It offered to prove this by the testimony of defendant, Ms. Caruso and corporate records. The memorandum also offered to prove by corporate records and the testimony of defendant, Caruso and Orangegate\u2019s attorney that Parker Avenue General was a corporation formed by Robert Slater to act \u201cexclusively as a \u2018payroll company\u2019 for Orangegate Construction, Inc. to issue payroll checks\u201d to its Orangegate\u2019s employees who were engaged in the construction; that only Orangegate hired, fired and controlled those employees; that Parker Avenue General\u2019s only source of funds was a weekly deposit into its account, made by Orangegate \u201cto cover payroll and related expenses;\u201d that simultaneously with such deposits Orangegate\u2019s bookkeeper would present payroll checks, completed as to payees and amounts, to be signed by defendant and Caruso; that Orangegate not only failed to remit to the State the payments required by the statute but \u201cnever funded Parker\u2019s account therefor,\u201d and that defendant never received nor had access to monies withheld by Orangegate for the taxes in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The memorandum urged that because the court had \u201cfailed to make inquiry of the defendant, or other persons, the convictions <em>sub judiee, </em>have no basis.\u201d It argued that had proper inquiry been made the convictions would not have been entered. Counsel argued that there was thus no \u201cjurisdictional basis\u201d for the convictions. This rather convulated jurisdictional argument appears to be engendered by the passage of almost 31 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>from the entry of the judgment of conviction, and seems to be the offspring of counsel\u2019s conclusion that the only remedy available was a motion for a new trial under <em>R. </em>7:4-7, the last sentence of which places no time limit where the motion is based \u201con the ground of ... lack of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">No logical <em>nexus </em>exists, between the judicial failures of which plaintiff complains and jurisdiction. Accordingly, the motion for a new trial received short shrift in the Municipal Court and on appeal to the Law Division. Both judges held defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">That does not mean that defendant is without a remedy. The situation here was one where the court had jurisdiction but failed to afford due process. The plea of guilty thus obtained and the sentence imposed upon that plea was illegal. It is well established that an illegal sentence is correctible at any time. <em>State v. Sheppard, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332, 336 (App. Div.1973), certif. den. 64 <em>N.J. </em>318 (1973). A court may do so <em>sua sponte. State v. James, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>173, 178-179 (App.Div.1979), certif. den. 81 <em>N.J. </em>343 (1979). Basic concepts of justice and fair dealing require that this be so. Defendant\u2019s motion, of May 25, 1983, although styled as one for a new trial, attempted to direct the trial court\u2019s attention to the legal deficiencies of the original plea and judgment of conviction. The record of those proceedings facially demonstrated the illegality of the plea and the sentence. Although defendant\u2019s application was misdirected, <em>State v. Sheppard </em>and <em>State v. Strupp, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>94 (App.Div.1968) make it clear that \u201can illegal sentence becomes \u2018inoperative in [its] entirety and [is] properly vacated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sheppard, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 336 (quoting <em>State v. Strupp, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 98). The municipal judge before whom the 1983 misguided motion was placed had the power to correct the unjust result by vacating the illegal conviction. The power to punish offenders granted to a court would seem \u201cnaturally to include the power to correct sentences imposed by it.\u201d <em>State v. Culver, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>495, 504 (1957), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>cert. </em>den. 354 <em>U.S. </em>925, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>1387, 1 L.Ed.2d 1441 (1957). That power is inherent and requires no specific grant by statute or rule of court. <em>Culver </em>holds that where a sentence imposed was in fact improper the court\u2019s jurisdiction to impose a correct sentence does not expire until a valid sentence is imposed. 23 <em>N.J. </em>at 510-511. It can be said with equal force that the same rationale requires vacation of an illegal sentence imposed upon an illegally taken plea, regardless of the time such relief is sought. <em>See also R. </em>3:22-12 which provides, as to post conviction relief petitions, that a \u201cpetition to correct an illegal sentence may be filed at any time.\u201d In any event, our rules of court are required to be \u201cconstrued to secure a just determination\u201d and in the absence of a specific rule our courts are instructed to \u201cproceed in any manner compatible with\u201d such purpose. <em>R. </em>1:1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The plea of guilty and the judgment of conviction are vacated. The matter is remanded to the Municipal Court of Fort Lee for trial. Jurisdiction is not retained.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-14\"> Defendant\u2019s present counsel asserts what the defense would have been. She states the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">Parker Avenue General Contracting Corporation (Parker Avenue) was neither an \u201cEmployer\u201d nor an \"Employing Unit.\u201d Parker Avenue was formed at the direction of one Robert Slater, President and principal owner of Orangegate Construction, Inc., to function, and did function, exclusively, as a \"Payroll service\u201d for Orangegate Construction, Inc. (Orangegate), to issue payroll checks to persons engaged and employed by Orangegate in the construction of Century Towers, a complex of luxury high-rise apartments in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The construction workers were hired and fired by Orangegate, and Orangegate supervised, directed and controlled their work. Neither Parker Avenue, nor its two nominal officers, defendant, John Paladino and Patricia Caruso, hired, fired, supervised, directed or controlled the workers or their work, and neither or them had the right, power or authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">Parker Avenue's only source of funds was Orangegate which, weekly, made a deposit to cover payroll and related union-contributions into Parker Avenue's account. And, each week, Orangegate\u2019s bookkeeper would draw and present for the signatures of defendant, John Paladino and Patricia Caruso net payroll checks that were completed as to payees and amounts. Orangegate never funded Parker Avenue's account with either the monies retained as employer and worker contributions, or with any additional monies for such purposes. Consequently, Parker Avenue, and thus defendant, John Paladino never received, had access to, or deprived the State of New Jersey of the monies withheld by Orangegate.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Finally, defendant, John Paladino, as well as Patricia Caruso, were compensated for the \u201cpayroll services\u201d they performed for Orangegate, and not by Parker Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">Thus, the responsibility for collecting and remitting employer and worker contributions to the State of New Jersey rested solely with Orangegate.</p>\n<p id=\"AKY\">We observe that marshalling of the witnesses and evidence to demonstrate these contentions and the courtroom presentation of this evidence does not appear to be a task most layman would readily accomplish. The foregoing assertions by counsel are not supported by any affidavits.
