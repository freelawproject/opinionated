Clegg (\u201cRobert\u201d), when it was struck by another vehicle owned and operated by William Kovalski, now deceased. Defendant Mary Smeltzer (\u201cSmeltzer\u201d) was a passenger in the Clegg vehicle at the time of the accident. The parties appear to concur that Kovalski\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of the accident, although the record does not confirm whether such a determination has been conclusively made. Carol and Smeltzer were seriously injured. Robert was deprived of Carol\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Kovalski\u2019s automobile insurance policy issued by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company provided for $100,000 combined single limit coverage. The Cleggs and Smeltzer recovered $43,688.33 respectively from the Kovalski policy, representing an equal allocation of the available benefits under that policy after payment to the lessor for damage to the Kovalski vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">At the time of the accident, Robert and Smeltzer each were insured for single limit UIM coverage of $500,000 under their respective automobile policies. Since the institution of this action, an arbitration panel has determined Carol\u2019s damages to be $575,000, and Robert\u2019s loss of consortium damages to be $75,000. Smeltzer\u2019s insurance carrier has stipulated that her damages exceed $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Robert Clegg, individually and t/a Smeltzer Realty Co., is the insured named on the Declarations sheet of a policy issued by defendant Camden Fire Insurance Association (\u201cCamden\u201d). As we note <em>infra, </em>Carol is treated identically in the Camden policy with the named insured shown in the Declarations, because she is a spouse resident in the same household. By contrast, Smeltzer is an insured person under the Camden policy because of her status as an occupant of a covered auto. Smeltzer\u2019s own UIM coverage is written under a policy issued by defendant New Jersey Full Insurance Underwriting Association (\u201cJUA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The present controversy arose when the Cleggs and Smeltzer presented UIM claims to their own carriers for the full amount of their respective UIM coverages. The claims of each would exhaust their own UIM coverage. Because of proration provisions in the two policies, however, a question arose whether Smeltzer was entitled to share equally in the UIM coverage provided under the Clegg policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The Cleggs sought arbitration with Camden pursuant to a clause in their contract of insurance. Unsuccessful in effecting arbitration, the Cleggs filed an Order to Show Cause and Verified Complaint in the Law Division naming as defendants Camden, JUA and Smeltzer. After hearing, the trial judge entered an Order for Judgment which, among other things, compelled arbitration of the Cleggs\u2019 claim and declared that JUA was not entitled to <em>pro rata </em>or other contribution from the Camden policy. Finding UIM coverage to be \u201cpersonal\u201d to the insured, the judge ruled that each policyholder should recover under his own policy and thereby receive what he had bargained and paid for. In the judge\u2019s view, the proration provisions were not authorized by statute, legislative intent or interpretive case law, and should not be enforced to reduce the Clegg\u2019s recovery for their own injuries to less than the UIM limits they purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">JUA then filed this appeal, contending that Smeltzer, as a passenger, was entitled to share equally in the UIM benefits provided under the Cleggs\u2019 policy with Camden.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pending disposition of the appeal, each carrier has paid its own policyholders 50% of their unsatisfied UIM claim and deposited the remaining 50% with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The policies in issue each contain a clause which refers to proration of benefit payments when more than one policy covers a given loss. The Camden policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>OTHER INSURANCE * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">For any covered auto you don\u2019t own, the insurance provided ... is excess over any other collectible insurance. When two or more policies cover <em>on the same basis, either excess or primary, </em>we will pay only our share. Our share is the proportion that the limit of our policy bears to the total of the limits of all the policies covering <em>on the same basis.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">(emphasis supplied). The corresponding provision of Smeltzer\u2019s JUA policy reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">OTHER INSURANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">If there is <em>other similar insurance </em>we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all <em>applicable limits.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">However, any insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own ... shall be excess over any other collectible insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">The trial judge\u2019s characterization of UIM coverage as \u201cpersonal\u201d to the insured has some support in that the coverage is linked to the insured rather than to the covered vehicle. <em>See Fernandez, v. Selected Risks Ins. Co., </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>236, 241, 412 A.2d 755 (1980). UIM furnishes coverage both supplemental and optional, \u201cprovid[ing] as much coverage as the insured is willing to purchase,\u201d <em>Nikiper v. Motor Club of America, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393, 399, 557 <em>A.2d </em>332 (App.Div.), <em>certif. den., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>139, 564 A.2d 863 (1989), for his or her protection subject only to the owner\u2019s policy liability limits for personal injury and property damage to others. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.lb. The UIM mechanism assures that an insured will receive benefits up to the amount contracted for, whether these come from the tortfeasor\u2019s policy or from that policy coupled with his own. <em>See Landi v. Gray, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>619, 624, 550 A.2d 768 (App.Div. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">Whether the Cleggs\u2019 UIM coverage under their policy must be prorated hinges largely on the construction given to the \u201csame basis\u201d language of their policy with Camden. Under its terms, Carol is \u201cnamed insured,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to be treated identically with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>her husband for all coverages provided. Smeltzer\u2019s basis for insurance under the Cleggs\u2019 UM/UIM endorsement, however, is only as an occupant of a vehicle covered by the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Smeltzer is not insured \u201con the same basis\u201d as the Cleggs. Whether the Camden policy is \u201csimilar insurance\u201d within the meaning of the JUA policy may be more uncertain, but we do not see this as relevant in determining primacy of the Cleggs\u2019 UIM claim to the full extent of their own policy. In short, any unused portion might be \u201ccollectible\u201d by Smeltzer on a prorated basis but only if the primary insurance afforded to those insured \u201con the same basis\u201d under the Camden policy is first applied for the benefit of the named insureds who purchased the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">This accords with our long-standing practice of interpreting policy provisions based upon objectively reasonable expectations of the insureds. <em>Werner Indus., Inc. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>30, 35, 548 <em>A. </em>2d 188 (1988). Such reasonable expectations may govern construction even in absence of ambiguity, in recognition of the generally one-sided nature of insurance contracts. <em>See id., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 35-36, 548 A 2d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Given the discretionary nature of UIM coverage, a purchaser would reasonably and objectively expect that he is buying such protection up to the declared limits primarily for himself and his resident spouse. An intention to prefer passengers to the purchasers\u2019 own interests is, in our view, unrealistic and not objectively reasonable. For most purchasers of insurance, passengers would be but incidental beneficiaries of the UIM contract. This interpretation is borne out by the automobile insurance Buyer\u2019s Guide, mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-23 and distributed to each prospective purchaser. The description of UIM emphasizes the personal nature of the security afforded and the apparent certainty of available benefits to the amount purchased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">When you buy uninsured motorist coverage, you are also provided coverage to protect you <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from those motorists who are underinsured. If you are in an accident caused by such a motorist, underinsured motorist coverage will pay damages up to the difference between your underinsured motorist coverage limit and the other driver's liability coverage limit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-15.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">To construe the policies, as JUA urges, to permit proration of benefits payable to Smeltzer operates to deny the Cleggs full benefit of the first-party coverage they were reasonably entitled to believe they had purchased. Given this construction, Smeltzer would not have \u201ccollectible\u201d UIM insurance available from the Clegg policy, unless the Cleggs\u2019 own damages were less than $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Our holding, we believe, harmonizes the language of the policies with that of the statute which authorizes it. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-l.lb refers to provision of UIM coverage to \u201cthe named insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Paragraph 17:28-l.le of the statute defines \u201cunderinsured\u201d in terms of a comparison of the tortfeasor\u2019s available liability limits and the UIM limits under the policy \u201cheld by the person seeking that recovery,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>the policyhold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>er. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1e. <em>See also Gold v. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 276, 558 A.2d 854 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Our opinion does not reach nor approve the trial judge\u2019s apparent view that UIM proration provisions are unauthorized by statute or precedent. It is unnecessary for us now to resolve what the proration rights of JUA might have been were the Cleggs\u2019 damages lower than their UIM maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Camden has not participated in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-13\">Page 1 of the Camden policy reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>AGREEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZe\">In return for payment of the premium ..., we agree with you as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQc\">DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfE\">Throughout this policy, \"you\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amqo\">1.
