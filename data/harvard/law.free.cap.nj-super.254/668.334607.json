Featherston was also indicted for using a remotely activated paging device during the commission of the possession with intent to distribute, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-20 (count two). Defendants were jointly represented and tried together. They were both convicted on count one, and Featherston was convicted on count two. Medina was sentenced to an indeterminate term, not to exceed 5 years, and fined $1,000. A $2,000 DEDR penalty and $30 VCCB penalty and $50 lab fee were also imposed. Her driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months. Featherston received an indeterminate term not to exceed 7 years for the possessory offense and a concurrent indeterminate 18 month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>sentence for the illegal use of a paging device. Featherston was fined $2,000, received a $2,000 DEDR penalty, aggregate $60 VCCB penalty and $50 lab fee. His license was also suspended for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On this appeal defendants jointly argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">POINT I EVIDENCE ELICITED ON CROSS-EXAMINATION REGARDING DEFENDANT FEATHERSTON\u2019S PRIOR ARREST WAS CLEARLY INADMISSIBLE AND PREJUDICIAL AND, THEREFORE, A NEW TRIAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">POINT II THE CONVICTIONS WERE TAINTED BY PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT AND, THEREFORE, SHOULD BE REVERSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">POINT III THE JURY CHARGE WAS IMPROPER AND, THEREFORE, A NEW TRIAL SHOULD BE GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">A.

The investigation led to surveillance of Featherston\u2019s home in Franklin Township and ultimately to the issuance on July 7, 1990 of a search warrant which authorized a search of Featherston\u2019s person, his residence and his car, and the 1985 silver Nissan belonging to his girlfriend, defendant Medina.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">After procuring the warrant, the raid team determined that Featherston was not at home and \u201cdisbursed throughout Franklin Township trying to locate\u201d Featherston or his vehicle. They ultimately received information that Featherston would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>in the area of Route 27 near the Four Musketeers Restaurant \"for a possible drug transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">At approximately 9:30 p.m. on July 7, 1990 the police observed Featherston and Medina entering the Four Musketeers Restaurant. The two subsequently left the restaurant and entered Medina\u2019s car which the police stopped on Route 27. Detective Fitzgerald and Officer Price \u201capproached the vehicle ... and relayed to Michael Featherston that [they] in fact did have a search warrant for his person, the vehicle, [and] his residence.\u201d A patdown of Featherston revealed an \u201cactivated\u201d \u201cpaging device\u201d which was turned on and capable of receiving incoming calls. While the police did not conduct a thorough search of the vehicle at that time, they did conduct a brief search of the car for weapons and, finding none, \u201csecured\u201d the vehicle. They thereafter went to search Featherston\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">At trial, Lieutenant Andrew Racz of the Somerset County Prosecutor\u2019s Office testified that he had a conversation with Featherston as the house was being searched. According to Racz, Featherston volunteered to aid the police in the apprehension of one Jose Crespo who, approximately six months earlier, \u201cwas a target of a previous investigation\u201d in which \u201ca quantity of CDS and money ... and a weapon was seized.\u201d Featherston told Racz that \u201cCrespo had stopped at his [Featherston\u2019s] house the previous Saturday and wanted him to travel to New York City to purchase a quarter pound of cocaine.\u201d Featherston further indicated that he was \u201cwilling to cooperate\u201d with the police in \u201can effort to arrest this Mr. Crespo in the process of purchasing this cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Following the conversation, Detective Stuart Buckman of the Somerset County Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed Racz that the search of Featherston\u2019s bedroom led to discovery of a loaded \u201cnine millimeter Beretta handgun\u201d (for which Featherston had a permit) with \u201ca clip with bullets in the gun and a clip next to the gun.\u201d Buckman noted that the gun \u201cwasn\u2019t like a stored weapon in a gun case, it was found loaded under a cushion,\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Featherston\u2019s bedroom. Ammunition was also discovered, as were lists of names and numbers identified as \u201cdrug lists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Following his conversation with Featherston, Racz undertook a complete search of the Medina vehicle which produced \u201ca plastic bag containing a white granular substance.\u201d After \u201cretrieving\u201d the plastic bag from the trunk, Racz \u201centered the residence,\u201d and \u201cimmediately upon seeing [Racz] with [the] bag\u201d Featherston told the Lieutenant \u201c[o]h that\u2019s nothing, that\u2019s just soap powder that I used to get the stains out of my jeans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Racz gave the bag to Detective Fitzgerald and requested that he \u201cfield test the substance.\u201d However, the test was not conducted because, although they had a \u201cmarijuana field test kit,\u201d they \u201cdidn\u2019t have a cocaine field test kit\u201d with them at the time. Racz informed Featherston that the substance \u201cwould be sent to the State Police Lab for a positive identification\u201d and that Racz would conduct a field test on the substance when he returned to headquarters. Defendants were not then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Featherston testified at trial and claimed that the police did test the substance taken from the car in a \u201cvial\u201d or \u201ctest tube\u201d and discovered that it was \u201csoap.\u201d According to Featherston, Fitzgerald reported to the others, \u201cI can\u2019t believe we got soap.\u201d Featherston also testified that the lists of people, with numbers beside the names, retrieved from his bedroom did not relate to drugs. Rather, they were members of a softball team to which he belonged or the names of \u201cpeople who owed money to Diane [Medina] or myself for loans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Medina also testified at the trial and verified Featherston\u2019s assertions regarding the lists seized during the search. She testified that on her eighteenth birthday in November 1989 she received the proceeds of a settlement from a car accident which amounted to $72,000.00. She further testified that she gave $25,000 to her parents and spent the rest by sponsoring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>softball team and lending money to the people on the list.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Racz testified that upon returning to BADT headquarters, he performed a field test on the confiscated substance and that the result was \u201cin fact positive for cocaine.\u201d According to Racz, when Featherston was told of the results, he \u201caccused\u201d Racz of \u201cputting cocaine into that substance.\u201d According to Racz, \u201cbecause of those accusations, allegations ... I was told not to cooperate with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Eve Momyer, a woman who lived with Featherston\u2019s father, Leonard Michael, testified that she and the father arrived at the home during the search at approximately 12:15 a.m. of July 8, 1990. After the police left the premises, Ms. Momyer noticed \u201cparaphernalia sitting on the desk.\u201d Featherston\u2019s father identified it as \u201ctesting equipment\u201d consisting of \u201can individual test tube, another box and a small packet of smaller test tubes.\u201d Ms. Momyer and Leonard Michael put the items into a plastic bag and on October 19, 1990 took them \u201cto Winston labs for analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">State Police Senior Forensic Scientist Songza Park testified for the State that, as of the summer of 1988, \u201cthe law was changed\u201d and chemists who test for CDS did not have to \u201cdo quantitation on the specimens and the weight goes out as it is.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Park found there were \u201ctwo distinctive textures of powder forms in the specimen.\u201d The detergent was on the bottom, and \u201con the top in the corner it was pure white powder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>... that was cocaine.\u201d She determined the \u201ctotal gross weight\u201d of the specimen to be 26.23 grams, a quantity greater than \u201ca trace amount of cocaine.\u201d The defendants\u2019 expert Marvin Winston testified that he tested a vial brought to him by Featherston\u2019s father and concluded \u201cthere was no cocaine in the vial.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to a court order, Winston also performed a chemical analysis on the same sample tested by Park and found \u201conly basically a possible trace of cocaine present.\u201d Brian O\u2019Brien, another defense expert, testified that the 26 grams contained \u201cpoint zero zero two percent\u201d or a \u201ctrace amount\u201d of cocaine reflecting what he called an \u201caccidental mixture.\u201d In O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion, \u201cthis product is not distributable. It would be offensive and abrasive for somebody to use.\u201d He said \u201c[i]t has no value in the drug market. It could not be distributed to anyone.\u201d O\u2019Brien also testified that CDS distribution usually evidences \u201cweighing devices ... packaging devices [and] ... large sums of money,\u201d none of which were confiscated by police from the home or car.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">As part of the State\u2019s case Sergeant Timothy Wenzel of the Somerset County Prosecutor\u2019s Office testified, as an expert, that the quantity of cocaine involved \u201cwould not be typical[ly],\u201d for mere use, and that the weapons and bullets, lists with numbers thereon, beeper and other observations by the police were \u201ctypical of somebody possessing cocaine for distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Featherston argues that on his cross-examination the prosecutor improperly extracted evidence of a prior arrest and therefore he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">In a certification supporting his pretrial motion for additional discovery designed to obtain the expert analysis, Featherston detailed his defense and stated that Racz told him \u201cthat if I did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>not cooperate (I believe he wanted me to do some controlled buys), he would put the screws to me.\u201d Featherston further stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">I believe that members of the raid party added cocaine to the soap. I know that members of the Franklin Township Police Department were well aware of the fact that I was arrested and charged with a drug offense as a juvenile. These charges were subsequently dismissed. I believe that members of the Franklin Police Department have the incentive to frame me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On his direct testimony at trial, Featherston testified that, in response to a statement made during the search about a tip the police received, he told Racz that about a month before \u201csome dude named Poppo came to my front door, forced his way in and said he had a proposition for me, him and his friend.\u201d He testified he was offered \u201c$4000 to go to New York to buy a quarter pound of cocaine\u201d for him, but that he told Poppo that he was \u201cnuts ... [t]hat ain\u2019t me, man\u201d and refused. According to Featherston, after he \u201crecounted this story to Drew Racz,\u201d the Lieutenant denied any involvement in the incident and said it was \u201cthe first we have heard of it.\u201d As \u201cPoppo\u201d was a former coworker, Featherston offered to find his address, and Racz asked him to \u201cget in touch with me in a couple days with any information you got on him or anybody else.\u201d Featherston responded, \u201cI can do that ... That won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Racz left his name and telephone and beeper numbers on a business card that was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">According to Featherston, Racz called him shortly thereafter, at 3:30 in the morning, and said \u201cI got some bad news for you, kiddo. That soap we took from you has turned into cocaine.\u201d According to defendant, when Featherston said \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to it, but I am telling you that stuff was soap,\u201d Racz suggested that he \u201cjust admit to it ... [i]t would be a lot easier on you.\u201d When Featherston pointed out that he saw the soap tested, Racz said \u201c[n]o, you didn\u2019t ... That was the THC tester\u201d and \u201c[fjorget about what happened there.\u201d He said that if the substance tested \u201cpositive\u201d by the State Police defendant would be charged with possession with intent \u201c[a]nd that holds a lot of weight in Somerset County\u201d for which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>would \u201cgo away for ten years if you get convicted of that.\u201d Featherston told Racz \u201cI don\u2019t want to get convicted of anything. I told you I would come in and help you if you wanted my help.\u201d Defendant said Racz reacted negatively to his accusation of \u201cplanting something\u201d and said \u201cI don\u2019t even want to work with you now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">On his cross-examination, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkmH\">Q. Have you ever told anybody or stated in any papers or written down on any piece of paper that you knew Franklin Police Department were out to get you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">A. I don't recall talking to anyone or writing anything down of that nature, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">Q. Do you have any idea why the Franklin Police Department would be out to frame you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">Q. Do you recall filing a certification with the Court in this particular matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag3\">A. Excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">Q. Do you recall filing a certification with the Court in this particular matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3U\">A. I may have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-11\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-12\">Q. I will show you S-15. If you could just look through that and see if it refreshes your recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-13\">A. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-14\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-15\">Q. Why would Franklin Police Department have an interest in framing you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3b\">A. I guess \u2019cause I was arrested in 1986 and was not convicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">Without objection the colloquy continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-17\">Q. You were arrested on what charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-18\">A. Possession of CDS with intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-19\">Q. Cocaine, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-20\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-21\">Without objection, the following then occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-22\">Q. There was a motion to suppress granted in that case, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-23\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-24\">Q. So in your opinion, because they had arrested you once before, and they had to dismiss charges because of a legal technicality, you thought they were taking a second shot at you?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-25\">Defense counsel (not present counsel) then objected, but defendant responded \u201c[y]es.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The trial judge thereupon called for a sidebar discussion. The prosecutor argued that he was not attempting to impeach Featherston\u2019s credibility by reference to the prior arrest. Rather, he sought to impeach Featherston\u2019s credibility by demonstrating a prior inconsistent statement because he had testified at trial that the police contaminated the soap sample because \u201che wouldn\u2019t cooperate with ... Racz,\u201d whereas in his certification Featherston stated that the soap was contaminated because of vindictiveness following dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">It is settled that introduction of evidence of prior arrests is improper as a basis for impeaching a witness\u2019 credibility. <em>State v. Hutchins, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 359-360, 575 A.2d 35 (App.Div.1990). As noted in <em>Hutchins, </em>we have previously made \u201cclear that where defendant\u2019s case rests upon his credibility, admission of testimony or the posing of questions concerning defendant\u2019s prior arrest, constitutes plain error and requires reversal of the conviction, and a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360, 575 A.2d 35. <em>See also State v. Dunphy, 12 N.J. </em>531, 536-537, 117 A.2d 617 (1955); <em>State v. Cooper, </em>10 <em>N.J. </em>532, 555-556, 92 A.2d 786 (1952); <em>State v. Searles, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 215, 197 A.2d 384 (App.Div.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">However, the prosecutor (not trial counsel) now argues he \u201cwas not attempting to use the prior arrest in the traditional sense of attacking a criminal defendant\u2019s credibility, <em>i.e., </em>using prior crime as relevant to law abiding status and thus relevant as to the issue of veracity.\u201d The prosecutor, rather, claims the right to attack his credibility by demonstrating the inconsistencies in Featherston\u2019s defense by showing the different reasons attributed for the alleged \u201cframe-up.\u201d Arguably, and assuming some inconsistency, any response to a question concerning the certification would have \u201copened the door\u201d for further questioning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the scope of the cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>directed to the nature of the prior charges and, especially, the reason for the dismissal was improperly developed, and should have been excluded, if only under <em>Evid.R. </em>4. The fact that Featherston testified that he had been \u201cframed\u201d did not justify development of the fact that the prior charges were dismissed because of a motion to suppress on a \u201ctechnicality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">It may be suggested that the objection to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the \u201ctechnicality\u201d was sustained, but there was no direction to disregard the affirmative answer, and some responses are so prejudicial they cannot be disregarded. <em>See Bruton v. United States, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>123, 135, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1620, 1627, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, 485 (1968); <em>State v. Morant, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 136, 574 A.2d 502 (App.Div.1990). In any event, defendant testified that a motion to suppress had been granted, and there can be little doubt, in context, that the jury was led to understand that defendant escaped conviction for a similar offense and did so only because of a legal \u201ctechnicality.\u201d The reality is that the prosecutor revealed indirectly what he was prohibited from proving directly \u2014 a predisposition to commit a crime by virtue of defendant\u2019s prior similar misconduct. <em>Cf. State v. Arnwine, </em>67 <em>N.J.Super. </em>483, 486-87, 171 A.2d 124 (App.Div. 1961) (\u201c[tjhrough no fault of his own, defendant under relentless inquiry was obligated to disclose that he had previously been <em>charged </em>with [a similar offense]. We are strongly of the view that this prior charge may have, in the minds of the jury, lent color to the truth of the charge on which defendant was standing trial. It seriously prejudiced his case and amounted to plain error\u201d) (emphasis in original). <em>See also Evid.R. </em>47, 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Medina testified on cross-examination that the frame-up occurred because \u201cthey didn\u2019t find nothing.\u201d When the prosecutor asked about Featherston\u2019s \u201cprior encounter\u201d with the Franklin Township police, an objection was sustained and the judge declined to permit the inquiry even with a limiting instruction. The prosecutor referred to Medina\u2019s pretrial certification which was similar to Featherston\u2019s and to the fact he was trying to inquire as to \u201cwhat was in her mind,\u201d but the judge ruled it inadmissible because of irrelevance and because \u201cunder rule four, we\u2019ve heard enough about that and the potentiality for bias and prejudice, in my mind, is a concern, and would outweigh whatever probative value it may have as to the credibility of this witness.\u201d Further, before summations he directed counsel not to refer to the prior arrest. The trial judge, however, denied a new trial because of the \u201cprior arrest\u201d issue, noting that no curative instruction was given because none was requested and that defense counsel may have believed that the testimony supported the defense. Moreover, he noted that the questions regarding the prior arrest related to Featherston, that they were not related to Medina, that she was convicted and, therefore, suggested that there could have been no undue prejudice to Featherston.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Because defendant asserted that he was framed, the prosecutor had the right to develop the subject and could test defendant\u2019s credibility with respect thereto. It is not suggested that reference to a prior, counseled certification filed in furtherance of a pretrial discovery motion could not be referred to for purposes of impeachment. <em>See and compare, e.g., Michigan v. Harvey, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>344, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1176, 108 L.Ed.2d 293 (1990); <em>James v. Illinois, </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>307, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>648, 107 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>676 (1990); <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 <em>U.S. </em>222, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971); <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>377, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). However, the scope of the cross-examination must be tailored to preserve fairness and prevent undue prejudice. Here, the cross-examination of Featherston developed under the guise of attacking credibility, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>constituted not only a challenge to the defense of \u201cframe-up\u201d because of hostility over dismissal of charges previously filed, but brought out that Featherston was arrested for similar conduct before and got off on a \u201ctechnicality,\u201d and that the same abhorrent conduct occurred again. The inference was clear \u2014 Featherston was predisposed to sell drugs and this jury should not let him get away with it a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We recognize that prosecutors cannot be expected to do battle in the adversarial ring with two hands tied behind their backs. The cases are legion with respect to their rights as adversaries as well as their duties and obligations. <em>See e.g. State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 320, 524 A.2d 188 (1987). Despite the merits of the cause or their zeal for a result, our constitutional system of justice survives because the means of obtaining a conviction is as important as the conviction itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In essence, the proofs in this case were far from overwhelming. Defendants were convicted of second degree possession with intent to distribute because of the quantity involved. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(l), -b(2). Neither party claims the quantity of <em>pure cocaine </em>or the quality of the substance was relevant to the charge, <em>see State v. Torres, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 9-11, 563 A.2d 1141 (App.Div.1989). Nevertheless, in light of the testimony of the defense experts that only two parts per 1,000 were cocaine and, therefore, could not have been for distribution, the defense was plausible \u2014 defendants could not be intending to distribute the substance and did not possess it to distribute, and that they were \u201cframed\u201d by police who themselves added a small quantity of cocaine to Featherston\u2019s laundry powder. Under these circumstances, we cannot find that the improper cross-examination about the prior disposition was harmless or did not deprive defendants of a fair trial. <em>See e.g. State v. Pennington, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>547, 565, 575 A.2d 816 (1990); <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>Ramseur, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 322, 524 A.2d 188 (1987).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">It may be suggested, as the trial judge did, that reference to Featherston's prior arrest had no direct impact on Medina. However, their joint defense was that they both were framed. Because of the possibility the jury rejected the defense as to Featherston because of prosecutorial misconduct, Medina had to be similarly prejudiced as well. Further, here Medina was tried as an accomplice of Featherston, and under the facts of this case and the instructions given to the jury, her liability was premised on the proof of Featherston\u2019s wrongdoing developed at the joint trial. In the circumstances, the reversal of Featherston\u2019s conviction mandates reversal of the judgment against Medina.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The need for a retrial requires us to mention the question of joint representation by counsel. We recognize that, under our law, defendants can seek joint representation, and it can be permitted upon knowing, intelligent waivers of the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>to independent counsel developed on the record. <em>See R. </em>3:8-2. <em>See also e.g. State v. Bellucci, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>531, 410 A.2d 666 (1980); <em>State v. Land, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>24, 372 A.2d 297 (1977). Such representation makes sense for economic and other reasons when the defenses are consistent. However, there may develop at any trial an unexpected and unforseen event which may require employment of different tactics or strategy for the benefit of an individual defendant. The same is true on appeal. In this case, the proofs reflect that Featherston was the most culpable, and the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was essentially more prejudicial to him. The disposition as to both defendants did not, therefore, necessarily have to be the same. In response to our questions at argument, appellate counsel for defendants (who, as we have noted, did not try the case) acknowledged his approach to the appeal as if the defendants\u2019 case \u201crise or fall together\u201d and candidly admitted that they might more appropriately be represented by separate counsel. As no issue regarding joint representation is raised on this appeal by either the defendants or the State, we do not address the issue further. However, we do direct that the question of joint representation be fully explored before the retrial. <em>See R. </em>3:8-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The State does not argue that Featherston\u2019s conviction on count two can survive a reversal on count one. Count two charged Featherston with use of a remotely activated paging device \u201cwhile engaged in the commission of\u201d possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. We do not decide that a conviction for using a paging device incident thereto must automatically be vacated merely because a drug conviction is reversed. The basis for reversal may be significant. Here the judge instructed the jury that \u201cif you find the [defendant did not possess cocaine with intent to distribute, then [he] cannot be found guilty of this charge,\u201d and, in any event, the prejudice incurred at the trial affected both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Because count two must be retried we briefly address defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial judge\u2019s instructions on that count. Both parties have encouraged us to do so in the event we directed a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-20 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">A person is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree if he <em>uses </em>a remotely activated paging device while engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit any crime or offense enumerated in Chapter 35 or 36 of Title 2C of the New Jersey statutes, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The judge told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">So, to find the defendant guilty on this charge, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt two things. That the defendant, Michael Featherston, used a remotely activated paging device; and two, that at the time he did so, he was engaged in the commission of a crime or possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">Now, by the words, used a paging device, we <em>do not mean that the pager was actually activated on the date in question. </em>But we mean that the defendant had in his possession a paging device which <em>could have been remotely estivated </em>at the time the offense occurred, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">As <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-20 is a penal statute, it must be strictly construed, <em>State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>83, 102, 557 A.2d 277 (1989), and the word \u201cuses\u201d must be interpreted to mean that the pager has to be \u201cused,\u201d not merely \u201cpossessed,\u201d in connection with the drug offense, here possession with intent to distribute. On the motion for a new trial, the judge noted his concern that a defendant could escape penal liability by turning off the pager \u201cwhen he realizes that he or she is to be arrested\u201d so that \u201cit would be off and theoretically not in use [which] would enable the defendant to avoid a conviction on this charge.\u201d However, the proofs, either direct or circumstantial, must reveal use of the paging device incident to the drug crime, not necessarily that the police observed the defendant use it or that it was on at the time of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">While the trial judge may have properly expressed the elements of the offense, his instructions conveyed the impression that mere possession of a pager which could be activated at the time defendant possessed the cocaine with intent to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>it \u2014 without using it \u2014 sufficed to sustain the conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this respect, he erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The judge should have related the law he was charging to the facts the jury was being asked to decide. <em>See State v. Concepcion, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>373, 379, 545 A.2d 119 (1988). Here, however, once the judge went beyond stating the elements of the offense, he did not go far enough in explaining what he meant concerning activation. By stating that the beeper did not have to be \u201cactually activated on the date in question,\u201d the judge did not make clear if he was referring to defendant\u2019s act of turning on the beeper or to activation by people trying to communicate with him. The judge should have instructed the jury that in order to find that defendant \u201cused\u201d the paging device, it had to find that the paging device was \u201con\u201d so as to have been capable of receiving signals and fulfilling its paging purpose. Further, the judge should have made clear that the jury had to find that, while engaged in the commission of the drug offense and in connection with that offense, defendant was or could have been contacted as a result of his use of the paging device.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">A defendant must use the beeper, not merely possess it, incident to the drug offense. While defendant argued before the trial judge that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction on count two<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, on his post-verdict motion that a new trial was warranted because of the charge, he failed to object to the instruction when it was given. In these circumstances, we do not have to decide whether the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>mandates reversal of the conviction on count two, as \u201cplain error,\u201d independent of any other ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The judgments of conviction are reversed, and the matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The defense produced witnesses who borrowed money from defendants and used pagers to contact Featherston for legitimate purposes, including use incident to the softball team.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">Featherston testified that during the house search the phone range and Officer Price answered the phone and said \"[w]hy don\u2019t you come over, I\u2019m in business\" and that at approximately 1 a.m. in the morning one Kenny McCracken appeared at the residence. Featherston further testified that McCracken had never previously paid a visit at that hour and he had no knowledge as to why he appeared that morning.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-10\"><em>See </em>the legislative history noted in <em>State v.

We note this and other possibly questionable conduct by the trial prosecutor because of our belief that it may have contributed to the conviction in a case which was, particularly in light of the testimony of defendants\u2019 experts, less than overwhelming.
