Pepe and Richard T. Pepe brought these actions against defendant General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) and certain of its agents to recover damages arising out of what the Pepes called \u201cthe demise of the Pepe empire\u201d of automobile dealerships, then in bankruptcy. Judge Kleiner dismissed the complaints upon his finding that the Pepes \u201cmay not proceed as individuals to assert a cause of action against the defendants\u201d and that \u201c[i]f there is a cause of action for the defendants\u2019 acts, it is a chose in action, which is the property right of the trustee in bankruptcy.\u201d The Pepes appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The Pepes owned and operated, in corporate form, ten automobile dealerships in South Jersey. According to their complaints, the corporations developed a relationship with GMAC, \u201cthe lending branch of General Motors,\u201d pursuant to which GMAC loaned money for floor plan financing, dealership acquisition, capitalization loans, acquisition of inventory and equipment and purchase of real estate. Starting in late 1987, GMAC altered its practices and \u201cmade it very difficult to conduct business,\u201d thereby causing \u201cuntold financial problems and reputation problems to the Pepe dealerships.\u201d In pursuit of a scheme \u201cto bankrupt and destroy ... the Pepe automobile empire,\u201d GMAC placed \u201ckeepers\u201d in the dealerships \u201cfor the purpose of monitoring the transactions taking place.\u201d Having thus \u201cactually assumed control\u201d of the dealerships, GMAC \u201cdestroyed\u201d their business. The dealerships filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief on August 24, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Based on those allegations, the Pepes asserted eleven overlapping and duplicative causes of action against GMAC and its agents, for (1) \u201cbreach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\u201d (2) fraud, (3) negligent misrepresentation, (4) intentional misrepresentation, (5) intentional, negligent and reckless destruction of the dealerships, (6) bad faith conduct designed to \u201csqueeze and destroy\u201d the dealerships, (7) intentional destruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>tion of the dealerships, (8) malicious interference with the Pepes\u2019 contractual relations with the franchisors and banks, (9) negligent destruction of \u201cthe Pepe empire,\u201d (10) wilful or negligent destruction of Richard Pepe\u2019s \u201cname\u201d in their \u201cfinancial dealings with others\u201d and (11) again, intentional destruction of the dealerships. The complaints demanded compensatory damages of $115,000,000 as well as punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The complaints were filed on August 2, 1990, almost two years after the Bankruptcy Court had approved a lengthy and comprehensive stipulation entered into by the dealerships, the Pepes, the bankruptcy trustee for the dealerships and the principal secured creditors including GMAC. The stipulation recited that it had been \u201cproposed\u201d by the debtors \u201cto encourage and induce GMAC [and the other secured creditors] to permit the use of cash collateral by Debtors and thereby enable the Debtors to obtain and replenish an inventory of motor vehicles, parts and supplies which are necessary for the operation of the Debtors\u2019 respective businesses.\u201d Paragraph 58 of the stipulation provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">As part and parcel of the consideration for entering into this stipulation, the debtors, trustee, and debtor-in-possession hereby release and discharge the secured creditors, their respective officers, agents, employees, successors, assigns, subsidiary and parent corporations, and insurers of and from any claim, demand, right or cause of action of any nature whatsoever, without limitation, specifically, including any and all claims, demands, rights or causes of action for lender liability resulting from secured creditors\u2019 prior dealings with the debtors and the principals. The claims from which the debtors, trustee and debtor-in-possession are releasing secured creditors include, but are not limited to, fraud, constructive fraud, duress, interference with corporate governments or contractual relations, breach of contract and defamation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The stipulation was approved by Bankruptcy Judge Wizmur and entered of record in the Bankruptcy Court on October 12, 1988.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number> The causes of action pleaded by the Pepes all assert losses sustained by them as the result of the destruction of their corporations. As such, the claims are entirely derivative of causes of action which, but for their release by the bankruptcy stipulation, would be available to the corporations. The law is clear and uniform: shareholders cannot sue for injuries arising from the diminution in value of their shareholdings resulting from wrongs allegedly done to their corporations. <em>See, e.g., Kauffman v. Dreyfus Fund, Inc., </em>434 F.2d 727, 732 (3d Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 <em>U.S. </em>974, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1190, 28 L.Ed.2d 323 (1971); <em>Ash v. I.B.M., </em>353 F.2d 491, 493- 494 (3d Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>927, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1446, 16 L.Ed.2d 531 (1966); <em>Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>183 <em>F. </em>704, 709 (3d Cir.1910). Nor can stockholders assert individual claims <em>for </em>wages or other income lost because of injuries assertedly done to their corporations. <em>See Pitchford v. PEPI, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 92, 96-98 (3d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>935, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2649, 49 L.Ed.2d 387 (1976). The Pepes argue that their role as guarantors of the debt of the dealerships establishes a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d creating duties owing directly to them; but the case law is to the contrary. <em>See, e.g., Mid-State Fertilizer Co. v. Exchange Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>877 F.2d 1333, 1336 (7th Cir.1989); <em>Sherman v. British Leyland Motors, Ltd., </em>601 <em>F.2d </em>429, 439-440 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Wells Fargo Ag Credit Corp. v. Batterman, </em>229 <em>Neb. </em>15, 424 <em>N.W.2d </em>870, 874 (1988). Similarly, the fact that the Pepes had given mortgages and other collateral to GMAC to secure the obligations does not render their claims any less derivative of the corporate claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In stating essentially those conclusions, Judge Kleiner relied largely on <em>Taggart &amp; Taggart Seed, Inc. v. First Tenn. Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>684 <em>F.Supp. </em>230 (E.D.Ark.1988), <em>aff'd, </em>881 F.2d 1080 (8th Cir.1989). That case was brought by shareholders against the corporation's principal financing institution, alleging the intentional or negligent breach of a loan agreement and resultant emotional distress and economic loss to the plaintiffs. The trial court dismissed the complaint because the injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>alleged by the shareholders \u201care incidental to and derivative of the injury alleged to the corporate entity\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 234); although some of the stockholders were guarantors of the loans, the corporation remained \u201cthe real party in interest\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 235). Relying on <em>Small v. Goldman, </em>637 <em>F.Supp. </em>1080 (D.N.J.1986), as the authority most favorable to their position, the Pepas urge us to reject <em>Taggart </em>and the other cases stating the same principles. We decline that invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\"><em>Small </em>is inapposite. The court there permitted a shareholder to maintain an individual RICO cause of action \u201cbased on an alleged conspiracy by defendants to get her to sell her stock below value, and for a breach of fiduciary duty by [the director of the corporation].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1033. Confirming that \u201conly the corporation may bring a RICO action to redress injury suffered by the corporation unless the shareholder can also show some specific direct harm to her personally\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1031), Judge Ackerman found that plaintiffs allegations made out a case of \u201cdirect harm to her personally\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1033). On its face, a conspiracy to force a stockholder to sell her stock below value is a wrong suffered directly and solely by the shareholder, not derivative of any loss or injury sustained by the corporation. <em>Small </em>is thus of no assistance to the Pepes. <em>See also Judiee\u2019s Sunshine Pontiac, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., </em>418 <em>F.Supp. </em>1212 (D.N.J.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Dismissal of the Pepe claims does not result in a wrong without a remedy. The remedy for misconduct of GMAC or any other party against the dealerships is in the hands of the bankruptcy trustee and the Bankruptcy Court. The trustee released any claims against GMAC in consideration of the secured creditors\u2019 undertakings to try to keep the Pepe corporations in business. We have no knowledge, and we express no opinion, as to the wisdom of that release. We hold only that causes of action arising out of GMAC\u2019s alleged destruction of the dealerships may not be pursued by the Popes but are solely for the trustee acting under the aegis of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The District Court subsequently dismissed the trustee's appeal raising certain challenges to the order approving the stipulation. Paragraph 58 apparently was not addressed in that proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
