COLEMAN, P.J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The issue raised in this appeal is whether <em>Shebar v. Sanyo Business Systems Corp., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>276, 288-289, 544 A.2d 377 (1988) should be applied retroactively or prospectively. We hold that it should be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">This is the second appeal in this case in which David T. Smith (plaintiff) has alleged wrongful termination of employment. In our first decision dated July 19, 1989, we held that plaintiff\u2019s claim of an oral contract of employment supported by an act of forbearance alleged a cause of action similar to that alleged in <em>Shebar. </em>The Supreme Court denied defendants\u2019 petition for certification on November 13, 1989, 118 <em>N.J. </em>223, 570 A.2d 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">The matter was scheduled for trial on September 24, 1990. On that date defendants presented the trial court with a motion seeking a ruling that <em>Shebar </em>be given prospective application only. The motion was argued on October 9,1990, and the judge ruled in favor of defendants and dismissed the complaint by order dated November 7, 1990. In a letter opinion filed pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:5 \u2014 1(b), the judge concluded that based on <em>Grigoletti v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>89, 570 A.2d 903 (1990), <em>Shebar </em>should be given only prospective application. She held that Shebar's recognition that \u201cforbearance from accepting another job offer can be adequate consideration for an oral employment contract ... was certainly new to New Jersey\u201d and should be applied prospectively from the date <em>Shebar </em>was decided, August 4, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>On this appeal, plaintiff argues that <em>Grigoletti </em>was limited to <em>Woolley v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>284, 491 A.2d 1257, <em>modified, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>10, 499 A.2d 515 (1985), type claims and that <em>Shebar </em>as well as the present case are not <em>Woolley </em>type cases. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\"><em>Grigoletti, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 116-117, 570 A.2d 903, held that the decision in <em>Woolley </em>should be applied only prospectively because \u201cit involved a novel and unanticipated interpretation and application of that law and, in fact, altered the basic structure of employer/at-will-employee relations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 116, 491 A.2d 1257. The Court further observed that <em>\u201cWoolley </em>took a quantum leap forward in holding that contractual obligations could be implied in fact from an employment manual, and gave such manuals and similar employer policies a legal significance not theretofore found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 570 A.2d 903. Thus, Grigoletti's prospectivity holding is limited to <em>Woolley </em>type employment contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\"><em>Shebar </em>in plain and unmistakable language made clear that it did not involve a <em>Woolley </em>type claim because no employment contract based on an employment manual or employer policies was alleged. To the contrary, Shebar alleged an oral promise was made to him that he would not be discharged except for cause. He alleged an act of forbearance in not accepting another job as the required additional consideration. The <em>Shebar </em>Court stated \u201cThere is no basis in this record for finding an established <em>[Woolley </em>type] company-wide termination policy. What is before us is a special contract with a particular employee, not a general agreement covering all employees.\u201d <em>Shebar, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 288, 544 A.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Nor does <em>Shebar </em>represent a novel or unanticipated interpretation of the law such as required by <em>Coons v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>419, 426-434, 476 A.2d 763 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>1123, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>808, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>800 (1985), in order to satisfy the test for nonretroactivity. <em>Shebar </em>cited <em>Savarese v. Pyrene Mfg. Co., </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>595, 89 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>237 (1952), <em>Shiddell v. Electro Rust-Proofing Corp., </em>34 <em>N.J.Super. </em>278, 112 A.2d 290 (App.Div.1954), <em>certif. denied, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>408, 111 A.2d 527 (1955) and <em>Rogozinski v. Airstream By Angeli, </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133, 143, 377 A.2d 807 (Law Div.1977), <em>affirmed </em>except as to damages, 164 <em>N.J.Super. </em>465, 397 A.2d 334 (App.Div.1979), as support for its holding. <em>Shebar, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 285-288, 544 A.2d 377. <em>Savarese </em>acknowledged that oral contracts for long term employment, supported by consideration additionally to the services incident to the employment, are not void even though they are difficult to prove. <em>Savarese, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>at 600-602, 89 A.2d 237. To the same effect, is <em>Shiddell, supra, </em>34 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 289-290, 112 A.2d 290. <em>Rogozinski </em>recognized a long term contract of employment supported by considerable sacrifice of important economic advantages.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\"><em>Shebar </em>instructs that an alleged breach of an oral contract of employment made to an individual, rather than through a manual or company policies, \u201cshould be analyzed by those contractual principles that apply when a claim is that an oral employment contract exists.\u201d <em>Shebar, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 288, 544 A.2d 377. Under general contract law, New Jersey has acknowledged for over three-quarters of a century that an act or promise of forbearance may be sufficient consideration to support an alleged oral contract of employment. <em>See Bird v. J.L. Prescott Co., </em>89 <em>N.J.L. </em>591, 591-592, 99 A. 380 (E. &amp; A.1916), cited in <em>Savarese, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>at 600, 89 A.2d 237. The employee in <em>Bird </em>did not prevail because of the insufficiency of the evidence required to meet the heavy burden of proving a contract of lifetime employment. Indeed, <em>Bird </em>said nothing to suggest that oral contracts of employment supported by a act or promise of forbearance were invalid. <em>See also </em>1 <em>Williston on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 135, at 566 (3d ed. 1961); 1 <em>Corbin on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 135, at 575 (1950); <em>United &amp; Globe Rubber Mfg. Cos. v. Conard, </em>80 <em>N.J.L. </em>286, 289, 78 A. 203 (E. &amp; A.1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>We conclude that an oral contract of employment supported by additional consideration such as an act or promise of forbearance, if not recognized in this State as valid since the <em>Bird </em>decision in 1916 no matter how difficult to prove, \u201chad been foreshadowed, at least in part, for years\u201d before <em>Shebar </em>was decided. <em>Mirza v. Filmore Corp., </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>390, 399, 456 A.2d 518 (1983); <em>Coons, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 427, 476 A.2d 763. For that reason alone, <em>Shebar </em>should be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Beyond that, we based our prior decision on <em>Shebar, Savarese, Shiddell </em>and <em>Rogozinski, </em>all cited with approval in <em>Shebar. </em>We held that plaintiff\u2019s complaint could not be dismissed on summary judgment motion for failure to state a claim. When the Supreme Court denied defendants\u2019 petition for certification, our prior decision became the law of the case as to that issue and \u201cthat decision should [have been] the end of the matter.\u201d <em>State v. Hale, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 410, 317 A.2d 731 (App.Div.1974); <em>State v. Stewart, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138, 143, 481 A.2d 838 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>212, 491 A.2d 707 (1984). Also under the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel, our prior decision that <em>Shebar </em>controls the present case, precluded the entry of the order that gives rise to this appeal. <em>Velasquez v. Franz, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>498, 505-507, 589 A.2d 143 (1991); <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>181, 186, 380 A.2d 1128 (1977). Any argument defendant desired to advance as to why <em>Shebar </em>should not be followed, should have been advanced at that time, otherwise such an issue is deemed to have been waived. Even if our prior decision was wrong, it is fundamental that the principles of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel preclude any further consideration of that decision because of the need for finality as to whether a cause of action is alleged in the complaint. <em>Velasquez, supra, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>at 511, 589 A.2d 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The order dated November 7,1990 is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
