The pivotal issue raised by this appeal is whether an obligee under a labor and material payment bond, such as Jackson, has a right of recovery against its surety North America, and, if so, whether the contractual limitation period for bringing suit would bar such recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Many of the facts giving rise to this appeal are set forth in our opinion in <em>Ribeira &amp; Lourenco v. Jackson Health, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>16, 20-21, 554 A.2d 1350 (App.Div.1989), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>419, 571 A.2d 1311 (1990), and were relied upon here by both parties. These facts need not be repeated at length here. It is sufficient for purposes of this appeal to emphasize that North America is the surety on both a performance bond and a labor and material payment bond. The performance bond, which was satisfied by North America, named Jackson, as obligee, and named defendant Green Cast Enterprises, Inc. (Green Cast), as principal, and guaranteed that the principal would complete the contract. When the contract was not completed, North America paid Jackson under the performance bond. The labor and material payment bond guaranteed claims for labor and materials used in the performance of a subcontract between defendants John J. Michaels Developers, Inc. (Michaels) and Green Cast. The labor and material payment bond named Green Cast, as principal, and Jackson, as obligee.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Green Cast defaulted on the subcontract and ceased work on the project on February 13, 1985. As a result, on August 11, 1985, plaintiff instituted an action against Jackson, Michaels, Green Cast and defendants Condor Company, Inc. and Howard Lowy to recover the unpaid balance due for labor performed and materials furnished in connection with the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>project. On September 9, 1986, Jackson filed an answer and third-party complaint, joining North America as a third-party defendant, seeking to recover additional monies from North America under the labor and material payment bond. In the third-party complaint, Jackson sought recovery and indemnity under the labor and material payment bond, claiming that it was entitled to recover under the bond \u201cany and all sums which claimant [plaintiff] recovers against [it]\u201d, as well as all sums it \u201cpaid or will pay for labor and materials\u201d to claimants and all costs, expenses and attorney's fees. On October 20, 1986, plaintiff amended its complaint to include a direct claim against North America, as surety for Green Cast on the labor and material payment bond. After the trial court denied North America\u2019s motion to dismiss the third-party complaint, the trial court severed the trial of Jackson\u2019s third-party complaint against North America from the trial of plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">After completion of discovery, North America moved for summary judgment against plaintiff on the ground that the action against it was barred by the provisions of the bond that limited the time in which to bring suit to one year after the principal had ceased work on the project. The trial court held that the time limitation provisions of the bond were valid and enforceable. Since Green Cast, the principal, ceased work on the project on February 13, 1985, and plaintiff did not commence suit against North America, the surety, until October 20, 1986, more than one year later, the trial court further held that plaintiff was barred from bringing the suit and entered summary judgment in favor of North America. We affirmed the judgment, holding that the one-year limitation period in the labor and material payment bond precluded the action against the surety and that the surety was not equitably estopped from raising the limitation period in the bond as a defense. We also held that the claim against the surety in the amended complaint did not relate back to the date of filing the original complaint. The Supreme Court affirmed o.b. in 118 <em>N.J. </em>419, 571 <em>A.</em>2d 1311 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Thereafter, on December 4, 1990, North America moved for summary judgment with respect to the third-party complaint, arguing that the judgment in <em>Ribeira &amp; Lourenco v. Jackson Health, supra, </em>was <em>res judicata </em>as to Jackson\u2019s third-party claim against it and barred this action. Additionally, North America argued that its sole obligation under the labor and material payment bond \u201cwas to pay claimants who complied with the conditions of the bonds,\u201d and that Jackson was not a claimant as that term is defined by the bond. Jackson, in opposing the motion, admitted that \u201c[t]he time is past for [claimants] now to bring suit against [North America]\u201d, but argued that its rights, as an obligee under the bond, were \u201cnot addressed in the bonds\u201d and, thus, were not affected by the one-year limitation for bringing suit contained in the labor and material payment bond. Judge Longhi in the Law Division granted summary judgment in favor of North America and dismissed all claims by Jackson under the labor and material payment bond. The trial court held that Jackson, as obligee, stood in no better position than the third-party beneficiaries stood and, since the bond contained a limitation for bringing suit within one year, it, as obligee, was bound by that limitation and, therefore, this action against North America was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Jackson contends on this appeal that the trial court erred \u201cby extending limitations of suit expressly applicable to defined \u2018claimants\u2019 to the owner/obligee on a labor and material payment bond.\u201d Essentially, Jackson argues that the terms of the payment bond, which limit actions to \u201cclaimants\u201d do not apply to it as an obligee and that its \u201cright to sue is not derived from, nor solely dependent upon, a claimant\u2019s rights or obligations under the bond.\u201d We disagree and affirm. We are satisfied from our study of the record and arguments presented that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of North America and that all of the issues raised are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>North America issued both a performance bond and a labor and material payment bond, naming Jackson as obligee in each. North America, as surety, was bound under each bond for $800,000. The other surety on the bond, Union Indemnity Co. of New York, was bound for $2,500,000 and has subsequently become insolvent. North America tendered the full payment of its obligation \u2014 $800,000\u2014to Jackson under the performance bond. Jackson accepted the payment and released North America. Under the labor and material payment bond, North America, as surety, was bound to Jackson \u201cfor the use and benefit of claimants, as hereinbelow defined____\u201d The pertinent provisions of the labor and material payment bond read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">1. A claimant is defined as one having a direct contract with the Principal or with a Subcontractor of the Principal for labor, material, or both, used or reasonably required for use in the performance of the Contract, labor and material being construed to include that part of water, gas, power, light, heat, oil, gasoline, telephone service or rental of equipment directly applicable to the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">2. The above named Principal and Surety hereby jointly and severally agree with the Owner that every claimant as herein defined, who has not been paid in full before the expiration of a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which the last of such claimant\u2019s work or labor was done or unperformed, or materials were furnished by such claimant, may sue on this bond for the use of such claimant, prosecute the suit to final judgment for such sum or sums as may be justly due claimant, and have execution thereon. The Owner shall not be liable for the payment of any costs or expenses of any such suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">3. No suit or action shall be commenced hereunder by any claimant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">a. Unless claimant, other than one having a direct contract with the Principal, shall have given written notice to any two of the following: the Principal, the Owner, or the Surety above named, within ninety (90) days after such claimant did or performed the last of the work or labor, or furnished the last of the material for which said claim is made____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">b. After the expiration of one (1) year following the date on which Principal ceased Work on said Contract, it being understood, however, that if any limitation embodied in this bond is prohibited by-any law controlling the construction hereof such limitation shall be deemed to be amended so as to be equal to the minimum period of limitation permitted by such law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">In view of the clear and unambiguous provisions of the bond, particularly Paragraph 3, the trial court correctly held that Jackson was time-barred from suing North America on the labor and material payment bond and, therefore, properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>granted summary judgment in favor of North America. <em>See Ribeira &amp; Lourenco, supra, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 22, 554 A.2d 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Beyond this, we are satisfied that Jackson has no legal basis for recovering under the payment bond because it is not a claimant as that term is defined by the bond. It is undisputed that Jackson was the obligee under the payment bond. An obligee is not a claimant as defined in the payment bond. Jackson did not have a direct claim for labor and material against Green Cast, the principal, under the payment bond. It is fundamental that a performance bond and a labor and material payment bond are two distinct bonds, each giving rise to different contractual rights and obligations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">Generally speaking, contractors\u2019 bonds are of two types, sometimes combined in a single bond: performance bonds and labor and material payment bonds. A performance bond guarantees that the contractor will perform the contract, and usually provides that, if the contractor defaults and fails to complete the contract, the surety can itself complete the contract or pay damages up to the limit of the bond. A labor and material payment bond guarantees the owner that all bills for labor and materials contracted for and used by the contractor will be paid by the surety if the contractor defaults. The purpose of a payment bond or provision is to protect the equity of the owner and his property against the claims of unpaid subcontractors or suppliers. [17 Am.Jur.2d <em>Contractors\u2019 Bonds </em>\u00a7 1 (1990) at 747 (footnotes omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\"><em>See Middle-West Concrete v. General Ins. Co., </em>165 <em>W.Va. </em>280, 282-84, 267 S.E.2d 742, 744-45 (W.Va.1980); <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co. v. Rose, </em>314 <em>Ky. </em>233, 238, 234 S.<em>W.</em>2d 728, 730-31 (1950) (interpreting language in bonds practically identical to the payment bond involved here).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Generally, an obligee under a labor and material payment bond is not entitled to payments for labor and material paid by the obligee who completes the contract after the contractor\u2019s default. 13 Couch, <em>Cyclopedia of Insurance Law </em>2d \u00a7 47:232 (1982) at 373 (hereinafter Couch); 17 <em>Am.Jur</em>.2d <em>Contractors\u2019 Bonds, </em>\u00a7 5 (1990) at 750; <em>see e.g., Southwood Builders v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>235 <em>Va. </em>164, 172, 366 S.E.2d 104, 109 (Va.1988). As Couch explained in \u00a7 47:231 of his <em>Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>While an obligee has a right of action on a dual-purpose bond with respect to the harm sustained by him through a breach of the contract, he has no right thereon with respect to the claims of labor and materialmen, unless, through payment, he has become subrogated to their claims. So a contractor\u2019s bond by which the surety engages to indemnify the owner from all costs and damages he may suffer by reason of the failure of the contractor faithfully to perform his contract and to satisfy all claims and demands incurred in performing the contract, and to pay all persons who shall furnish the contractor with labor and materials, gives the owner no right of recovery on his own behalf against the surety on account of materialmen\u2019s claims unless and until he has actually suffered damages by being compelled to pay them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">For example, where a payment bond is conditioned on the contractor making prompt payments to labor and material claimants, but a claimant who is not paid files a mechanic\u2019s lien attaching to the owner\u2019s property, the bond implies an obligation on the part of the surety to indemnify the owner so that the property will be free of the lien. [Couch, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47:231 at 373 (footnotes omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">And Couch further explained in \u00a7 47:232:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">With respect to the claims of labor and materialmen, it is immaterial that the principal contractor has defaulted and that the obligee is completing the performance of the contract. Accordingly, the surety of the defaulting contractor is liable for materials which the contractor had purchased and which were used by the obligee in completing the contract after such default.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\"><em>To be distinguished from the case in which the claim is asserted by the labor and materialman is the question whether the obligee is entitled to payment for the amounts paid by him. With respect to this point it is held that since a labor and material bond is limited in coverage to the protection of labor and materialmen, it by definition does not indemnify the obligee with respect to labor and materials used by the obligee in completing the contract after the contractor\u2019s default. </em>Consequently, where a performance bond and a labor and material payment bond were executed and the contractor after running into financial difficulties ceased work on two houses and abandoned the contracts and the surety paid the amount of the performance bond, it was held liable on its labor and material payment bond only for labor and material used on the building for which the contractor had failed to pay and was held not liable for the materials and labor reasonably required to complete the contract, it being pointed out that the object of the labor and material payment bond was to protect the owner against mechanics\u2019 liens. Furthermore, this conclusion is not altered by the fact that the labor and material bond refers to \u201call labor and material used or reasonably required for use in the performance of the contract,\u201d since such words are not intended to extend the coverage to protect the obligee of the performance bond, but only to protect the surety against extravagant and unnecessary use of labor and materials on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the contractor or the claimant. [Couch, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47:232, at 373-74 (footnotes omitted; emphasis added)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">And, finally Couch explained in \u00a7 47:233:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">The obligee may be entitled, by way of subrogation, to assert against the surety the claim paid by him. For example, where a contractor purchases material and supplies from a subcontractor who, in consideration of forgoing the right to file a mechanic\u2019s lien, is promised by the owner payment for the material, the owner, after payment of the material contracted for, has a right of action on the contractor\u2019s surety bond. [Couch, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47:233 at 374 (footnotes omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">As noted, the situation is slightly different when an unpaid claimant files a mechanic\u2019s lien on the obligee\u2019s property. Couch, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47:231 at 373; 17 <em>Am.Jur.2d Contractors\u2019 Bonds, supra, </em>\u00a7 13 at 754-55.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">In some cases, owners of buildings under construction have paid or agreed to pay laborers or materialmen the amounts owed to them by general contractors for labor or material furnished for use in the buildings, in order to avoid the placing of mechanics\u2019 liens on the property. It has been held that where a surety on a contractor\u2019s bond would be liable to the owner if a mechanic\u2019s lien were perfected on the property, and the owner makes payment to materialmen or laborers in order to avoid the placing of a mechanic\u2019s lien on the property, the owner may recover the amount paid from the surety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">Liability for loss arising from payment of mechanics\u2019 liens falls within the purview of a bond conditioned to hold the obligee harmless for any breach of contract. However, it has also been held that an owner who refuses to pay a general contractor for materials and labor furnished to him, and insists on paying materialmen directly to avoid any possible filing of mechanics\u2019 liens, releases the contractor\u2019s surety from liability on the contractor\u2019s bond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">A surety on a contractor\u2019s bond is not liable for payments made to material-men where no valid lien could have been asserted against the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS4\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-12\">Also, a payment bond conditioned on the contractor making prompt payments to labor and material claimants has been held to imply an obligation on the part of the surety to indemnify the owner when an unpaid claimant files a mechanic\u2019s lien attaching to the owner\u2019s property so that the property will be free of the lien. [17 Arai.jMr.2d, <em>Contractors\u2019 Bonds, supra, </em>\u00a7 13 at 754-55 (footnotes omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Thus, as Couch clearly explains, the labor and material payment bond by definition did not indemnify Jackson with respect to labor and materials used by it in completing the contract after the contractor went into default Couch, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47:323 at 374. In our view, the labor and material payment bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>should not \u201cbe construed so as to extend liability beyond the terms of the contract, or so as to nullify the plain intention of the parties.\u201d 74 <em>Am.Jur</em>.2d <em>Suretyship </em>\u00a7 257 (1974) at 170 (footnote omitted). By the plain terms of the bond, the parties limited actions on the payment bond to certain defined \u201cclaimants,\u201d whose claims were to be filed within a specified time period. The payment bond was created to make monies available for, and give a direct claim of action to, the labor and materialmen who had a direct contract with the principal or its subcontractor. Thus, the payment bond protects the owner from liens being attached to its property. The performance bond, on the other hand, was created to provide the owner with funds necessary to complete the project upon the default of the principal contractor. <em>See </em>17 <em>Am.Jur.2d Contractors\u2019 Bonds </em>\u00a7 1 at 747; <em>General Ins. Co., supra, </em>165 <em>W.Va. </em>at 282-84, 267 S.E.2d at 744-45; <em>Standard Accident, supra, </em>314 <em>Ky. </em>at 238, 234 S.W.2d at 730-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Jackson, as obligee, was not a claimant as defined by the payment bond and, therefore, had no contractual right to assert a claim under that bond against North America. Moreover, Jackson has not alleged that liens have been filed against, or attached to, its property. Thus, to permit Jackson to recover on the labor and material payment bond would be contrary to, and would defeat the purpose of, the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The result reached here is supported by <em>Southwood Builders v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>235 <em>Va. </em>164, 366 <em>S.E.2d </em>104 (Va.1988). There, the Virginia Supreme Court was asked to consider, in part, whether a lower court properly concluded that Southwood, as Principal/General Contractor, \u201cwas not a proper claimant under the payment bond and that, even if it was a proper claimant, the claim was barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 366 S.E.2d at 105. Southwood had entered into a general contract with the local county government to construct the county courts and office building. Southwood then subcontracted some of the work to United Drywall and Plastering Co. As part of the subcontract, United was required to provide both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>an 100% performance and 100% payment bond payable to the contractor. The language of these bonds is virtually identical to North America\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Sometime after the project had started, United encountered financial difficulties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">instead of terminating United, notifying Peerless [surety], and taking over the work, [Southwood] proposed a deal to United: If United would add another crew, Southwood would pay for that crew and for all additional materials ordered by United for the job. This arrangement was made known neither to Peerless nor to the architects. The plan was that the monies paid by South-wood on United\u2019s behalf would be deducted from United\u2019s progress payments. <em>[Id. </em>at 167, 366 <em>S.E.2d </em>at 105-06].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Despite this agreement, United later defaulted on the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 167, 366 S.E.2d at 106. The Virginia Supreme Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">We turn now to the issue concerning Peerless\u2019 liability under the labor and materials payment bond. United stopped work on December 4, 1981. South-wood\u2019s suit under the payment bond was filed on March 10,1983. The payment bond contained this provision: \u201cNo suit or action shall be commenced hereunder by a claimant, (a) after the expiration of one (1) year following the date on which Principal ceased work on said subcontract____\u201d United was the principal. <em>Under the language of the bond itself, Southwood\u2019s suit against Peerless was plainly time-barred.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">Under Southwood\u2019s reasoning, because it took over the job and furnished labor and materials through March 26, 1982, its suit was timely. By Southwood\u2019s approach, the date the principal under the bond stopped work has no bearing whatever on the statute of limitations question in cases where work on the defaulted project is continued by others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-13\">Southwood\u2019s approach is without merit. First, the statute and the bond are to be read together. <em>See Thomas Somerville Co. v. Broyhill, </em>200 <em>Va. </em>358, 105 S.E.2d 824 (1958). The more restrictive language of the bond does not conflict with the statute and thus should be given full effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-14\">Second, Peerless gave a bond based on United\u2019s participation in the project. Once United defaulted, that bond could not, without Peerless\u2019 consent, simply be read to include the entity which took over United\u2019s work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-15\">Third, <em>the payment bond was designed to protect a claimant as defined in the bond, which included only those having \u201ca direct contract with the Principal for labor, material, or both, used or reasonably required for use in the performance of the contract. \u201d Southwood had no such relationship with United. Southwood was United\u2019s general contractor. Southwood did not supply labor or materials to United. </em>In essence, Southwood <em>lent money to United </em>which United used to pay for labor and materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>We hold that the trial court did not err in concluding that Southwood\u2019s claim under the labor and material payments bond was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. <em>[Id. </em>at 171-72, 366 S.E.2d at 108-09 (Emphasis added) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Finally, we point out that <em>Hayle Floor Covering, Inc. v. First Minnesota Constr., </em>253 <em>N.W.2d </em>809 (Minn.1977), relied upon by Jackson, is factually distinguishable and does not support a different result. <em>Hayle </em>involved an unique fact pattern not present here; namely, that the subcontractor had instituted a mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure action against the owner of the construction project and held a valid lien against the property. When an unpaid claimant files a mechanic\u2019s lien \u201cthe bond implies an obligation on the part of the surety to indemnify the owner so that the property will be free of the lien.\u201d Couch, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47:231 at 371; 17 <em>Am.Jur.</em>2d, <em>supra, Contractors\u2019Bond </em>\u00a7 13 at 754-55. This is not the case here as Jackson has not claimed that any lien has been filed against, or attached to, its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Accordingly, the summary judgment under review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
