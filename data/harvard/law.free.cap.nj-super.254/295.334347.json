Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was successful, and we granted leave to appeal. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The evidence at the motion to suppress was substantially undisputed and was supplied by a single witness, Richard Stone, Assistant Principal of the Middlesex County Vocational-Technical High School in Piscataway. Stone testified that on January 14, 1988 he was informed by a guidance counselor \u201cthat she thought one of her students had a bag of Marijuana\u201d, and he \u201c[ajsked the guidance counselor to talk to the student to see if this was true or false.\u201d Stone was subsequently advised that the student reported that defendant \u201chad the bag.\u201d Stone knew that there had been a prior incident during which a \u201cpartially burned marijuana cigarette\u201d had been found in defendant\u2019s jacket pocket. Defendant had been disciplined as a result of that event.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Stone asked defendant to \u201ccome down to a conference room in the main office and ... asked him if he had in his possession anything he shouldn\u2019t have had.\u201d Defendant answered in the negative. Thereafter Stone asked defendant if he would \u201cmind emptying his pockets\u201d, which defendant voluntarily did. Stone reported the results of his investigation to the \u201cguidance counselor and asked her if there was any further information that she could give because [defendant] had nothing on his person.\u201d Based on the information she developed from the student, the guidance counselor advised Stone to \u201ccheck [defendant\u2019s] book-bag.\u201d Stone then went to the art class from which defendant had been called, and the teacher there pointed out defendant\u2019s bookbag which Stone took to the conference room. Stone asked defendant \u201cif this was his bag\u201d and defendant answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>in the negative. In light of that response, Stone opened the bag and took out some books with defendant\u2019s name on them. Defendant \u201cgrabbed\u201d a hat taken from the bag and put it on. A brown paper bag was also taken from the bookbag. Stone found 75 vials of cocaine, not marijuana, in the brown paper bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The motion judge suppressed the evidence concluding that the search violated the Fourth Amendment based on holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>325, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>733, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>720 (1985). The judge, in essence, found that the basis for the guidance counselor\u2019s report to Stone was not sufficiently developed to justify a finding of \u201creasonable grounds\u201d and that there were insufficient \u201creasonable grounds\u201d developed to make further inquiry. The judge did not pass upon the State\u2019s alternative argument that the bag was opened only after the defendant denied ownership and that, therefore, defendant had no expectation of privacy with respect to the contents of the bookbag.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In <em>T.L.O., </em>the vice principal of the Piscataway High School received a report from a teacher that two girls were smoking in the girls\u2019 room, and the vice principal asked T.L.O. \u201cto come into his private office and demanded to see her purse. Opening the purse, he found a pack of cigarettes, which he removed from the purse and held before T.L.O. as he accused her of having lied to him.\u201d The vice principal also \u201cnoticed a package of cigarette rolling papers\u201d which he \u201cassociated with the use of marijuana.\u201d As a result the vice principal conducted a further investigation of the pocketbook and found \u201ca small amount of marijuana\u201d and paraphernalia. 469 <em>U.S. </em>at 328, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 736, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">While the United States Supreme Court granted the petition for <em>certiorari </em>to decide whether the exclusionary rule applied in the public school setting and the \u201cappropriate remedy in juvenile court proceedings for unlawful school searches\u201d, 469 <em>U.S. </em>at 332, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 737, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 728, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>determined that the search of T.L.O.\u2019s purse \u201cdid not violate the Fourth Amendment\u201d and, therefore, did not reach any issue concerning remedy. 469 <em>U.S. </em>at 333, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 738, 83 L.Ed.2d at 729. The Court held that the Fourth Amendment prohibited \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures ... conducted by public school officials\u201d, 469 <em>U.S. </em>at 333, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 738, 83 L.Ed.2d at 729, and that <em>\"... </em>what is reasonable depends on the context within which a search takes place\u201d, 469 <em>U.S. </em>at 337, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 740, 83 L.Ed.2d at 731. Speaking for the Court, Justice White noted that \u201c[a] search of a child\u2019s person or a closed purse or other bag carried on her person\u201d constitutes \u201ca severe violation of subjective expectations of privacy\u201d, 469 <em>U.S. </em>at 337-338, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 740-741, 83 L.Ed.2d at 732, but that \u201c[ajgainst the child\u2019s interest in privacy must be set the substantial interests of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in the classroom and on school grounds.\u201d 469 <em>U.S. </em>at 339, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 741, 83 L.Ed.2d at 733. In endeavoring to \u201cbalance between the school-child\u2019s legitimate expectations of privacy and the school\u2019s equally legitimate need to maintain an environment in which learning can take place\u201d, the Court decided that the \u201cwarrant requirement\u201d \u201cwould unduly interfere with the maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures needed in the schools.\u201d 469 <em>U.S. </em>at 340, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 742, 83 L.Ed.2d at 733. The Court concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">that the accommodation of the privacy interests of school children with the substantial needs of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools <em>does not require strict adherence to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause to believe that the subject of the search has violated or is violating the law. Rather, the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness, under all of the circumstances, </em>of the search. Determining the reasonableness of any search involves a twofold inquiry: first, one must consider \u2018whether the action was justified at its inception\u2019, second, one must determine whether the search as actually conducted \u2018was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place\u2019. Under ordinary circumstances, a search of a student by a teacher or other school official will be \u2018justified at its inception\u2019 when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school. Such a search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>nature of the infraction. [469 <em>U.S. </em>at 341-342,105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 742-743, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 734-735] (emphasis added; citations and footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In granting the motion to suppress, the motion judge here focused on the first of the two prongs mentioned for determining the reasonableness of the search. We conclude that the first prong was satisfied by a report from a specific student to a guidance counselor that defendant possessed a controlled dangerous substance and Stone\u2019s knowledge that defendant had previously been disciplined for possession of CDS. In any event, Stone did not conduct any search of the bookbag until after defendant expressly denied that it was his. We emphasize that, as the United States Supreme Court has stated in <em>T.L.O., </em>teachers and school administrators need not become involved in \u201cthe necessity of schooling themselves in the niceties of probable cause\u201d and that they can \u201cregulate their conduct according to the dictates of reason and common sense\u201d, 469 <em>U.S. </em>at 343, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 743, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 735. Vice Principal Stone did that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Just as the Supreme Court found that the search of the purse by the vice principal in the Piscataway school was reasonable in <em>T.L.O., </em>we conclude that the search of the bookbag by the vice principal in this case was also reasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Accordingly, the orders granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The <em>T.L.O. </em>Court left open for consideration a claim that the search violated the state constitution. <em>See </em>footnote 10, 469 <em>U.S. </em>at 343, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 744, 83 L.Ed.2d at 736. In arguing that \"the search and seizure of defendant by an assistant principal were not predicated on a reasonable suspicion that any search would turn up evidence that a student has violated or is violating the law or any school rules\u201d, defendant relies upon <em>T.L.O. </em>and does not argue any separate state constitutional right. In any event, we would find none in these circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
