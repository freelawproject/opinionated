The affidavit is defective in the fact that it does not allege or show that William H. Clark was the agent or attorney of the plaintiff, or authorized in any way to speak for him. We cannot assume or presume knowledge of absent facts. They are essential in order to sustain the attachment. The cases cited by the appellant are good law, but do not bear out the appellant\u2019s contention when applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-21\">Order affirmed, with costs.
