It is insisted, however, that the defendant was entitled as of right to the order changing the place of trial. A fatal objection to this claim appears in the fact that it defaulted in serving its answer, and not having made the motion in time, as prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure (sections 982-984, 986), the defendant was not in a position to insist, as a matter of right, that the place of trial should be changed. Vale v. Railroad, 12 Civ. Proc. R. 103; Taylor v. Smith (Sup.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">We think the order was right, and should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">On Motion for Reargument.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">(May 22, 1896.)</p>\n<author id=\"b228-13\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AhB\">It was not intended to express in the opinion the view that the motion to change the place of trial was not made within the number of days allowed by the Code to serve notice of such'a motion. We held, what we still think is the true rule,'that as a matter of strict legal right the demand must accompany the answer as provided by section 986 of the Code, and the answer itself must be served in time. In other words, if default has been made in answering, the subsequent service of the answer on the opening of such default, or the receipt of the answer by consent of the attorney, does not restore the party in default to a position where he can insist as a matter of strict legal right that the place of trial must be changed. Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
