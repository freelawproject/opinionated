The \u25a0defendant appellant, in his answer, among other things alleges that the plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law to protect all their rights and interests involved in this action. An injunction pendente lite was obtained by the plaintiffs, whereby it was ordered that the \u2022defendants, and each of them, \u201cbe enjoined and restrained from preventing, hindering, delaying, or interfering in any manner with the \u25a0plaintiffs in the cutting, harvesting, carrying away, or removing the grass, hay, grain, and crops now growing upon said premises.\u201d This practically put the plaintiffs in possession of the premises, and enabled them to harvest and carry away the crops thereon. The cause was noticed for trial, and placed upon the calendar of the special term for trial as an equity action. Upon motion of the \u25a0plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, the special term granted an order striking the cause from the calendar of such court, upon the ground \u201cthat the same is an action at law, and not an action in equity,\u201d and from that order the defendant George Decker appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Ordinarily, the question as to whether a cause should be stricken from the calendar at any term of the court rests in the sound discretion of the justice holding such term, and his disposition of that question will not be disturbed upon appeal; but, if his disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\u25a0of the cause proceeds upon a mistaken view as to the nature of the action, which will embarrass the parties, or may affect their legal rights upon the ultimate trial thereof, it then becomes a proper subject for review. The plaintiffs in this action are seeking both legal and equitable relief, and the full measure of relief prayed for by them in their complaint cannot be obtained except in a court of equity. The action is not merely an action of ejectment.* Only two of the defendants are alleged to be in possession of the premises. The other two defendants are not necessary defendants in an action of ejectment, they are made parties to the action, under the allegation that a conspiracy exists between all the, defendants to wrongfully hold possession of the premises, so as to wrongfully obtain and dispose of, for their own benefit, all the grass, hay, and crops growing thereon. They are all alleged to be insolvent, and that the plaintiffs will be irreparably damaged if they are permitted to proceed, and that the plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law, and they ask for an injunction. It is unnecessary, it seems to me, to \u25a0enter into any discussion to show that these facts, together with the relief asked, makes the case one for a court of equity. It is unnecessary to cite authorities to show that the plaintiffs may properly demand both legal- and equitable relief in the same action, and, where a \u201cplaintiff brings an action for both legal and equitable relief in respect to the same cause of action, the case presented is not \u2022one of right, triable by jury under the constitution, and the plaintiff, by such election, submits to have the issues tried by the court, \u25a0or by the court with the aid of a jury, as the court in its discretion may determine, according to the practice in equity cases.\u201d Cogswell v. Railroad Co., 105 N. Y. 319, 11 N. E. 518; Lynch v. Railroad Co., 129 N. Y. 274-288, 29 N. E. 315. Whatever may be the rule where a defendant asserts, in his answer, that there is an adequate remedy at law, and that the plaintiff is not entitled to equitable relief, and demands, at the trial, that the action be tried as one at law and not in equity, is of no consequence upon this appeal. The plaintiffs, by the nature of the relief asked in their complaint, have waived nil right to have their action tried as an action at law, and the defendant appellant has assented to and asks that the same be tried as an action in equity; and the plaintiffs, having sought equitable relief, and partially obtained it by their temporary injunction, cannot now,.upon their own motion, against the protest of the defend-ant, remove it from an equitable to a legal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
