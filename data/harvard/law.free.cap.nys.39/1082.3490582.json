When she withdrew from their service, she left the hotel, telling one of defendant\u2019s servants that she would send J.\u2019s Express for her trunk, and on the same day she left an order to call for her trunk. On the next day, one of J.\u2019s drivers called for the trunk, but was told that it had been delivered to another expressman on the day before. The expressman to whom the trunk was delivered had a slip of paper with plaintiff\u2019s name on it, and he was allowed to take the trunk, but no receipt was required, nor did defendant\u2019s servants ascertain his name or the license number of his wagon, or require him to leave the slip of paper.

It appears that in May, 1895, Mr. and Mrs. Schonthal (who subsequently employed the plaintiff) came to the hotel, and engaged rooms for themselves, child, and maidservant. During their stay they changed servants, and on October 30, 1895, the plaintiff was engaged as maid and seamstress. She was assigned to a room, ate at the table of the hotel, with other persons similarly employed by the guests, and her board was regularly paid by her employers while she remained there. The plaintiff left the Schonthals November 18, 1895, and on the morning of that \u25a0day departed from the hotel, with the avowed intention of not returning. Before leaving, she gave one of the defendant\u2019s servants the key to the room she had occupied, and told him she would send Jackson\u2019s Express for her trunk. The defendant contends that the Schonthals came to the hotel under a special contract for board, and were therefore boarders, not guests. Even if this be so, the plaintiff, by virtue of her employment, and the contract between the Schonthals and the defendant, became a boarder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>likewise, and whatever liability the defendant assumed as to them extended in like manner to her. It was incumbent on him, therefore, to exercise such care over the property of his boarder as a prudent person would take of his own property, and he became liable for the negligence of his servants while acting within the scope of their employment. Smith v. Read, 6 Daly, 33, 52 How. Prac. 14. Assuming that after the departure of the plaintiff from the hotel, the contractual relation having ceased, the defendant became liable for the property committed to his charge only as an ordinary bailee (Wintermute v. Clark, 5 Sandf. 242), the question is whether he exercised over it \u201cthe same or as much care as he takes of his own property of a like kind,\u201d or \u201csuch care as the circumstances and the nature of the property naturally call for.\u201d Edw. Bailm. \u00a7 43. On November 18, 1895, the plaintiff left the order with Jackson\u2019s Express to call for her trunk. Manning, one of the drivers employed by that concern, called at the hotel for the trunk the next morning, and demanded the trunk, but was told that it had been delivered to another expressman on the previous day. The defendant proved that a man with a wagon called on November 18, 1895; that he had a slip of paper with the plaintiff\u2019s name thereon; and that upon demanding the trunk he was allowed to take it. The defendant took no receipt for the trunk. Randolph, the hallman, who delivered it, testified that he had worked in hotels for six or seven years, and that in general they took receipts, but that \u201che did not think to take a receipt for help\u2019s trunks.\u201d He did not obtain the name of the man to whom he delivered it, or ascertain the license number of his wagon, or require him to leave the slip of paper containing the plaintiff\u2019s name; so that the defendant was unable to give any information concerning where the trunk had gone, or where it could be found, further than it was given to an unknown expressman. The plaintiff testified that the delivery made was without her authority, and that although she had consulted detectives, and made efforts to recover her property, she had not been able to obtain it. The delivery of the plaintiff\u2019s trunk under such circumstances was not the exercise of that care which the law imposed upon the defendant, and made him liable to the plaintiff for its loss, on the ground of gross negligence. The rule is that a bailee for hire, or a gratuitous bailee, who delivers the goods he has as such bailee to a wrong party, is liable to the true owner for their value. Covkendall v. Eaton, 55 Barb., at page 193, and cases cited. And\" it is clearly applicable to this case, upon the proofs presented; for the facts show an indifference respecting the safety of the plaintiff\u2019s property, and disregard of the usage as to taking receipts, which excludes the idea that any diligence was used by the defendant to insure its delivery to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">The justice awarded judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor for $75. It is satisfactorily sustained by the evidence, and must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
