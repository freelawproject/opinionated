This, evidence was sufficient to warrant defendant\u2019s removal as assignee, and to sustain the decision which was made. It was not necessary nor did the court convict the defendant of mala fides in-connection\" with his trust; but the court found that defendant unwarrantably delayed and neglected to perform the duties of his trust, and this was sufficient upon which to found a judgment removing him as trustee. In re Mechanics\u2019 Bank, 2 Barb. 446. It appears, however, that all the available assets of the estate have been collected, and all that remains to be done is to take and state the account of the assignee, and distribute the fund to those entitled. This may as well be done under the direction of the court as to burden the estate with the expense of a new assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">The judgment will therefore be modified by providing that, upon the coming in of the report of the referee, the moneys of the estate with which the assignee shall be found chargeable shall be paid into court, and distributed to those entitled, under its direction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
