Gumbleton and Edward Cahill, now assessors, be, and are hereby, removed from their said position as assessors. Such removal to take effect immediately.\u201d After the passage of this resolution the relator was notified by the secretary of the board that he was so removed. He thereupon notified the board that his removal was contrary to law, and protested against the same. The appointment was not in express terms for any particular time, and the respondents claim that the duration of the time of his office was not provided for by the constitution or' declared by law, but he held such office during the pleasure of the board, and the respondents therefore had the power to remove him, at their pleasure, and without assigning any reason therefor.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b164-12\">Argued before YAH BRUHT, P.

The relator was not within any of the provisions of law limiting the power of removal, as in cases of the police force, heads of bureaus, clerks, veterans, etc. We see no escape, therefore, from the conclusion that the respondents had the power to remove the relator from his office as assessor, at their pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The writ should be dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
