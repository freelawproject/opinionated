Josephine Whitman was devisee of an interest in the real estate, situate in said county, of which the testator died seised. The appellant then had, and still holds, a&gt; judgment against said Josephine, docketed in said county February 14, 1889, for $417.91, which became and is a valid lien upon said real estate so devised, and can be fully satisfied out of the same, unless the paper now offered shall be probated as a codicil to said will, in which case the said devise to Josephine will be superseded, and the appellant\u2019s judgment be uncollectible. Application was made July 2, 1895, to the surrogate of said county, for the-probate of said codicil, and thereupon proceedings were instituted for the probate thereof. The appellant was not cited, but, as judgment creditor of said Josephine, he thereupon applied to the surrogate, upon a verified petition alleging the facts above set forth, for leave to appear in the proceedings- and contest the probate. The surrogate denied the application, and this appeal is from the order of denial. It appears that Josephine is a lunatic.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b532-15\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Josephine Whitman has prima facie the legal title. It is proposed to destroy this prima facie lien by probating a codicil to the will of Josephine\u2019s father, which will was duly probated five years ago. The surrogate\u2019s order denies to the appellant leave to appear and contest the proposed probate; thus denying to him the right to resist at the threshold, where it can best be done, the attack upon his prima facie right. Section 2617,. Code Civ. Proc., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u2022\u2018Any person, although not cited, who is named as devisee or legatee, in the will propounded, or as executor, trustee, devisee or legatee in any other paper purporting to be a will of the decedent, or who is otherwise interested in sustaining or defeating the will, may appear, and at his election support \u2022or oppose the application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We think the appellant is within the letter of the statute, and clearly within its spirit. Lafferty v. Lafferty, 5 Redf. 326; Turhune v. Brookfield, 1 Redf. 220; Walsh v. Ryan, 1 Bradf. (Sur.) 433. In Re Brown, 47 Hun, 360, it was held that the receiver of the property of a judgment debtor could not contest the probate of the will of the wife of the debtor, although, if probate should be denied, the debtor would come into property enough to pay his debts. The difference between compelling a debtor to acquire property enough to satisfy his creditors, and disabling the creditor to protect the lien which he has already acquired upon his debtor\u2019s property, is apparent. Section 2514, subd. 11, is cited as limiting the meaning of a \u201cperson interested.\u201d It declares that when the expression \u201cis used in connection with an estate or fund [it] includes every person entitled either absolutely or contingently to share in the estate or the proceeds thereof, or in the fund, as husband, wife, legatee, next of kin, heir, devisee, assignee, grantee or otherwise, except as creditor.\u201d Whether a will is admitted to probate, or not, does not affect the creditor of the decedent. He therefore need not be a party. The inclusion of the parties named is not the exclusion of those also included by the terms of section 2617 of the same chapter of the act. Section 2617, in addition to the parties therein enumerated, includes a party who is interested otherwise than are the enumerated parties in sustaining or defeating the will. We. think, under the circumstances, the appellant is such a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The order of the surrogate is reversed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements against the proponent, and leave is granted to the appellant to appear and contest the probate. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
