Upon information and belief that at all the times herein mentioned the 'defendant company had a rule, regulation, and custom whereby its agents and servants directed and permitted passengers that were smoking to stand upon the front platform of its closed cars, and that smoking elsewhere upon ,its said closed street cars was and is prohibited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">In disposing of this appeal the settled rules of pleading may be briefly referred to. A pleading may state facts as they actually \u2022exist or according to their legal effect. \u201cIn most cases either mode '\u2022of pleading, at the option of the party, is correct.\u201d Bennett v. Judson, 21 N. Y. 238; Farron v. Sherwood, 17 N. Y. 227; Barney v. Worthington, 37 N. Y. 112. That the plaintiff\u2019s intestate \u201cboarded and got upon the front platform of one of the defendant\u2019s street \u2022cars,\u201d or that he was thrown \u201cfrom the said platform of said car,\u201d \u2022are not irrelevant statements, but allegations of the actual facts. It will frequently happen that where a pleading alleges the facts ac\u2022cording to their legal effect the opposite party, to obtain knowledge as to the proof which he is obliged to meet on the trial, and thus avoid being surprised, is obliged to move either for a bill of particulars or to make the complaint more definite and certain. See cases cited above. As the getting on and riding upon the front platform might, upon proof that it was contrary to' the rules of the road, which, under the general railroad law, would relieve the defendant irom liability, render it necessary to furnish a reason or excuse for the conduct of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, this is what plaintiff attempted to do by pleading, in the fourth paragraph of the complaint, that the defendant had a rule which \u201cpermitted passengers that were smoking to stand upon the front platform of its closed cars.\u201d It may well be that the failure to connect plaintiff\u2019s intestate with this allegation by stating that he was smoking, etc., or the failure to prove such facts, may prevent defendant\u2019s rule being available as an excuse, but this is quite different from concluding that it is so irrelevant as to justify its being stricken out. And though it may be unnecessary to allege in a complaint what it is essentially necessary to prove upon the trial, that.plaintiff\u2019s intestate was free from contributory negligence (Hackford v. Railroad Co., 6 Lans. 381, affirmed 53 N. Y. 654; Lee v. Gas Light Co., 98 N. Y. 115), still it is not improper to plead or allege that fact. We do not mean to pass upon the effect or sufficiency of the allegation; our purpose being to show that the paragraph is germane to the subject of the action, and may be a link in the chain of proof, and therefore matter proper to be given in evidence. It has been held that a motion to strike out alleged irrelevant matter should be granted \u201cwith reluctance and caution,\u201d and \u201conly where no doubt exists of the irrelevancy charged. '* * * There is still another rule, * * * and that is, there must be some evidence that the retention of the allegations would embarrass the defendants in their defense; something shown establishing harm or injustice.\u201d Williams v. Folsom, 57 Hun, 128, 10 N. Y. Supp. 895; Town of Dunkirk v. Lake Shore &amp; M. S. Ry. Co. (Sup.) 27 N. Y. Supp. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>We think that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.
