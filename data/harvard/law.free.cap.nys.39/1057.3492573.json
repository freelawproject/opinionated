Price 820,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-17\">Within a month from the day upon which the employment took effect, the defendant herself secured a purchaser, and sold the premises. On the next succeeding day the plaintiff presented a customer, who was able and willing to purchase upon the prescribed terms, and upon such customer\u2019s rejection by the defendant this action was instituted to recover the plaintiff\u2019s commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-18\">Upon the trial the justice ruled, in effect, that the defendant, pursuant to the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s employment, was precluded from selling to a person other than a purchaser secured by the plaintiff, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>cept at the risk o\u00ed being compelled to pay the latter\u2019s commissions, if within the period limited for such employment he should present a customer who was able and willing to pay the price demanded, and otherwise to comply with the defendant's terms. The charge to the jury embodied the ruling alluded to, and the exceptions to such charge present the only assignments of error which merit discussion. It is ordinarily true, as the defendant\u2019s counsel urges, that the employment of one broker does not disable the owner from employing another, or from negotiating a sale in person (Chilton v. Butler, 1 E. D. Smith, 150; Goldsmith v. Cook, 14 N. Y. Supp. 878), since the right of the principal to do, in person or by another, that which he has empowered his agent to do, is an implied condition of every agency (Dole v. Sherwood [Minn.] 43 N. W. 569); but it must be conceded that if the owner employs a broker with the understanding that the latter\u2019s agency shall be exclusive, the owner will subject himself to liability for breach of contract if, notwithstanding, he engages or avails himself of the aid of another broker for the same purpose (Moses v. Bierling, 31 N. Y. 462). However, it should be observed that the case at bar differs materially from the case of a mere exclusive agency to negotiate a sale, upon application of the rule governing the interpretation of contracts, that effect should be given, if possible, to every part of the contract under review. 2 Pars. Cont. 89; Flanagan v. Fox, 6 Misc. Rep. 132, 26 N. Y. Supp. 48. It is apparent from the contract before us that it was thereby intended not only to secure to the plaintiff the exclusive agency to negotiate a sale, but also the exclusive right to negotiate a sale during the period limited. Schultz v. Griffin, 5 Misc. Rep. 499, 26 N. Y. Supp. 713; Dole v. Sherwood, supra; Golden Gate Packing Co. v. Farmers' Union, 55 Cal. 606. Such a right necessarily resulted from the plaintiff\u2019s \u201coption\u201d to sell, unless, indeed, the contracting parties are to be charged with redundancy. The word \u201coption\u201d may have been inartiflcially chosen by the parties, but while it remains its effect is not to be avoided. It is a synonym for \u201cchoice\u201d or \u201cpreference\u201d (Cent. Diet., \u201cOption\u201d), and so must be taken as evidence of an intention to confer upon the plaintiff a right which he was to possess or enjoy above all other persons. The exclusive agency of the plaintiff to negotiate a sale in the defendant\u2019s behalf plainly followed from the context of the writing hereinbefore set forth, without reference or allusion to such \u201coption,\u201d and unless, therefore, it is held that the defendant intended to waive her right to negotiate a sale in person, so much of the contract as undertook to give the plaintiff an \u201coption\u201d to sell must be held to be meaningless or redundant, in violation of the rule of interpretation already alluded to. The exclusive agency to negotiate a sale, independently of any \u201coption\u201d to sell, secured to the plaintiff a preference over all persons other than the defendant. Obviously, therefore, the \u201coption,\u201d choice, or preference in the negotiation of a sale was intended to secure him against the interference of the defendant in person as- well. The verdict is amply supported by the facts in evidence, and the judgment should, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
