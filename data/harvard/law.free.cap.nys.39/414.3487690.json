The complaint, after the usual allegation, stated that defendant Degan and others-\u201chave or claim to have some interest in or lien upon the said mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>gaged premises, or some part thereof, which interest or lien, if any, has accrued subsequently to the lien of the said two mortgages.\u201d Defendant Degan answered as follows: \u201cThe defendant William Degan, for separate answer to the complaint herein, (1) denies that he has or claims to have some interest in or lien upon the premises described in said complaint as therein alleged. (2) Defendant, for further and separate defense herein, alleges that he has not, at any time or times whatsoever, had or claimed to have, and does not now hold nor claim to hold, any interest in or lien upon said premises of any nature or kind. Wherefore said defendant asks that the complaint herein be dismissed as to him, with costs.\u201d From an order</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajt\">striking out said answer as frivolous, defendant Degan appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AoK\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b439-5\">Argued before PARKER, P.

This answer did so, and therefore is not frivolous. No doubt the defense is an unreasonable one, but the plaintiff might have served with the summons notice upon the defendant that no personal claim was made upon him (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 423), and thus probably have protected himself against this answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion below denied, with $10 costs, without prejudice to any motion, as plaintiff may be advised. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
