McNally v. Insurance Co., 137 N. Y. 389, 33 N. E. 475. Observing the rule stated, the case, as developed upon the trial, was that during the years 1882 and 1883 the plaintiff effected five policies of life insurance in the defendant company, upon each of which policies she regularly paid the weeldy premiums as they matured until March, 1895, amounting in the aggregate to $165.95, and that thereafter the defendant unjustifiably assumed to forfeit each of such policies for nonperformance of a condition subsequent, to wit, the payment of premiums maturing subsequently to those actually paid. The question which arose upon the motion of the defendant\u2019s counsel for dismissal of the complaint was solely with regard to rhe plaintiff\u2019s right to recover in assumpsit, as for money had and received by the defendant to her use, the premiums paid, and we concur in the justice\u2019s decision that, the plaintiff had mistaken her remedy. Granting that upon the defendant\u2019s breach the plaintiff could treat the contract, with regard to each of the policies, as determined, it does not follow that the defendant was bound, ex rnquo et bona, to restore the premiums received by it, for which, in part at least, the plaintiff had had value, in the risk assumed by the defendant. Plainly, the plaintiff could not predicate a rescission of the contract of the defendant\u2019s breach, without restitution by her of what she had received under the contract; and a contract of life insurance being essentially indivisible, in point of performance, by either of the parties thereto (Cohn v. Insurance Co., 50 N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>Y. 610), such restitution was, in the nature of things, impossible (Whart. Cont. \u00a7 748; Clark, Cont. 774; Hunt v. Silk, 5 East, 449). In a case such as the one at bar, if the insured is unwilling to await the maturity of the policy, and then to test its continued vitality, only two remedies are available: The insured may either sue at law for damages for the insurer\u2019s breach of contract, or prosecute an action in equity to have the policy adjudged to be in force, and the insurer to accept the premium refused. Suth. Dam. \u00a7 838; Speer v. Insurance Co., 36 Hun, 323; Day v. Insurance Co., 45 Conn. 480; Hayner v. Insurance Co., 69 N. Y. 435; Cohn v. Insurance Co., supra. The case at bar should be distinguished from a case where the failure of consideration for the premiums paid is entire, in that the risk to be assumed by the insurer under the policy never attached; the policy being avoided for noncompliance with a condition precedent, fraud, or .other causes. 11 Am. &amp; Eng.
