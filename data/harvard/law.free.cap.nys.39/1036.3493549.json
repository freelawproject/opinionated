People v. Mather, 4 Wend. 229; Close v. Olney, 1 Denio, 319. See cases cited in opinion in Brown v. Walker,. 161 U. S. 588, at page 598, 16 Sup. Ct. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>In answer to the application were read the affidavits of the severa) defendants that neither of them had in his possession, or under, his control, the books, papers, and documents of which an inspection was sought. This is the only allegation in the affidavits\u201d upon the subject. This assertion was not sufficient to defeat the application. The several defendants did not deny the existence of such books and papers, nor did they account for the fact that such books and papers were not in their possession or control If the books and papers once existed, it was incumbent upon the defendants to satisfy the court that either they had been lost or destroyed, or how and in what manner the defendants had lost control or possession of them.
