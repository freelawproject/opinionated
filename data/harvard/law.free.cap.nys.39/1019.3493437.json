This particular action was tried in the Buffalo superior court in February, 1895, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. At the same term a motion was made upon the minutes of the court for a new trial upon the various grounds specified in section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which was denied, and judgment for damages and costs was entered upon the 5th day of April, 1895. Upon the 29th day of April an appeal was taken from such judgment, and from the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, to the general term of the superior court, where an affirmance was had in the month of December following, and thereupon an appeal was taken to the court of appeals, which is still pending. The more material portion of the newly-discovered evidence which is set out in the moving affidavits was discovered as early as March 1, 1895, and it appears to be more or less material to the issues tried; but whether it is of such a character as to justify the conclusion that it would probably have changed the result, could the defendant have had the benefit of it upon the trial, is somewhat problematical, inasmuch as it appears that since its discovery two additional actions have been tried, with the result that the plaintiff succeeded in one of them, and the defendant in the other. But, whatever view may properly obtain as to this feature of the motion, we feel constrained to affirm the order appealed from, upon the ground of loches on the part of the defendant; for it appears that this motion was not made until November, 1895, which was more than eight months after the additional evidence is claimed to have been discovered. During this interim the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>had the opportunity of weighing its effect upon the minds of the jury in the two cases adverted to, and it was not until the second of those cases had been tried, and a result reached favorable to the defendant, that any effort was made to obtain a copy of the minutes of the evidence of the newly-discovered witnesses, upon which to found the defendant\u2019s motion. In the meantime the defendant had elected to appeal from the order denying its motion for a new trial, and from the judgment entered thereon, and this appeal was argued at the general term before the motion for a new trial upon the ground of newly-discovered evidence was brought to a hearing. We' do not overlook the fact that there is much in the evidence in this case to warrant the inference which the defendant seeks to draw therefrom, but at the same time we are reminded that it has received careful consideration at the hands of an impartial jury, whose conclusion thereon the trial court found no occasion to disturb, and that the same judge who presided at the trial has likewise determined that the newly-discovered evidence was not of such a character as to justify him in granting a new trial. In view of all these circumstances, but more particularly, by reason of the defendant\u2019s delay in bringing the motion to a hearing until after judgment had been entered, we think the order appealed from should be affirmed.
