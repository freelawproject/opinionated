The defendant, in his answer, denied the main allegations of the petition, except as to amount of rent, and alleged that the renting was for the term of one year from April 1, 1891, and that, after that' date, he held over from year to year, so that his tenancy would not expire until April 1, 1896. He also alleged that, on the 1st of November, 1895, he paid to the petitioner, and the latter accepted, the sum of $4 for one month\u2019s rent, ending November 30th following.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-19\">The payment of $4 for the rent of November, 1895, was testified to by the defendant and by another witness, and was not in terms denied by the plaintiff. The counsel for the plaintiff claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>that this was for rent for occupancy prior to November 1st. Assuming that the justice may have so found, the question, then, is whether the tenancy has ever been properly terminated. It was alleged that a month\u2019s notice to quit was given. A notice was served on the 2d of October, 1895, and the proceeding was commenced on the 2d of November, 1895. \u201cThe day from which any specified number of days, weeks, or months of time is reckoned shall be excluded in making the reckoning.\u201d Section 27 of the statutory construction law, as amended by chapter 447 of the Laws of 1894. \u201cThe rule is well settled that, in computing time, the first, day, or the day when the time begins to run, is to be excluded.\u201d Parker, J., in Judd v. Fulton, 10 Barb. 117. So that, under the month\u2019s notice which was served on October 2d, the defendant had all of the 2d of November in which to leave; and on that basis the proceeding was prematurely commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">It is, however, claimed by the counsel for the plaintiff that no notice to quit was necessary. The renting here, according to the petition and according to the testimony of the plaintiff, was for no fixed period. There was no writing. The plaintiff testifies that, on or about November 1, 1890, the defendant came to him, and asked him if he could have the premises, and the plaintiff replied he could at $4 a month and make his own repairs, and that nothing was said about the length of term he was to occupy; that he (defendant) paid $20 down, and made payments afterwards, but the plaintiff cannot state when, but they were not made regularly. The defendant testifies that, in December, 1890, he hired the premises; that he told plaintiff he wanted the house for the winter and one year from the 1st of April then next; and the plaintiff replied, \u201cAll right\u201d; that he was to pay him $4 a month, payable every month,\u2014nothing being said when payable, whether first or last of month; and that he paid, most of the time, about the 10th or 15th of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In People v. Darling, 47 N. Y. 666, it was held that, \u201cwhere a tenant is in possession under a paroi agreement, void by the statute of frauds, and has occupied for a year, paying the rent monthly, this creates a tenancy from month to month, which can only be terminated by a month\u2019s notice to quit, expiring with the end of some month reckoning from the beginning of the tenancy.\u201d The doctrine of this and kindred cases, applied to the evidence on the part of the defendant, would entitle him to a month\u2019s notice to quit. The evidence on the part of plaintiff presents no more definite term. It was not a lease for a definite time, and then a holding over, in fact or by implication, for a like definite time. It was, in substance, that the defendant, as long as he paid $4 a month, could occupy, until the plaintiff gave him notice to the contrary. In Pugsley v. Aikin, 11 N. Y. 494, 498, it was held that a renting \u201cfor one year from the 1st day of April, 1848, and an indefinite period thereafter,\u201d could not be determined except by notice. See, also, Wilson v. Taylor, 8 Daly, 256; Hoffman v. Van Allen, 3 Misc. 99, 23 N. Y. Supp. 682; Ludington v. Garlock, 9 N. Y. Supp. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>We are of the opinion that the defendant was entitled to notice to quit, and that, the notice given being insufficient, the plaintiff failed to make out a case for dispossession.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Judgment of the county court and of the justice reversed, with costs in all the courts. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
