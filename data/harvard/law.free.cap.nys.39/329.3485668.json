The policy was for one year from November 13, 1894, and covered household furniture, wearing apparel, etc. The questions presented for review are based on a condition of the policy providing that, \u201cin the event of disagreement as to the amount of loss, the same shall * * * be ascertained by two competent and disinterested appraisers, the assured and this company each selecting one.\u201d In accordance with this provision, the defendant demanded an appraisal, and named an appraiser.' The plaintiff thereupon nominated William A. Baird as her appraiser. The defendant objected to Mr. Baird, and Charles H. Otto was named in his place. Otto was in like manner objected to, and the plaintiff finally appointed George A. Handte as appraiser. The defendant objected to Handte, on the ground that he was at the time, or shortly prior thereto, a partner of Mr. Kinney, the plaintiff\u2019s adjuster upon the loss in question, and not wholly disinterested. The plaintiff then brought suit, and, at the end of her case, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground that the plaintiff had failed to perform the condition of the policy requiring the appointment of a disinterested appraiser, that the loss might be determined without action. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The court, in charging the jury, submitted to them the question whether any one of the persons named by the plaintiff was a competent or disinterested man, within the meaning of the policy; charged that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiff to establish that the persons she selected were competent and disinterested, and, unless the plaintiff sustained that burden by a preponderance of proof, she could not recover. The jury having found in favor of the plaintiff, it must be assumed upon this appeal that Handte was disinterested, as well as competent. Uhrig v. Insurance Co., 101 N. Y. 362, 4 N. E. 745; Bradshaw v. Insurance Co., 137 N. Y. 137, 32 N. E. 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The defendant claims that the court erred in refusing to charge that \u201cif the jury find that Mr. Handte, Mr. Otto, and Mr. Baird, the three persons named by the plaintiff as appraisers, were in point of fact public adjusters, and were then, or recently had been, partners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>of the plaintiff\u2019s agent, Mr. Kinney, they were neither competent nor disinterested, within the meaning of the policy.\u201d The fact that Handte had about two months previously been a partner of Mr. Kinney did not per se make him interested (Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 672; 6 Lawson, Rights, Rem. &amp; Prac. \u00a7 3328); nor did the fact that he had formerly been an insurance adjuster necessarily make him interested. Hence the question whether there was any force in the objection was, under the cases cited, properly submitted to the jury, and their finding should, for the purposes of this appeal, be regarded as conclusive. The fact that Handte had been an insurance adjuster would certainly tend to prove his competency for the task he was to assume, and the condition of the policy requires the appraiser to be not only disinterested, but competent, and both of these requirements were complied with in the appointment made. In the Bradshaw Case, supra, the court held that the word \u201cdisinterested,\u201d as used in the policy, does not mean simply a lack of pecuniary interest, but requires the appraiser to be \u201cone who is not biased or prejudiced.\u201d There was no solid ground for asserting that Handte was biased or prejudiced; and the presumption is that he was honest, and would perform his duty. Wood, Prac. Ev. 226, 228; 1 Phil. Ev. (Cow., H. &amp; E. notes) marg. p. 605; Fenlon v. Dempsey (Sup.) 2 N. Y. Supp. 763; Turner v. Kouwenhoven, 100 N. Y. 115, 2 N. E. 637; Kinsella v. City of Auburn (Sup.) 7 N. Y. Supp. 317; Wheeler v. Wheeler (Sup.) 2 N. Y. Supp. 496. Assuming, therefore, that Handte was competent as well as disinterested, it was immaterial whether the objections urged to the preceding appointees had or had not merit, for the plaintiff acquiesced in the objections when she designated Handte, and took the risk of asserting the propriety of his selection. The request to charge that Handte was disqualified if the jury found that he was in point of fact an adjuster, and had, prior to his selection as appraiser, been a partner of Mr. Kinney, went too far, and was therefore properly declined. The alleged facts contained in the request did not import bias or prejudice against the defendant, and, apart from this, did not necessarily disqualify Handte. It would be unwarrantable to hold that every insurance adjuster is presumed to be prejudiced against insurance cdinpanies, and therefore disqualified, as matter of law, to act in the indifferent capacity of appraiser. If any particular reason exists why a certain appraiser should not act, the reason must be specifically stated, that its sufficiency may be passed upon in the light of the proofs offered. That was done here, with a result unfavorable to the defendant, after a careful submission of the question to the jury; and that is about as far as the inquiry can extend. In the Uhrig Case, supra, it is held that, \u201cunder the arbitration clause, it was the duty of each party to act in good faith to accomplish the appraisement in the way provided in the policy; and if either party acted in bad faith, so as to defeat the real object of the clause, it absolved the other party from compliance therewith; and if either party refused to go on with the arbitration, or to complete it, * * * so that there could be an agreement upon an ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>praisal, the other party was absolved.\u201d And the court justly observed that <em>\u201ca </em>claimant under such a policy cannot be tied up forever without his fault, and against his will, by an ineffectual arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The exceptions are without merit; and as the verdict finds support in the evidence, and has the approval of the trial judge and the general term of the court in which the action was tried, the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
