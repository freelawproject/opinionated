He was a workman in the employ of the defendants, and he avers that the designs in question were invented at odd hours, outside of his regular hours of work, and upon Sundays. There-were two questions in the case: First, whether there was an im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>plied promise on the part of the defendants to pay for these designs ; and, second, what was their reasonable value.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The plaintiff was in the defendants\u2019 employ. There was no express agreement to pay him for these designs apart from his regular wages. Whether, from the defendants\u2019 request to make the designs, an implied promise arose to pay therefor, depended upon the special circumstances of the case. The making of the designs was not, apparently, within the plaintiff\u2019s regular employment. They were made largely outside of his ordinary hours of work. He says that one of the defendants told him to make them at home, and that he made many of them there. There is other evidence tending to show that these particular services were not included in the plaintiff\u2019s regular work, and that the defendants recognized the fact when they made the special request upon which the action is founded. We think there was enough, at all events, to go to the jury upon this head, and that they were authorized to find an understanding between the parties that the plaintiff should be compensated for the extra and special services in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The plaintiff wholly failed, however, to prove the value of these services. He attempted to prove a custom as to the compensation for such designs. He endeavored to show that it was the custom to allow therefor 10 per cent, upon the cost of each article made therefrom. We have examined the testimony carefully upon this head, and it is entirely clear that no such custom was proved, and that none such exists. Such a custom would be preposterous, and so, indeed, the jury must have thought, for their verdict bears n\u00bb earthly relation to the plaintiff\u2019s claim on this head. The case was tried without the slightest regard to the rules of law governing the measure of damages. The plaintiff was permitted to prove, under objections and exception, that, when he first entered the defendants\u2019 employ, there were but 10 workmen in the shop, while, after his designs came in, the business increased so rapidly that the defendants employed from 60 to 70 workmen. After this testimony had been repeated several times, the learned trial judge acknowledged that it was \u201cutterly immaterial,\u201d and stated that he allowed it for the purpose of indulging the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his own theory of the case. It would have been better had the learned judge followed his own clear views,\u2014better for the speedy and correct administration of justice, and better, in the end, for the plaintiff. But this testimony was worse than immaterial. It left the jury, in a case which was entirely barren of legal evidence as to the value of the plaintiff\u2019s services, to speculate upon the general improvement in the defendants\u2019 business occasioned by the plaintiff\u2019s talent as a designer. It left them entirely free to give unliquidated damages. Then, too, the learned judge\u2019s charge afforded the jury no guide upon this subject. There is not a suggestion as to the true rule or the proper measure of compensation. The jury were left entirely at sea, to deal with idle and incompetent testimony according to their own notions, and were permitted, in a general and loose way, to do just what they pleased. A verdict thus unsupported by competent evidence, and arrived at without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>instructions as to the proper measure of compensation, cannot be permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and n new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
