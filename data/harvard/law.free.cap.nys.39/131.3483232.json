The answer was that the rates would be, on the 6,000 barrels of rosin to Chicago, twelve cents per 100 pounds, and on the 2,500 barrels of rosin to Buffalo <em>6yz </em>cents per 100 pounds. The reply was that that was satisfactory, and the plaintiffs were thereupon requested to confirm it by letter. In pursuance of that request the plaintiffs addressed the following letter, which is in evidence, bearing date August 3, 1891, to the Ocean Steamship Company, the defendant, in this case, in which they state as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-14\">\u201c \u2018Gentlemen: Herewith confirmed, the rates quoted you over the telephone this day, viz.: 6,000 barrels of rosin, New York to Chicago, 12 cts. per 100 lbs.; 2,500 barrels rosin, New York to Buffalo, 6% cts. per 100 lbs.

Stiiwell, Jr., on the following day, which reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">\u201c \u2018Mr. George W. Stiiwell, Jr., G. M. Inland Transportation Company,- 109 &amp; 111 Broad St., N. Y.

The intention surely was to do something more than convey information. The intention was clearly to bind. The letters were not written merely to refresh the recollection of the people who had spoken to each other at the telephone, nor to keep a record of a passing conversation. It will be observed that there is nothing indefinite either in the telephonic communication or in the letters. Every element of a contract is clearly specified. The precise number of barrels is stated, the charge per pound for transportation, the place where the goods are to be received and where they are to be delivered. As to part of the goods, shipment is limited to the very month when the arrangement was made. Thus the case is distinguished from Railway Co. v. Dane, 43 N. Y. 240, where the defendant offered by letter to receive iron, not to exceed a certain number of tons. It is true that in the case at bar the parties do not literally use the words \u201cWe agree to transport 6,000 barrels of rosin from New York to Chicago at 12 cts. per 100 pounds, and 2,500 barrels of rosin from New York to Buffalo at 6-3,- cts. per 100 pounds.\u201d But the agreement upon the one side to furnish the rosin for transportation, and upon the other to transport it, is plainly implied from the language used. They were business men. They were not drafting a legal document when they wrote these letters. They were .making their contract in their -own way, and expressing themselves in their common parlance. It was either that or an immense amount of precise formality about nothing. The letters were senseless unless they intended to contract; and there could be no binding contract about a rate disconnected with a contract to transport at such rate. The defendant requested a written confirmation of the telephone arrangement. 'The plaintiffs requested a written acceptance of that confirmation. All this was surely not to put each other upon honor, or to effect a mere option. When one side confirmed the rates quoted, that was the carriers\u2019 short, mercantile way of saying that they would transport at those rates. When the other side accepted the confirmed rate, that was the shippers\u2019 or brother carriers\u2019 short mercantile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>way of saying that they would furnish the goods and pay the rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">There was no question to go to the jury as to the intention of the parties. It was a pure question of law upon the plain language of the letters which followed the telephonic communication. Nor was there evidence suggestive of any other possible meaning than that fairly apparent upon the face of the writings construed with reference to such previous communications. Indeed, the surrounding circumstances, and everything which subsequently transpired, are conclusive in favor of the construction put upon these letters by the learned judge. There was not a particle of evidence favoring any other construction. The defendant\u2019s agent, Walker, testified that a year before this transaction the plaintiffs notified them that \u201crates, to hold good, must be accepted.\u201d It seems that the defendant had previously suffered from the lack of a binding contract, and had found itself helpless when rates were suddenly advanced. It was doubtless to prevent this state of things that it was determined in future to make binding arrangements with regard to the rates. But how would that avail if, as the defendant contends, the carriers were not to be bound by their engagement, nor the shippers (who were brother carriers) by their acceptance thereof? It is only upon the construction that they were bound, and that an agreement with regard to the rates, specifying with precision the goods to be carried, was an agreement to transport the particular goods so specified at those rates, that common sense can be attributed to their acts. That the defendant understood the contract as thus interpreted is accentuated by what subsequently transpired. The defendant furnished a part of the goods. When the plaintiffs, in writing and verbally, requested it to furnish more, there was no suggestion of a defective contract, no intimation of the nonexistence of a binding obligation. On the contrary, the defendant\u2019s chief clerk testified that the only reason why the second lot was not given to the plaintiffs was that they were not sufficiently prompt in taking it when offered. He did not then claim that the defendant was not bound to give the plaintiffs the whole lot. All that he claimed was that the second lot had been offered to them in the regular course of business,\u2014naturally under the contract,\u2014and that they had not sent a boat for it in due time. This chief clerk also testified that he made no arrangement with other parties to transport this second lot until after the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to send the boat for it, thus contradicting the statement made by Mr. Walker in a letter which he wrote to the plaintiffs on September 15, 1891 (when, owing to the plaintiffs\u2019 firm insistence upon what they characterized as a well-understood arrangement, the issue had to be met), to the effect that the defendant had secured better terms from the plaintiffs\u2019 competitors as far back as the 4th of August. This letter of Mr. Walker\u2019s was evidently written to present the defendant\u2019s side of the case in as favorable an aspect as possible, and it is significant that its statements should be controverted by his own employ\u00e9. It is equally significant that in this letter Mr. Walker could only account for the delivery to the plaintiffs of the first lot, notwithstanding that, upon his own showing, these goods should, in the regular course of business, have gone to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the competitors from whom he said the defendant had received better terms, by the suggestion that they were delivered to the plaintiffs \u201cin error.\u201d We think it clear that the defendant understood the contract precisely as the plaintiffs did, but, having decided to break its bargain, and to deal with others, it sought to avoid its terms by the shallow pretense of an original misunderstanding. The case is clearly within the principle stated by Grover, J., in Railway Co. v. Dane, supra, that, if the plaintiff there had accepted the defendant\u2019s proposition for the transportation of any specified quantity of goods, a contract mutually obligatory would have resulted therefrom, for the breach of which by either party the other could have maintained an action for the recovery of the damages thereby sustained. That is this case. The contract here was mutually obligatory. The plaintiffs could not, after their letter and the defendant\u2019s reply, advance the rates for the transportation of the particular 8,500 barrels of rosin specified therein. They were thereafter bound to take the goods, and transport them at the confirmed and accepted rates. The defendant had the corresponding obligation to furnish the particular goods for transportation at these rates. The contract was not unilateral. It was mutually obligatory, and either party would have been liable for its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">As to the damages, the jury awarded a less sum than the evidence warranted. We think the damages were fairly proved, and that no error was committed on that head. No other question is presented calling for special consideration. We find no error in the record, and the judgment and order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
