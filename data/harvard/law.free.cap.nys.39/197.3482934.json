This would be but one cause of action, however numerous the various items for which plaintiffs need ask that the directors be held responsible to the corporation. This is enforcing a right of the corporation, and the plaintiff asks the court to enforce this right because the corporation itself is under the control and management of the directors who are alleged to be in default, and whose wrongful acts have caused the injury to the corporation. This is a cause of action which vests in the corporation, not in the plaintiff; and the plaintiff has a right simply to ask a court of equity to exercise its power to compel these directors and trustees, and others who have succeeded to the property which really belongs to the corporation, to restore to the corporation what has been improperly taken from it. Mixed up with this cause of action, however, are certain allegations in the complaint upon which plaintiff asks a personal judgment in favor of himself against the Warren-Scharf Asphalt Paving Company for $50,000 damages. It is quite clear that this is a perfectly distinct cause of action from one which seeks to enforce a right vested in the corporation against the other defendants; and it would seem that such two causes of action are improperly united in this complaint, and that the defendants have a right to have them separately stated, \u2014one being a cause of action which he is enforcing of his own right, and the other a cause of action which he is enforcing in the right of the company,\u2014and the judgment in each case would be that the other defendants restore to the company the property, or the value thereof, of which they have deprived the corporation. We think, therefore, that there are two causes of action set forth in the complaint, and that upon the plaintiff\u2019s appeal the order should be modified so as to require the plaintiff to separately state and number such two causes of action. As this complaint, in consequence of this order, will have to be amended, it does not seem necessary for us to pass upon the appeal by the defendants from the order which refuses to strike out certain allegations of the complaint as irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>vont, immaterial, or redundant and scandalous, as these allegations may not appear in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The order should be modified as suggested, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
