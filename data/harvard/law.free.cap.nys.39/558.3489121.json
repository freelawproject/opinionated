Ziehen v. Smith, 148 N. Y. 558, 42 N. E. 1080. This case disapproves of the rule laid down in Morange v. Morris, *42 N. Y. 48, and in Ingalls v. Hahn, 47 Hun, 104, and affirms the more reasonable doctrine that the contract is not broken by the mere fact of the existence on the day of performance oi some lien or incumbrance which it is in the power of the vendor to remove. In the case at bar there was, upon the day specified in the contract for the closing of the title, no lien or incumbrance upon the property (other than the first mortgage) which the vendor could not have removed. Upon that day he had a satisfaction piece of the second mortgage, and he gave his attorney money with which to pay all taxes and Croton water rents. He had agreed that the first mortgage held by the New York Life Insurance Company should be 5 per cent., not at 6 per cent., as stipulated upon the face of the mortgage. But the fact was that upon his original application for the loan the company\u2019s finance committee had indorsed a memorandum to the effect that the interest should be 6 per cent, until the completion of the building, and 5 per cent, afterwards. The buildings had been completed for upwards of two years prior to the transaction under consideration, and the company during that time had been accepting 5 per cent, from the defendant, thus executing the agreement indorsed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>upon the original application. Clark, the clerk of the company who had charge of the applications for loans on real estate, testified .that on the 14th day of October, 1890, the company\u2019s appraiser certified that the buildings were then finished, and that from that date the interest was 5 per cent. This witness also testified that the reduction in this manner was in accordance with the company\u2019s custom. \u201cMr. Prague,\u201d said he, \"was building houses, and he wanted a loan. We would tell Mm, if we made from time to time payments, we should charge six per cent, until the completion of the buildings, and five per cent, thereafter. The last payment,\u2014when he comes to the last amount,\u2014we send our appraiser there, and he certifies that the houses are fimshed, and when we make the last payment we reduce the rate of interest. I did that myself, personally, in my order for the last payment.\u201d The plaintiff was, of course, entitled to conclusive \u25a0evidence of this reduction. He was not bound to accept the defendant\u2019s assurance that it had been done. The mortgage at 6 per cent, was all that appeared upon record. But if he had demanded a proper instrument, legally affecting such reduction, there can be no doubt that the defendant could have furnished it. As Judge O\u2019Brien said in Ziehen v. Smith, supra, \u201cIt cannot be affirmed, under the circumstances, that the plMntiff would not have received the title wMeh the defendant had contracted to convey.\u201d A few days later the company actually gave the defendant a certificate, to be furnished to the plaintiff, to the effect that the then present rate of interest was 5 per cent. That certificate, or any other binding covenant, could have been obtained from the company upon the day fixed for the closing of the title just as readily as it was obtained five days later. Clark testified without contradiction that the only reason why such .an instrument had not previously been given was that the defend.ant had not asked for it; that he could have had it for the asking; that, as \u201cthe true amount was only five per cent., we could not help .giving him that certificate.\u201d It is apparent, therefore, that the mere fact of the nonexistence upon the day of performance of an instrument evidencing such reduction did not of itself work a breach of the contract. Uor can it be affirmed that it was not then in the vendor\u2019s power to procure such an instrument. On the contrary, it may safely be affirmed that such an instrument could readily have been procured by him, 'and .delivered to the plMntiff upon the day fixed for performance. It will be observed\u2014and the fact should be emphasized\u2014that this is not an action by the vendor agMnst the vendee for a breach of the contract by the latter. Undoubtedly the vendor could only maintain such an action upon showing actual, and not possible, readiness upon his part in all particulars. But that is not this action. Here the vendee sues the vendor for the latter\u2019s breach of the contract, and the burden is upon the vendee to show that he demanded performance at a time when the vendor was bound to comply, and under circumstances which indicate that the vendor was unable to perform. What are the facts on this head? The contract provided that the deed should be delivered \u201con the 23rd day of February, 1893, at 11 o\u2019clock a. m., at the office of Adams &amp; Comstock, 36 Wall street, N. Y. City.\u201d Upon the day and at the hour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>specified the plaintiff and his counsel, Devlin, appeared at Mr. Com-stock\u2019s office, apparently ready to close the title. Mr. Comstock was present, but the defendant was not. The defendant misunderstood the hour, and did not arrive until about 20 minutes to 12. While thus waiting for the defendant, the plaintiff tendered the purchase money to Comstock, and demanded a deed. Comstock could not comply in the absence of the defendant. Thereupon the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked Comstock to adjourn the matter, but Comstock declined, stating that he expected the defendant every minute. It is true that Devlin testifies that the request for the adjournment preceded the tender. But he is not corroborated in this statement by either his client or by Comstock (who denies the tender in toto), while his own managing clerk, Zwinge, distinctly testifies that the request for an adjournment followed the tender and demand. After Com-stock denied the request for an adjournment, and at 25 minutes to 12, the plaintiff and his counsel left Comstock\u2019s office. As they .were leaving, Comstock said: \u201cHow long will you be at your office? I will be up there just as soon as Mr. Prague comes in, and I will have all the papers. I will have the deed executed, and all the papers ready, and close this up; and I am sure Mr. Prague.means to be here in a few minutes.\u201d To this Devlin answered, \u201cI will be there for a little while.\u201d Comstock then inquired, \u201cWill you be there until half past twelve?\u201d Devlin replied, \u201cYes; he would.\u201d And thereupon he and his client left. The plaintiff heard all this, and made no objection. Comstock\u2019s testimony, as quoted, is not really denied. Devlin was asked the following question, and gave the following answer: \u201cQ. When you left Mr. Comstock\u2019s office, did you not tell him you would remain in your office until half past twelve? A. That I have no distinct recollection of. Mr. Comstock swore to that. I don\u2019t contradict it.\u201d Zwinge testified that he did not recollect Devlin\u2019s making the remark \u201cthat he would wait at his office until half past twelve for Mr. Prague. He said he would wait a little while.\" Campbell was asked whether he heard Devlin say that he would wait at his office until half past 12 for Mr. Prague to come in, and he answered: \u201cI can\u2019t say the hour, sir, exactly. Q. He said he would wait, didn\u2019t he? A. I think he did.\u201d It is clear that Comstock\u2019s version of the matter was accurate, and was substantially undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In this state of the evidence, two questions were presented: First. Whether the plaintiff remained a reasonable time at Com-stock\u2019s office, and whether his tender and demand there were not, under all the circumstances, premature and precipitate. Second. Whether, notwithstanding such tender and demand, it was not the intention of the parties to leave the matter open, at least until half past 12 of the same day. Upon the first question the defendant\u2019s counsel requested a submission to the jury. This was refused, and the defendant excepted. It is apparent that the learned judge refused the request solely upon the ground that, even at half past 12 of the same day, the liens for taxes were not cleared off, nor was written evidence at hand of the interest reduction from the first mortgage. He relied upon and followed Morange v. Morris, su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>pra. This is apparent from the prior language of the learned judge. In response to the argument of counsel, he observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-3\">\u201cAs to the payment of taxes and water rents, the court quotes from the opinion of the court in Morange v. Morris, *42 N. Y. 51, which says, as to incumbrances, \u2018It was the duty of the defendant to have caused them to be discharged before the time arrived at which he had stipulated to convey,\u2019 eiud with approbation in Hartley v. James, 50 N. Y. 38, and I have not seen it overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">We think it may safely be assumed that if Ziehen v. Smith, supra, had then been decided, and had been before the learned judge, he would not have refused to submit the question of reasonable time to the jury merely because certain things remained to be done at half past 12, which things were entirely within the defendant\u2019s power to do.. Whether 35 minutes were, under the circumstances, a reasonable time for the plaintiff to wait, was, in our judgment, a fair question for the jury. Zwinge testified that, in some instances within his experience, it took as much as an hour to close an ordinary title, where there were several taxes and mortgages to be paid off, and new loans made on an exchange of property. The following questions were put to this witness, and the following answers given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201cQ. Under those circumstances, where it is necessary to take a little time, lawyers are generally patient with each other until the parties can arrive on the scene? A. They are. Q. They do not hold closely to the minute, in the closing of a title, where both parties are ready and willing to close the title? A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Mr. Comstock testified that he told the plaintiff and Devlin that the deed was prepared, but that, for some reason he did not know, Mr. Prague had not arrived yet; that he expected him to come; and that he would undoubtedly be there within a few minutes. Devlin testified that Comstock said Prague should have been there, and he could not account for his absence. That time was not essential to the plaintiff is clearly evidenced by Ms request for an adjournment. Devlin said, \u201cI requested an adjournment for a day or so, until the difficulties might be arranged.\u201d Zwinge said, as we have seen, that this request for an adjournment followed a tender. Upon these facts, we do not think it can be said, as matter of law, that there was a breach of this contract at the expiration of the 35 minutes. If the plaintiff and his counsel had exercised the customary patience, and had waited 5 minutes more, they would have seen the defendant, and the whole matter could have been readily closed. The defendant could have given the plaintiff that day everything which he had contracted to give him. It cannot be affirmed that he could not have done this within a reasonable time after his appearance at Comstock\u2019s office. The latter\u2019s office was but a short distance from the office of the Hew York Life Insurance Company. The register\u2019s office was but five minutes\u2019 walk from there, and, according to Comstock\u2019s undisputed testimony, \u201cthe whole thing could have been done in a couple of minutes.\u201d We think, therefore, that this question should, at least, have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>As to the second question, the decision of the learned judge was also erroneous. No other conclusion can correctly be drawn from the undisputed facts to which we have adverted, save that compliance with the previous demand for performance\u2014assuming such demand to have been made\u2014was waived. With such waiver, a further demand of performance became necessary to establish the breach upon which alone the plaintiff could maintain his action. The evidence was overwhelming\u2014indeed, substantially all one way \u2014in support of the defendant\u2019s claim that the entire matter was left open until half past 12, and that the plaintiff left Comstock\u2019s office with the distinct understanding that the contract was not then ended; that if the defendant arrived within a short time the transaction could be renewed in Devlin\u2019s office; and that he and his counsel would remain there (the closing acts meanwhile being in abeyance) until half past 12. The plaintiff\u2019s subsequent course in absenting himself from Devlin\u2019s office prior to the time indicated, and then leaving Devlin without power, is suggestive of bad faith, and of a desire to take advantage of trivial and unsubstantial objections to what was in reality a satisfactory title. We think the plaintiff was bound to make a further tender of performance after he left Comstock\u2019s office, as a condition precedent to an action for a breach of the contract; and, upon both the grounds discussed, there should be a new trial. The direction was erroneous, in itself, and the refusal to submit the specific question of fact was also erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The plaintiff claims that the defendant\u2019s request to go to the jury was too late; that, both parties having asked the court to direct a verdict in their favor, they waived the right of submission. This contention is without merit. The defendant undoubtedly waived the right to have the case sent to the jury generally (Mayer v. Dean, 115 N. Y. 559, 22 N. E. 261), but not the right to have a specific question of fact submitted to them (Koehler v. Adler, 78 N. Y. 290). The defendant here formulated a specific question of fact, which he requested the trial judge to submit to the jury. The presumption of the defendant\u2019s consent to the decision by the court of the question thus formulated was, as was said in Koehler v. Adler, supra, \u201crepelled by an express request to go to the jury upon\u201d that question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The judgment and order denying the motion for a new trial should be reversed, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b587-7\">INGRAHAM, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AStQ\">I concur in the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Justice BARRETT, as I think, upon the evidence, there was at least a question for the jury to determine,\u2014whether or not the closing of the title had been adjourned until half past 12 of the day fixed therefor at the office of the attorney for the plaintiff, and whether, at such adjournment hour, the defendant appeared, ready to complete his contract. It is true that the plaintiff did, at the time and place mentioned in the contract for the completion thereof, make what I consider to be a sufficient tender, but, if subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>quent to that there was an adjournment to a future time and place, such adjournment would be a waiver of the tender already made; and then, under the rule stated in Ziehen v. Smith, 148 N. Y. 558, 42 N. E. 1080, before either party would be in default a new tender would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">As to the objections to the plaintiff\u2019s title, they are evidently of a character which could be readily obviated. And so far as the interest of the mortgage with the insurance company being at 6 per cent., instead of <em>5- </em>per cent., the mortgage had but a few days to run. It had been executed under an agreement by which the interest was to be reduced when the houses were completed. That agreement had been executed by a verbal understanding, and the receipt of 5 per cent, for two years; and the evidence is that the company were quite willing to give a formal agreement, and did subsequently give s\u00fach an agreement. The mortgage, however, had but a few days to run, and the difference in the interest would .be quite small, and not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
