Y. Supp. 304), and it is therefore unnecessary to restate them. The judgment here is assailed for errors claimed to have been made in rulings upon evidence and in the charge of the judge. Upon the part of the plaintiff the disputed questions as to whether the employment was by the week or year, and as to whether his contract was assumed by the defendant, were sought to be supported by declarations of Bliss, with whom the contract was originally made, and who subsequently entered into partnership with the defendant. The important issue was as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s was a weekly or a yearly hiring. To support his contention he was permitted,' over objection, to introduce the evidence of other employ\u00e9s that they were employed by the year. In addition, the court was asked to charge the jury \u201cthat the fact that the plaintiff remained in the employment of Charles E. Bliss &amp; Co. after June 1, 1892, at the same wages, raises no presumption that the firm had employed him to May 1, 1893,\u201d which request was refused. As these two rulings were likewise erroneous, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
