In the case at bar the plaintiff had clearly waived the same, as the order provided that the amended complaint was-granted without prejudice to any of the proceedings already had, or to the position of the cause on the day calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">Objection is also made to the service of the unverified answer to-the amended complaint. This, we think, is explained by the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney that the copy amended complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>served on Mm did not contain any verification, and that he did not know, and was not informed, that there was such verification attached to the original amended complaint. A paper served as a copy is assumed to be correct. It is true that the defendant\u2019s attorney admitted due and timely service of a copy of the amended complaint, which was verified; yet, in the absence of knowledge on his part of such facts (as sworn to by him), he had a right to, and did, make an offer, which was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">\u201cSir: As I have already notified you, the copy amended complaint which I received yesterday had no copy of any verification annexed or attached thereto. I therefore believed that the original amended complaint was not verified, and I served an unverified answer thereto, which has been returned to me, and which I herewith return to you, for the reason that same was originally served upon you on the 14th inst., and your return to me thereof was unauthorized. As I am informed that it is claimed that the original amended complaint was verified, I send you a copy thereof which was received by me, so that you may, if you desire, attach a copy of the verification thereto. If you do this, the bearer will serve upon you a verified answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-7\">\u201cDated New York, January 15,1896. Yours, etc.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-8\">\u201cDaniel Daly, Deft\u2019s Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-9\">\u201cTo Abraham Levy, Esq., Plaintiff\u2019s Attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">The plaintiff did not accept tMs offer, and must, in view of all the circumstances, bear the consequences. The order opening the default was correct and fair and reasonable, and, being within the sound discretion of the court, must be sustained, with leave to comply with said terms by the appellant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
