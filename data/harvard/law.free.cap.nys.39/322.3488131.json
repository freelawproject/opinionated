One Frank, who had some interest in the goods, thereafter received a letter from a Hamburg concern, naming these defendants as receivers of the goods, although it may be noted that the alleged translation of the letter in evidence merely refers to the property as \u201clost in New York.\u201d Frank, however, was not misled, and called upon the defendants with Hirschmann\u2019s bill of lading, and, making tender of the sum stated in that instrument to be due, demanded the goods, which demand was refused, the defendants claiming a lien for freight charges paid by them to the amount of $55.05. Hirschmann then assigned his claim to this plaintiff, who has brought this action for delivery of the goods, or their value, to which the defendants counterclaimed their charges, above noted, and judgment proceeded in their favor for the amount claimed. While there may well be doubt that any claim for freight charges was available to the defendants over and above the amount expressed in the bill of lading (Woodruff v. Havemeyer, 106 N. Y. 129,134, 12 N. E. 628), or that their counterclaim, founded upon an implied contract, could be entertained in this action for the goods as connected with the subject of the action or arising out of the transaction in suit (Romaine v. Brewster, 10 Misc. Rep. 120, 30 N. Y. Supp. 948), it is not essential that these points be decided, since, in any event, the judgment must be reversed for the very obvious error committed by the justice below in allowing a recovery by the defendants against the plaintiff personally for a debt due, if at all, from his assignor of the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>action. Montanye v. Montgomery (Com. Pl.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 655. As a defense alone, this claim might possibly have prevailed, but an affirmative judgment against the plaintiff, based upon it, was quite without warrant in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
