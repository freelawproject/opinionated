The procedure here was a proper one. McAdarn, J., Valiente v. Bryan, 66 How. Prac. 302. The plaintiffs on their own behalf seek to recover on the first cause of action, and on the second cause of action as assignees of Vogel &amp; Co., on the ground that the merchandise in each instance was consigned to the defendant; that demand for the return thereof, or the amount realized therefrom, was made in each instance, and was refused, and in consequence thereof the defendant has converted said merchandise, to their damage. The defendant, in effect, denies each and every allegation. At the trial it was admitted that the defendant and plaintiffs, as well as Vogel &amp; Co., who had assigned their claim to plaintiffs, had many previous transactions; but the defendant contended throughout the trial that all his transactions with them were for goods actually purchased by him, and sold to him by the plaintiffs and Vogel &amp; Co.; that at no time were any goods consigned to him, nor did he make.any request for the same. Borne exhibits were offered in evidence and marked, and others were only marked for identification. Among those papers on behalf of the plaintiffs was one known as \u201cExhibit A,\u201d and which had been admitted against defendant\u2019s objection, under the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-5\">\u201cQ. Did you at that time, when these goods were so given to him, make any memorandum or entry in your books\u2014the original entry\u2014as to the terms upon which these goods were delivered? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objects. Admitted. Defendant\u2019s counsel excepts.) A. Yes, sir. Q. Is this a list of the goods that are spoken of in your testimony? (Paper shown witness. Defendant\u2019s counsel objects.) A. Yes, sir. (List referred to offered in evidence. Defendant\u2019s counsel objects as immaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent.) Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I offer it merely as a matter of convenience. (Admitted. Defendant\u2019s Counsel excepts. Marked \u2018Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 1.\u2019)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The book of original entry was not offered in evidence, nor was this exhibit said to be a true copy thereof, but only a list of the property testified to; and yet on its face, without explanation, it bore more than a mere list, and assumed to give the terms of the alleged contract between the parties, with the amount consigned, and the credits of goods returned, and the balance remaining. On its face it presents the conclusions of some one, or the maker thereof, of the standing of the defendant, since it gives the date and items of delivery of the goods as June 8. 18.92, and the credits as for the goods returned, July 2, 1892. It was not a paper received by the defendant so as to bind him by the words, \u201cTerms on memorandum,\u201d and therefore was certainly improperly received and admitted in evidence. But, irrespective of the propriety of its admission in evidence, it was there with all its force and effect, and being the original evidence of the contract, as alleged by the plaintiffs. Another exhibit which was only marked for identification was \u201cExhibit C.\u201d That was identical with \u201cExhibit A\u201d in evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>except as to the date and items, and containing these words: \u201cTerms net cash.\u201d Exhibit E was in evidence, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit E.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Elliott &amp; Cougle, No. 52 Elizabeth St.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">New York January 6, 1892.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Charge to -.

It is admitted that Exhibit O (for identification) was, with the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>two in evidence, handed by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to the court officer who had charge of the jury, on their leaving the court room for deliberation, and was taken by them into their room. It is also the fact that on their return from their deliberations, and after arriving at a verdict, they returned to the court the three exhibits already spoken of, and among these was Exhibit C (for identification), at the same time announcing their verdict. The defendant, immediately upon this discovery, made his motion to discharge the jury. The trial justice, however, received the verdict, against the objection of the defendant. Immediately thereafter the defendant again renewed his motion, and the trial justice took the motion under advisement. Having received the verdict against the objection of the defendant, the trial justice lost jurisdiction, -and the only way the defendant could then have the motion considered was to apply at special term,\u2014Moore v. Railroad Co. (Com. Pl.) 8 N. Y. Supp. 329,\u2014which he did, and the same was considered by the same judge sitting at special term. This motion was denied on the grounds, particularly, that the taking of the paper aforesaid did no harm to the defendant. This is the question first to be determined. From a careful examination of the testimony, it is clear that the jury must have considered this paper, Exhibit C, because, before retiring, one of the jurors asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">\u201cWhat relation have the bills in evidence to the case? The Court: You have a right to take them into consideration. The bills are not eouclusive. They are simply evidence of the transaction had between the parties. Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: In no event are these bills to be regarded bills of sale. The Court: They are not bills of sale; undoubtedly not. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I except to that, and ask your honor to charge that the bills themselves show they are bills of sale. A paper which says \u2018Sold to,\u2019 or \u2018Bought of,\u2019 constitutes a bill of sale, in law. The Court: I decline to charge that they are bills of sale, in law. (Defendant excepts.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Again, after the jury had retired, a written communication was sent by them to the trial justice, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-8\">\u201cWere not the plaintiffs obliged to mark the words \u2018on memorandum,\u2019 or \u2018on consignment,\u2019 on the bills rendered, so as to make the same really a \u2018consigned account\u2019 ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">To which the court answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">The jury had before them then a paper marked, \u201cTerms on memorandum\u201d; another marked, \u201cTerms net cash\u201d; and a third paper marked, \u201cCharge to -. Terms 25 per cent. On back what to come back if not sold.\u201d The defendant had absolutely denied that any goods were consigned to him at any time, and that the words on Exhibit E, \u201cWhat to come back if not sold,\u201d were not written in Ms presence, nor with his consent or knowledge, and that the entire bill was a purchase and sale. The jury were no doubt considering the defendant\u2019s oral testimony, and the variety and difference of the written testimony, in regard to the terms, and when comparing the words, \u201cTerms 25 per cent.,\u201d on Exhibit E, and which was claimed by the plaintiffs to be evidence of a former consignment of goods, with the words, \u201cTerms net cash,\u201d contained in Exhibit C (for identification), which was conceded to be an absolute sale; and, being in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>doubt, they were led, in order that they might determine from all the evidence in the case as to whether these transactions at issue were a sale or consignment, to inquire why Exhibit E, if it was a consignment, did not contain the words, \u201con memorandum,\u201d or \u201con consignment,\u201d on the bills rendered, so as to make same really a consignment account. The court answered \u201cNo,\u201d and this ended the discussion. The paper was then before them in the jury room, seen by some, and perhaps by all, of them; and the presumption must be, in the absence of more convincing proof to the contrary than that presented, that it was read, wholly or in part, and referred to, by some one of those who saw it. It was competent for the plaintiffs to offer the affidavits of the jury to sustain the verdict by showing that the paper was not read. This the plaintiffs omitted to do. I am convinced, from a careful examination of the evidence, and the taking of this paper by the jury into their room, that it was examined, considered, and had an important influence on their verdict. See Mitchell v. Carter, 14 Hun, 448; Dolan v. Insurance Co., 22 Hun, 404; O'Brien v. Insurance Co., 38 N. Y. Super. Ct. 482. I am satisfied that this paper was not intentionally given to the jury by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, and was given only in the manner stated by him. It was still a serious mistake, and an improper communication to the jury, and one for which the verdict should be set aside. \u2019 The tendency is to look with distrust upon all irregularities and communications writh jurors, either at the trial, or after they have withdrawn to their room to consider the verdict. The verdict, for these reasons alone, should be set aside, and a new trial granted, with costs to the defendant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The defendant has taken many exceptions during the trial, and we now proceed to examine a few of them:</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The admission of Exhibit A, after it was once rejected by the court as a list of the articles, was error, since it was not to refresh the witness\u2019 recollection, and not made by him, and purported to state the manner and terms of the contract alleged by the plaintiffs, without any proof of its origin, or being signed or sanctioned by the defendant. Bank v. Madden, 114 N. Y. 280, 21 N. E. 408; Rosenstock v. Heggarty (City Ct. Brook.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 228; Joslyn v. Pulver, 59 Hun, 136, 13 N. Y. Supp. 311; Donlon v. English, 89 Hun, 69, 35 N. Y. Supp. 82. Again, the following rulings and questions appear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-7\">\u201cQ. Did you on that occasion state to Mr. Elliott that you wanted any goods on consignment? (Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objects. Objection sustained. Exception.) Q. Was there anything said by you to Mr. Elliott, that you wanted goods on consignment? (Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objects. Objection sustained. Exception.) Q. Did he say anything to you, that he wanted to let you have goods on consignment? (Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objects. Objection sustained. Defendant excepts.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">The only issue was whether the defendant had purchased the goods, or received them on consignment, and the plaintiffs had related conversations claimed to have been had with the defendant, in which the subject of consignment was spoken of. It was therefore proper and pertinent for the defendant\u2019s counsel to ask whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>he (the defendant) had any such conversation, or whether the plaintiffs had ever spoken to him about the same. We think this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Again, when the judge had finished his charge to the jury a juror asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">\u201cWhat relation have the bills in evidence to the case?\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The court answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-8\">\u201cTon have a right to take them in consideration. The bills are not conclusive. They are simply evidence of the transaction had between the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">This was correct, and, had the judge stopped there, would have been all right, but the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-10\">\u201cIn no event are these bills to be regarded bills of sale. The Court: They are not bills of sale; undoubtedly not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">To which the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">It was conceded that the numerous items on each of the bills had been delivered and accepted; except the ones alleged to have been consigned, were purchased by the defendant, and sold to him. The rule is that such papers, containing the words \u201cbought of,\u201d or \u201csold to,\u201d unexplained, and unaccompanied by delivery and acceptance, become such a contract, or the written evidence of the contract of sale, within the intention of the parties, and entitled to such effect. Bonesteel v. Flack, 41 Barb. 435; Coe v. Tough, 116 N. Y. 273, 278, 22 N. E. 550. The defendant\u2019s request to charge, immediately following this, was too broad, and not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">After the jury retired the following communication in writing was sent to the court :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-14\">\u201cWere not the plaintiffs obliged to mark the words \u2018on memorandum,\u2019 or \u2018on consignment,\u2019 on the bills rendered, so as to make the same really a \u2018consigned account\u2019?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">To which the court answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-16\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: In connection with the question asked by the jury, and the answer by the court thereto, we request the court to charge that the words \u2018on memorandum,\u2019 or \u2018on consignment,\u2019 not being written on the two bills, is a circumstance which the jury may take into consideration in determining the question whether the transactions in question were sales, or were merely consignments. The Court: I decline so to charge. (Defendant\u2019s counsel excepts.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">This request should have been allowed, since the trial justice had already charged that they had a right to take the bills into consideration, and that they were not conclusive; having before them a bill (Exhibit A) marked \u201cTerms on memorandum,\u201d which contained the items of goods claimed by Yogel &amp; Co., and another bill which represented the portion,claimed by the plaintiffs, and which occurred in January, 1892, and which the plaintiffs say was a consignment, but which only contained the words \u201cTerms net.\u201d The jury, having the whole evidence before them, had a right to consider these omissions, in determining the question whether the transactions before them were sales, or merely consignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">For this, and the errors already pointed out, the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
