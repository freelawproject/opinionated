The only allegation in the complaints alleging negligence on the part of the defendant is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-18\">\u201cThat the explosion of the said fly wheel was due to the carelessness and negligence, and the want of proper care and skill, on the part of the de-' fendant or its agents, servants or employ\u00e9s.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-19\">The complaints in these cases differ from that in Piehl v. Same Defendant, 39 N. Y. Supp. 1131, where we held that a bill of particulars was not required. They do not allege how the defendant was negligent, or state any facts in that regard. The plaintiffs, upon the trial, may, in addition to showing the fact of the explosion, offer evidence to prove that the fly wheel was defective before the accident, to the knowledge of the defendant; that the defendant failed to have proper and skillful employ\u00e9s to manage the wheel; that it was not properly run, inspected, or placed; that the defendant did not have a sufficient number of servants to manage it; that, at the time of the accident, the wheel was being operated in an improper manner; or other acts or omissions of the defendant. As the pleading now stands, it is obvious that the defendant will be unable, in advance, to properly prepare to meet evidence that the plaintiff may offer, on the trial, to show negligence on the part of the defendant, in addition to the fact of the explosion of the wheel. Hence, without considering the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>whether or not the mere fact that the wheel burst places upon the-defendant the burden of showing that the accident did not happen through its negligence, we think a bill of particulars should be served, stating what facts, if any, the plaintiff expects to show upon the trial, besides the fact of the explosion, indicating negligence on the part of the defendant. In Dwight v. Insurance Co.,. 84 N. Y. 493, it was held that a bill of particulars may be ordered in all descriptions of actions. In a proper case such a bill should be furnished in an action to recover damages for the alleged negligence of the defendant. O\u2019Hara v. Ehrich (Super. N. Y.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 52; Baker v. Sutton, 86 Hun, 588, 33 N. Y. Supp. 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">The order should be reversed, and njotion granted requiring the-plaintiffs to furnish the defendant with a statement containing the particulars upon which the claim of negligence and want of proper care and skill on the part of defendant, or its servants, agents, or employ\u00e9s, is based, without costs in this court or the-court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
