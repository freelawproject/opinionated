He does not deny that he had notice of that order, and knew of its contents. Subsequent to the granting of the order, he left the state, and consequently the order was not served upon him. He has failed to comply with the order in any respect, or to pay anything to the plaintiff on account of the alimony and counsel fees directed by that order to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">We think the court below had power to strike out the answer. Quigley v. Quigley, 45 Hun, 24; Walker v. Walker, 82 N. Y. 261; Brisbane v. Brisbane, 5 Civ. Proc. R. 352. The fact that, in consequence of the defendant\u2019s refusal to comply with the order of the- court, sequestration proceedings were instituted and a receiver appointed, simply emphasizes the defendant\u2019s contempt; and that those proceedings have been ineffectual is no reason any other proceedings should not be taken against the defendant to compel him to comply with the order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">The court below had no authority to strike out the appearance of the defendant. The defendant had a right to appear in the action, so as to have notice of the subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">The order should therefore be modified so as to provide that the answer interposed by the defendant be stricken out, and that the action proceed as if such answer had not been interposed, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
