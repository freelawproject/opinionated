He was a passenger on one of the defendant\u2019s electric cars running from Albany to Troy. The defendant\u2019s road has two tracks; the cars for Troy running on the easterly, and th\u00f3se for Albany on the westerly, track. At Ward\u2019s Lane, about half a mile from the city of Albany, the car stopped, to permit the plaintiff and his companion, Hughes, to alight. The plaintiff alighted from the easterly side of the car, preceded by Hughes, and, as soon as he reached the ground, the car in which he had been riding started, and rapidly proceeded on its way northerly. To reach his residence, it was necessary to cross both tracks, with the location of which and with the running of the cars he was familiar. After he had crossed the easterly track, he came to a space of five feet between that and the westerly track. One of the defendant\u2019s cars coming down from Troy on the westerly track was then approaching. It was about 10 o\u2019clock at night, and dark. This down car was lighted with electric light, had a large headlight, and, Hughes says, \u201cwas one glare of light.\u201d While the evidence furnished very strong grounds for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>belief that this car could have been seen before the plaintiff had crossed the easterly track, it is beyond question that, from his position between the two tracks, it was plainly visible. It is inconceivable that the trolley post, eight inches in diameter, midway between the two tracks, five feet apart, could have obstructed his vision. Instead of remaining between the tracks, or stepping back upon the easterly track, until the approaching car had passed, the plaintiff proceeded to cross the westerly track, and, when nearly over, was struck by the car; his companion, who was just ahead, having reached the other side in safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The law is too well settled to require the citation of any authorities that it is the duty of a person, before crossing a traveled railway, to look for an approaching train; and a failure to do so, when the view is unobstructed, or crossing with knowledge of an approaching train, precludes a recovery for any injuries sustained. The plaintiff does not swear that he looked for the down car, and the conclusion is irresistible that he either did not look, or that he saw it, and miscalculated his chances of crossing in safety. The latter is very probable. Either is fatal to his recovery. There was a rule and custom of the defendant that, when a car is standing at a street crossing or station, an approaching car must not pass, but come to a full stop; but the plaintiff could not so rely upon this custom as to absolve him from the duty of vigilance. Assuming that there was on this occasion a violation of the rule, which may be gravely doubted, the plaintiff, by the exercise of that care which the law imposed upon him, would have discovered it in time to avert any injurious consequences to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In Dobert v. Railway Co. (recently decided by the general term, in this department) 36 N. Y. Supp. 105, the learned judge who wrote the prevailing opinion says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\u201cThe evidence discloses that the intestate, on passing around the rear end of this car, looked in the direction of the approaching car, * * * and which car, as would appear from the evidence, was hidden from the view of the intestate until the very moment of his fatal collision with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">He also says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">\u201cIt was upon a crowded thoroughfare;\u201d and \u201cit did not appear that he was familiar with the crossing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">In respect to those facts, there is between that case and this an obvious and essential distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
