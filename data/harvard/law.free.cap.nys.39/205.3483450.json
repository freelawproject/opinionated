(2) That at divers and sundry times prior to July 1, 1890, plaintiff, at the special instance and request of the defendant, personally, and through Dr. Outerbridge, his assistant, rendered certain services to her, as her physician, amounting to two hundred and eighty-seven dollars ($287), which services were reasonably worth the said sum of two hundred and eighty-seven dollars ($287), which defendant agreed to pay, and of which payment has been demanded repeatedly by plaintiff from defendant, but no part of which has been paid by the defendant to the plaintiff, excepting the sum of two hundred dollars ($200) paid by defendant, on account, on the 7th day of January, 1895, all .of which stands as account stated by bills rendered and agreed to. For a second and separate cause of action: (3) That between the 30th day of October, 1890, and the 27th day of March, 1891, plaintiff, at the special instance and request of defendant, personally, and through his assistant, Dr. Outer-bridge, rendered services, as a physician, to her son, to her daughter, and to herself, and incurred certain disbursements in connection therewith, for which the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff, and which services were reasonably worth the sum of five hundred and twenty-three dollars ($523), and the said disbursements amounted to the sum of twenty-nine dollars and fifty cents ($29.50); said services and disbursements being shown in detail in the bill of particulars hereto annexed, and hereby made a part of this complaint. (4)-No portion of said five hundred and fifty-two dollars and fifty cents ($552.50) has ever-been paid, although payment thereof has been repeatedly demanded by plaintiff, and refused by defendant. Wherefore, plaintiff demands judgment against the defendant in the sum of six hundred and thirty-nine dollars and fifty cents ($039.50), with interest on eighty-seven dollars, parcel thereof, from the 1st day of July, 1890, and on five hundred and fifty-two dollars and fifty cents ($552.50), balance thereof, from the 1st day of July, 1891, besides the costs and disbursements of this action.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b230-9\">Argued before BARRETT, R\u00dcMSEY, WILLIAMS, PATTERSON, and INGRAHAM, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-10\">E. C. Perkins, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-11\">F. H.

It is for professional services. Under the averments upon that head, the plaintiff will be required to prove every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>one of the numerous items of his special bill of particulars. After fully alleging the facts constituting his cause of action for these professional services, the plaintiff adds these unnecessary and irrelevant words: \u201cAll of which stands as account stated by bills rendered and agreed to.\u201d The defendant claims for these words the effect of a formal plea of an account stated. But there is here no allegation that an account was stated between the parties. The statement is that certain evidential incidents \u201cstand\u201d therefor. The words really amount to nothing more than the plaintiff\u2019s conclusion as to the effect of a part of his evidence. Having fully stated his real cause of action, he adds that he has rendered bills therefor, which were agreed to, and that thus this cause of action \u201cstands as account stated.\u201d This is pleading evidence, and a conclusion therefrom. But it is not a substantial plea of an account stated. Upon the merits the case is within the principle of Richards v. Stokes, 1 App. Div. 305, 37 N. Y. Supp. 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The items in the bills which constitute the two causes of action are upwards of 40. The defendant has put the items of services in issue (for the purposes of the trial), as well as the value. She admits that plaintiff rendered \u201ccertain\u201d services, and thus, it is true, admits the averment on that head as phrased in the complaint. But she does not admit the \u201cservices and disbursements\u201d which, as the complaint states, are shown in detail in the bill of particulars thereto annexed, and made a part thereof. On the contrary, she denies any knowledge, or information sufficient to form a belief, as to whether \u201cthe said services and disbursements are shown in detail\u201d in said bill of particulars. Thus we have not only a regular physician\u2019s account, and that a long one, properly itemizing each visit, but an account which covers services rendered separately to three persons by the plaintiff and his two assistants. The defendant contends that the items of service are undisputed, and that the issue relates solely to their value. But in this she is not borne out by the pleadings and the affidavits; nor did she offer a stipulation to admit all these items, and rest her defense solely upon their value.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Upon the case, as presented, the action is upon the plaintiff\u2019s account, and its examination is the immediate object of the action. It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for a reference granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
