Judgment was demanded that defendant account for money and property received by him; that plaintiff recover damages for breach of defendant\u2019s contract, and for such other relief as might be just and equitable.

All these acts are alleged as breaches of the agreement of retainer, and it is alleged that, by reason thereof, the defendant is indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $9,920. Judgment is demanded that the defendant in all things account to the plaintiff for the money and property received by him in his capacity as attorney and counsel, especially in the matters therein specifically set forth, that the plaintiff recover her damages for the breach of defendant\u2019s contract in the sum stated, and that plaintiff have such other or further relief as may be just and equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The defendant, in his answer, among other things, denies the receipt of any money in the settlement of the divorce action, or of any money or property in payment or settlement of the action of conversion; denies any fraud as to the real estate; and alleges that he has fully accounted for the rents. The statute of limitations is also set up, and a counterclaim for legal services.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The action was commenced September 6, 1893. When the case was moved for trial before the court and a jury, the defendant claimed that it was an equity action, not triable by jury. The point was overruled, and the plaintiff proceeded to give her evidence. She did not show that the defendant had ever received any money in settlement of the divorce action, or any money or property in settlement of the claim or judgment in conversion. As to the real estate, it appeared that, on December 13, 1880, it was deeded to the p1a.int.iff by her sister, Mrs. Van Horn, there being then on the property a mortgage for $1,600. On the 17th of July, 1883, the plaintiff gave another mortgage on the property for $1,000, which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>borrowed of Mrs. Sayles, the money being procured and delivered to the plaintiff by the defendant. In August, 1883, the plaintiff directed the rents to be paid to the defendant, and the defendant accordingly collected the rents from Augusf, 1883, to May 15, 1886, being the sum of $1,385, of which he paid to the plaintiff the sum of $665. The plaintiff testifies that she had a conversation with the defendant about what he was to do with the rent money. \u201cHe was to take care of the property, take the rent, and, if there was anything over what I had taken and interest on the mortgages, to let it run on the property, and I would go to work and try and pay off the mortgages.\u201d The last payment received by plaintiff from defendant was February 24,1886, and, as she testifies, she had no conversation with him after that till 1889,1890, or 1891. A deed of the property was put in evidence from the plaintiff to the defendant, dated February 8, 1884, and recorded August 13, 1887, for the consideration, as therein expressed, of $1,000; also, a deed from the defendant to Stark and Fish, dated February 14, 1887, and recorded August 13, 1887. The plaintiff testified that she never knowingly executed the deed to defendant, and that she first heard that defendant claimed to have it on September 27, 1887. There was evidence that the property, on February 8, 1884, was worth about $6,000. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, it was held by the court\u2014properly, we think\u2014that the plaintiff had not made out a case as to her claims for money or property received in settlement of the divorce and conversion cases. The court also held that, as to the balance of her claims, which had reference to the rents and the real estate, the only available remedy of the plaintiff was in equity, and that, as to those matters, the case should be treated as an equitable one, and so triable before the court without a jury. The jury was thereupon discharged, and the case finished before the court alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The claim for rents, if treated as an action at law, accrued more than six years before the commencement of the action, and the plea of the statute of limitations would apply. The plaintiff knew, in 1886, that the defendant had received the money. Wood v. Young, 141 N. Y. 211, 218, 36 N. E. 193. If the claim as to the deed be treated as an action for damages for the fraudulent procurement of a deed and the destruction of plaintiff\u2019s title, it would be an action for an injury to property (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3343, subd. 10), and so within subdivision 3 of section 382 (Miller v. Wood, 41 Hun, 600), and apparently barred by the lapse of time. No demand would be necessary. See Mills v. Mills, 115 N. Y. 80, 21 N. E. 714; Lammer v. Stoddard, 103 N. Y. 673, 9 N. E. 328. If .treated as an action to procure a judgment, other than for a sum of money, \u25a0on the ground of fraud, within subdivision 5 of section 382, it would be deemed an action in equity, and so triable by the court. See Carr v. Thompson, 87 N. Y. 160. In the complaint, by its terms, only one \u2022cause of action is stated, and equitable relief is sought, evidently upon the theory that that is essential to an adequate and full adjustment of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. Brigham v. Gott, 3 N. Y. Supp. 518. The plaintiff has not, we think, any ground for complaining of the manner of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>In the final disposition of the case by the special term it was held that the defendant was chargeable with the value of the plaintiff\u2019s-interest in the real estate at the time he conveyed it away. The-plaintiff, however, claims that the amount of such charge against the defendant was less than she was entitled to. There was evidence on the part of the defendant tending to show that the plaintiff' at the time was indebted to him in about the sum of $700 for legal services, over and above the balance in Ms hands of the rents. The-special term in effect found that the interest of the plaintiff in the-property, over and above the mortgages thereon, and in view of the-claim of Mrs. Van Horn to set aside the deed from her to plaintiff,, for wMch a suit was then pending, was not greater than the amount due defendant for legal services. The accounts between the parties-were upon that theory deemed to be balanced, \"and the defendant for subsequent legal services for plaintiff in the matter of an indictment was awarded the sum of $56, without costs. The suit of Mrs. Van Horn was commenced in April, 1884, and she apparently claimed that the deed to her sister (the plaintiff) was only as security for advances. The plaintiff had stated, in January, 1883, in a verified petition in the divorce case, that she had no interest in the property, and held it in trust for other parties. She had received, in the loan from Mrs. Sayles and in rents, more than she paid her sister for or on account of the property. The defendant claimed that the deed to-him was fully understood by the plaintiff, and was made to secure him for legal services, and to enable Mm to protect the mortgage to-Mrs. Sayles. The suit of Mrs. Van Horn not only put in jeopardy the security of defendant for his services but also the $1,000-mortgage. In the transfer by the defendant, he only obtained payment of the mortgages, both then being under his control. He-claims that he made the transfer with the assent of the plaintiff. The mortgages and the costs on the foreclosure of the first one-amounted to about $3,200. The property, after the title was cleared up by the purchaser from defendant, and the claim of Mrs. Van Horn provided for, was sold at private sale for $5,250.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The plaintiff, in effect, claims that the defendant was bound, at his-own expense, and at the risk of the $1,000 mortgage, to defend the suit of Mrs. Van Horn, and that, not having done so, he should be-charged with the full value of the property over and above the mortgages. From the facts of this case as presented by the evidence on the part of the defendant, which the court had a right to believe, it might well be doubted whether the claim of Mrs. Van Horn could have been defeated. No sufficient reason is apparent that would have required the defendant at all hazards to defend. The plaintiff cannot well complain that the court below, in ascertaining the value of her interest in the property, took into account the pending litigation with Mrs. Van Horn, and the consequent impairment of plaintiff\u2019s title. The amount of such impairment and the value of defendant\u2019s services were matters of fact, to be determined from the evidence. No sufficient reason is apparent for this court to interfere. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\"Judgment affirmed, wdth costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
