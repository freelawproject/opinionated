One Julius H. Eice was the former owner of both lots. The plaintiff claims under a deed from said Julius H. Rice to Charles Rice et al., dated May 10, 1860. In that conveyance lot 10 is described as situate on Main and Water streets, in said village, and as 72\u00bf feet wide and 150 feet deep. The lot is also described as bounded southerly by lot No. 12, now owned by the defendant, and as being called the \u201cBrick Store Lot.\u201d The plaintiff claimed that, although, in said deed, the lot is described as running 72-| feet along Main street, it was, in fact, 77-?,- feet in width, and embraced a strip of about 3 feet on the southerly line, of which the defendant took possession shortly before the commencement of the action. The trial judge directed a verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Some years prior to the aforesaid conveyance from Julius H. Rice to Charles Rice and others, there was a brick store on lot No. 10, and a fence at the place which, plaintiff contends, is the true line between his premises and those of the defendant. At the rear of the store, and within a foot of this fence, was a shed used in connection with the store. It was shown that the lot north of the fence was called the \u201cBrick Store Lot.\u201d That fence remained there about 24 years, and was then taken down, and a new one erected in its place, which, or a portion of which, remained until the defendant tore it down, shortly before the commencement of this action. There is evidence from which a jury might have found that the owners of lot No. 10 used and occupied, in connection with their store, up to this fence for a period of over 30 years. As the evidence, therefore, would have sustained a finding that the plaintiff and his grantors had occupied lot No. 10, up to the said fence, for a period of about 30 years, we are of the opinion that the case should have been submitted to the jury, who could have found a practical location of the line between the plaintiff and defendant, or a possession by the former and his grantors of the premises in dispute for such a period as entitled him to maintain the action. See Reed v. Farr, 35 N. Y. 113; Baldwin v. Brown, 16 N. Y. 359; Hill v. Edie (Sup.) 1 N. Y. Supp. 480. The distances named in the description of the deed do not necessarily control. Robinson v. Kime, 70 N. Y. 147. The premises conveyed by the above-mentioned deed being described as the \u201cBrick Store Lot,\u201d a finding could have been properly made that the grantor intended to convey the lot fenced, used, occupied, and known by that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Again, the witness Arnold made a survey of lots 10 and 12. In doing so he used the map of South Glens Falls, and made a survey in accordance therewith. No question seems to have been raised on the trial as to the authenticity or authority of this map. No objection was interposed that it was not the map mentioned in the deed from Julius H. Rice to Charles Rice and others. The evidence of Arnold was to the effect that the plaintiff\u2019s lot was 77| feet wide, and that of the defendant 64 feet, and that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>tiff, as the owner of lot No. 10, was entitled to the strip of land he seeks to recover in this action. If the evidence of this witness was to be relied upon, the deed under which the plaintiff claimed conveyed to his grantor the premises in question. The evidence above mentioned and other testimony in the case, we think, raised a question of fact, which should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
