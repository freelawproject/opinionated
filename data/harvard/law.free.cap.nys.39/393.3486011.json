The defendant denied in his answer that he made any fraudulent representations when the horse was sold. The issue thus formed presented the only question of fact involved in the action. The plaintiff testified that the defendant made many representations which were false and fraudulent, upon which the plaintiff relied when he made the purchase. The defendant testified that he made no such representations. The parties, by their testimony, contradicted each other on every material question, and each attempted to corroborate his evidence by other witnesses. The important question was, which should be believed?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">When the defendant was under cross-examination, he testified that he sometimes drove horses on race tracks. In reply to a question, he testified that he had never been charged with \u201ccrooked driving.\u201d He was then asked if he had recently been taken out of his sulky at Syracuse for \u201ccrooked driving.\u201d This question was objected to as incompetent and improper, and as not bearing on the question of credibility. The objections were overruled, and an exception taken. He answered, \u201cI was asked to get out.\u201d It has been held that charging a man- with \u201ccrooked practices\u201d on a race course is slanderous per se. Gideon v. Dwyer, 87 Hun, 246, 33 N. Y. Supp. 754. The purpose of the question was to affect the defendant\u2019s credibility, and the tendency of it and of the answer was to prejudice him before the jury. It is well settled in this state that it is not competent to ask a witness on his cross-examination, for the purpose of affecting his credibility, if he has been charged with crimes or misdemeanors, or if he has been turned out of a social or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ganization. Brown v. People, 8 Hun, 562, affirmed 72 N. Y. 571; West v. Lynch, 7 Daly, 245; Berner v. Mittnacht, 2 Sweeney, 582; Crapo v. People, 15 Hun, 269, affirmed 76 <em>N. </em>Y. 288; Smith v. Mulford, 42 Hun, 347; Kober v. Miller, 38 Hun, 184; Hayward v. Sayer, 45 Hun, 595; Van Bokkelen v. Berdell, 130 N. Y. 141, 29 N. E. 254; Barker v. Savage, 1 Sweeney, 288; Greaton v. Smith, 1 Daly, 380, affirmed, sub nom. Greton v. Smith, 33 N. Y. 245; Ryan v. People, 79 N. Y. 593. A witness may be asked, for the purpose of affecting his credibility, in respect to his own acts, but not in respect to \u2022the acts and declarations of others tending to discredit him. Without considering the other questions presented on the briefs, we think that, for this error, the judgment and order should be reversed, and \u25a0a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs \u25a0to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
