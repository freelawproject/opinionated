The defendant pleaded certain -set-offs, which were allowed by the jury, and about which no serious contention is made on this appeal, and alleged, by way of counterclaim, that on or about November 20, 1894, she paid in advance to the firm the sum of $462, which amount was received by it, and no credit therefor given to her, and that the credit to which she was thus entitled would have more than satisfied the demand in suit. The controversy is as to this alleged counterclaim. The plaintiff claims that there was no payment, but that the transaction was substantially this: Mr. Benedict, one of the firm, gave Mr. Friedline, the defendant\u2019s husband, a note of W. B. Williams, one of the firm\u2019s customers, made to the order of Benedict &amp; Fowler, for $462, and asked Friedline to get the money for it; that Friedline took the note to August Kohn, who, upon the guaranty or indorsement of the defendant, gave him the amount, which he handed to Mr. Benedict as the proceeds of the discount; that the note was not paid at maturity, and the defendant, as guarantor or indorser, was obliged to take it up, and, as the note had not matured at the time of the assignment to the plaintiff, the sum subsequently paid thereon by the defendant was not a proper subject of counterclaim (Code, \u00a7 501, subd. 2; Church Co. v. Clarke, 77 Hun, 467, 28 N. Y. Supp. 870; Myers v. Davis, 22 N. Y. 489), and in respect thereto the defendant became a mere general creditor of the insolvent firm, entitled to collect from its assignee whatever dividend may become payable to its creditors. The defendant, on the other hand, insists that she indorsed the note, and obtained the money thereon, on the credit of her indorsement, from August Kohn, and that, at the time she paid the money over to Benedict, it was agreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>the amount so paid should then be credited by his firm on the account against her; that the note was really given to her as collateral security for any overpayment made, or that might be made, to Benedict &amp; Fowler,\u2014the proceeds, if paid, to be accounted for upon a final settlement of accounts between them. The claim seems odd, yet it may be true. The case was submitted to the jury, which found the defendant\u2019s theory to be correct,\u2014that the plaintiff\u2019s assignors had been paid in full prior to the assignment, and therefore the assignee had no cause of action. While the version of the transaction given by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses conforms to businesslike methods, and that given by the defendant is out of the usual course, the jury nevertheless had the right to believe the defendant and her witnesses; and, as the verdict has been approved by the trial judge and general term of the city court, we cannot interfere with the finding. Arnstein v. Haulenbeek, 16 Daly, 382, 11 N. Y. Supp. 701; Claflin v. Watch Co., 7 Misc. Kep. 668, 28 N. Y. Supp. 42; G-leason v. Thom, 16 Misc. Rep. 30, 37 N. Y. Supp. 680; Kreizer v. Allaire, 16 Misc. Rep. 6, 37 N. Y. Supp. 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">No error of law having been committed to the plaintiff\u2019s prejudice, the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
