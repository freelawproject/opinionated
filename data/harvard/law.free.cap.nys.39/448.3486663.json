The capital stock, authorized by its charter, is $5,000, all of which has been fully paid in to the company. It does an advertising business in this state, and employs, as the \u25a0comptroller has found, upon ample evidence, $40,000 in such business, and makes a net profit thereby of at least $20,000 per year. It is liable to taxation \u201cupon its franchise or business\u201d upon the basis of \u201cthe amount of capital stock employed within this state.\u201d \"The comptroller is authorized, for the purposes of the tax, to ascertain and determine the amount of such capital stock employed within this state. See People ex rel. Singer Manuf\u2019g Co. v. Wemple, 78 Hun, 63, 29 N. Y. Supp. 92, for citation of the various statutes. The comptroller fixed the amount of capital stock thus employed in this state at $40,000 for the year and ten months ending November 1, 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">The relator claims that it could not in any event exceed $5,000. We think it is settled by authority that \u201cthe amount of capital stock,\u201d made by statute the basis of taxation, cannot exceed the amount authorized by its charter. People v. Coleman, 126 N. Y. 433, 27 N. E. 818; Williams v. Telegraph Co., 93 N. Y. 188. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>held that the money or property which a corporation may acquire or employ in its business may greatly exceed the amount of its capital stock. Such property consists of capital stock, surplus, and franchise. The capital stock, however great the aggregate property, cannot exceed in amount, though it may in value, the amount permitted by its charter. Id. Ordinarily, the amount of the capital stock of a foreign corporation doing business in this state is less than the amount authorized by its charter. In such case the comptroller, in order to ascertain the amount employed within this state, may need to examine as to the extent and details of its business within the state. People ex rel. John A. Roebling\u2019s Sons\u2019 Co. v. Wemple, 138 N. Y. 582, 34 N. E. 386; People ex rel. Seth Thomas Clock Co. v. Wemple, 133 N. Y. 323, 31 N. E. 238. Rules applicable to ascertaining the part of the whole afford no warrant for assessing the whole above the amount of its fixed limit. It is said, in Einstein v. Electric Co., 146 N. Y. 53, 40 N. E. 631, that \u201cno acts of the officers or agents of the company are competent to enlarge the capital stock, nor can the stockholders do so save in the particular manner pointed out by the statute.\u201d The relator may employ its surplus in business, if it chooses, instead of increasing its capital stock. The statute does not include in this particular field of taxation such surplus thus employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The determination of the comptroller should be reversed, with costs, and the tax against the relator be fixed upon the basis of $5,000, its capital stock employed within this state. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
