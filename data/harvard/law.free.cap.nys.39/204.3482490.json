The action was brought in equity, alleging unauthorized and unlawful acts on the part of the defendant with reference to the plaintiff\u2019s real estate, intrusted to the care and management of the defendant as agent of the plaintiff, the violation of a trust and a fiduciary relation between the parties, and the misappropriation of moneys received from the wrongful incumbrance and sale of the real estate by defendant, and praying for an accounting with reference to the management of the property, and that defendant be compelled to reduce the amount of one mortgage upon the property, and to satisfy another mortgage thereon, and to restore the property to its condition, before such unauthorized and unlawful acts were committed by the defendant, and for other relief. The defendant denied the allegations of unlawful acts, and \u25a0alleged a partnership with reference to the property, etc.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b229-8\">Argued before BARRETT, RTJMSEY, WILLIAMS, PATTERSON, and INGRAHAM, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-9\">Henry A.

The examination of a large account was not necessarily involved. The examination of any account was dependent upon the determination of the question whether the relations of the parties were those of principal and agent or not; whether the wrongful acts alleged were committed by the defendant or not. The court should itself have determined this question, and, if its determination was such as to require such an accounting, the court might then order a reference to take such account. This is the practice generally adopted, and should have been adhered to in this case. Camp v. Ingersoll, 86 N. Y. 433; Telegraph Co. v. Bickford, 142 N. Y. 224, 36 N. E. 881; Morrison v. Benthuysen, 103 N. Y. 675, 9 N. E. 180; Doyle v. Railway Co., 136 N. Y. 505, 32 N. E. 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs of appeal, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
