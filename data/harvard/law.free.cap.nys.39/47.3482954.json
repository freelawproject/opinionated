To obtain relief, it will be necessary to set aside the assignment made by plaintiff to Lehman Bros., upon the grounds alleged,\u2014that it was obtained by fraudulent representations, and was the result of a mistake of fact. If successful in this attack upon the assignment by showing that such representations were made,, and that they were false and fraudulent, then, undoubtedly, the further relief of an accounting would follow; and as this, in view of the numerous transactions between the parties, would necessarily involve the examination of a long account, the taking of this would properly be sent to a referee. So far as the defendants Lehman Bros, are concerned, the action can in no sense be regarded as referable, because, as between them and the plaintiff, the issue is whether the assignment to them was the result of fraud and mistake. To justify a compulsory reference, it is not enough that the case may involve the examination of a long account, but sufficient should be shown to justify an inference that that would be the course of the trial, or, as said in Camp v. Ingersoll, 86 N. Y. 433, \u201cThe account to be examined must be the immediate object of the action or the ground of defense, and that it must, be directly, and not collaterally,, involved.\u201d If plaintiff is successful in setting aside the assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u25a0to Lehman Bros., the latter have no interest whatever in the accounting, or the extent of the liability of the defendants Gqodhart; their sole interest being centered in an endeavor to uphold the assignment to them, which is assailed for fraud and mistake. And, even as to the defendants Goodhart, the question which is first to be disposed -of, and upon the establishing of which alone the plaintiff is entitled to reopen the accounts, is that of fraud. We do not think, therefore, that the court had power to order a compulsory reference of this issue. But, even if it were a matter of discretion, it should not, upon the pleadings here, have exercised it in directing a reference. The respondent calls our attention to the case of Bank v. Baker, 148 N. Y. 581, 42 N. E. 1077; Id. 90 Hun, 277, 35 N. Y. Supp. 933. The \u2022eases, however, are entirely dissimilar. There the action was brought under chapter 487 of the Laws of 1889, by creditors of a deceased insolvent debtor, to disaffirm a transfer made in fraud of their rights as creditors. As correctly stated in the headnote in 90 Hun, 277, 35 N. Y. Supp. 933, \u201cThe primary question in such case is whether an indebtedness to the creditor does exist upon the part of the \u2022estate of the deceased, and the whole proceedings depend upon the establishment of this issue in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d This statement alone is sufficient to emphasize the distinction between that \u2022case and the one at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
