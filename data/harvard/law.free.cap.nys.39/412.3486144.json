The facts stated in support of this charge are that the defendant, knowing itself to be insolvent, transferred some of its property to one of its officers to secure its debt to him, and to give him a preference over other creditors, and transferred other of its property to another creditor for like purpose, contrary to the express prohibition of section 48 of the stock corporation act (chapter 688, Laws 1892). As an original proposition, we should be inclined to hold that the intentional violation of a statute prohibiting preferences was intentional fraud upon the creditors, entitled to the observance and protection of the statute; but, under the rule stated in Casola v. Vasquez, 147 N. Y. 258, 41 N. E. 517, we must hold that the facts adduced do not support the charge of actual, intentional fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">The orders are affirmed, each with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
