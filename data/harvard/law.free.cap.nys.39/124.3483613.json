The original order, entered on the 26th day of October, appears to have been resettled, and that order was consequently vacated by the order resettling it. By the order as resettled it appears that this appellant was in default. The appellant applied for an adjournment, which was refused, whereupon his counsel withdrew, and the order as resettled contained a recital that no one appeared on behalf of the respondent Whiton, and the motion was then decided, after hearing David McClure, Esq., of counsel for petitioners, and on that motion the order was entered. This was evidently an order granted on default, and from an order entered on default no appeal can be taken. Code, \u00a7 1294. This appeal is therefore dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
