At the hearing of the motion, the defendant objected to the granting thereof; on the ground that his attorney had a lien on the costs, and that he had assigned them to his attorney for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-17\">Costs primarily belong to the party, but the attorney has a lien thereon for his services. The rule of law is: \u201cWhere the several awards asked to be set off against each other were made in the same action, the equities of the parties are superior to the lien of the attorney or the rights of assignees.\u201d See Hopper v. Ersler (Super. 1ST. Y.) 38 N. Y. Supp. 176, and Winterson v. Hitchings (Com. PI.) Id. 171, and cases therein collated.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-18\">The order appealed from is reversed, with costs, and the motion granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
