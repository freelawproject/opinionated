Quirk was making an unauthorized use of a parcel of land owned by him (the locus). Quirk claimed that his operations were a proper pre-zoning, nonconforming use. Each building inspector acted on the basis that (1) Quirk was entitled to make a nonconforming use of the locus, and (2) he had made no improper expansion of that use. Owners of land abutting the locus and others (not including Cameron) filed apparently on April 16, 1982, with the town board of appeals (the board) an appeal from the decision of the second building inspector for relief as follows: viz., (1) that the board require Quirk \u201cto apply for a special permit ... in accordance with Chapter I Section 175 Sub Section 1532 [of the by-law] if he persists in his substantially changed and extended use of the\u201d locus, and (2) that the board \u201cfind that the use of the . . . [locus] is substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the previous nonconforming use of the property by Gordon C. Hamblin, in accordance with . . . [town z]oning by-laws, and that, in addition, said board find that said use will create an undue nuisance, hazard, or congestion and substantial harm will result to the established and future character of the neighborhood or town in accordance with Chapter I Section 175 Sub Section 1422 of said by-laws.\u201d Hamblin was one of Quirk\u2019s predecessors in title to the locus.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">A public hearing was held before the board on May 13, 1982, after notice \u201cto the petitioner and all . . . owners of property deemed by the [b]card to be affected\u201d and by publication.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At a subsequent board meeting, on June 10, 1982, insufficient votes in favor of various suggested courses of action could be mustered. The appeal, accordingly, was treated as denied. The decision was not filed by the board with the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>clerk until August 2, 1982. This filing was 108 days after the appeal to the board on April 16, and fifty-three days after the board\u2019s decision on June 10.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Upon a complaint to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, by persons not all of whom were parties to the appeal before the board, the board asserted the absence of some of the original parties as a defense under \u00a7 17. Quirk, allowed to intervene, filed a counterclaim which set out (1) that different groups were (a) parties before the board and (b) parties before the Superior Court, and also (2) that the objections to the inaction of the first building inspector, followed by a further request for enforcement by objectors to the inaction of the second building inspector, amounted to harassment of him (Quirk) as owner of the locus. The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment solely on the ground that the board\u2019s decision \u201cwas made and filed beyond the time requirement set forth in\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The motion judge granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs on the authority of <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, </em>389 Mass. 617, 623 (1983), and <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Greenfield, </em>394 Mass. 663, 666-667 (1985). He stated that the failure of the board \u201cto file its decision until fifty-three days after its decision\u201d and 108 days after the filing of the petition to the board had resulted in a \u201ccon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>structive\u201d grant of the petition. See also <em>Cappuccio </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Spencer, </em>398 Mass. 304, 310-311 (1986). He ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 petition to the board was under c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 15, rather than under \u00a7 9, because the \u201cplaintiffs were not seeking a special permit\u201d but were asking instead \u201ca determination by the [bjuilding [inspector that . . . [Quirk\u2019s] operations were in violation of existing by-laws and thus prohibited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">This case obviously requires some renewed consideration of the provisions of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, and 17, as in existence after (and as amended after) the effective date of St. 1975, c. 808, which resulted in a very substantial revision of preexisting zoning provisions. Certain relevant portions of these revised sections are set out in the appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">These statutory provisions, especially the \u201cconstructive\u201d approval provisions of \u00a7 15, in various respects, have been found (by those engaged in zoning litigation) to be confusing and lacking in clarity and explicit guidance. See, in addition to the cases already cited, the split decision in <em>Noe </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Hingham, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 110 (1982). See also <em>Elder Care Servs. Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Hing-ham, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 480 (1984), <em>Vokes </em>v. <em>Avery W. Lovell, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 471 (1984), and <em>O\u2019Kane </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Hingham, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 163-165 (1985). In the present case (which arose in 1982 before the <em>Capone </em>decision, announced July 6,1983), because (a) the seventy-five days allowed by c. 40A, \u00a7 15, for the board\u2019s decision and (b) the fourteen days allowed for filing the board\u2019s decision with the town clerk both had expired, \u00a7 15 operated constructively to grant at least some aspects of the request for an order by the building inspector to Quirk to desist from an apparently valid nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The \u201cconstructive\u201d approval provisions of the appeal provisions \u00a7 15 (see Appendix, italicized language following [X]) can usually be applied reasonably effectively with respect to precisely stated relief sought from a building inspector or other town official, e.g., granting or denying a building permit or the refusal of, or agreement to take, <em>explicitly </em>stated action to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>enforce the zoning by-law. The \u201cconstructive\u201d approval provisions of \u00a7 15, however, are much less well adapted to granting a <em>general </em>enforcement request denied by a building inspector. Indeed, nothing more precise than a <em>general </em>order to enforce the by-law may be all that can be directed intelligibly unless, perhaps, the original request for enforcement was framed in sufficiently <em>specific </em>form to enable the building inspector to know exactly what he is commanded to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We perceive no reason why the failure of the board (in the present case) to file its decision with the town clerk in timely fashion may not be treated as a \u201cconstructive\u201d approval of the appeal of those who sought relief from the board that the board direct the building inspector to take action to require Quirk to seek a special permit to continue what the plaintiffs contend is an unlawfully expanded nonconforming use of the locus. If Quirk does not apply for a special permit, we think the order may be made sufficiently inclusive to order the building inspector to seek enforcement of the zoning by-law under c. 40A, \u00a7 7 (see appendix), in the Superior Court, alleging that the nonconforming use has been unlawfully expanded. Quirk, in such an enforcement action, then will be entitled to show the true extent of the nonconforming use and to be protected in that. We think, however, that the second part of the request to the board for relief is too general and diffuse to be readily susceptible of constructive approval under c. 40A, \u00a7 15 (see appendix). See <em>DiGiovanni </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 343-345 (1985), where (at 345) it was suggested that \u201ca too vaguely worded application\u201d to the board may not be susceptible of \u201cbeing constructively granted\u201d under c. 40A, \u00a7 15. See also the general discussion in <em>Neuhaus </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Marlborough, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 232-235 (1981), where, however, no question of constructive approval of the request to the board was raised; the <em>Vokes </em>case, 18 Mass. App. Ct. at 473; Healey, Massachusetts Zoning Practice Under the Amended Zoning Enabling Act, 64 Mass.L.Rev. 157, 161-165 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We hold that the failure of the board to complete action on the appeal to it within the period specified in \u00a7 15 resulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>a constructive grant of the relief sought by the appellants to the extent only that the building inspector shall be ordered (1) to take appropriate action to require Quirk to seek a special permit, and (2) if Quirk does not apply for a permit within a reasonable time, then to file an action in the Superior Court to require Quirk\u2019s compliance with the zoning by-law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>In that action it will be the duty of the Superior Court to determine the extent of the nonconforming use to which Quirk is entitled, and to enjoin any improper expansion of that use which has occurred. The scope of the court\u2019s determination in the enforcement action will be essentially as broad as the de nova judicial review under c. 40A, \u00a7 17, to which Quirk would have been entitled if he had claimed timely appeal from the constructive approval under \u00a7 15 of the appeal to the board under the principles of the <em>Girard </em>case, 14 Mass. App. Ct. at 337-338.\u00ae The summary judgment appealed from is to be limited as herein provided and as so limited is affirmed. No party is to have costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Portions of Certain Relevant Sections of G.L.

In particular, the notice of the public hearing before the board, and the decision (if any) of the former building inspector are not set out verbatim. Also, the town\u2019s zoning by-law is not in the record. See <em>Ploski </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Somerset, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 875, 876 (1979), holding that such by-laws \u201care not matters of which we can take judicial notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> The record and docket entries show no appeal at any time by Quirk from the board\u2019s decision of June 10, 1982 (naturally enough because it was in his favor), or from any \u201cconstructive\u201d granting by the board of relief sought by the plaintiffs. See <em>Girard </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Easton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 334, 337-338, decided August 23, 1982, so that Quirk and his counsel could not have been put on notice of the possibility of claiming judicial review (under the principles of that decision) of any \u201cconstructive\u201d grant of relief, by the board by its failure to file its decision with the town clerk within fourteen days (see G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15) after its denial of relief on June 10 or within twenty days from the expiration of the period of seventy-five days following the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s petition to the board on April 16, 1982, viz., June 30, 1982. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. Because Quirk never himself sought judicial review, we need not decide the period within which he could have done so under <em>Girard </em>case principles. See, however, the discussion in <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Greenfield, </em>394 Mass. 663, 665-667 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\"> The limitation of relief appears consistent with <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Nantucket, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 733, 737 (1983), where it was said: \u201cIn general ... the appropriate policy, when the scope of the proceedings before (and the decision of) a board of appeals is in doubt, is to construe the proceedings circumspectly and to avoid an interpretation which leaves the scope of the board\u2019s decision more sweeping than abutters and other interested persons had reason to anticipate when notices were given and hearings had.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\"> Because the principles of the <em>Girard </em>case are not set out in c. 40A, \u00a7 15, in explicit form, legislative reconsideration of the \u201cconstructive\u201d grant provisions of that section might serve to protect not only city and town boards and abutting owners (as in the <em>Girard </em>case) but also landowners (e.g., like Quirk possessed of nonconforming use rights) from losing the opportunity to claim appeals from \u201cconstructive\u201d grants of relief sought in appeals to boards of zoning appeals. There would seem at present an opportunity under \u00a7 15 for boards to use delay to effect zoning manipulation. At least inclusion (in some manner in the statutory language) of the principles of the <em>Girard </em>case could result in clarification. See the somewhat analogous provisions of the first paragraph of G.
