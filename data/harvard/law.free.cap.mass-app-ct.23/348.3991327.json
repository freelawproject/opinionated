The Commonwealth\u2019s case consisted of testimony from the arresting officer about the events, the results of a breath test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>administered on a device known as the \u201cIntoxilyzer 5000\u201d revealing a blood alcohol content of .17 percent weight by volume, and a videotape taken of the defendant while he was being booked and while the breath test was being administered. The defendant attempted unsuccessfully to have the judge suppress the breath-test results on the ground that the \u201cIntoxilyzer 5000\u201d does not perform a \u201cchemical test or analysis of his breath\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(e), as appearing in St. 1980, c. 383, \u00a7 1. The defendant\u2019s case consisted of his own testimony as to his activities, including the consumption of alcohol, during the night of his arrest. In addition, he offered to produce an expert witness to challenge the accuracy of the breath-test results. The proposed witness, one Patrick Demers, testified at length on voir dire concerning his qualifications and opinions. Without any findings or explanation, the trial judge exluded all testimony from Demers.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In this appeal, the defendant contends that it was error for the judge (1) to allow evidence concerning the breath-test results and (2) to exclude the expert\u2019s testimony. We rule that the Intoxilyzer 5000 is a breath-testing device capable of yielding results which may be admissible in evidence under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(e). However, we rule that, in the circumstances, the judge erred in excluding all expert testimony from Demers in the absence of any proper basis for doing so. The defendant, thus, is entitled to a new trial on the conviction of operating under the influence. As none of the reasons for reversal applies to the conviction of failing to stay within marked lanes, that conviction stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">1. <em>The Intoxilyzer 5000 is a chemical test or analysis of the breath. </em>General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24(1 )(&lt;?), provides that, so long as certain conditions are met, including the consent of the defendant to the test,</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u201c[i]n any prosecution for [operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor], evidence of the percentage, by weight, .of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood at the time of the alleged offense, as shown by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>chemical test or analysis of his blood or as indicated by chemical test or analysis of his breath, shall be admissible and deemed relevant to the determination of the question of whether such defendant was at such time under the influence of intoxicating liquor; ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The Legislature has recognized that \u201cthe [Smith &amp; Wesson] Model 900A Breathalyzer and other scientific instruments that measure blood alcohol content on the basis of breath samples have for some time been deemed to satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s \u2018general acceptance\u2019 standard for admissibility of scientific evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>392 Mass. 1, 17 (1984). The Intoxilyzer 5000 is an infrared photometric instrument designed to measure ethyl alcohol in the breath. Its operation is based upon the scientific principle that vaporized alcohol will absorb infrared light of a wavelength of 3.39 microns at a rate different from that of other chemical compounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The device measures the amount of infrared light absorbed and translates that measurement into a blood alcohol content reading. Although it is a more sophisticated instrument than the breathalyzers used since the early nineteen sixties, its functioning is based, nevertheless, upon the same underlying scientific principle (known as Henry\u2019s Law): that, at any given temperature, the ratio between the concentration of alcohol in one\u2019s blood and that in the alveolar air in the lungs is a constant: 2,100:1. See 4 Gray, Attorneys\u2019 Textbook of Medicine par. 133.73(1) (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u201cChemistry\u201d is a \u201cscience that deals with the composition, structure, and properties of substances . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 384 (1971). \u201cChemical analysis\u201d has been defined as \u201cthe corpus of all techniques whereby any exact chemical information is obtained.\u201d The New Columbia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Encyclopedia 520 (1973), cited in <em>Dayton </em>v. <em>Schenck, </em>63 Ohio Misc. 14 (Dayton Mun. Ct. 1980). The defendant argues that the phrase \u201cchemical test or analysis\u201d is limited to tests or analyses performed with chemicals. The statutory authorization, however, is not by its terms limited to tests which utilize chemical reactions. The machine in question analyzes the suspect\u2019s breath for the presence of ethyl alcohol, an identifiable \u25a0chemical compound, and measures its concentration by means of a physical test routinely used for that purpose by chemists. In every other jurisdiction in which the issue has been raised, Intoxilyzer 5000 machines or similar devices have been determined to perform \u201cchemical\u201d analyses. See <em>Dollar </em>v. <em>State, </em>287 Ark. 153 (1985); <em>Husk </em>v. <em>State, </em>476 N.E. 2d 149 (Ind. Ct. App. 1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Legislature would not have intended to limit the authorization it was providing for the important public purpose of facilitating reliable proof in drunk driving prosecutions to the technology which happened to be available when the original breath-test legislation was passed in 1961. St. 1961, c. 340. The instrument in question is, in our view, of a type that the Legislature must have meant to include. The evidence of the test result was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">2. <em>The expert testimony was improperly excluded. </em>The qualifications and opinions of Demers, the expert witness offered by the defendant, were explored at length on voir dire. The qualifications of the witness in matters relating to alcohol con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>sumption and testing methods are substantial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also had sufficient knowledge of the particular facts so that his opinions were not formed in the abstract. He stated that he was familiar with the operation of infrared breath-analysis machines, that he had reviewed the police department\u2019s ownership and maintenance records of the machine in question, and that he had viewed the videotape of the defendant\u2019s breath test and inspected the defendant\u2019s test printout.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">According to his voir dire testimony, Demers was prepared to state, among other things: (a) that the particular Intoxilyzer 5000 machine used for the defendant\u2019s breath analysis was not properly installed, maintained, tested, calibrated, or operated; (b) that the defendant, as observed by the witness on the videotape, did not display the clinically observable signs expected of an individual with a . 17 percent blood alcohol content; (c) the amount of alcohol a person of the defendant\u2019s size would need to consume during the relevant time period in order to obtain a .17 percent blood alcohol content; and (d) what the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content would have been if he had consumed only the amount of alcohol the defendant said he consumed. The Commonwealth objected to the introduction of the evidence. The prosecutor took issue before the trial judge with the substance of some of Demers\u2019 opinion, and objected to Demers\u2019 qualifications. Demers, the prosecutor pointed out, was not a physician; he did not own an Intoxilyzer 5000; and he had received no specific training or licensing on that machine. The prosecutor argued that the expert\u2019s examination of the videotape was an insufficient basis for the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>sions he reached about the extent of the defendant\u2019s intoxication. Finally, the prosecutor maintained that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169 (1985), barred any expert testimony as to what the blood alcohol content would be of a person who had consumed the amount of alcohol the defendant said he had consumed. Without offering defense counsel an opportunity to respond to the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, the judge stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to exclude the evidence.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On appeal, the Commonwealth concedes that a defendant charged with operating a motor vehicle v/hile intoxicated may use expert testimony to challenge the accuracy of his particular breath-test results. Although direct authority in this Commonwealth concerning expert testimony in drunk driving cases is sparse, a contrary rule could deprive a defendant of the opportunity to present a meaningful defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>392 Mass. at 8; <em>California </em>v. <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984). See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. at 175.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Certainly, the reliability of chemical tests and the application of scientific principles and formulae are matters outside the common knowledge of jurors, and an expert\u2019s opinion could be of assistance to them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis </em>390 Mass. 89, 98-99 &amp; n.6 (1983). The Commonwealth now seems to dispute only the qualifications of the expert, an issue which, the Commonwealth correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>points out, ordinarily lies within the judge\u2019s discretion. That discretion, however, is not without limits. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banuchi, </em>335 Mass. 649, 655 (1957); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>United Books, Inc., </em>389 Mass. 888, 896 (1983). In a criminal case the denial of a defendant\u2019s right to present expert testimony merits close scrutiny. On this record, where we can discern no acceptable basis for what seems to us the arbitrary blanket rejection of Demers\u2019 opinion testimony, the limits were exceeded. Demers appeared to possess \u201csufficient skill, knowledge [and] experience in the field of his testimony that the jury [might have] receive[d] appreciable assistance from it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>United Books, Inc., </em>389 Mass. at 896, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, 367 </em>Mass. 169, 182 (1975). See <em>Department of Youth Services </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 527 (1986). He had sufficient familiarity with the subject matter. An expert need not be personally familiar with every aspect of a question at issue. \u201cThe [expert] witness . . . may base his opinion upon facts observed by himself or within his own knowledge and testified to by himself, or upon facts assumed in the questions put to him and supported either by admitted facts or by the testimony of other witnesses already given or to be given at the trial, or upon facts derived partly-from one source and partly from the other.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, 73 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The admission in evidence of the breath-test result triggered instructions to the jury that they could infer that the defendant at the time of his arrest was under the influence of alcohol. If the jury had been allowed to hear from the expert that the defendant\u2019s test results were unreliable, they might not have drawn the adverse inference. The offered opinions, thus, were relevant to the issue. (Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. at 175, in which the expert opinion offered was held to be inadmissible because the defendant had refused to have his breath tested.) The points made by the prosecutor in objection to the testimony were directed primarily to the weight it deserved. Those points could form the basis for effective cross-examination. The Commonwealth could also counter the force of the defendant\u2019s evidence by presenting an opposing expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>If, for some reason, the judge found the witness lacking in credibility, it would have been helpful if he had made specific findings to that effect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>United Books, Inc., </em>389 Mass. at 897, a criminal case which deals with the highly controversial subject of pornography and which strongly suggests that a trial judge should provide some findings or explanation when in such a case he denies a defendant\u2019s request to present the testimony of a qualified expert on a relevant issue on which such testimony could assist the jury. In the absence of such an explanation or factual basis, there is slight reason for an appellate court to defer to the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion because that court may find it difficult to know whether any discretion was in fact exercised. At any new trial in this case, if the defense should offer Demers or another expert witness of like qualifications, the witness should be permitted to state opinions relating to the reliability of the defendant\u2019s breath-test results unless, as to any particular opinion, the judge makes findings to indicate why he regards the expert as unqualified to express that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The judgment on the complaint for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor is reversed and the verdict is set aside. The judgment on the complaint for failing to stay within marked lanes is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\"> The principle underlying infrared analysis of substances derives from the Beer-Lambert law of absorption. According to this law, molecules absorb electromagnetic radiation, and only radiation of certain wavelengths will be absorbed by a molecule of any given compound.
