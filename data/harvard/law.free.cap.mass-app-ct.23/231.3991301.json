(Cullinet),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was a Massachusetts corporation engaged in the development, acquisition, and marketing of computer software products for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>business, financial, and commercial use. Its main product line centered on a database management system it had developed for use on IBM mainframe computers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cullinet\u2019s business, in 1981, extended throughout the world, and it had subsidiaries and marketing representatives in twenty-four different countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">McCormack and Dodge (M &amp; D) in 1981 was also a Massachusetts corporation. It was engaged in the development and marketing of applications software. Such software allows a computer to perform a specific function such as accounts payable or a general ledger analysis of financial information. One of M &amp; D\u2019s products at the time was General Ledger (G/L Plus), a software system that performed general ledger accounting functions. That product was sold by M &amp; D, both domestically and throughout the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In the spring of 1981, Cullinet approached M &amp; D in an attempt to acquire rights to the G/L Plus system. Negotiations ensued leading to the signing of a software license agreement (Agreement) between the two companies on August 25, 1981. The Agreement was drafted by lawyers for Cullinet and included the following paragraph entitled \u201cRecitals\u201d: \u201cLicensor has developed the System (as defined in Section 1.7 hereof). [Cullinet] desires (a) to obtain rights to use and evaluate the System, (b) to receive consultation and advice as to the operation of the System with, and as to the integration of the System into, certain products licensed by [Cullinet] and its affiliates and (c) to obtain a non-exclusive license to market and sub-license the System throughout the United States of America and Canada, all upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The Agreement provided that M &amp; D would deliver to Cul-linet a specific version (\u201cRelease 1.7\u201d) of M &amp; D\u2019s G/L Plus system (System) and related technical information. Section 3.1 granted to Cullinet a non-exclusive license, limited to the United States and Canada, to use the System in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Cullinet\u2019s business, including the right \u201cto make modifications to or improvements in the System for any purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Another section (\u00a7 3.2) granted Cullinet a non-exclusive license to market and sublicense the System to users of Cullinet database management systems, subject to certain limitations: Cullinet would market the System \u201conly with an interface ... to be used with a [Cullinet] database management system,\u201d and Cul-linet would not implement any interface that could be used with products other than Cullinet\u2019s.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Cullinet was given a \u201climited right\u201d to use the name \u201cMcCor-mack &amp; Dodge General Ledger Plus\u201d for purpose of identifying the \u201csource of the System.\u201d After February 28, 1982, Cullinet was prohibited from representing to users or prospects \u201cthat its version of the System [was] the same as [M &amp; D\u2019s] version of the System.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> M &amp; D expressly retained its own rights to use and market the System and to grant such rights to others (\u00a7 3.6). The Agreement included an integration clause which stated that the \u201cAgreement contains the full understanding of the parties . . . and supersedes all prior understandings and writings relating thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The controversy between the parties concerns the language in Article VI, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u201c6.1 <em>Term. </em>The term of this Agreement shall be five years from the date hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">\u201c6.2 <em>Assignment of Rights to [Cullinet]. </em>Upon the expiration of this Agreement pursuant to 6.1 above, Licensor shall automatically, by operation of this Agreement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>without the execution of any further documents or the payment of any further consideration or the taking of any further action by Licensor or [Cullinet], assign to [Cul-linet] all right, title and interest in and to the System sufficient to permit [Cullinet] to use and to sublicense the System, in perpetuity, without limitation, subject, however, to the Licensor\u2019s rights contained in [\u00a7] 3.6<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, [Cullinet] will not during the term of this Agreement or thereafter implement any interface for the system to be used with any product other than a database management system marketed by [Cullinet].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Shortly after the parties signed the Agreement, differences arose in regard to the interpretation of Article VI. It became apparent that each party considered the geographic scope of the agreement to be of crucial importance. Cullinet claimed worldwide rights while M &amp; D argued that only United States and Canadian rights were involved. As a result of the dispute, Cullinet filed an action in the Superior Court against M &amp; D. It contended that under the language of Article VI, at the expiration of the five-year term in \u00a7 6.1, \u2018it had the right to market the System worldwide. Cullinet sought a declaration to that effect. M &amp; D, in its answer and counterclaim, contended that the Agreement barred Cullinet from marketing the System outside the United States and Canada forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Cullinet moved for partial summary judgment on its complaint, arguing that the language of the Agreement was clear and unambiguous and supported its interpretation that the geographic limitation would be removed at the end of five years. M &amp; D also moved for summary judgment, asserting that its own interpretation was clear from the language of the Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ment and that the rights were forever limited to the United States and Canada. After a hearing on the motions, a Superior Court judge ruled, in effect, that the language was not clear but instead was uncertain and equivocal on the disputed point. He ordered an evidentiary hearing to receive extrinsic evidence for the purpose of elucidating the terms of the Agreement. Pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 42(b), 365 Mass. 805 (1974), he severed the issue raised by Cullinet\u2019s complaint from any other issues that might be raised by M &amp; D\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">At the four-day hearing, the parties introduced oral and documentary evidence in support of their respective interpretations of the Agreement. Cullinet maintained that the language in Article VI was clear that upon the expiration of the Agreement under \u00a7 6.1, new rights were granted to Cullinet under \u00a7 6.2, subject to certain limitations, none of a geographic nature. M &amp; D on the other hand, contended that in the context of the Agreement \u201cwithout limitation\u201d had only a temporal and not a geographic meaning. It claimed that the Agreement did hot contain any mention of worldwide rights and that none could be read into it by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">After the hearing, the judge filed a memorandum of decision that included his findings of fact, rulings of law, and order for judgment. Reversing, sub silentio, the ruling that he had made at the hearing on the motions, the judge now concluded that the language of the Agreement <em>was </em>clear and unambiguous. He stated that the language of the Agreement itself, \u201cdemonstrates without any substantial doubt that after August 31, 1986, the locus of Cullinet\u2019s rights continues to be the United States and Canada and does not extend beyond them.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a separate section of the memorandum, he reviewed the extrinsic evidence introduced at the hearing and concluded that it \u201cconfirmed\u201d his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Judgment entered in accordance with the judge\u2019s decision. Culiinet has appealed from that judgment. It claims that the judge erred in that he (1) misconstrued the language of the Agreement, (2) misused paroi evidence to contradict terms of the Agreement, (3) made clearly erroneous findings of fact, and (4) wrongfully excluded certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">A reading of the Agreement demonstrates that the judge erred in his conclusion that the Agreement was clear and unambiguous on its face. An ambiguity exists because of the introductory language contained in the recitals clause quoted earlier and the language in \u00a7\u00a7 6.1 and 6.2. As Culiinet suggests, a reasonable interpretation is that the agreement terminated after five years and that the new rights granted Culiinet in \u00a7 6.2 are without the limited geographical scope contained in the recitals and other parts of the Agreement. It is also reasonable to conclude, as M &amp; D argues, that the recital clause sets the context for both \u00a7\u00a7 6.1 and 6.2, and that if rights as important worldwide rights were intended to be granted, they would have been specifically mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We feel constrained to reverse the judgment and order a new trial. Because of our holding that there was an ambiguity in the Agreement, we do not fault the judge for receiving extrinsic evidence. See <em>Robert Indus. Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 753 (1973), where the court stated that \u201cthere was no error in the admission of evidence of the facts and circumstances of the transaction, including the situation and relations of the parties, for the purpose of applying the terms of the written contract to the subject matter and removing and explaining any uncertainty or ambiguity which arose from such application.\u201d Also see <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>A-H, Inc., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 126, 128-129 (1983); 4 Williston, Contracts \u00a7 629 (3d ed. 1961 &amp; Supp. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">We do not reverse because we believe that the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion was necessarily wrong. Rather, we do so for two reasons. First, we are concerned that the trial judge\u2019s erroneous conclusion that the language of the Agreement was clear and unambiguous may have affected the conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>he reached based upon his consideration of the extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Second, he found that Cullinet, after execution of the Agreement, \u201cmade no claim to international rights and, indeed, recognized that the Agreement gave it none.\u201d Cullinet offered evidence of testimony of Mr. Robert N. Goldman, its senior vice president and chief negotiator of the Agreement, given in October, 1981, two months after the execution of the Agreement. The testimony was given in the presence of counsel for M &amp;\u25a0 D in a law action brought against M &amp; D by ABC Management Systems, Inc. Mr. Goldman testified that after five years Cullinet would be able to market the System outside the United States and Canada. The evidence was relevant, and excluding it was error, unless there were grounds for exclusion not apparent on this record. Once the judge decided to receive extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 negotiations and postexecution conduct, Goldman\u2019s testimony became admissible as bearing upon Cullinet\u2019s interpretation of the Agreement communicated to M &amp; D shortly after the Agreement was executed. The testimony was also admissible as a prior consistent statement in the face of a strong suggestion of a recent contrivance. <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Corey, </em>150 Mass. 445, 445-447 (1890). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 522, 528, 530 (1977). Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 168-169 (5th ed. 1981). 4 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1129 (Chadboum rev. 1972 &amp; Supp. 1986). Its exclusion was obviously prejudicial to Cullinet in view of the judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The purpose of the remand is to determine the intent of the parties as to the meaning of the disputed language at the time that they executed the Agreement. It may be, however, that on remand, the judge will determine that, at the time of execution, each party had a different understanding as to the existence of worldwide rights at the end of the five-year period. If that should be his finding, it appears that in this case the parties were at such a stage of performance by the time the disagreement erupted that the Agreement could not be rescinded. In these circumstances, the judge would have to determine what was the more reasonable interpretation, in light of the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>used in the Agreement and all the attendant circumstances. <em>D. Federico Co. </em>v. <em>New Bedford Redevelopment Authy., </em>723 F.2d 122, 129 (1st Cir. 1983). <em>Jamesbury Corp. </em>v. <em>Worcester Valve Co., </em>443 F. 2d 205, 210n.7 (1st Cir. 1971). <em>Fay, Spofford &amp; Thorndike, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 342 (1979). Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 204 comment d (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial on the construction of \u00a7 6.2 and related provisions and for trial on the issues raised by M &amp; D\u2019s counterclaim. We do not reach the other issues argued by Cullinet, as they should not arise at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-14\"> In 1981 the plaintiff was known as Cullinane Database Systems, Inc.

Cullinet, therefore, bought a \u201cfrozen\u201d version of the System.
