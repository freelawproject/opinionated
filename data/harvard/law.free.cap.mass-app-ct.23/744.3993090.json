As prevailing parties in these actions, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>tiffs secured an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982) (vindication of civil rights; attorney\u2019s fees). The defendant State official paid the amount of the award, but after a period of delay. Accordingly the plaintiffs applied for post-award interest accrued during that period. From the order allowing such interest, the defendant appeals. We affirm the order for the reasons set out below. We go on to suggest how the State may proceed when it has a meritorious reason for asking a court to postpone the obligation to pay assessed fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">1. We take, as typical of the consolidated cases, that of Jason Gaulin, a child three years old. He is the son of Patricia LaRochelle. The other members of Ms. LaRochelle\u2019s household are her children, Marsha and Dennis Delgado, aged six and seven years, who receive Social Security survivors\u2019 benefits because their father is dead; David LaRochelle, her present husband; and David LaRochelle, Jr., their son, six months old. Jason\u2019s father, Keith Gaulin, has not contributed to Jason\u2019s support. When the mother sought \u201cgeneral relief\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 117, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., on Jason\u2019s behalf, and for him alone, the Department of Public Welfare declined to consider the application; rather it required the mother to apply for herself and all four children. In refusing the combined application thus made, the Department attributed David LaRochelle\u2019s income to the mother and decided that his earnings were available to support her and all the children. This brought the group over the income baseline for general relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was asserted on Jason\u2019s behalf that so to count the stepfather David LaRochelle\u2019s income in deciding Jason\u2019s eligibility not only violated the statute (G. L. c. 117, \u00a7 9) and regulations (106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 313.520 [1979]), but also violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution (and provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution to the same effect) by discriminating invidiously against stepchildren claiming general relief in situations like Jason\u2019s, for the basic rule of law was that a stepfather was not obligated to furnish support for his stepchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>The plaintiff exhausted administrative review and then applied to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, by complaint filed in July, 1982. Upon cross motions for summary judgment, the court held for the plaintiff on State grounds (interpretation of the statute and regulations) without having to pass on the constitutional issues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judgment entered in November, 1982. The defendant Commissioner took an appeal from the decision,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Supreme Judicial Court granted direct appellate review. However, in September, 1983, there was a stipulation of voluntary dismissal, the defendant Commissioner having acceded to the plaintiff\u2019s view which allowed individual consideration of Jason\u2019s application without counting the stepfather\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In October, 1983, the plaintiff moved on affidavits for allowance of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982 &amp; Supp. IV).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After discovery in connection with this motion, the judge made an award of $8,199.75 (in the three consolidated cases) on June 13, 1984. The Commonwealth paid this amount on September 28,1984, after a delay of three and one-half months. Thereupon the plaintiffs moved for an order for interest on the award accrued during the period of delay. An order, in the amount of $286.99, was allowed;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied; and it is the allowance of this item of interest that is the subject of the present appeal. (We have omitted from our narrative the substance of an affidavit offered by the defendant to explain the delay of payment. This will be discussed at point 3 below.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>2. The courts of the Commonwealth are well acquainted with the \u00a7 1988 provision for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees payable to the prevailing parties in civil rights actions against State officials grounded on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) or certain other Federal enactments which, at plaintiff\u2019s election, may be instituted in State courts. See <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444 (1981); <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312 (1982); <em>Mulhern </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>398 Mass. 18, 27 &amp; n.13 (1986). Section 1988 is \u201cappropriate legislation\u201d of the Congress \u201cto enforce the provisions\u201d of the Fourteenth Amendment within the meaning of \u00a7 5 thereof. See Senate Report (Judiciary Committee) No. 94-1011, at 5 (1976), to accompany S. 2278, which passed as P. L. 94-559, 90 Stat. 2641 (1976), amending 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1976). The effect of the statute is to overcome any inconsistent claim that a State official, as defendant, may advance under the banner of the sovereign immunity of the State. See <em>Hutto </em>v. <em>Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 693-700 (1978); <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 132 (1980). For this purpose it does not matter whether the civil rights enforcement action against a State defendant is brought in State or Federal court. See <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 10-11 &amp; n.12 (1980); <em>Ferdinand </em>v. <em>Fairbanks, </em>599 P.2d 122,125 (Alaska 1979). Cf. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Hales Corners, </em>115 Wis. 2d 289, 304 (1983). So also \u00a7 1988 imports a Federal standard for a court, whether State or Federal, in deciding what is the reasonable fee. See <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 320-325.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such were the bases for the award of the attorney\u2019s fee in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Although \u00a7 1988 does not speak in so many words about interest accruing on an award of attorney\u2019s fees when there is a delay of payment by the State, the general practice of the Federal courts is to allow such interest. Thus in <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>565 F. Supp. 294, 297 (N.D. Ill. 1983), the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>said, citing considerable authority, \u201cEvery reported case to address the issue has held that interest is available on an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988.\u201d See also <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>565 F. Supp. 310, 320-321 (N.D. Ill. 1983). Characteristic decisions are <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>616 F.2d 1268, 1275-1276 (5th Cir.), modified, 636 F.2d 942 (1980), rehearing en banc denied, 641 F.2d 403 (1981); <em>Spain </em>v. <em>Mountanos, </em>690 F.2d 742, 747-748 (9th Cir. 1982); <em>R.W.T. </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>712 F.2d 1225, 1234-1235 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 464 U.S. 1009 (1983). Cf. <em>Wojtkowski </em>v. <em>Cade, </em>725 F.2d 127, 129 (1st Cir. 1984). The practice with respect to post-award accrual of interest parallels that regarding interest due upon ordinary money judgments, and the courts, indeed, in awarding post-award interest, often refer to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 (1982),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the statute applied in Federal courts that deals in general terms with interest owing on unpaid judgments for money. See, e.g., <em>R.W.T. </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>712 F.2d at 1235; <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>565 F. Supp. at 300.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Section 1961 cannot be directly invoked when it is a State court that has made an award of fees under \u00a7 1988, but the liability of the State for post-award interest is alike regardless of the forum. It stems from those considerations of policy which led to fee-shifting in civil rights litigation by statutory statement and nonstatutory development, and which manifested themselves strikingly in the 1976 amendment of \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Broadly speaking, the Congressional intention has been to create a strong system of private enforcement of Federal civil rights. The prospect of recovering reasonable (not extravagant) attorney\u2019s fees encourages the initiation and conduct of worthwhile litigation in this field that might otherwise never be brought (note that plaintiffs are often without resources and that this kind of litigation commonly results in injunctive or declaratory relief rather than money judgments). The threat of superadded liability for the opponent\u2019s legal expenses tends to deter abuses of governmental power. Where excesses are found to have occurred, the substantial financial burdens of corrective litigation are put where they justly belong. These and complementary motives were expressed during the passage of the 1976 legislation, and likewise appear in the decided cases. See the forceful statement in S. Rep. No. 1011, and <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>616 F.2d at 1274-1275; <em>Furtado </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>635 F.2d 915, 918 &amp; n.5 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>In such a regime, it is entirely appropriate to charge interest for delayed payment of assessed fees. Besides the ordinary justifications for interest, a rule which would free a State of that interest obligation would work against the basic policies mentioned: it would dilute the encouragement of putative plaintiffs and their counsel to commence proper actions and would give State defendants, as losers, an extraneous motive to delay payment. If, in the end, fees awarded as reasonable were paid after delays, net of interest, the effect as a practical matter would be to reduce those fees by indeterminate amounts without an explicable logic. See <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>616 F.2d at 1275-1276; <em>R.W.T. </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>712 F.2d at 1234-1235; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Summer, </em>488 F. Supp. 83, 85-88 (N.D. Miss. 1980); <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>499 F. Supp. 174, 212 &amp; n.54 (E.D. Tex. 1980). For State court decisons allowing post-award interest against governmental defendants, see <em>Indiana Hosp. Licensing Council </em>v. <em>Women\u2019s Pavilion, </em>486 N.E.2d 1070, 1074 (Ind. App. 1985); <em>Willson </em>v. <em>Des Moines, </em>386 N.W.2d 76, 79 (Iowa), cert, denied, 479 U.S. 948 (1986); <em>Amarillo </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>651 S.W.2d 906, 916 (Tex. App. 1983). Thus we conclude that the order appealed from, charging interest on past due attorney\u2019s fees assessed under \u00a7 1988, accords with Congressional policy and judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">3. The defendant Commissioner, although recognizing the obligation of the State for the reasonable attorney\u2019s fee awarded herein under \u00a7 1988, denied any consequent obligation of the State for post-award interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">First, the Commissioner argued that whereas the sovereign immunity of the State cannot be set up as a barrier to the obligation to pay the principal amount of the assessed \u00a7 1988 fees (the State in fact paid that amount), the immunity may be interposed with respect to interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This notion, if upheld, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>would reverse and put at naught the formidable lines of authority cited above. To support his proposition, the Commissioner has cited the case of <em>Library of Congress </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>478 U.S. 310 (1986) (6-3 decision). The Library as an agency of the United States was the defeated defendant in an action by a private person for job-related racial discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1974, which in \u00a7 706(k) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 [k] [Supp. IV 1974]) provides for \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs\u201d in favor of such a prevailing party. The Court held that the United States was not bound to pay pre-award interest forming part of a fee award pursuant to \u00a7 706(k).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This result followed from an iron bound \u201cno-interest rule\u201d (478 U.S. at 321-322) which had been notoriously in force for well over a century: the United States cannot be cast in interest, whether pre- or post-judgment, except by a Congressional enactment \u201caffirmatively and separately\u201d (478 U.S. at 315) prescribing that obligation. The Court would not indulge in considerations of policy: \u201cTheirs not to reason why.\u201d The Court virtually confesses the anomaly. It nowhere indicates that the States may now assert any similar immunity to interest on a fee award made pursuant to \u00a7 1988 or a similar enactment, and no inference to that effect would be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Second, failing reliance on the <em>Library of Congress </em>case, the Commissioner points to the administrative difficulty experienced by State officers in providing prompt payment of the award of fees herein as a reason for being excused the payment of interest during the period of delay. An affidavit of the deputy commissioner for accounts and Federal revenue of the finance division of the Department of Public Welfare, offered in apparent opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s application for payment of interest, stated that the court\u2019s order of June 13 awarding fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>was received in the legal division on June 20; prior to June 15 the affiant\u2019s office had notified the legal division that with the approaching end of fiscal year 1984, payment requests for services during that year must be made before June 15, otherwise checks could not be promised by June 30; separate accounts payable were set up by the Commonwealth for unpaid services and carried over to fiscal year 1985 and made available by July 9; the legal division made request to the affiant\u2019s office after July 9 for payment of the fees; the affiant was then on vacation; the request was processed commencing on August 28; usually three or four weeks intervene for clearance through the Department, the State Comptroller\u2019s office, and the Governor\u2019s Council before issuance of a check by the State Treasurer; and payment was made on September 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">For present purposes we need not question the efficiency of the process of securing official payment of the fee award in this case. The administrative steps may appear lumbering but they perhaps have some function in avoiding chicane or corruption. We think a court might well be sympathetic in a given case to a submission by the State that the obligation to pay a fee award should be postponed for a stated period \u2014 that there should be an interest-free interval \u2014 to allow for processing the payment. Such play in the joints does not appear incompatible with the federally imposed duty. Compare n. 7. We find evidence of a few suggestive arrangements for relief of this sort made by the courts at the time and as part of the awards of fees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We think a court may consider such proposals by State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>defendants when justified on the facts, kept within bounds, and not made a cover for indefinite protraction of the process which would diminish the value of the reasonable fees awarded. We stress, however, that any arrangement of the kind should be made at the time of the award. Less plausible is it for the State to attempt to plead excuse for late payment, as it did here, when no adjustment was provided in the award itself. This procedure is objectionable if for no other reason than that it invites evidence and counter evidence about just when the processing became unduly extended and the State became chargeable with interest. The unavoidable burden thrown on the courts to rule on applications for attorney\u2019s fees ought not be aggravated unnecessarily by that sort of inquiry.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\"> The mother testified, however, that her husband was unable to support Jason and compelling him to do so would put a strain on the marriage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\"> The ultimate reliance on State grounds does not render \u00a7 1988 inapplicable. <em>See Lund v.

In 1975, the Supreme Court in <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Soc., </em>421 U.S. 240, held that it was for Congress to designate when fee-shifting was appropriate. The amendment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 in 1976 was the Congressional response, filling the gap created by the <em>Alyeska </em>case.
