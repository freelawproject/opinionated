He was employed then by Anthony Manzo, at Ogden Suffolk Downs Race Track (the track) and was engaged in his duties in Manzo\u2019s barn on premises at and owned by the track. He was taken into custody there by a State trooper and others. They led him to a \u201ctack room\u201d. There he was searched and was accused by employees of the track and the State police of selling drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The foregoing circumstances are set forth (a) on the basis of allegations in Perez\u2019s substitute complaint in the Superior Court filed March 5, 1986, to which no answer until April 7, 1986, appears on the Superior Court docket,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (b) on various affidavits filed by Perez. The present proceeding before this court is on a petition for interlocutory relief under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par. and for an injunction under Mass.R.A.P. 6(a), as appearing in 378 Mass. 930 (1979). See <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 612-618 (1980). That petition recites that on February 27, 1986, a Superior Court judge denied Perez\u2019s prayer for a preliminary injunction restraining the Commission from interfering with his \u201cright to earn a living as an assistant trainer pending the resolution of the . . . action on the merits\u201d and, alternatively, pending appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The petition to this court essentially incorporates by reference Perez\u2019s substitute complaint in the Superior Court and an affidavit of Perez, dated merely \u201cthis day of February ,1986.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Little information is afforded (in addition to that stated in the first paragraph of this opinion), except that the substitute complaint alleges (par. 12) that among Perez\u2019s \u201ceffects seized . . . was a list of names with dollar amounts next to . . . [the] names\u201d and (par. 13) that \u201c[o]n the basis of . . . [that] list of names\u201d he \u201cwas permanently ejected from the grounds of the . . . [t]rack, without a hearing, by an order of the . . . State Police acting under the authority of [t]he Commission.\u201d The petition to this court further recites that Perez claimed an appeal to the Commission for the track\u2019s order of ejectment, that the Commission denied his appeal, that, by way of the substitute complaint, Perez sought judicial review in the Superior Court of the Commission\u2019s order and a preliminary injunction, and that the Superior Court motion judge denied a preliminary injunction. See also note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The petition now before us then proceeds somewhat vaguely to allege that it was error not to grant the preliminary injunction because the Commission\u2019s decision (a) was based on illegally seized evidence which should have been suppressed, (b) was unsupported by substantial evidence, and (c) \u201cwas based upon unlawful procedure as [t]he Commission was the only available body\u201d to hear both the motion to suppress and the case on the merits. The substitute complaint also asserts that a regulation promulgated by the Commission (see note 5, infra) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">1. <em>Pertinent Statutes and Regulations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">General Laws c. 128 A provides for strict regulation of horse and dog racing in Massachusetts. The original 1934 statute (St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>1934, c. 374, \u00a7 3) was revised considerably by St. 1978, c. 494. See <em>Catrone </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 484, 486-487 &amp; n.3 (1984), in which is quoted the strong declaration of policy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> set out in \u00a7 1 of the 1978 revision. The revision substantially strengthened the Commission\u2019s power and ability to control horse racing in the public interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Chapter 128A, \u00a7 9, has, since 1934, given to the Commission \u201cfull power to prescribe rules, regulations and conditions under which all horse . . . races at horse . . . racing meetings shall be conducted.\u201d Section 9 also provides that \u201cany person violating any . . . regulation shall, upon a complaint brought by the commission, be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.\u201d Other provisions affecting regulations are set out in \u00a7\u00a7 9A and 9B.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The Commission has promulgated a regulation, 205 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.17(27) (1985), which is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>2. <em>The Statutory Policy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The broad aspects of the public interest which support close regulation of horse racing with pari-mutuel betting were stated in <em>Colella v. State Racing Commn., </em>360 Mass. 152,159(1971): \u201cThe Legislature recognized the existence of . . . dangers [\u2018inherent in any gambling operation of such proportions\u2019] unless the racing meetings were strictly governed and controlled by rules covering the many details which the statute did not cover. It contemplated that the Commission would be best equipped to supervise the racing operations, and it gave the Commission the very broad powers necessary to accomplish the purpose.\u201d In <em>Fioravanti </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn. </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 299, 305 (1978), it was said, \u201cIn testing the constitutionality of a [Commission] regulation . . ., all rational presumptions are made in favor of the validity of the regulation. It will be struck down only if it \u2018cannot be supported upon any rational basis of fact that reasonably can be conceived to sustain it.\u2019 . . . Horse racihg accompanied by gambling is particularly susceptible to fraud and corruption. The Legislature has recognized these dangers and has given broad powers to the commission to control racing operations strictly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Regulations of the Commission<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> have been sustained in a variety of circumstances. In the <em>Colella </em>case, 360 Mass. at 155-159, a rule regulating the fees paid to jockeys in the absence of special agreement was sustained. In the <em>Fioravanti </em>case, 6 Mass. App. Ct. at 302-305, this court sustained a rule making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>a horse trainer \u201cresponsible for the presence of prohibited articles [there drugs for horses] . . . without regard to his knowledge of their presence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302. In the <em>Catrone </em>case, 17 Mass. App. Ct. at 491, the same race track involved in this case was sustained in excluding (as a matter of business judgment) under the Commission\u2019s statutes and regulations, a licensed trainer from racing because he \u201chad been at or dangerously near situations which reasonably could be thought to have been detrimental to good racing standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">3. <em>Effect of Licensee\u2019s Conduct on Public Interest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">We approach this case with recognition that the Legislature for a long time has tried to ensure that horse racing will be conducted lawfully and in a manner which will encourage public confidence. The Commission and any licensed private entity engaged in running a race track (see the <em>Catrone </em>case, 17 Mass. App. Ct. at 490-493) reasonably could conclude, as a matter of business judgment, that the unlawful distribution of drugs (either for human use, or for use on horses, see, 128A, \u00a7 13B) by licensees working at a race track inevitably would be highly detrimental to racing. In other jurisdictions, race track stewards or other officials have been upheld in enforcing comparable rules or regulations designed to prevent harmful conduct by licensees. See <em>Shoemaker </em>v. <em>Handel, </em>795 F. 2d 1136, 1142-1144 (3d Cir. 1986, breathalyzer and other testing of jockeys, and random selection of trainers for other tests); <em>Pullin </em>v. <em>Louisiana State Racing Commn., 477 </em>So.2d 683 (La. 1985), <em>S.C, </em>somewhat revised, 484 So.2d 105 (La. 1986); <em>Delguidice </em>v. <em>New Jersey Racing Commn., </em>100 N.J. 79 (1985); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania State Horse Racing Commn., </em>68 Pa. Commw. 353 (1982). See also <em>Lanchester </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania State Horse Racing Commn., </em>16 Pa. Commw. Ct. 85, 93 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">4. <em>Aspects of the Request for Preliminary Injunction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Perez, on the basis of allegations in his substitute complaint and affidavits, seeks an injunction under the first paragraph of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, a matter essentially discretionary. See <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. at 612-618. That case states standards for action by a trial judge (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>a single justice of this court) in deciding whether preliminary injunctive relief should be afforded. Such a judge should consider, among other matters, whether the grant or denial of preliminary relief, if warranted at all, is more likely to cause irreparable harm to one or the other of the contending parties. Perez here has not established a record making it appropriate for us to hold that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial judge (and the single justice) to deny a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Perez, in effect, makes a general attack on 205 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.17(27) (1985) as inherently violating constitutional restraints on searches of individual persons. Enough has been said above to make it plain that horse racing (when conducted with pari-mutuel betting) is a strictly and pervasively regulated occupation. An administrative search in a closely regulated occupation (there the drug industry and the sale of drugs) was dealt with in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lipomi, </em>385 Mass. 370, 375-385 (1982). For that case, apparently on a full record of proceedings in the Superior Court and during the administrative search (at 371-372, 376-377, especially nn.3-5), the court (with two Justices dissenting) affirmed the suppression of items seized in the search. What is said in the majority opinion shows that every purported broad authority to conduct warrantless searches (there G. L. c. 13, \u00a7 25) is likely to be scrutinized with great care in its application to any particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The <em>Lipomi </em>decision (at 378-380) reviewed pertinent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, especially <em>Colonnade Catering Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 72 (1970), <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biswell, </em>406 U.S. 311 (1972), and <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>452 U.S. 594 (1981). It was concluded<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>that the combined effect of these and other Federal decisions</p>\n<p id=\"A9G\">was that \u201ca warrant may not be constitutionally required when [the Legislature] has reasonably determined that warrantless searches are necessary to further a regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lipomi, </em>385 Mass. at 380, quoting from <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>452 U.S. at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Perez contends that \u00a7 4.17(27) does not meet the requirements of the <em>Lipomi </em>case (see the quotation in note 7, <em>supra) </em>and the Supreme Court cases just mentioned (a) because it is a regulation and not a statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (b) because it imposes, as a condition of being a licensee of the Commission, an unconstitutional requirement of consent to any search permissible under \u00a7 4.17(27).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A further and related contention by Perez\u2019s counsel is that \u00a7 4.17(27) and c. 128A as a whole do not sufficiently limit the time, place, and scope of warrantless searches. See the discussion in the <em>Lipomi </em>case, 385 Mass. at 382-383.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>All the contentions advanced in behalf of Perez, however, fall far short of showing abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge and the single justice in denying preliminary injunctive relief. The problems are discussed by Perez\u2019s counsel in a vacuum (without any detailed record of underlying facts and without the complete administrative record before the Commission, see, e.g,. note 1, supra) on the basis of pleadings and affidavits in large measure stated as conclusions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The record does not furnish the facts to make possible (a) a determination of the extent (if at all) \u00a7 14.17(27) was employed, or (b) any interpretation of the regulation to bring it within limits suggested by the decided cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The record does show that Perez was a high school graduate (and thus potentially employable in a number of occupations), but the judges who denied preliminary injunctive relief were given little other information concerning the hardship to Perez likely to result from denial of that relief. They were warranted fully in recognizing the substantial countervailing public interest considerations, e.g., the importance to the racing industry and to public confidence in its avoiding any suspicion or any appearance of participation by Perez, a licensee, in unlawful drug distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>We hold that, in the absence of a substantially more complete record, Perez has not shown an abuse of discretion by the trial judge or by the single justice in denying a preliminary injunction. They were amply justified in deciding that (even if the record\u2019s deficiencies may be cured at a trial on the merits) they should not consider, at a preliminary stage and on an inadequate record, important issues possibly of constitutional dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\n<em>Order denying preliminary injunctive relief affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> The present record does not contain (a) the original complaint filed in the Superior Court on February 28, 1986, or the answer thereto, (b) the transcript of a hearing on February 12, 1986, before the Commission, at which it appears from the denial (on February 21) of Perez\u2019s appeal to it, evidence was received, or (c) the transcript of any other hearing before the Commission, the Superior Court, or the single justice of this court. In the course of proceedings before the Commission (to obtain a reversal of an order of the track and the State police, acting for the Commission, permanently ejecting Perez from the track), Perez filed a motion to suppress articles taken from his person when he was searched. That motion, which does appear in the record, was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\"> A single justice of this court denied a preliminary injunction, so far as such relief was sought pursuant to the first paragraph of c. 231, \u00a7 118. He denied also the relief requested under Mass.R.A.P. \u00a7 6(a). In addition, however, he ordered that the clerk of the Superior Court \u201cforthwith assemble the record of . . . [Perez\u2019s] appeal pursuant to . . . [par. 2 of] \u00a7 118\u201d and that the appeal be \u201ctentatively scheduled for the June/September list for oral argument.\u201d We interpret this order as a direction that denial of relief by the Superior Court judge be considered by a panel of this court. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>by no means sure that this order amounts to a \u201creport\u201d to a panel by the single justice of his own denial of a preliminary injunction and of the similar action by the trial judge. See the <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>case, 380 Mass. at 614. Nevertheless, as the matter has been fully briefed and argued, we consider the matter as a reported denial of a preliminary injunction by the trial judge and, in connection therewith, the similar denial by the single justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> That declaration stated that one purpose of the revision was \u201cto instill public confidence in the integrity of the sport.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\"> Among further powers given to the Commission by the present form of c. 128A are: <em>\u00a7 </em>7, the power to appoint one steward to each licensed track and one or more representatives to attend each licensed racing meeting with access to specified books and papers and \u201cfull and free access\u201d to premises used in connection with racing; 5 <em>8, </em>the power to obtain the assignment of police officers (to be under \u201cthe operational authority of the [Cjommission\u201d) and to employ various technicians, veterinarians etc.; <em>\u00a7 </em>9, to enable the Commission \u201cto exercise ... a proper control over . . . racing,\u201d the power to prescribe under \u00a7 9 \u201crules, regulations and conditions\u201d for licensing various persons, including \u201cowners, trainers, jockeys and stable employees at horse tracks,\u201d who shall be fingerprinted and required to \u201cwear a badge containing a photograph,\u201d and also to provide for the suspension and revocation of such licenses; and <em>\u00a7 10A, </em>the power to exclude (subject to appeal to the Commission) from the track premises or eject \u201cany person whose presence ... is detrimental, in the sole judgment of . . .

Every licensed person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>or person permitted to pursue his/her occupation or employment within the grounds of any association by accepting his/her license or such permission does thereby irrevocably consent to such search as aforesaid and waive and release all claims or possible actions for damages that he/she may have by virtue of any action taken under this rule.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b292-12\"> In <em>Bay State Harness Horse Racing &amp; Breeding Assn. </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>342 Mass. 694, 698-700 (1961), it was assumed that, in framing regulations under c. 128A, \u00a7 9, the Commission would be required \u201cto apply general standards of public interest, convenience, and necessity, similar to those which have been sometimes implied in the regulation of public utilities.\u201d It was also assumed that the statute (and the regulations pursuant to it) should be so interpreted \u201cas to avoid serious doubts about. . .

The presence of this factor insures that warrantless inspection will pose only a minimal threat to justifiable expectations of privacy. Second, warrantless inspection must be a crucial part of a regulatory scheme designed to further an urgent [governmental] interest. And third, the inspection must be conducted in accord with a <em>statutorily authorized </em>procedure, itself carefully limited as to time, place, and scope. The presence of this factor guards against the possibility that any inspection right will be abused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lipomi, </em>385 Mass. at 380, quoting from <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>Hertzler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>Enterprises, Inc., </em>418 F.
