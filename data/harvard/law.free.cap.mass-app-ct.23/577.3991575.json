We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">On August 19, 1985, the defendant occupied an apartment under a written lease in the plaintiffs\u2019 185-unit development. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The development is financed by the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency. Living with her were her two sons, David, age sixteen and Raphael, age fifteen. Sometime about 1:30 p.m. on that day, while the defendant was at work, Raphael broke and entered into a neighbor\u2019s apartment and stole a videocassette recorder and some money. The neighbor was not at home at the time, but the event was witnessed by another resident of the complex, who was able to identify the defendant\u2019s sons. David was apparently with his brother, Raphael, although it is not clear from the evidence whether David entered the apartment. David apparently tried twice before the burglary, and once afterwards, to reach his mother by telephone, but he was unable to speak to her. The videocassette recorder was recovered from the defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The victim of the burglary suffered from lupus and multiple sclerosis. She indicated that \u201c [a]s a result of [the] incident I am constantly worried and my health is declining.\u201d She also \u201cquestioned whether] I should move,\u201d stating that \u201cI become emotionally upset when I leave the house and see the people who are responsible for breaking into my home.\u201d There was also evidence that other residents expressed fears for their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The defendant apologized and offered to pay for the damage. She also indicated to the victim and to management that if they pressed charges she \u201cwould be glad to go down to the juvenile court and do whatever had to be done.\u201d When management failed to do so, the defendant obtained a complaint against Raphael as a delinquent child, and a juvenile court committed him to the Division of Youth Services (D.Y.S.) until his eighteenth birthday. A few weeks after his commitment, Raphael was hospitalized for a ruptured appendix. After leaving the hospital, he returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment to recuperate while being watched by his twenty-one year old sister. When he was able to walk, the defendant called D.Y.S. and had him returned to custody. David continues to live in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The plaintiffs sent the defendant notice of termination of her lease for \u201cfailing to live in a peaceful way respecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>rights of other residents to privacy, security, and peaceful enjoyment as provided in Paragraph F. 2 of your lease.\u201d Paragraph F. 14 of the lease extends this obligation to \u201cmembers of [the rjesident\u2019s household.\u201d Pursuant to MHFA requirements (spelled out in the lease), a conference was held to decide whether the plaintiffs would be permitted to proceed with eviction. The conference report, admitted in evidence, indicated that D.Y.S. could not guarantee a permanent setting outside the home for Raphael. In authorizing the eviction, the officer who conducted the hearing concluded that Raphael has no \u201cpemanent setting\u201d and that \u201c[hjis behavior represents a threat to the safety and well-being of the residents at Greenhill Towers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The judge found that both of the defendant\u2019s sons were involved in the incident, although he found Raphael to have been the principal wrongdoer. He considered the standards in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, supra, </em>to be applicable to this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge noted that \u201cthe court has no evidence before it of previous acts of wrongdoing affecting other \u2018residents\u2019 in the complex.\u201d He also noted his view that \u201cas grave as this incident is, it must be viewed as an isolated one and not foreseeable.\u201d The judge concluded that since \u201cthe defendant has taken steps to remove the primary offender from the premises and has stated her firm will that he not return to the premises if he should be released from custody,\u201d the plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment for possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>When a tenant in a multifamily development is charged with interfering with the quiet enjoyment and safety of other residents by reason of a crime, \u201ccause\u201d requires that the owner show' an act sufficient to justify eviction committed by the tenant or a member of the tenant\u2019s household, and \u201csome connection between the tenant and the conduct underlying the termination.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. at 264. However, the owner is not required to present affirmative proof that the tenant had reason to know of the family member\u2019s criminal propensities and was unable to control the conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 265. The owner has the benefit of an \u201cinference . . . that the tenant is aware of potential problems, and able to exercise some influence or otherwise prevent violent and destructive conduct on the premises.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>To \u201cnegate the inference,\u201d the tenant must show \u201cthat she could [not] have averted the lease violation. In other words, if the tenant can show that she could not have foreseen and prevented her son\u2019s violence, there is no \u2018cause\u2019 to evict her.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Spence </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 489 (1983). As we understood these standards, the existence of the inference required the defendant in this case to prove one of three circumstances: (1) that she could not have foreseen her son\u2019s commission of the break-in and theft; (2) that even though she might have foreseen the crime she could not have prevented its occurrence; or (3) that although she foresaw the crime she took reasonable measures to prevent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We can discern no evidence sufficient to support a finding that the defendant met one of these three circumstances. The defendant did not identify any considerations such as a \u201cprior record of good conduct, that might have made [her son\u2019s criminal] conduct unforeseeable.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. at 265-266. Nor does the fact that the defendant was at work when the incident happened, and unable to be reached by telephone, establish that the incident was not foreseeable or, if foreseeable, that it could not have been prevented. Most criminal or disobedient acts by juveniles are done outside their parents\u2019 presence. To find this type of evidence sufficient to negate the inference would create a loophole which we do not think was intended by the Supreme Judicial Court. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>that the defendant acted promptly in having Raphael committed to D.Y.S. does not provide a basis for concluding that she might have foreseen the conduct and did what she could to prevent it. If anything, this fact may tend to establish the opposite inference \u2014 that there had been known prior difficulties but that no serious effort had been made to control the difficulties through counselling, substitute care, or other forms of aid until something very serious occurred that called for drastic action. Indeed, the fact that the defendant was convinced that Raphael was solely responsible, even though the witness to the incident implicated her other son as well, is some indication that the defendant had knowledge of Raphael\u2019s propensities. The parent-child relationship is precisely the sort of relationship that gives rise to \u201cthe natural inference that the tenant is aware of and able to prevent potential misconduct\u201d and which places on the tenant, in an action such as this, the obligation \u201cto prove otherwise.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. at 272-273.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In the defendant\u2019s favor, there was evidence that she was embarrassed, that she knew Raphael was wrong, that she had taught her children the difference between right and wrong, and that she felt that she should not be blamed for the incident because \u201cI can\u2019t be with my children twenty-four hours a day.\u201d She also testified that she had arranged for Raphael to live in New York with his grandmother when he was released from D.Y.S. But this evidence is not sufficient, in our view, to satisfy her burden of proof. What is missing \u2014 and it is critical in this case \u2014 is some proof that this was a first-time incident or, if not the first incident, that the defendant had acted decisively and effectively to prevent a recurrence and that Raphael\u2019s act was for that reason unforeseeable. It was the defendant\u2019s obligation to provide that proof and without it the judge\u2019s finding that the \u201cincident . . must be viewed as an isolated one and not foreseeable\u201d cannot stand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>We recognize, as did the judge, that <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, supra, </em>and <em>Spence v. O\u2019Brien, supra, </em>involved situations where there was evidence of knowledge by the tenants of prior bad acts by persons living with them. As we read those cases, however, we do not view that consideration as important in this case. The flaw in the trial judge\u2019s decision is his apparent reversal of the burden of proof, that error leading to his ultimate conclusion that the absence of evidence of other prior acts of wrongdoing by the defendant\u2019s sons established that the incident could not have been foreseen or prevented. It was the defendant\u2019s burden to adduce such evidence, not the plaintiff\u2019s, and none was introduced. The other arguments made by the defendant were answered adversely to her in the <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The judgment is reversed. A new judgment is to be entered awarding possession to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\"> The plaintiffs argue that the <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley </em>\u201ccause\u201d requirements does not apply to their housing development but applies only where a government agency charged with administering public housing, such as a housing authority, has brought an eviction action. They rely on the fact that the record does not clearly show that the development in which the defendant lived is subsidized by public agencies to the point where regulations governing public housing developments should apply to the eviction of tenants. See, e.g., <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Henry Phipps Plaza South, Inc., </em>498 F.2d 937 (2d Cir. 1974). We need not decide the question because counsel for the plaintiffs did not object when the <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley </em>decision was brought to the judge\u2019s attention, and accepted by him, as the controlling precedent. An issue not properly raised in the trial court cannot ordinarily be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Stigmatine Fathers </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>369 Mass. 562,565 (1976). See also <em>Dominick v. Dominick, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 93 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-6\"> There was information in the plaintiff\u2019s answers to two of the defendant\u2019s interrogatories which might have assisted the defendant in negating the inference. The answers, however, were not introduced in evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>cannot be considered. See Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 33.6, at 324 (1975). Also, the fact that the defendant appeared pro se cannot provide a basis to overlook important deficiencies in the evidence. See <em>Mmoe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 617, 620 (1985), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> The parties have not, quite properly, made us aware of any change in the defendant\u2019s situation since the trial. In any event, the owner is entitled to possession if, at the time of the eviction hearing, it was entitled to judgment for possession. \u201c[D]ue process inevitably entails some delay between the conduct claimed by the landlord to warrant termination of a tenancy and the decision whether termination is justified. ... If ... the [defendant\u2019s] boys have reformed [or] . . . can be kept away, this is all to the good. . . . But if [the landlord] was entitled to serve its notice of termination . . . due process does not require .. . [consideration] of improved conduct during the period consumed by the hearing ... [or by the appellate] proceedings which [the tenant] initiated.\u201d <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Henry Phipps Plaza South, Inc., </em>498 F.2d at 945-946.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
