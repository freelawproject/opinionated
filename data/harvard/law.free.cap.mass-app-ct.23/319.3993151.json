He was convicted of armed robbery and one count of aggravated rape (natural sexual intercourse) and acquitted of the other count of aggravated rape (unnatural sexual intercourse). He contends that the judge erred in (1) restricting his cross-examination of the complainant and (2) denying the jury\u2019s request to review the complainant\u2019s testimony. He also claims that the prosecutor misstated the law in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The complainant testified to the following facts. In Boston, shortly before 3:00 a.m. on November 15,1982, the complainant flagged a cab driven by the defendant. The complainant, who had been working as a prostitute that night, wanted to return to her home in Roxbury. She and the defendant struck a deal, bartering sexual favors for transportation. She agreed to perform fellatio on the defendant in exchange for the ride home. She got into the front seat and gave him directions to her residence. However, he deviated from the route that she gave him, pulled a knife out, and threatened to stab her if she disobeyed him. He then drove the cab to a location on Columbus Avenue, where he parked behind a building. He ordered her to perform fellatio on him. He held the knife to her stomach, he then forced her to submit to an act of natural intercourse. The defendant then demanded that the complainant give him two gold chains which she had around her neck and one that was braided in her hair. When she refused, he put the knife to her stomach and reiterated his demand. He snatched the chains from her and put two of them around his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Within a minute or two, a police car drove up alongside the cab and stopped. The defendant threatened to kill the complainant if she made any complaint. One of the officers asked the defendant if everything was all right. He assured the officers that all was well. As the police car started to leave, the officers saw the complainant \u201cshaking her head \u2018no.\u2019\u201d The police car stopped, and both officers got out and approached the cab, at which point the complainant jumped out and ran toward them. She then accused the defendant of rape and robbery. The police found an open knife on the floor of the cab. They also removed the chains from the defendant\u2019s neck. They found the third chain in the defendant\u2019s pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The defendant contradicted the complainant\u2019s testimony on several points. He testified that the complainant consented to have intercourse for $25 and a ride home. He parked the cab where she directed, and they engaged in intercourse. He stated that he and the complainant were each wearing a gold chain, that she tried his chain on, and then he put hers on his neck. He was still wearing both chains when the police arrived. He denied robbing the complainant or threatening her with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">1. <em>Restriction of complainant\u2019s cross-examination. </em>Prior to trial, defense counsel had obtained the criminal records of the complainant. They consisted of five prior convictions for various minor offenses. The records indicated that she had defaulted on numerous occasions on the charges. During the cross-examination of the complainant, defense counsel attempted to show that she was in default on a pending criminal charge at the time she complained to the police that she had been robbed and raped. The prosecutor objected after the complainant had responded,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the judge sustained the objection. At a side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>bar conference, defense counsel explained that evidence of the complainant\u2019s status as a defaulter at the time of the incident complained of was probative as to a motive to fabricate her accusations against the defendant. The judge again refused to allow cross-examination of the complainant as to the defaults.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The certified records of the complainant\u2019s prior convictions were admitted as exhibits, and they showed numerous defaults, including the fact that she was in default at the time she made the accusations against the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In his closing argument to the jury, defense counsel referred to the complainant\u2019s record as providing a motive for her to fabricate an accusation in order to avoid prosecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He mentioned the complainant\u2019s defaults (\u201cwarrants\u201d) and urged the jury to consider her \u201csuspendeds [szc], probations\u201d in light of her possible motive to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The defendant argues that the judge committed prejudicial error in not permitting him to inquire into whether the complainant was in default at the time she made a complaint of robbery and rape against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u201cA defendant has the <em>right </em>to bring to the jury\u2019s attention any \u2018circumstance which may materially affect\u2019 the testimony of an adverse witness which might lead the jury to find that the witness is under an \u2018influence to prevaricate\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 229 (1981). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frey, </em>390 Mass. 245, 250 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>384 Mass. 377, 380 (1981). Even when the witness in question is the complainant in a rape case, where evidence of prior sexual acts would normally be barred, the defendant\u2019s right to show a motive to make a false accusation takes preference over the shield afforded to the complainant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. at 228-229. Here, defense counsel sought to introduce evidence that the complainant had a criminal case pending at the time she made the accusations against the defendant, and also that a default warrant had issued. Defense counsel made it clear to the judge that this evidence was offered to establish that the complainant had a possible motive to fabricate her accusations against the defendant. \u201cThe right to cross-examine a complainant in a rape case to show a false accusation may be the last refuge of an innocent defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229. The exclusion of the evidence was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The Commonwealth argues, however, that in this case the judge\u2019s error was harmless. <em>See Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 681 (1986). It bases its argument on the ground that \u201cthe information the defendant unsuccessfully sought to elicit on cross-examination reached the jury through other means.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>393 Mass. 824, 831 (1985). We agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In the instant case, the jury had before it certified copies of the complainant\u2019s criminal records which showed not only that she had incurred numerous defaults, but also that there was a default warrant outstanding on a pending criminal case at the time she made the accusations against the defendant. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>defense counsel was permitted to refer to the numerous defaults and the pending criminal case during his closing argument (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>and argue that the complainant had ample reason to fabricate her accusations against the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the jury could consider in its deliberations whether the pending criminal case and the outstanding warrants caused the complainant to fabricate her accusations against the defendant. Because information equivalent to that which was erroneously ruled to be inadmissible was communicated to the jury, we hold that the error was harmless. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNickles, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 114, 118 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>370 Mass. 548,572, cert, denied, 429 U.S. 943 (1976) (no error to exclude questions regarding witness\u2019s motive to seek government favor where his plea agreement with prosecution was recounted to the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">2. <em>Denial of jury\u2019s request to review complainant\u2019s testimony. </em>The jury, after deliberating for about one and a half hours, sent the judge a note asking, among other things, \u201cCan we please review [the complainant\u2019s] testimony concerning this case?\u201d The judge denied their request and told them that in relatively short cases, such as the one they were deciding, the court typically did not allow jurors to review the testimony. In addition, the judge instructed the jury that they would have to rely on whatever they could recollect of the evidence. There was no objection to the judge\u2019s decision by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The defendant contends that the judge based his decision on the ground that he did not have discretion to grant the jury\u2019s request. A review of the judge\u2019s words to the jury demonstrates that he believed that he had discretion but did not care to exercise it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 274, 283 (1986). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buiel, </em>391 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Mass. 744, 745 &amp; n.l (1984), where the judge informed the jury that an instruction on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify was mandated by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The judge\u2019s action in denying the jury\u2019s request to review the complainant\u2019s testimony was not an abuse of discretion. The discretion to permit the reading of a witness\u2019s testimony to the jury during its deliberations should be exercised with caution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 405 (1982). \u201cThe reading of testimony may indeed overemphasize certain aspects of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, \u201c[ljeaving the jury to resort to their collective memories was, in the circumstances, a correct exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 217, 224 (1984), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 106, 109 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">3. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>In his argument, the prosecutor stated that the defendant could be convicted of rape if he ejaculated against the complainant\u2019s wishes, even though penetration was consensual. No objection to the argument or request for a curative instmction was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In his charge to the jury, the judge stated that he would instruct them as to the applicable law. He carefully outlined, in detail, each element of the crime of rape. He specifically told them that they must find nonconsensual penetration and that it was not necessary that ejaculation take place. There was no objection to any part of the instruction on rape and no request for a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Any harm to the defendant resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of law was cured by the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>386 Mass. 593, 602 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Szczuka, </em>391 Mass. 666, 673-674 (1984). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Killelea, </em>370 Mass. 638, 645-646 (1976) (judge\u2019s instructions fell short of curing prejudice caused by prosecutor\u2019s gross misstatement of law, requiring reversal). Although there was neither an objection nor a request for a curative instruction, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lussier, </em>364 Mass. 414,424-425 (1973); compare <em>Killelea, supra, </em>the trial judge \u201camply resolved any confusion [the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>statement] might have caused.\u201d <em>Atkins, </em>386 Mass. at 602. The judge not only told the jury that he would instruct them on the applicable law, see <em>Szczuka, </em>391 Mass. at 673-674, but dealt specifically with the requirement of nonconsensual penetration. Therefore, any error was not \u201cof a type and seriousness which should lead [the court] to reverse in the absence of a proper [objection].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 16 (1986), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We have examined the other issues raised by the defendant as to the prosecutor\u2019s conduct at trial and other statements in his closing argument. They are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\"> The transcript shows the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u201cQ.

No defaults. Is that a conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">[Defense counsel]: Yes, it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-19\">[The judge]: Well, put it in as a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-20\">[Defense counsel]: All right. I\u2019ll introduce it as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-21\">Q. Do you remember this case at all?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-22\">A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-23\">Q.

The question, however, was never answered, and the line of questioning was not pursued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> The admission of such unexpurgated records as exhibits was error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>397 Mass. 298, 300 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u201cNow, the police officers arrive. . . . \u2018[W]e saw a cab, and, gee, it was out of place.

See, I wasn\u2019t introducing these things to show you that she\u2019s a prostitute. She admits that. She has something to gain. Liberty. Liberty. Check it out. You look at the convictions.

I don\u2019t have to talk about her morality but certainly she must have had some reason for her actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">it</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">\u201cI expect that at some point [the prosecutor] is going to ask you in a rhetorical fashion, \u2018Well, if this didn\u2019 t happen, why did she come to court?\u2019 \u201cWhenever somebody mentions that upstairs, please, <em>check out these suspendeds, probations, think about it. </em>She has a lot to gain by coming. A lot. Just like she had a lot to gain by accusing him on that evening.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> We note that the judge did not totally foreclose exploration of the complainant\u2019s possible motive to fabricate because of her court involvement at the time that she made the accusations against the defendant. Although he excluded cross-examination as to the complainant\u2019s defaults, he overruled the prosecutor\u2019s objection to a question as to her probationary status (see note 2, <em>supra). </em>The fact that defense counsel failed to pursue the issue of the complainant\u2019s probationary status \u201ccannot be attributed to an error by the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 114,118(1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
