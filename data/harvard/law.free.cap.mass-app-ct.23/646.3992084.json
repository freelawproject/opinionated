Realty Trust. For convenience the Hood Corporation and the realty trust are treated as one entity and referred to as Hood because they appear to have the same interests. Hood had undertaken its enterprise with the encouragement of the then mayor of Leominster and of the regional chamber of commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b667-6\">Cutter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"azs-dedup-1\">Hood Industries, Inc. (Hood), is a manufacturer of polyurethane foam and products fabricated from the foam. B.G.H. Realty Trust owns about 403,000 square feet of land (the locus) in Leominster in an industrial zone (where the manufacture of foam is permitted as of right). Hood occupies a building on the locus with a floor area of about 240,000 square feet. Hood plans to use the building on the locus for its manufacturing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">There had been issued to Hood by the Leominster fire department prior to June 24, 1985, a permit to store not more than 1,665 gallons of class C liquids as defined in regulations of the Board of Fire Prevention Regulations (G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 14), found in 527 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 14.02-14.03 (1981), including Toluene Diisocyanate (T.D.I.), with a flash point of over 187 degrees Fahrenheit and therefore regarded as a relatively low fire risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Hood applied to the Leominster city council (the city\u2019s licensing body for this purpose, see G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1953, c. 230, \u00a7 1, defining \u201clocal licensing authority\u201d) for a license to store substantially larger amounts (45,600 gallons for the present) of class C fluids. All procedural preliminary formalities were complied with so that a hearing on the application (endorsed in behalf of the city\u2019s fire department) was held before the legal affairs committee of the council on June 24, 1985. At this hearing a variety of witnesses spoke against the license stirred by widespread local opposition to the storage of T.D.I. on the locus, to the toxic character (with various serious health risks) of T.D.I., and to the risk of spills when chemicals and products were being taken to the locus.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Much was made of the circumstance that the locus was not far from a \u201cheavy\u201d residential area and from a nursing home and a school. There was reference in the hearing to what was represented as Hood\u2019s allegedly poor \u201ctrack record\u201d at its plant in another community. Counsel for the objectors said in his opening to the committee, \u201cThere is more than just flammables <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>involved here. We are involved with the storage of toxic dangerous chemicals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The legal affairs committee voted informally to report to the council adversely to Hood\u2019s application. The chairman of the legal affairs committee so reported and the full council voted unanimously to deny the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Hood then brought in the Superior Court an action in the nature of certiorari. See G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4; Mass.R.Civ.P. 81(b), 365 Mass. 841 (1974). This was heard on November 20 and 22, 1985, before a Superior Court judge. He made findings on February 25, 1986, affirming the city council decision to deny the requested license. Hood appealed. Hood\u2019s motions to amend the findings were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The principal contention made by Hood before us is that the city council was not authorized under G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 13, to consider any issues other than that of the flammability of the class C substances to be stored by Hood and the danger of fire which would result from the storage of these substances in the quantities for which a license was requested. For essentially the reasons stated by the trial judge (and largely on decided cases cited by him) we affirm his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The judge found the facts essentially as already stated in this opinion. He had before him at least the portions of the transcript of the hearing before the city council and its legal affairs committee which appear in the record furnished to this court by Hood\u2019s counsel. He listed (as we have done) considerations which he recognized the council (\u201ca political body\u201d) took into account in its consideration of Hood\u2019s application, and which entered into the council\u2019s ultimate vote. He concluded that there was nothing \u201carbitrary, whimsical[,] or capricious about the . . . denial of [Hood\u2019s] application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">The judge also found no \u201cevidence that . . . [Hood was] treated unequally under the law. There are other plastic fabricators in the same area where . . . [Hood is] located. Although many of them store liquids which are rated as class A [more flammable than class C] chemicals, this application . . . was the first of its kind for the storage of this chemical of the class C variety. . . . [S]ome council members inspected the . . . [Hood] facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>The judge found further that the record did not disclose \u201cany confusion on the part of the members of the city council or on the part of any municipal officials reporting to them.\u201d For the \u201cmembers [of the council] to consider constituent input and opinion is not contrary to the law. . . . There is no evidence here that the hearings were abbreviated\u201d or that the council members were \u201cimproperly predisposed to deny the license sought by\u201d Hood. \u201c[Mjembers of the [c]ouncil were investigating the subject matter of the application weeks before . . . the hearings. At least one council member was disposed against the application before the hearings commenced.\u201d On the night of the hearings he cast his vote to deny the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">On these findings the judge correctly ruled that it was not improper for members of the council \u201cto seek information outside ... the formal hearing, [citing <em>Craven </em>v. <em>State Ethics Commn., </em>390 Mass. 191, 196-199 (1983)] or to be sensitive to constituents\u2019 pressures or to come to the hearing with a preference as long as no improper motivation such as extraordinary allegiance or monetary gain is present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The judge concluded reasonably that the council had the benefit of a presumption that they were acting honestly and with appropriate motives. See <em>Foster from Gloucester, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 284, 293-294 (1980). Examination of the hearing transcript does not indicate that counsel for Hood were refused permission to present any testimony or arguments which they wished to offer, or that they objected to any testimony which was offered by others, or that they sought to cross-examine any witnesses opposing the license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hood\u2019s principal representative was afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>opportunity for rebuttal and to answer questions from various council members. We perceive, in the circumstances, no conduct on the part of the council sufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The judge also concluded that the council\u2019s action was supported by sufficient evidence and was neither arbitrary nor capricious. In respect of fire prevention, the breadth (a) of a licensing power of this type and (b) of the considerations which may be brought to bear on the licensing body are illustrated by the following decisions. See <em>Scudder </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Sandwich, </em>309 Mass. 373, 376-377 (1941, \u201cpublic interest\u201d); <em>Kidder </em>v. <em>City Council of Brockton, </em>329 Mass. 288, 290-291 (1952, traffic congestion); <em>Johnson Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Medford, </em>353 Mass. 540, 543 (1968, \u201cthe somewhat wide discretion given to the licensing authority extends beyond . . . fire risk and involves other [public interest] considerations\u201d and testimony under oath is not required), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 392 U.S. 296 (1968); <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Chelsea, </em>361 Mass. 802, 806-808 (1972, discussion of the breadth of discretion of the licensing authority); <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Duxbury, </em>358 Mass. 64 (1970, residential area, narrow street, traffic congestion). See and compare <em>E.A.D. Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Shrewsbury, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 826, 827-828 (1978), and cases cited. See also <em>St. James Bldg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Safety, </em>260 Mass. 548, 552-556 (1927), and the general discussion in <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 51-59 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">We perceive no inconsistency in the conclusion which we reach with <em>Tebo </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Shrewsbury, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 618, 626-631, further appellate review granted, 398 Mass. 1105 (1986). In that case this court viewed a regulation (restricting blasting within stated distances of a microelectronic manufacturing operation) adopted by the Board of Fire Prevention Regulations as beyond the authority thus far given to that board by the Legislature under G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 9. This court said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>(at 629), \u201cThe fire board\u2019s writ to promulgate safety regulations of general applicability is surely very broad. Our difficulty with the regulation in question is that it does something quite different from protecting against hazard in the conventional sense. It proscribes blasting in certain locations <em>irrespective of safety concerns. </em>The blasting may threaten no lives, cause no rocks to fly, and impair no buildings. It is enough that it is within a certain distance of an occupation that wants a high degree of protection from vibration and dust\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The opinion recognized (at 629) that \u201cthe insulation of calibration equipment from vibration is a form of protection of property,\u201d but (at 629-630) that what the \u201cregulation does is to favor one form of economic activity, manufacture of microelectronic components, over another form of economic activity, quarrying rock and grading land for development. It is quite apparent that economic choice, rather than safety, underlies the regulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The opinion then pointed out (at 630) that \u201c[i]t is not a question of the rationality of the choice. We are aware that high technology is of long term economic importance to Massachusetts. There is more future in microchips than rock chips. The Legislature could rationally decide that the public interest requires a limitation on blasting activity, even though safety considerations are not implicated. The Legislature could delegate to an administrative agency, the fire board or some other agency, the formulation of rules and regulations which will govern the making of such an economic choice.\u201d The decision in the <em>Tebo </em>case was that the Legislature had not yet conferred upon the board the authority to choose.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">No such issue is presented here. Safety from fire hazards is the basic question with the storage of flammables. That question, under our decisions, is to be dealt with by the city council not only in the light of fire prevention problems but also with appropriate weighing of other broadly applicable public safety and welfare considerations. No unauthorized economic decision between Hood\u2019s special needs and the competing interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>of other industrial concerns and business companies was directly involved in the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\"> In the absence of an attempt by Hood\u2019s principal counsel to offer testimony (other than his own), to object to testimony, or to seek to cross-examine hostile witnesses, there is no occasion for us to consider whether if they had made any such attempt and had been denied the opportunity, Hood would have been deprived of a proper hearing upon the issue of <em>granting </em>a license (as contrasted with a hearing upon a license revocation or upon an alleged violation of the terms of a license).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">As the trial judge noted, \u201cimpatience, discourtesy, or bad manners do not invalidate a decision or require the abrogation of a decision provided the essentials of sound judicial conduct are not violated,\u201d citing <em>Ott </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>Board, of Registration in Medicine, </em>276 Mass. 566, 574 (1931). Although views were expressed vigorously, the transcript of the hearing does not show basis for invalidation of the council\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
