The defendants appeal, claiming that the trial judge committed error, first, in denying their motions for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case and again at the close of all the evidence, and, correspondingly, in denying their motion for judgment n.o.v. Connected is a point about the application of Federal regulations or a Massachusetts statute regarding the carrying and deploying of safety warning devices. Second, the defendants say the judge was wrong to enlighten the jury, in response to their questions, about the consequences of a verdict that charged both sides with negligence. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Summarized, the evidence ran thus. On March 17, 1978, Ballou, a \u201cplatform man\u201d (i.e., freight loader) and driver, was taking a B model Mack tractor and a forty-five foot box trailer loaded with linoleum from Norwood, Massachusetts, to his employer\u2019s terminal in Cranston, Rhode Island. About 8:10 p.m. Ballou entered Interstate Route 95 at Neponset Street, near Norwood; for several miles he traveled south on a gradual rise (2.22 feet per hundred). He began experiencing engine trouble and as he reached the crest of the incline about 8:30 p.m. he lost most of his power. Some 200 feet downward from the crest (the down grade was somewhat steeper, 2.32 percent) he pulled the rig into the breakdown lane and stopped. He tried to start the motor, but failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">About 1:00 a.m. the plaintiff, Thurston, started from Logan Airport, Boston, south on Route 95, driving a one and one-half ton truck with an empty sixteen-foot storage box. Headed for his employer\u2019s terminal at Walpole, Massachusetts, he intended to get off Route 95 at the Route 1 exit about 450 feet past the spot where (unknown to him) Ballou\u2019s vehicle was sitting. Fifteen hundred feet from the crest of the incline, Thurston, riding the middle lane of the three lanes, noticed a car back of him bobbing left and right as if to pass him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Accordingly, Thurston began moving to the right hand lane. Coming over the crest (unlit) he continued his move to the right while somewhat slowing down from his pace of forty miles per hour. Suddenly, a hundred feet ahead of him he saw the reflection from three reflectors at the back of Ballou\u2019s trailer. At that point he could not make out whether the trailer was stationary or moving. In his left side-view mirror he saw the car that had been behind passing him in the center lane. Still moving to the right and beginning to cross into the breakdown lane, Thurston now saw Ballou\u2019s trailer only thirty or forty feet ahead. Thinking he could not swerve to the left because of the passing car. Thurston braked, killed his engine, dived for his floor boards, and felt a crushing impact. Ahead in the cab of the tractor, Ballou was also shaken and injured. The time was about 2:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">1. We may now add and assess evidence bearing on the defendants\u2019 first claim, that a rational jury could not find Ballou causally negligent. It is conceded that when Ballou set out from Cranston to pick up at Norwood he knew that he had no safety apparatus \u2014 for example, flares or reflective triangles \u2014 to warn oncoming traffic of an immobilized vehicle, apparatus especially important when there is a hindrance to sight such as an obstructing hill. The Massachusetts statute requiring the carrying and use of warning devices, specifically three flares, applies by its terms to commerical vehicles becoming disabled upon the traveled portion of a street or highway.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was evidence the tractor-trailer was wholly in the breakdown lane, although Thurston testified that two of its rear tires were in the right hand travel lane. Thus the defendants can contend there was no violation of statute which, if shown, would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>some evidence of negligence. See <em>Harsha </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>314 Mass. 738, 741 (1943). However, the plaintiff contends, the judge agreed, and we do also, that the Federal regulations, not the State statute, controlled because the former impose \u201ca higher standard of care\u201d than the latter. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 392.2 (1977). The regulations, promulgated by the Federal Highway Administration, require warning devices to be put out when a vehicle breaks down on the travel part or the shoulder of a highway and require a driver to carry more than merely flares.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 392.22, 393.95 (1977). Thus there was a violation which counted as some evidence of negligence, and so the judge instructed the jury. But the defendants say that the violation, if it occurred, was immaterial because flares, if set out shortly after the vehicle came to rest, as the regulations require, would have burned out before 2:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The defendants\u2019 proposition seems to be that, once the Federal regulations are gotten round in this way, Ballou is washed clean of all responsibility. This idea approaches the perverse. It starts with confounding the Federal regulations. The minimum Ballou might have carried to comply with the regulations was flares plus red flags,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and flags could have been posted at the crest for as long as might be necessary. Further, the question of Ballou\u2019s negligence is by no means confined to the absent safety kit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> &amp;There was evidence (although disputed) that the tractor-trailer showed no lights of any sort at the time of the accident. A State trooper came upon Ballou in his vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>about one hour before the accident and there was evidence (also disputed) that he gave Ballou flares which, had they been set successively, would have left one burning as Thurston approached the top of the incline. There was evidence (undisputed) that, in a five and one-half hour period, Ballou made only three desultory, and failing, efforts to flag down motorists as they passed his vehicle. Ballou, who had traversed this road on other occasions, did not energize himself to go to the intersection with Route 1 only 450 feet away where opportunities for getting help were likely to be better. Ballou came as near as might be to doing nothing at all, and was found in his cab at the moment of collision. It is clear enough that there was no basis for a directed verdict or for judgment n.o.v. Regarding the element of causation, compare <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 323, 330-331 (1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">2. The jury were asked to answer special questions under Mass.R.Civ.P. 49(a), 365 Mass. 813 (1974). After appropriate questions about negligence and causation, question 4 asked, \u201cAssuming total causal negligence equals 100%, what part of that total do you attribute to the negligence of Mr. Ballou, and what part to the negligence of Mr. Thurston?\u201d; question 5 then asked the jury to put down a dollar amount that would fairly compensate the plaintiff for the injuries he sustained in the accident. After some deliberation, the jury sent these inquiries to the judge: \u201cIf we decide on 50-50 fault for each individual, can we award Mr. Thurston an amount of money as damages?\u201d and \u201cThe amount we arrive at, will the percentage be applied to it?\u201d After explaining to counsel that he normally answered such questions from juries, the judge instructed the jury further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>on comparative negligence and answered the jury\u2019s questions. Although the defendants took no objection to the substance of the judge\u2019s statements, they had objected to the judge\u2019s undertaking to provide any answers to the jury. We doubt the defendants \u201cstat[ed] distinctly ... the grounds of [their] objection\u201d as required by Mass.R.Civ.P. 51(b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974), so as to preserve it for appellate review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In any case, we held in the quite similar case of <em>Kettinger </em>v. <em>Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 993, 994-995 (1982), that, just as the use of special questions is discretionary with the judge, so is it discretionary to describe the consequences of jury answers to special questions on comparative negligence, whether by means of instructions or responses to questions put by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">There was no abuse of discretion. Comparative negligence is not an easy subject. The jury questions were intelligent. It is not indicated that anything in the picture suggested the jury were preparing themselves through their questions for a bout of unreasoning indulgence in sympathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Opinion has differed about the judge\u2019s advising a jury about the results that may flow from their rule 49(a) answers on comparative negligence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We would point to the danger of the jury\u2019s speculating in the dark about the possible consequences and would leave it to the judge (as we held in <em>Kettinger) </em>to sense \u2014 having in view the facts of the particular case, any appeals therein to prejudice over reason, and the style of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>inquiries from the jury \u2014 whether elucidation with necessary warnings would be likely to help or hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-6\"> General Laws c. 85, \u00a7 14B, as amended through St. 1974, c. 529, \u00a7 1, requires the operator of a commercial vehicle having a gross weight in excess of five thousand pounds to carry at least three safety flares, defined as either pot torches, electric lamps, or other devices meeting Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 125. When his vehicle becomes disabled within three hundred feet of the crest of a hill, the statute requires the operator to set out the flares and to place one of them in the direction of approaching traffic so as to \u201cafford ample warning to other persons using such way, and in no case less than one hundred feet, nor more than three hundred feet, from the disabled vehicle.\u201d (We omit sundry details.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b760-6\"> \u201cShoulder\u201d naturally comprises a breakdown lane, as was made reasonably clear at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\"> Under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 393.95(f) (1977), the driver was required to carry three emergency flares, or three electric emergency lanterns, or three red emergency reflectors, or three reflective triangles.
