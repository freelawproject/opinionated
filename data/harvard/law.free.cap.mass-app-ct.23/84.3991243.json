The significant prayers for relief were equitable in nature; the plaintiff wanted the defendant ordered to permit him to take another examination in the first course and ordered to assign him a numerical grade in the second course. The defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was allowed in April of 1984, and the plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>from the ensuing judgment. That appeal is still pending but, for some unexplained reason, has not yet been entered in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In July of 1985 the plaintiff commenced the present action against the defendant in the same court and county. This time the complaint sought damages and attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9. The damages were said to flow from the following, among other things: the refusals described in (1) and (2) above, (3) the defendant\u2019s refusal to give the plaintiff a higher median grade in a third course, and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff as a result of (1) through (3). It is apparent from the face of the present complaint (and it was expressly agreed at argument) that all the operative facts relied on to support the present action had transpired prior to the commencement of the first action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant moved to dismiss the present action under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (9), 365 Mass. 755 (1974) (\u201cPendency of a prior action in a court of the Commonwealth\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) and on the ground of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The motion was allowed after hearing, and the plaintiff appealed again. This time he has entered his appeal in this court. It is clear from the caption and language of the judgment, which were expressly approved by the motion judge under Mass.R.Civ.P. 58(a) (2), 365 Mass. 826 (1974), that the judge acted only under rule 12(b)(9).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we pass the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>arguments advanced by both parties on the question of res judicata, as well as the arguments advanced by the defendant under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">This leaves us with only one question to be considered. The plaintiff argues at some length that the dismissal of the present action was precluded by the provisions of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(8), inserted by St. 1973, c. 939.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That subsection was enacted by the Legislature in the wake of, and was obviously intended to supersede, the holding of <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Cas. Co., </em>361 Mass. 582 (1972). Whether the subsection was intended to modify the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel is a question expressly left open in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Phoenix Inv. Counsel of Boston, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 444, 448-449 (1982).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we have said, no question of res judicata is before us in this case because the present action was dismissed under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (9). For the same reason, no question of collateral estoppel is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We have examined the legislative history of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(8),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and see nothing to suggest that the Legislature in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>tended to modify the salutary and well established rules against claim splitting which are now comprehended within rule 12(b) (9). See, e.g., <em>Dearden </em>v. <em>Hey, </em>304 Mass. 659, 661-662, 663-664 (1939); <em>Louison </em>v. <em>Fischman, </em>341 Mass. 309, 314 (1960); <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Jamaica Plain Co-op. Bank, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 153, 163-165, 166-167 (1979); <em>Mongeau </em>v. <em>Boutelle, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 251-252 (1980); <em>Guindon Ins. Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 931, 931-932 (1983). We find no abuse of discretion or other error of law in the dismissal of the present action under rule 12(b)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\"> The demand letter required by G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3), was not sent until shortly before the commencement of the present action. It was also agreed at argument that such a letter could have been sent and the complaint in the first action amended to include all the present claims prior to the court\u2019s ruling on the motion for summary judgment in the first action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\"> The parties are in agreement that the first action was still \u201cpending\" within the meaning of the rule because the appeal from the judgment in the first action was still viable when the second action was commenced. Compare <em>McCauley </em>v. <em>Sons Pharmacy, Inc., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 774, 775 (1975); <em>Massachusetts Bread Co. </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1053, 1054 (1982). Contrast <em>Twomey </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Medford, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 770, 776 n.ll <em>(1979);Mongeauv.Boutelle, </em>10Mass. App. Ct. 246, 249 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\"> The judge may have confined his consideration to rule 12(b) (9) because res judicata is listed in Mass.R.Civ.P. 8(c), 365 Mass. 750 (1974), as one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of the affirmative defenses which is to be set up by answer and is not enumerated in Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), as one of the defenses which can be raised by motion. But see <em>Saisi </em>v. <em>Trustees of State Colleges, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 949 (1978); <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Jamaica Plain Co-op. Bank, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 153, 157 n.7 (1979); <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>18 Mass.
