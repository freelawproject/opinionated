The charges were based on an incident which occurred in the defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s apartment in Lowell on July 28, 1983. According to the victim, the defendant drove him from Tewksbury to the apartment; while the two young men were sitting on a bed listening to music, the defendant made sexual advances towards the victim which were rejected; the defendant punched the victim in the face, grabbed his throat, put a pillow over his head and performed fellatio on him; the defendant then attempted to force the victim to perform fellatio on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">We have considered each of the defendant\u2019s contentions on appeal and, finding no reversible error, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">1. <em>Sufficiency of evidence of rape. </em>The victim\u2019s account of what the defendant did to him in the apartment was sufficient to overcome the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty of rape. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>22(b), </em>as appearing in St. 1980, c. 459, \u00a7 6. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>383 Mass. 888 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 581-585 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">2. <em>Fresh complaint. </em>The defendant claims error in the trial judge\u2019s admission of the fresh complaint testimony of one Robert Haines, an older and trusted friend of the victim. A month or so after the incident, in response to a question by Haines, the victim stated that the defendant had raped him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>This was the first time the victim had related to anyone that the rape had occurred in an apartment. Three other fresh complaint witnesses testified that the victim had told them shortly after the incident that the rape had. occurred in a car. The defendant objected to the testimony from Haines on the ground that the complaint was not sufficiently prompt to qualify as a fresh complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u201cA complaint of a sex crime made by a victim within a reasonable period of time after the commission of the offense is admissible as corroboration of the victim\u2019s testimony under the fresh complaint doctrine.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crowe, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 480 (1986), and cases cited. See generally <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>299 Mass. 55, 57-58 (1937); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 391-397 (1976). See also Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 171 (5th ed. 1981). \u201cA reasonable period of time\u201d has not been defined as a matter of law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bedard, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 959 (1978). To qualify as a fresh complaint, the communication by the victim need only be \u201creasonably prompt in light of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 473 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In allowing the testimony, the trial judge implicitly found that the complaint was reasonably prompt in the circumstances. The victim was a youth of nineteen at the time of the incident. Following the incident he was in obvious distress, embarrassed, and fearful of \u201cwhat people might think.\u201d His initial complaints were met in part by disbelief. His father reacted to the victim\u2019s complaint of rape, for example, by asking him why he had not prevented it by fighting off the defendant. Even when he responded to Haines\u2019 inquiries about the incident several weeks after it occurred, the victim was upset, and he was crying and trembling. It is not at all implausible that feelings of humiliation, embarrassment, and violation of privacy might be particularly forceful in a teenage victim of a male homosexual rape and might account for a delay of several weeks in revealing all the details of the rape. The fresh complaint rule has been applied to admit accounts made after delays longer than the one in this case, where circumstances warranted such flexibility. <em>See Commonwealth v. Wilson, </em>12 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Ct. 942, 942-943 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brenner, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 930, 931-932 (1984) (detailing the circumstances of cases involving sexual assaults on children which warrant flexible application of the rule). The trial judge acted within his discretion in admitting the complaint as \u201creasonably prompt in light of the circumstances\u201d of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">3. <em>The admissibility of evidence of the victim\u2019s state of mind. </em>On direct examination, without objection, the victim testified that he smashed all of the defendant\u2019s car windows the day after the rape. The prosecutor then asked the victim why he did that. Over a general objection, the judge allowed the victim to testify that he had smashed the windows because he \u201cwas mad and wanted to get back.\u201d The defendant contends on appeal that evidence of the victim\u2019s state of mind when he damaged the defendant\u2019s property was inadmissible because it was irrelevant and prejudicial. If the evidence was \u201cadmissible for at least one purpose, its admission over a general objection . . . [was] not erroneous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875, 882 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">There was at least one theory on which the state of mind testimony was admissible. By introducing the evidence of the destruction of the car windows as part of the case-in-chief, the prosecutor was anticipating the use of that evidence by the defense to support its theory of fabrication. The victim had not made any complaint of rape to the police before he smashed the car windows. He had been convicted previously of malicious destruction of a car, and, at the time of the rape alleged in this case, he was on probation for that earlier offense. It was important to the Commonwealth to counter the defendant\u2019s anticipated attempt to convince the jury that the victim fabricated the rape in order to avoid being charged with violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>of his probation. Having been permitted, without objection, to ask the victim about the smashing of the windows, it was reasonable for the prosecutor to ask the witness to explain that conduct. The judge\u2019s ruling permitting the explanation was not erroneous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 269-270 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. at 880-882; Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 165-166 (5th ed. 1981 &amp; 1986 Supp.). At most, one might question whether the judge should have allowed the question to be asked during the victim\u2019s direct examination rather than on redirect after the defense had pursued the issue in cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dougan, 377 </em>Mass. 303, 307 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. at 880-882. Any minor departure from the traditional order of proof, however, a matter usually left to the trial judge\u2019s discretion, was not prejudicial. The defense took full advantage of the opportunity to explore the issue in cross-examination and to argue forcefully the inferences adverse to the Commonwealth arising from the victim\u2019s conduct and his probation status.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">4. <em>Surprise witness. </em>On cross-examination, defense counsel inquired of the victim into the whereabouts of one David Whalen, the first person to whom the victim had reported the rape. He elicited the fact that Whalen was not in court and not expected to testify. While the victim was still undergoing cross-examination , the prosecutor informed the judge that he intended to call Whalen to testify. Defense counsel objected on the ground of suprise. He contended that he had relied in his trial strategy on the Commonwealth\u2019s representations in the pretrial conference report and in its list of prospective witnesses that Whalen would not testify. Defense counsel claimed he would be \u201cambushed\u201d by Whalen\u2019s sudden appearance. However, defense counsel was aware from the transcript of the probable cause hearing of Whalen\u2019s name and address and the substance of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing Whalen to testify. The Commonwealth sought to call the witness only after the defense raised questions about his absence. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scalley, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 224, 230-231 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>(1983). Defense counsel\u2019s questions implicitly suggested to the jury that Whalen was absent because his testimony would have contradicted that of the victim. That suggestion was false, and it became important for the prosecutor, if possible, to set the record straight. The judge conducted an extensive voir dire and concluded that, although there was poor police investigatory work, there was no bad faith on the part of the prosecutor in failing to produce Whalen sooner and no prejudice to the defense in allowing Whalen\u2019s testimony. The judge afforded defense counsel the opportunity to cross-examine Whalen during the voir dire and postponed Whalen\u2019s testimony until the final day of trial. Whalen\u2019s testimony itself was cumulative. There was no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scalley, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 231; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 627, 630-631 (1985). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chappee, </em>397 Mass. 508, 515, 518 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">5. <em>Limitation of cross-examination. </em>The defendant twice sought to inquire into the victim\u2019s use of drugs, in particular, \u201cmescaline,\u201d on the night of the rape in order to impeach the victim. Such evidence might have caused the jury to question the victim\u2019s perception and memory and might have indicated that he had \u201cdreamed the whole matter up.\u201d As a basis for asking the questions, defense counsel relied upon a record of the victim\u2019s conviction on April 22, 1983, for possession of marihuana and the allegation that the victim was known by drug-related nicknames.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Because he viewed the basis as insufficient, the trial judge excluded the questions and denied the defendant\u2019s requests for a voir dire. Although it might have been preferable for the judge to conduct a brief voir dire of the victim on the subject of his possible drug use on the day of the incident, it was within the judge\u2019s discretion to deny the request for a voir dire absent a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for the inquiries. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 368-369 (1983). Without a substantial basis for the questions, there is a risk of \u201ccommunicat[ing] impressions by innuendo . . . .\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>367 Mass. 280, 284 (1975). The judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that neither a conviction of possessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>marihuana several months before the rape nor the possible use at some time of a suggestive nickname was a sufficient basis for posing the particular questions. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciminera, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 103 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\"> Even if admission of the evidence was error, it was not prejudicial. As to the fact of the rape, Haines\u2019 testimony was merely cumulative. The discrepancy between Haines\u2019 version and the victim\u2019s testimony at trial, on the one hand, and the other \u201cfresh complaints,\u201d on the other hand, was fully exploited by defense counsel in cross-examination and closing argument. Furthermore, Haines\u2019 testimony was not unnecessarily detailed or inflammatory. And finally, the trial judge gave proper limiting instructions when the evidence was admitted and in his charge to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
