Sherick, was tried in Superior Court in Plymouth County and found guilty of rape (as a lesser included crime), and acquitted on the other charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The present appeal attacks some remarks by the prosecutor in his closing argument, and a portion of the judge\u2019s instructions. It will suffice to outline the case without plunging into details. Then we deal with the particular contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In the afternoon of May 3, the victim and her father and a younger sister were walking on Main Street, Brockton, the former two carrying bags of groceries. The defendant came by in a beat-up station wagon and offered them a ride. The victim and the father knew the defendant as a worker for a moving company who had recently assisted in moving their family to Main Street from Parker Street. The trio piled into the car and the defendant, with stops at the Registry of Motor Vehicles and a liquor store, drove them home, accepting along the way an invitation to take dinner with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The defendant ate little but drank a considerable amount of beer. Shortly after dinner the victim called her friend, Mary Dexter (we use a fictitious name), who lived on Court Street, and volunteered to babysit for her. The defendant offered to give the victim a ride there: it was a cold, rainy evening. Arriving outside Dexter\u2019s house, the defendant, instead of letting the victim out, locked the door on the passenger side, grabbed the victim\u2019s forearm to stop her from opening the door, and told her they were going for a ride. He said she would be in trouble if she told the police or the lawyers. Then he reached into the glove compartment, drew-out a knife, and held it to her throat. Again he warned her about telling. (It may be noted here that the victim was eighteen years old, thin, frail, and of low intelligence.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">After a further struggle with the victim, the defendant drove to a junk yard on Freight Street, deserted at that hour, and turned off engine and lights. He removed his clothes, talking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>now (and later) about the victim having \u201chis kid.\u201d Again the victim tried to get out of the car but the defendant prevented her. He undressed her, pushed her onto the back seat, and followed her there. He entered her mouth, then her vagina, then her anus. They put on their clothes and resumed places on the front seat. After some driving around, the defendant returned to the Dexter house and let the victim out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Mary Dexter, opening the front door in response to the doorbell, observed that the victim was wet and dishevelled. Asked where she had been \u2014 she was long overdue \u2014 the victim, evidently distraught, said she had been at McDonald\u2019s. When Dexter, disbelieving that story, said she would call the victim\u2019s father \u2014 he had been phoning Dexter repeatedly to see whether she had shown up \u2014 the victim told Dexter of the rape, identifying the man as the one who had moved the family from Parker Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Dexter called the Brockton police department and the Rape Crisis Center. Officer Eric Smith arrived with Officer Lee Kendrick, spoke with the victim, and brought her to the Brockton Hospital. There she told her story again. Her clothes were taken and Dr. Henry Kurusz, assisted by Nurse Maria J. LaCara, made various tests of which that for acid phosphatase (an enzyme found in seminal fluid) proved positive in readings from the mouth, questionably positive for the anus, and positive for the vagina (but this reading could be false because of the presence in the vaginal vault of blood remaining from the victim\u2019s recent menstrual period).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">When the defendant was brought to the police station after his identification and arrest, he said, following Miranda warnings, that he was willing to talk. In conversation with Captain John Bukunt, with Officers Smith and Kendrick also present, the defendant denied knowing any family called \u201cRobert\u201d (fictitious name) though he knew a man for whom he had done some moving whose first name he took to be Robert. He told how he had spent May 3. In this narrative he accounted for the whole day and did not mention any encounter with the victim or her father. At the trial he took the stand and testified that he had picked up the victim and her father in the station <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>wagon on the afternoon of May 3, had drunk beer at the Robert place that evening, and had driven with the victim to the Dexter address. While in the car he had asked her whether she wanted to do some \u201cparking,\u201d and she agreed. He had engaged in vaginal and oral intercourse with the victim at the junkyard, but she was a consenting partner. Following vaginal entry, it was the victim who initiated oral intercourse. He had returned her to the Dexter house.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Despite some wavering in the victim\u2019s testimony (mentioned below at note 2), the jury could well have believed the substance of the evidence which amounted to proof of forcible intercourse, and disbelieved the defendant\u2019s assertions of consent on the part of the victim, as well as the defendant\u2019s attempt at an alibi as told to Captain Bukunt. (The judge correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motion at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case for required findings of not guilty; the motion was not renewed at the close of all the evidence.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">1. In his closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor commented on the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence in comparison with the defendant\u2019s and asked the jury to consider where the balance of credibility lay. He said the victim\u2019s several accounts of the May 3 incident, including her testimony at the probable cause hearing, before the grand jury, and at trial, had been consistent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the other hand, the defendant had told his story twice, at the police station and at trial, and the stories were contradictory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s comment passed without objection or remark by defense counsel. On the present appeal, however, the defense contends there was a breach of the rule that forbids prosecutor (or judge) to lead the jury to draw an adverse inference from an accused\u2019s failure to come forward and speak at any stage after being taken into custody. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Teixera, </em>396 Mass. 746, 752 (1986). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 553-554 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 694-698 (1983). The policy at work here is that of the privilege against self-incrimination embodied in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and, locally, in art. 12 of our Declaration of Rights and two satellite statutes, one, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, Third, in effect embodying or restating the privilege,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a second, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 23, applying it more particularly to references to the failure of a defendant to testify or offer evidence at a preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The privilege should never fail of high respect and solid enforcement in our courts, but the attempt to bring it or its policy to bear in the present case to reverse the conviction seems to us much overdrawn and without merit. Here the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not directed to any failure of the defendant to testify; that would have been improper. Rather the comment was directed to an appraisal of the evidence on both sides that had been given at the trial; that was permissible. We elaborate the distinction as far as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">(a) Impermissible. A prosecutor may not at trial, in questioning witnesses or addressing the jury, point to the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand, thereby inviting the inference that the defendant fears to face the music or has something to hide. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, </em>332 Mass. 66, 69 (1954); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>387 Mass. 900, 908-909 (1983). Of course such a fault is as bad or worse where the judge himself makes such a direct, tendentious reference. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goulet, </em>374 Mass. 404, 410-411 (1978). The same vice inheres in interrogation or comment at trial that is pointed toward bringing out that a defendant had nothing to say when he was arrested, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>374 Mass. 514, 520-522 (1978), or avoided testifying or putting in any case at an earlier hearing, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haraldstad, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 574-575 (1983), in either instance inviting an inference headed toward a conclusion of guilt. The situation is not different where a prosecutor, in lieu of saying in terms that the defendant has failed to testify, remarks archly that the Commonwealth\u2019s case has not been answered or remains un-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>contradicted, when it is apparent that a response must have come, if at all, from the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 303-304 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 570-572 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>380 Mass. 70, 82-84 (1980). So, too, instead of saying outright that the defendant was speechless and tendered no evidence at a hearing on probable cause, a prosecutor may produce the same effect by the maneuver of beginning his cross-examination of witness after witness offered for the defense at trial by asking whether the witness was called by the defense to testify at the probable cause hearing, and eliciting in each instance a negative answer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 632 (1973), and remarks in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>375 Mass. 768, 774-775 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmarin, </em>378 Mass. 474, 476-478 (1979). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>376 Mass. 867, 869 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">(b) Permissible. In the cases described above, the privilege is subverted by what is, or amounts to, a direct appeal to the jury to draw the forbidden inference from the defendant\u2019s silence. But it is not in every case, where the fact of the silence is in some way referred to that the privilege is abused. Indeed, in many situations it is not possible for a prosecutor absolutely to skirt the fact.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The question is whether the jury\u2019s attention is being directed to the defendant\u2019s silence or failure to produce evidence as the basis for the prohibited inference, or is rather directed to a different matter, with the silence, in the rather unlikely event it draws any attention, being sensed as collateral or incidental.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>We mention illustrative instances of permissible commentary. The prosecutor\u2019s comment, \u201cHave you heard word one from the defendant as to what took place down at the police station,\u201d could \u201cin the context of the entire argument\u201d be characterized as \u201cdirected more at the general weakness of [the defendant\u2019s] defense than toward the defendant\u2019s own failure to testify.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>378 Mass. 312, 324 (1979), cert, denied, 446 U.S. 955 (1980). Remarks in a closing argument when \u201c[t]aken in context,\u201d \u201creflect[ed] an effort to summarize the evidence rather than any attempt to comment on the failure of the defendant to testify.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>381 Mass. 306, 315 (1980). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, </em>376 Mass. 735 (1978), with entrapment in issue, the prosecutor said there was no evidence of the defendant\u2019s frame of mind (i.e., whether he was \u201cpredisposed\u201d). This implicit reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand, coming \u201c[i]n the context of an argument on the weakness of the defendant\u2019s entrapment defense\u201d lacked the \u201cforbidden tendency\u201d of suggesting to the jury that it might \u201ctreat\"the defendant\u2019s silence as substantive evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744. Closing to a jury in a murder case where the defense was suggesting that the victim died by accident, the prosecutor asked why the defendant failed to seek medical attention, and so on. This did not impinge on the defendant\u2019s exercise of his privilege not to take the stand: it was a \u201ccommentary on the evidence\u201d and permissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 267 (1983). A prosecutor\u2019s comment that the defendant, who did not testify, gave only a partial and inadequate explanation at the time of her arrest (for a motor vehicle offense) was directed toward the \u201cgeneral weakness\u201d of the defendant\u2019s account, and was not a proscribed comment on the defendant\u2019s exercise of her right to remain silent at that time. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 331, 336 (1983). See also <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>v. <em>Belton, </em>352 Mass. 263, 270 (1967); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 891-893 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>22Mass. App. Ct. 274, 282(1986). Cf. <em>Common-wealthy. Cefalo, </em>381 Mass. 319, 337-338 (1980). Annot., 24 A.L.R. 3d 1093 (1969) (with 1986 Supp.), collects many cases that are helpful in delineating the legal line.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">(c) Present case. Here, as we have noted, the prosecutor was directing the jury\u2019s attention to the strength of the evidence on either side. In the face of the defendant\u2019s full testimony at trial (together with evidence of what he told the police at the station), it seems improbable that the jury could have had any distinct reaction to the prosecutor\u2019s oblique reference (so far as it was a reference at all) to an episode of pretrial silence. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>352 Mass. at 270. We add that the judge, early in the trial, had instructed the jury that the official preliminaries to the trial, including the probable cause and grand jury proceedings and indictment, were merely accusatory, not to count in their consideration of the case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Thus, we think there was no infraction of the defendant\u2019s rights. Defense counsel was evidently of like opinion, as he did not object. In the absence of objection, if an infraction were found, the question would be whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Having in mind the obscurity of the prosecutor\u2019s reference and the weight of the whole record, we think the answer is negative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. at 892; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1008 (1982). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egerton, </em>396 Mass. 499, 508 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>2. In sharp language, the prosecutor asked the jury to consider whether the defendant had not intentionally accommodated or adjusted his testimony to the evidence presented by the Commonwealth. Within reason, prosecutors maybe critical of the character of evidence offered by the defense, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>374 Mass. 613, 618 (1978) (defense \u201ctailor-made to try and avoid the evidence as it came in from the Commonwealth\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 703-704 (1979), just as they may comment on defense trial tactics. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunker, </em>363 Mass. 792, 800 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borodine, </em>371 Mass. 1, 11 (1976), cert, denied, 429 U.S. 1049 (1977), habeas corpus denied, <em>Borodine </em>v. <em>Douzanis, 592 </em>F.2d 1202 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 282. The prosecutor\u2019s comment was a permissible reflection upon elements of the defendant\u2019s testimony. Thus, after the victim described the acts of intercourse as having occurred on the back seat of the station wagon, the defendant replied with testimony that the back seat was occupied by a number of tires. Cross-examination in some detail went far enough for a jury to surmise that this testimony was invented for the occasion. So, too, the prosecutor could suggest that the defendant\u2019s testimony about the acts of intercourse was accommodated to the results of the acid phosphatase tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">3. There was objection to the judge\u2019s giving an instruction on consciousness of guilt (the content of that instruction was not in dispute). The objection was properly overruled because the jury could find that the defendant intentionally fabricated the account he gave Captain Bukunt at the police station. Such knowing falsity has many times been recognized as a sign of consciousness of guilt, justifying the conventional instruction on the subject. See <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>317 Mass. 10, 16 (1944); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eppich, </em>342 Mass. 487,492 (1961); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meuse, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 189, 190-191 (1975), <em>S.C., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 937 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> He was sentenced to four to eight years\u2019 imprisonment at M.C.I., Cedar Junction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\"> The jury could note that there was some partisan hyperbole in the prosecutor\u2019s statement about the victim\u2019s consistency. While it might be fairly stated that the victim\u2019s accounts were in general consistent (barring her early reference to McDonald\u2019s), cross-examination by the defense turned up a number of discrepancies in particulars between the victim\u2019s direct testimony at trial and her testimony at the probable cause hearing. The differences related to the time of various occurrences, descriptions of the knife and interior of the car, etc. As to some of these matters, the victim complained that she had been confused or misled by hostile questioning by counsel at the probable cause hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ABNS\"> The prosecutor said:</p>\n<p id=\"AOl\">\u201cWhat else can you ladies and gentlemen consider in deciding who is telling the truth up there and who is not telling the truth? Well, one factor is the consistency of this version of what happened on that particular occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>sion. Now, [the victim], as I told you, has told this story quite a few times. She told it to the police, she told it to the people at the hospital, she told it at the preliminary hearing, she told it at the grand jury, she told it here. She was cross-examined at the preliminary hearing, she was cross-examined here.</p>\n<p id=\"AfY2\">\u201c. . . That man has told his story twice. He told it to the police the night he was arrested, and told it to you ladies and gentlemen on the witness stand. Not five or six times, like [the victim]. Twice.</p>\n<p id=\"AMY\">\u201cIs what he told the police he was doing the night that he was arrested consistent with his trial testimony? Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest to you that that man got in that room with Captain Bukunt and Officer Smith and he told a false alibi.

The opinion did not mention any constitutional provision. <em>See Myers Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 852 n.9 (1973).
