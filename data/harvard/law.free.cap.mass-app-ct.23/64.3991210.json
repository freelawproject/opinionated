Crowley. On an earlier appeal, the conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunker, </em>363 Mass. 792 (1973). Dunker asserts, as a basis for his present motion for a new trial, that the judge\u2019s instructions on malice and manslaughter at the original trial (a) \u201ccreated an impermissible mandatory presumption in violation of . . . [Dunker\u2019s] rights to due process of law,\u201d and (b) \u201cimproperly shifted to . . . [Dunker] the burden of proving that he acted in passion or heat of blood and that his conduct was wanton and reckless.\u201d At the 1971 trial no objection or exception was claimed to the pertinent portions of the charge. The original trial took place before the decisions in <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684 (1975), and <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The motion judge, in a 1985 memorandum decision denying a new trial, reviewed the general facts established at the 1971 trial, and concluded that Dunker\u2019s \u201cdefense consisted solely of [an] alibi,\u201d viz., that he had been in New Bedford on the early morning of June 25, 1970, when Crowley was shot in Dorchester, and stated in a footnote to his memorandum that \u201c[a]t one point counsel for . . . Dunker indicated that he intended to present evidence that . . . [Dunker] acted in self defense\u201d but that \u201c[n]o such evidence, in fact, however, was offered at trial.\u201d The motion for a new trial was denied on the ground that any error in the judge\u2019s charge on malice was harmless because \u201cthe heart of . . . [Dunker\u2019s] defense . . . was alibi\u201d and that Dunker \u201cnever . . . advanced any theory of justification, mitigation[,] or lack of intent nor . . . were these issues raised by the evidence.\u201d The consequence, in the opinion of the motion judge, was that Dunker had \u201cwaived the issue of . . . errors in the charge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on malice in light of his strategy of an alibi defense.\u201d The motion judge thus concluded that, if all of the defense founded on the evidence was an alibi, the \u201ccharge on malice was unrelated to the issues in the case [and in fact tried] and was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The motion judge (who was not the trial judge) was advised by counsel (for the Commonwealth and for Dunker), at the hearing on the motion for a new trial, that the only evidence at trial bearing upon any defense other than alibi, was from a police officer who had talked with the victim and from two prisoners with whom Dunker had talked at M.C.I., Bridgewa-ter, while there for pretrial examination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The evidence against Dunker at the 1971 trial came from four principal witnesses. Two were police officers who talked with the victim at Boston City Hospital shortly after he was shot. The admission of the victim\u2019s statements to these officers that Dunker had shot him was sustained, on the ground that they constituted dying declarations, in the 1973 opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court, 363 Mass. at 793-795. The two prisoners who in 1970 had been in protective confinement at M.C.I., Bridgewater, testified to admissions made there to them by Dunker.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">One of these prisoners (Francis Gamey) testified that Dunker told him that he (Dunker) \u201cand another fellow called Big Mack . . . stole a Chrysler . . ., brought it ... to Boston with the intentions to pick up and kill . . . Crowley. They drove . . . to the 1310 Lounge at around one o\u2019clock in the morning . . . and Big Mack went into the 1310 Lounge on Dorchester Avenue and he picked up . . . Crowley and took him out with the intentions [szc] to kill him.\u201d Gamey\u2019s testimony continued. \u201c[Tjhey drove around Dorchester . . . into the Fields Comer area and <em>where an argument took place in the car </em>and . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Dunker asked Big Mack for the gun, while he was sitting in the back seat with . . . Crowley. And he shot . . . Crowley in the left side of the face and the kid ... ran out of the door of the car . . . and he [Dunker] shot him again in the side\u201d (emphasis supplied). Gamey further testified Dunker had said that \u201cBig Mack was driving the car,\u201d that they then drove to South Boston, and that Dunker \u201ctook Big Mack\u2019s car and drove to New Bedford.\u201d This, Dunker told Gamey, was \u201cto set up an alibi ... if he got arrested.\u201d On cross-examination by Dunker\u2019s counsel, further inquiry about the \u201cargument\u201d in the automobile was made. The witness, Gamey, persisted in his testimony that Dunker told him that, during or after the \u201cargument,\u201d he [Dunker] had asked Big Mack in the front seat for a gun and had been passed one. Before that Dunker didn\u2019t have a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The other prisoner at M.C.I., Bridgewater, who testified that he talked with Dunker in 1970 was Carlos A. Wilson. His pertinent testimony is summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">At the hearing before the motion judge, the testimony at trial of Sergeant Francis Whalen was referred to as possibly providing some support for a defense other than alibi. Sergeant Whalen had testified to talking three times with Crowley, the victim, at the hospital prior to his death. Crowley told him that Fred Dunker had shot him, that he (Crowley) did not know where Dunker lived, that he did not know the reason why the shooting happened, and that they (Crowley and Dunker) had served time together at M.C.I., Concord. On cross-examina-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>tian, Sergeant Whalen testified that Crowley had said that, while he was in the back seat of a vehicle, sitting next to a man from South Boston named Mack \u201che was shot . . . and then jumped out the door and ran . . . about 28 feet.\u201d The victim told the sergeant that the victim did not know whether \u201cMack\u201d was a first name, a nickname, or a last name. Crowley also told the sergeant that he \u201chad an argument with\u201d Dunker in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The only other evidence which might have a bearing on any defense other than alibi was that referred to in the 1973 opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court, 363 Mass. at 798-800. There it was recited that defense counsel had asked Crowley\u2019s father whether Crowley would get upset if someone was seeing Crowley\u2019s former wife and whether Crowley was easily excitable. As the 1973 opinion states (at 798), counsel in a bench conference had told the trial judge that the inquiry was material because \u201cour defense here is going to be self defense.\u201d The opinion went on (at 799), \u201cBased on that representation, the judge allowed . . . evidence concerning the victim. . . . [T]he victim\u2019s father testified that, except on occasion, the victim had not been living with his wife for four years prior to his death; he could not be the judge of whether the victim disliked his wife; he had trouble with his son; and his son was quick tempered. When the witness testified that he did not know whether his son \u2018would take offense ... at anybody who was stepping out or having any affair with his wife,\u2019 the judge asked counsel in front of the jury whether he was \u2018going to have evidence of that. \u2019 Counsel replied, \u2018Yes, I am, definitely. \u2019 <em>No such evidence was ever introduced\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The evidence just summarized is the only evidence brought to the motion judge\u2019s, and to our, attention as constituting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>evidence (a) permitting or requiring the trial judge to charge on manslaughter, or (b) constituting a basis for Dunker to argue a defense other than alibi. After the Commonwealth rested its case in chief, there was no defense effort to establish anything other than that Dunker was in New Bedford when Crowley was shot. Indeed, Dunker himself took the stand and testified that he was not in the Boston area \u201cbetween the morning of June 24 and the noon of June 25, 1970,\u201d and described in detail what he claimed to have been doing in New Bedford during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Dunker\u2019s present counsel now contends that the judge\u2019s instructions at the 1971 trial concerning malice created an impermissible mandatory presumption of malice which deprived Dunker of due process of law under principles discussed in <em>the Mullaney </em>case, 421 U.S. at 694-704, the <em>Sandstrom </em>case, 442 U.S. at 514-527, and <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307 (1985). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684, 687-692 (1976). Defense counsel also contends that these decisions are retroactive to convictions obtained and affirmed prior to their rendition. See <em>Hankerson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>432 U.S. 233, 240-244 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The charge given by the trial judge must be viewed as a whole. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980). The judge, at the outset, gave appropriate instructions on the presumption of innocence and that Dunker \u201cdoes not have to prove that he is innocent.\u201d The judge also instructed that it is \u201cthe obligation of the Commonwealth to establish beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element of the crime.\u201d In discussing specific intent, he told the jury, \u201cAn intent to kill may be <em>inferred </em>from the act of killing where a loaded firearm held by a defendant is aimed at a person and is discharged; the jury have a right to <em>infer </em>that such defendant intended to discharge it and to cause the bullet to hit a person at whom the firearm was aimed\u201d (emphasis supplied). The trial judge gave adequate instructions on the whole spectrum of homicides: murder in the first degree, second degree murder, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, and on the sometimes included offense of assault and battery. He distinguished murder from manslaughter by \u201cthe absence of malice in manslaughter\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The judge also instructed on the relationship between (a) malice, and (b) the use of a firearm which caused a homicide, in language set out in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dunker\u2019s present attorney argues that some of this language tends to shift to Dunker the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of establishing all the elements of murder in the second degree, in large part because of the use of the word \u201cpresumption\u201d in the language immediately following the bracketed letters [X] and [Y] inn.6. With this language, however, there must be read the trial judge\u2019s instructions with respect to manslaughter in this particular case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>At the close of the charge, after a bench conference, the judge gave his final instructions: \u201cIt is not sufficient to sustain a conviction of murder that the defendant may have been guilty of some other crime or crimes or that he may have been guilty of generally bad or imprudent conduct. . . . <em>The proof must establish the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt of every essential element of the particular charge made in the indictment. . . . </em>You must find the evidence to sustain the essential elements of either voluntary or involuntary manslaughter as I have explained them or don\u2019t find manslaughter. . . . [I]n the event you don\u2019t find <em>beyond a reasonable doubt the essential elements of any of the crimes </em>which I have defined, of course he is entitled to a not guilty to everything\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">There was little evidence to require that the trial judge charge on manslaughter, even if Dunker had admitted that he had shot Crowley. An autopsy revealed that a bullet had gone through the victim\u2019s head and that there was a bullet wound also in his side. This showing of accurate markmanship in close quarters at least tended to negate accidental shooting. The evidence of any physical argument or fight in the automobile was slight, at best. No evidence of provocation by Dunker by any inappropriate conduct with the victim\u2019s former wife ever was presented. The general testimony of Crowley\u2019s father that he had trouble with his son and that the son was quick tempered had no specific relation to the circumstances in which the son was killed. It may well be that the trial judge merely gave the manslaughter charge out of abundance of caution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 746 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Estremera, </em>383 Mass. 382, 391-393 (1981); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dustin, </em>391 Mass. 481, 487, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 844 (1984). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 727 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>383 Mass. 507, 514 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Viewed as a whole, the judge\u2019s charge (as mentioned above) gave full instructions on the presumption of Dunker\u2019s innocence and on the continuing burden resting upon the Commonwealth to prove every element of the crime with which Dunker was charged. The inadequacies now asserted, understandably, were not argued at all in 1973 (upon the original <em>pre-Mullaney </em>case appeal, 363 Mass. 792) and nothing about any improprieties in the jury charge then was discussed by the court, despite the comprehensive review (see, at 800) required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Even in the present <em>post-Mullaney </em>and <em>post-Sandstrom </em>era, however, the charge reasonably can be viewed as not risking interpretations by a jury prescribing any mandatory presumption, in view of (a) the broad flexibility described to the jury by the trial judge concerning their power to find the facts and (b) his repeated instructions that to convict they must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of a crime charged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adrey, </em>397 Mass. 751, 753-755 (1986), and cases cited at 755. Particularly should this view prevail upon the possibly more lenient scrutiny to be afforded to jury instructions given prior to the <em>Mullaney </em>and <em>Sandstrom </em>decisions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>374 Mass. 596, 599 pars. (1) &amp; (5) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We recognize, of course, that use of the terms \u201cpresumption\u201d and \u201cfindings\u201d (with reference to the proof of malice) have been disapproved as recently as <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>394 Mass. 355, 361 (1985), which reached a conclusion different from that in the <em>Adrey </em>case. In the present case, however, the situation was greatly affected by the circumstances that Dunker shifted to an alibi defense after the Commonwealth rested its case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, </em>388 Mass. 513, 514-516 (1983), dealt with a conviction in October, 1974, of murder (on January 27, 1974) in the second degree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, </em>369 Mass. 419, 420, 424 (1976). The trial judge had charged (see 388 Mass. at 514) that \u201c[w]hen the killing is caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>intentional use of a deadly weapon there arises a presumption of malice.\u201d This had been accompanied by an instruction that the jurors could \u201cinfer malice from the use of a deadly weapon, such as a revolver.\u201d The 1983 opinion (at 515) concluded that the charge \u201cdid not impose on [Festa] the duty to disprove malice\u201d and further that \u201cFesta\u2019s case was tried and argued by both parties solely on the issue of the identity of the perpetrator\u201d of the homicide. Festa\u2019s renewed motion for a new trial was denied (on this phase of the case) because the \u201cuse of the word \u2018presumption\u2019 in the malice instructions [has] no bearing on [Festa\u2019s] guilt, and ... the instructions [do] not create a danger of grave prejudice or a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>384 Mass. 362, 363-364 (1981). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>383 Mass. at 512-513, where Lee presented an alibi defense (see, at 509) with the consequence (at 512) that \u201c[t]he propriety of the charge as to malice was not in issue. The case was tried and argued by both parties on the theory that a murder had been committed. The issue contested by . . . [Lee] was solely that of the identity of the murderer.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>A more recent case, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egerton, </em>396 Mass. 499, 505 &amp; n.4 (1986), is relevant. There the <em>Lee </em>case was referred to as presenting an analogy to the refusal of a trial judge to charge on a lesser included offense where there was little or no evidence or defense contention based \u201con the element differentiating the greater and lesser offenses\u201d and (at 504) the \u201cdefense was primarily one of alibi.\u201d See also generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Estremera, </em>383 Mass. at 393-396; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 450-454 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The <em>Estremera, Lee, Festa, </em>and <em>Egerton </em>cases, in some degree, involve the appraisal of a jury charge on malice or intent in instances where other issues were predominantly the areas of contest at trial. This predominance of other issues has been treated as an important aspect of the context in which the probable impact on the jury of the malice charge has been determined. We are of opinion that the motion judge correctly concluded that, because of Dunker\u2019s alibi defense, any error in the 1971 malice charge was at most harmless. Viewing the evidence in the present case as a whole, we perceive no significant risk of any miscarriage of justice in the motion judge\u2019s decision. His conclusion that Dunker\u2019s assertion of an alibi defense was a waiver of any <em>Sandstrom </em>type error in the malice charge finds support in language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>392 Mass. 282, 286 (1984). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>384 Mass. 362, 363-364 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tameleo, </em>384 Mass. 368, 369-370 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">There has been doubt expressed in recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States whether it was ever appropriate to regard any error as harmless where there was conceivably constitutional error of the type discussed in the <em>Sandstrom </em>case. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>460 U.S. 73, 87 (1983, where possible instances of \u201charmless error\u201d were discussed but not found there to exist by a majority of the Court). In <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 313-327 (1985), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the issue was recognized as left unsettled. See also the dissents at 327-342. The question seems to have been answered in a recent split decision, <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 576-584 (1986). The <em>Rose </em>case was remanded (at 584) to the United States Court of Appeals with directions to consider \u201cwhether the error committed . . . was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The case, for the present at least, decides that the \u201charmless error\u201d principle of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18 (1967), may be applied in a <em>Sandstrom </em>context. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>461 U.S. 499, 507-512 (1983). As in that case \u201c[o]n the whole record, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the error [if any, now] relied upon was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-13\"> The shooting for which Dunker was indicted took place on June 25, 1970.

Dunker said that \u201che was sitting behind him and that Crowley was sitting on his right.

He said he got him, shot him twice,\u201d viz., in the head and also in the side.

The 1973 opinion (at 800) also made the comment, \u201cIndeed, the evidence . . . concerning the character of the victim and the occurrence of an argument between the victim and . . . [Dunker] may have been the evidence which prompted the jury to find . . . [Dunker] guilty of second, and not first, degree murder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b90-5\"> These instructions read, in part: \u201cIf a man intentionally and without legal justification . . . uses upon the body of another a force; for example, if a person puts a bullet in a revolver . . . that as used would probably do grievous bodily harm to another and create a plain and strong likelihood that the other will die as a result, the act is malicious within the meaning of the law even though the doer of that act was indifferent as to whether death would result or wished or hoped that death would not result. And an unlawful killing may be with malice aforethought and consequently murder in some cases where there was no intention to endanger life or even to injure. . . . Now, malice can be active malice, actual malice, or malice which is implied in law. And it is implied in law if there is an unlawful unjustified killing.\u201d After giving various illustrations of active malice, the judge proceeded, \u201cYou are also looking for an unlawful, unjustified act with no extenuating circumstances. And the heinousness, the wrongfulness of the act itself is sufficient to sustain a finding of malice ... as far as the law is concerned. [X] <em>Our court has said that from the use of a deadly weapon or instrument, there arises the presumption of malice aforethought, </em>as that term has been understood and applied in this Commonwealth. <em>So if you find an unlawful, wrongful, unjustified act such as killing, the commission of the act itself supplies, as a matter of law, the malice contemplated by the statute </em>when it talks about malice aforethought. . . . [Y] <em>[Tjhe circumstances which attend the killing may be shown, however, to rebut the presumption of malice </em>... by showing circumstances that[,] although they don\u2019t justify the killing, they do mitigate it from murder to manslaughter.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\"> After defining voluntary manslaughter as killing \u201cwithout malice but in sudden passion or heat of blood caused by reasonable provocation or upon sudden combat,\u201d he referred to the evidence that a \u201cfight\u201d took \u201cplace between . . . [Crowley] and . . . [Dunker] in the car. You are entitled to draw inferences within the limits I have explained. So, if you find the circumstances which support an intentional but unlawful killing by reason of passion or heat of blood, if you find those elements, those sustain the crime of manslaughter; they reduce the unlawful killing from murder to manslaughter because malice isn\u2019t present. Malice isn\u2019t present there because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the heat and the passion of the body took over. . . .\u201d The judge defined involuntary manslaughter as a homicide where there is no intent to kill but where the homicide was caused by \u201csuch a disregard of probable harmful consequences as to constitute wanton and reckless conduct.\u201d He proceeded, \u201c[I]f you believe there was a fight in that automobile, I suppose it is perfectly possible for you to find that a gun was accidently discharged. And if it was accidentally discharged in the course of wanton and reckless conduct while they were fighting with no intention to kill, it fits the category of involuntary manslaughter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b93-5\"> The <em>Lee </em>opinion (at 512-513) also says: The \u201cfailure to object [to the charge as to malice] reflects a conscious choice of trial strategy by defense counsel. We think our language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>374 Mass. 453, 465 (1978), disposes of the defendant\u2019s claim of error: \u2018We look askance when counsel who has tried a case, without success, ... on one theory of law, then attempts to obtain appellate review on an entirely different theory. . . . Neither the conventional type of appefllate review permitted in a criminal case, nor . . . G. L. c. 278 \u00a7 33\u00c9, for \u201ccapital case[s],\u201d is intended to afford an opportunity, from the vantage point of hindsight, ... to <em>attempt to convert the consequences of unsuccessful trial tactics and strategy into alleged errors by the judge\u2019 \u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The opinion (at 513) then said, \u201cThe evidence here raised no issue of justification, mitigation, or lack of intent on the part of the perpetrator. Rather, the identity of the killer was the paramount consideration. This case is thus factually distinguishable from those in which malice is a pivotal element in the jury\u2019s deliberation.\u201d The opinion then referred to the <em>Sandstrom </em>case, 442 U.S. at 520-521, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>382 Mass. 119, 134-135 (1980), <em>Reddick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 398, 404-405 (1980), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mclnerney, </em>373 Mass. 136, 141 (1977), where intent remained a principal issue. We are aware, of course, that, in the present case, the slight evidence of an argument in the automobile, obtained on cross-examination during the Commonwealth\u2019s affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>case, was never abandoned at trial in any formal way, although thereafter it ceased to be advanced by Dunker. To this extent this case may differ from the facts in the <em>Festa </em>case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
