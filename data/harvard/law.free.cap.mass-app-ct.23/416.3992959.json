L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB) annulling a decision of the board which had refused an \u201capproval not required\u201d endorsement under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">The plan submitted by the plaintiff landowner divided a 17.74 acre parcel on Lazell Street in Hingham into five lots. The parties had stipulated that Lazell Street is a public way \u201cused by the public and maintained by the Town of Hingham,\u201d that the zoning requirements in that zone for single family resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>dences are \u201c40,000 square feet in area and 150 feet frontage,\u201d and that each lot on the plaintiff\u2019s plan met the Hingham zoning by-law requirements. Nonetheless, the board declined to endorse the plan \u201capproval not required,\u201d giving the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u201c1. Lazell Street is a way in existence when the Subdivision Control Law became effective and does not have sufficient width, suitable grades, and adequate construction to provide for the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the proposed use of the land;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u201c2. the frontage does not provide safe and adequate access to a public way and is, therefore, not adequate frontage within the meaning of the Subdivision Control Law . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The plaintiff, relying on G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P, claims that her proposal is not a subdivision within the meaning of the Subdivision Control Law and that the board exceeded its authority in refusing the endorsement. General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 8IP, as appearing in St. 1963, c. 363, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u201cAny person wishing to cause to be recorded a plan of land situated in a city or town in which the subdivision control law is in effect, who believes that his plan does not require approval under the subdivision control law, may submit his plan to the planning board of such city or town . . . and, if the board finds that the plan does not require such approval, <em>it shall forthwith, </em>without a public hearing endorse thereon or cause to be endorsed thereon .... the words \u2018approval under the subdivision control law not required . . .\u2019 <em>Such endorsement shall not be withheld unless such plan shows a </em>subdivision\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The definitional section, \u00a7 81L, in the twelfth par., as amended through St. 1965, c. 61, defines a \u201csubdivision\u201d as the \u201cdivision of a tract of land into two or more lots\u201d but expressly provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">\u201cthe division of a tract of land into two or more lots shall not be deemed to constitute a subdivision within the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ing of the subdivision control law if, at the time when it is made, every lot within the tract so divided has frontage on <em>(a) </em>a public way or a way which the clerk of the city or town certifies is maintained and used as a public way!, or <em>(b) </em>a way shown on a plan theretofore approved and endorsed in accordance with the subdivision control law, or (c) a way in existence when the subdivision control law became effective in the city or town in which the land lies, having, in the opinion of the planning board, sufficient width, suitable grades and adequate construction to provide for the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the proposed use of the land abutting thereon or served thereby ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Citing <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 144 (1983), and <em>Hrenchuk </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Walpole, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 949 (1979), the board argues that, even if a way falls within the definition of \u00a7 81L, that is not enough. \u201c[I]t is also necessary that a planning board determine that the way in question . . . satisfies] the requirements of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>which . . . include the requirement that the way be safe for motor vehicle travel.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The board misapprehends the <em>Perry </em>and <em>Hrenchuk </em>decisions. Those cases rest on the reasoning of <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>376 Mass. 801 (1978), which held that as an aid in interpreting the exclusions of \u00a7\u00a7 81L and 8IP the court may look to \u00a7 81M as elucidating the purposes of those exclusions. <em>Id. </em>at 807-808. <em>Perry </em>at 151-152. See also <em>Rettig </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Rowley, </em>332 Mass. 476, 480-481 (1955). Thus, even though a statutory exemption (e.g., frontage<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on a public way) of \u00a7 81L is technically or formally satisfied, if, in fact, there is no practical access to the lots, \u00a7 81L will not apply. The <em>Gifford </em>court pointed out that in \u201cconformance with [the] text\u201d of \u00a7 81M, \u201cwe have emphasized repeatedly that a principal object of the [Subdivision Control Law] is to insure efficient vehicular access to each lot in a subdivision, for safety, convenience and welfare depend critically on that factor.\u201d Where approval is not required under the statute, \u201cit is because the vital access is reasonably guaranteed in another manner. The guaranty is expressed in \u00a7\u00a7 81L and 8IP of the statute in terms of a requirement of sufficient frontage for each lot on a public way. In the ordinary case, lots having such a frontage are fully accessible and, as the developer does not contemplate the construction of additional access routes, there is no need for supervision by the planning board on that score.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807. In <em>Gifford, </em>some of the lots were practically inaccessible and could not be reached by fire or other emergency vehicles. The court emphasized that it was concerned with \u201ca quite exceptional case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 808, and that to \u201chold that such a plan needs approval is not to interfere with the sound application of the \u2018approval . . . not required\u2019 technique.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In <em>Hrenchuk </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Walpole, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. at 949, the frontage on the public way was on a limited access highway \u201cand the boundaries of the plaintiff\u2019s proposed lots . . . provide[d] no means of vehicular passage between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>highway and any of the lots.\u201d In that context we said, citing <em>Gifford, </em>\u201cThe required access must take the form of (1) frontage on one of the three types of ways specified in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L, . . . , and (2) a planning board\u2019s determination under \u00a7 81P that adequate access, as contemplated by \u00a7 81M, otherwise exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Similarly, in <em>Perry, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 154, where the public way (Oakland Street) relied on did not, in fact, exist on the ground, we held that the access goals of \u00a7 81M were not satisfied. We also remanded to the board the question whether another public way (Midland Avenue), although existing on the ground, furnished acceptable access. Since the judge had made no findings \u201cin terms of the way\u2019s dimensions,, surface, or suitability for travel by ordinary and public safety vehicles,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 154-155, we could not determine whether Midland Avenue provided the access normally provided by a public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Central to the reasoning of the <em>Gifford, Hrenchuk, </em>and <em>Perry </em>cases, is the premise that where the exclusions in 81L, twelfth par., satisfy \u201cthe quality of access [those kinds of ways] normally provide,\u201d approval may not be withheld. <em>Perry </em>at 150. Where such access is provided, the board does not have \u201cthe same duties and responsibilities . . . as it has when it is called upon to approve a subdivision,\u201d <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Harwich, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 599, 602 &amp; n.5 (1980), and may not deny the endorsement. Compare North <em>Landers Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Fal-mouth, </em>382 Mass. 432, 437 (1981) (where subdivision is involved, adequacy of public way may be considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">This limitation is made clear in our cases. In <em>Gallitano </em>v. <em>Board of Survey &amp; Planning of Waltham, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 269, 273 (1980), and again in <em>Perry, supra </em>at 152, we said, \u201cThe <em>Gifford </em>case . . . was not intended ... to broaden the powers of planning boards ... [an endorsement under \u00a7 8IP may not be denied] whenever municipal officials are of the opinion that vehicular access could be better provided for.\u201d See <em>Perry </em>at 152-153.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">In sum, where there is the access that a public way normally provides, that is, where the \u201cstreet [is] of sufficient width and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>suitable to accommodate motor vehicle traffic and to provide access for fire-fighting equipment and other emergency vehicles,\u201d <em>North Landers Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Falmouth, </em>382 Mass. at 441, quoting from <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Township Comm. of Mendham, </em>91 N.J. Super. 111, 118 (1966); see also <em>Gifford </em>at 808, the goal of access under 81M is satisfied, and an 8 IP endorsement is required.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We turn now to the findings of the judge. He found that Lazell Street is a paved public way, that, except for a portion which is one-way, it is twenty to twenty-one feet wide, about the same width as the other streets in the area, and that it can \u201cprovide adequate access to all the proposed lots for the owners, their guests, police, fire, and other emergency vehicles.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These findings bring Lazell Street within the \u201cspecific objective criteria. . . chosen by the Legislature for the quality of access,\u201d <em>Perry </em>at 150, which entitle a landowner to an 8 IP endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\"> General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 81M, as amended through St. 1969, c. 884, \u00a7 2, in relevant part, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\u201cThe subdivision control law has been enacted for the purpose of protecting the safety, convenience and welfare of the inhabitants of the cities and towns in which it is, or may hereafter be, put in effect by regulating the laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways, and ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions and in proper cases parks and open areas. The powers of a planning board and of a board of appeal under the subdivision control law shall be exercised with due regard for the provision of adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe and convenient for travel; for lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways; for reducing danger to life and limb in the operation of motor vehicles; for securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and other emergencies; for insuring compliance with the applicable zoning ordinances or by-laws; for securing adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage, underground utility services, fire, police, and other similar municipal equipment, and street lighting and other requirements where necessary in a subdivision; and for coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other and with the public ways in the city or town in which it is located and with the ways in neighboring subdivisions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\"> The quotation is from the board\u2019s brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> As specified in the applicable zoning by-law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> We note that although the landowner relied on subsection <em>(a) </em>of the twelfth par. of \u00a7 81L, and not on subsection (c), the board in refusing the endorsement used the language of subsection (c), that is, \u201ca way in existence when the subdivision control law became effective,\u201d to describe the inadequacies of the public way (Lazell Street). If the board could apply to subsections (a) and <em>(b) </em>of 81L the broader powers given to it to determine the adequacy of the ways described in subsection (c), the first two exemptions would be rendered superfluous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> The judge also found that the road \u201cis as safe to travel upon as any of the hundreds of comparable rural roads that criss-cross the entire Commonwealth.\u201d We do not reach the board\u2019s arguments on traffic safety as we do not deem them relevant. We note that even if those arguments were to be considered, the judge\u2019s findings on traffic safety are not clearly erroneous and are dispositive. The board\u2019s contentions to the contrary are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
