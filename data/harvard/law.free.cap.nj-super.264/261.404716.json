A jury convicted Rodriquez and Politi of first degree kidnapping; assault; aggravated assault with a weapon; terroristic threats; possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose; and conspiracy to commit kidnapping. Mayo was convicted of conspiracy to kidnap.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The judge denied defendants\u2019 motions for a new trial. He then merged the convictions of Rodriquez and Politi for conspiracy to commit kidnapping into their respective convictions for first degree kidnapping.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rodriquez was sentenced on January 4, 1991, to thirty years in prison, ten years without parole eligibility on the conviction for first degree kidnapping. In addition, the judge imposed concurrent sentences of six months for the conviction for simple assault; eighteen months without parole eligibility for the conviction of aggravated assault with a weapon; four years for terroristic threats; and seven years, three years without parole eligibility, for the conviction of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The judge sentenced Mayo \u201cto a term appropriate to a crime of one degree lower\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(2)) on his conviction for second degree conspiracy to kidnap, and imposed a four-year term in prison, with credit for 282 days spent in custody. On March 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>1991, the judge granted Mayo\u2019s motion for reconsideration of sentence and resentenced him to five years of probation and released him from confinement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 34Fines and Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalties were assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Defendants Rodriquez and Mayo have appealed and we now consolidate those appeals for purposes of this opinion.

A brief summary will suffice. On January 16, 1990 at about 2:00 p.m. Anthony DePasque, then sixty-two years old, left his Clifton home to visit an auto parts store owned by his wife and managed by his current son-in-law. He stayed there until about 6:00 p.m. that day when he and his son-in-law left in different vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">DePasque arrived home at about 6:25 p.m. and parked his vehicle in his driveway. He gathered his things, including his nitroglycerine pills, and started towards the house. A car with lights off pulled up at the end of the driveway and two men got out of the vehicle shouting obscenities. They tried to force DePasque into their vehicle, but he fought with them. Someone came up behind him, grabbed him around the neck, spun him around and hit him on the head causing him to fall. He was then thrown into the vehicle where he was kicked and punched. De-Pasque was bleeding from the head while lying on the floor by the rear seat. At the time he did not recognize the two individuals. He then recognized the voice of a third individual as that of A1 Politi, his ex-son-in-law, who was seated in the front passenger seat, telling the others to \u201cshoot him, shoot him, kill him right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>here.\u201d At trial DePasque identified Rodriquez as one of the two men who initially approached him in the driveway. The other man was never identified. On cross-examination, DePasque also said he recognized Politi outside the car and was arguing with him over $150,000 which Politi felt he was owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">When the perpetrators arrived at their destination with DePasque at about 6:45 p.m. the driver blew the horn and an individual, identified at trial as Mayo, came downstairs from a second floor apartment. Rodriquez and Politi picked up DePasque from the floor of the car and brought him upstairs where Politi demanded $150,000. Rodriquez also demanded money and told DePasque that he was a Columbian and would wipe out DePasque\u2019s family. DePasque was allowed to make several telephone calls, some from a phone booth and some from Mayo\u2019s apartment. We need not relate everything that occurred in the intervening hours. Ultimately, the calls were traced and the police went to the apartment in the early morning hours of January 17, 1990. The police telephoned the apartment and told Mayo, who answered the phone call, to leave the apartment and come downstairs. Mayo complied, was apprehended, and was asked how many people were upstairs. At that point, Politi came out of the apartment followed by Rodriquez. DePasque then tried to leave the apartment and held the rail of the steps while he slid down the stairs. The police saw that DePasque was covered with blood and asked what happened. He replied that he fell down the ' steps and his friends were going to bring him to the hospital. He later said he told this story because he did not know what was happening and did not want anybody to get hurt. He then passed out and was taken to the hospital. DePasque had sustained a laceration on the top of the head which required stitches. He also had a broken nose, two fractured fingers, and black and blue marks on his arms and shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We have considered all of the arguments raised in light of the record and the briefs and conclude that they are without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2). We add only the following comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Rodriquez and Mayo both argue that they were entitled to a <em>Wade </em>hearing before DePasque should have been permitted to identify them in court. Before trial, personnel from the Morris County Prosecutor\u2019s Office showed photographic arrays to De-Pasque on January 25 and February 1 or 2,1990. Photographs of Rodriquez were included. A detective testified that the first photo grouping was an attempt to establish the identity of the fourth person who allegedly participated in the abduction of DePasque. This was unsuccessful on the first occasion. However, on February 1 or 2, a six-photo array was presented and one of the photos depicted Mayo. DePasque was unable to identify Mayo positively, but narrowed his choice to two photographs which he thought might have been Mayo, one of which actually was Mayo. The detective did not recall the order the photographs were given to DePasque, only that they were placed before him. Another six-photo array was presented which contained a picture of Rodriquez. DePasque was able to pick out Rodriquez\u2019s photograph. These arrays were preserved for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Surprisingly, there were three days of discussion about whether there should be a <em>Wade </em>hearing. Defendants Rodriquez and Mayo asked the trial judge for a <em>Wade </em>hearing prior to trial to determine if the photo array procedure was suggestive and might taint an in-court identification. The prosecutor responded to the judge\u2019s question of why a photographic lineup was even shown to DePasque by stating that it was not used to identify who the kidnappers were, but which person played what role in the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Rodriquez\u2019s attorney argued that a difference in background coloration on his client\u2019s photograph made the array suggestive as the photo of his client stood out. The judge rejected that suggestion based on his review of the photographs and the shading. He found no background more suggestive than any other. Ultimately, the judge concluded that there was an inadequate proffer of suggestiveness and that the mere fact that DePasque may have had difficulty in picking out Mayo\u2019s photograph did not require a <em>Wade </em>hearing. The prosecutor proffered a detective to testify as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>to the procedures employed in exhibiting the photos, and the judge did hear his testimony. Ultimately, the judge ruled that a <em>Wade </em>hearing was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The procedures for determining whether a <em>Wade </em>hearing is required were outlined in <em>State v. Ortiz, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 497 A.2d 552 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>335, 508 A.2d 212 (1985). <em>See State v. Madison, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>223, 232, 536 A.2d 254 (1988); <em>State v. Cooper, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>57, 65-66, 397 A.2d 702 (App.Div.), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>304, 434 A.2d 61 (1979). There must first be a proffer of some evidence of impermissible suggestiveness before a defendant is entitled to a <em>Wade </em>hearing. <em>State v. Ortiz, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 522, 497 A.2d 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Our cases have also held that even where photographs differ from others in the array, that does not render them impermissibly suggestive. <em>See State v. Farrow, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>434, 452, 294 A.2d 873 (1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>937, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1396, 35 L.Ed.2d 602 (1973); <em>State v. Mustachio, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>265, 274, 271 A.2d 582 (1970) (photos with defendant with front and side views on separate prints were not impermissibly suggestive). The facts in this case are similar to those in <em>State v. Gunter, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 554 A.2d 1356 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>80, 563 A.2d 841 <em>and </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>81, 563 A.2d 841 (1989), where the trial judge\u2019s determination that a photographic array was not unduly suggestive was upheld on appeal. We conclude there was no mistaken exercise of discretion by the trial judge in denying a <em>Wade </em>hearing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Moreover, the procedures used here did not violate the precepts of <em>State v. Earle, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>550, 552, 292 A.2d 2 (1972). Indeed, defense counsel\u2019s query about the procedures used and whether they were suggestive only occurred because the judge permitted the testimony of a detective prior to his final ruling that a <em>Wade </em>hearing was not required. Thus, defense counsel did have the opportunity to learn about the procedures used and whether they were suggestive. Any error in the judge\u2019s ruling would thus have been harmless. The procedures used did not violate <em>Earle. </em>In questioning DePasque, the investigator did not indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>any particular defendant was definitely in the lineup, he was only asking DePasque if any of the four people involved were in the array. In response to the court\u2019s questioning, the detective responded that DePasque had not been told the suspects were included in the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">As to defendants\u2019 arguments about failure to preserve a record of the out-of-court identification and that no \u201cchain of custody\u201d of these photographs was established, we conclude that <em>State v. Gunter, supra, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 39, 554 A.2d 1356, is persuasive and controlling. There, as here, there was no bad faith shown by the police, nor was there any prejudice to defendant. The detective\u2019s testimony that to the best of his recollections these photographs were the ones used in the array was sufficient to undergird the judge\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Finally, there were independent grounds for the identification. A <em>Wade </em>hearing was not required. <em>See State v. Oates, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 269-270, 587 A.2d 298 (App.Div.1991) (adequate independent grounds for identification of defendants without the photographic array). <em>See Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>188, 199, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>375, 382, 34 L.Ed.2d 401, 411 (1972); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>396, 414-415, 283 A.2d 513 (1971); <em>State v. Zarinsky, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>35, 58, 362 A.2d 611 (App.Div.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>101, 380 A.2d 685 (1977). The record adequately supports the judge\u2019s determination with respect to the lack of necessity of a <em>Wade </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Defendants\u2019 challenges to the videotaping and to <em>R. </em>3:13-2 as violating their right of confrontation and cross-examination as applied in this case arise because of what transpired after direct examination of DePasque and initial cross-examination on October 1, 1990. Court adjourned until the next day. On October 2 the prosecutor applied to revoke defendant Politi\u2019s bail on the ground that after court the day before, about 4:30 p.m., the prosecutor\u2019s office received a call from DePasque\u2019s daughter to the effect that two unidentified individuals had stopped by DePasque\u2019s house and threatened him with bodily harm if he did not change his story <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>and say he only fell down some steps and in fact was not kidnapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The prosecutor related that DePasque was frightened by the experience and around 9:00 p.m. that night had suffered a mild heart attack. He was admitted to the hospital. The prosecutor argued that it was likely that the two individuals were connected to Politi, who was then out on bail, and Politi\u2019s continued freedom jeopardized the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">After a bail revocation hearing the judge revoked temporarily Politi\u2019s bail until the next day so that more information could be obtained. DePasque was still in the hospital the next day. Politi\u2019s bail status was then reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Defense counsel wanted a delay of the trial until DePasque was available, even though that might be the next week, before the State could continue with other witnesses. The judge found no prejudice to the defendants in delaying completion of DePasque\u2019s cross-examination and allowing continuation of the trial with the State\u2019s other witnesses. After the State presented its witnesses, the judge heard arguments on whether to permit videotaped testimony of DePasque in the event he remained hospitalized on Tuesday of the following week. Defendants opposed this procedure as an impairment of their right to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The judge ruled that a videotaped cross-examination would be allowed if it became necessary and stated his reasons as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">Anything that\u2019s decided today, gentlemen, of course, is subject to the medical reports that we receive from the doctor on Tuesday in the event that Mr. DePasque is not yet out of the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">I\u2019ve taken the unusual procedure of having this matter heard today in anticipation perhaps hopefully we will not have to utilize the procedure, but in anticipation that perhaps Mr. DePasque, for medical reasons, is not going to be able to complete his testimony here in the courtroom next week. This sort of gives you an opportunity, if you wish to take an interlocutory appeal, if you disagree with what the ruling is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">Insofar as the delay in trying this matter, I must note for the record two of the defendants, Mr. Mayo and Mr. Rodriquez, have been in the County jail since January 1990. We are rapidly approaching the one year anniversary of their being placed in a County jail, waiting for this matter to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>If a mistrial is declared, it is almost a certainty that the retrial will not take place until after the first of the year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">As far as the right to confront the witnesses, that is a right that is, belongs to the defendants. And the defendants\u2019 right to confrontation of the witnesses will be protected and it will be preserved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">It may be cumbersome logistically. However, I don\u2019t see any reason why, if we have to take Mr. DePasque\u2019s videotape testimony, that the defendants cannot be present along with counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">The right to confrontation is that of the defendants. There\u2019s no right of confrontation as such as far as the jury is concerned. All that the jury has to do is be able to observe hopefully the demeanor of the witnesses. They can make that observation on videotape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">As counsel points out, it may not be within the whole courtroom atmosphere environment. However, if the videotape has to be utilized, it will be played to the jury in the courtroom. And I don\u2019t see where it\u2019s going to detract in any way from the seriousness or solemnness of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">I see no requirement that all of the proceedings be videotaped as counsel points out. The rule does talk, Rule 3:13-2 talks in terms of examination, cross-examination and determination of admissibility of evidence shall proceed in the same manner as at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">I don\u2019t see where that says, quite frankly, that stands for the proposition that either all of it is on videotape or none of it is on videotape. I do not see where that rule requires that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-11\">As far as Mr. DePasque is concerned, we were all present in Chambers, counsel and the Court were in Chambers yesterday when we spoke to the doctor via speaker phone. He seemed to indicate that once Mr. DePasque is moved off of the ICU floor, that there would be no threat to his health. There\u2019s no reason why he could not undergo a videotaped proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-12\">I should note also that if Mr. DePasque is not released from the hospital next week, the 'delay does not guaranty that Mr. DePasque two weeks from now, four weeks from now or ten weeks from now is going to be anymore available than he might be next week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-13\">I agree with counsel in the statement that really there\u2019s no precedent for a situation such as this. As a trial judge, and as trial attorneys, we always look to precedent. We look to be guided by what has taken place before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-14\">Quite frankly, I wish it was clear-cut that there was precedent so that we would not be here today having to debate what can and cannot be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-15\">But here is no precedent that I can find for a situation such as this where a witness in the middle of a trial takes ill. And, in fact, it\u2019s almost at the completion of the State\u2019s case at this point since the other witnesses, most of the State\u2019s witnesses, have testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-16\">$$$$$$$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-17\">As far as the question about what\u2019s going to happen if there\u2019s an objection made on the videotape to testimony of Mr. DePasque, that he might start to say something which is inadmissible, I don\u2019t see how that differs, in fact, from Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>DePasque being present in a courtroom and making the same, and the same problem arising; that Mr. DePasque might respond to a question with an answer that counsel deems objectionable or that there might be a question asked that counsel feels is objectionable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">On Tuesday, October 9, DePasque returned to court but said he was not physically able to testify. He said he had records from a CAT scan indicating he suffered another minor stroke and had just left the hospital the day before and his blood pressure was very high. The judge contacted DePasque\u2019s doctor who had \u201csome concern about DePasque testifying at that time.\u201d De-Pasque was readmitted to the hospital and on October 11 his cross-examination was completed and videotaped with the judge, prosecutor, defense attorneys, defendants and court reporter present in the hospital. On October 15, this videotape was played back for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Defendant Rodriquez argues that permitting the taking of videotaped depositions of unavailable witnesses as authorized in <em>R. </em>3:13-2 violated his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. He also argues that the rule is overbroad. We note initially that an overbreadth argument is generally restricted to limitations on First Amendment rights. <em>New York State Club Ass\u2019n v.

Morales, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 79, 539 A.2d 769 (Law Div.1987). In any event, a facial challenge was made to a Maryland statute, which permitted an alleged child sexual-abuse victim to testify by closed circuit television, before the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>836, 851-855, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>3157, 3166-3169, 111 L.Ed.2d 666, 682-685 (1990) (Maryland statute permitting alleged child sexual abuse victim to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>by closed circuit television out of presence of defendant and jury does not violate the confrontation clause.).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Although the confrontation clause reflects a preference for face-to-face confrontation and the importance of the right of cross-examination, it does not guarantee an absolute right to a face-to-face meeting. Occasionally, this preference must \u201cgive way to considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case.\u201d <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 <em>U.S. </em>237, 243, 15 <em>S.Ct. </em>337, 340, 39 <em>L.Ed. </em>409, 411 (1895). <em>See also Maryland v. Craig, supra, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>at 849, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3165, 111 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 681; <em>State v. Crandall, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>649, 654-656, 577 A.2d 483 (1990). The confrontation clause does not mandate eye-to-eye contact between the jury and the witness. Rather, it is to allow the defendant to confront witnesses against him. <em>State v. Crandall, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 658, 577 A.2d 483. Here, a clear public policy was furthered in allowing the trial to proceed where a material witness could not testify in court, particularly in the circumstances of this case where his testimony is interrupted by illness, perhaps precipitated by threat or fear, during the course of the trial in which he had already testified in part. There was no violation of any state or federal constitutional right of the defendants, <em>State v. Driker, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 470, 519 A.2d 942 (App.Div.1987); <em>State v. Washington, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 193, 494 A.2d 335 (App.Div.1985), and hence no violation of defendants\u2019 confrontation rights in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Moreover, we reject the contention that the trial judge did not consider less intrusive alternatives to permitting the videotaped testimony. The record reflects a clear showing of unavailability based on information given by the witness\u2019s physician. The trial judge was entitled to rely on that physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The fact that the State\u2019s other witnesses testified before defendants had an opportunity to cross-examine the victim did not prejudice defendants. The victim was not even present during their testimony. Generally all parties have some leeway as to the order in which witnesses are presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Adjournments required by the illness of the victim and the trial judge\u2019s rulings with respect to the taking of testimony of other witnesses before the completion of cross-examination of the victim are matters entrusted to the trial judge\u2019s discretion. We find no mistaken exercise of discretion in this case. <em>State v. Dye, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>518, 545, 291 A.2d 825, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>1090, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>699, 34 L.Ed.2d 675 (1972); <em>State v. Kyles, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 402, 334 A.2d 44 (App.Div.1975). The trial judge gave adequate reasons on the record why the trial should not be delayed when he preliminarily ruled on the question. He indicated that there was no way of telling how long the victim would be ill and he was concerned about the effect of a delay on the jury and the defendants Mayo and Rodriquez who had then been in the county jail for about ten months. The trial judge also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">I agree with counsel also that common sense, reasonableness and logic should dictate what the decision of the Court should be in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">I do not think common sense and logic and reasonableness mean that we\u2019re to throw out all the time invested in this matter up to this point, and if Mr. DePasque is not available next week, declare a mistrial and send everybody home. And hope that two or three or four or <em>six </em>months <em>from </em>now we\u2019re <em>going </em>to be able to move forward with the ease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Moreover, the judge adequately instructed the jury when the videotaped evidence was presented in court. The judge told the jury: \u201cFor all intents and purposes, the proceeding that you\u2019ll see on the TV monitor is a Superior Court courtroom proceeding. All the rules apply to it.\u201d Despite the defendants\u2019 argument that the jurors did not give the videotape the same weight and attention as they would have given a witness at the trial, the judge found just the opposite to have in fact occurred. He noted that the jurors did pay attention and that there was no more wandering of the jurors\u2019 eyes than there is when there is live testimony in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The judgments of conviction in each case are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\"> Politi was sentenced to thirteen years for the kidnapping, five years without parole eligibility. He was given concurrent sentences of six months for assault; eighteen months, with eighteen months of parole ineligibility, for the aggravated assault with a weapon; four years for the terroristic threats; and seven years for the conviction of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Politi is not an appellant herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b297-20\"> The record does not contain the amended judgment of conviction. Also, although the cover of Mayo\u2019s brief indicates \u201cPresently Confined,\u201d we presume that this is an error unless subsequent events resulted in re-incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[3]\">\n<p id=\"b297-21\">3 <em>United States v.
