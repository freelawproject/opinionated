At the time of the accident, she was operating a vehicle owned by her employer, Apple Computer, Inc., and insured by Industrial Indemnity Company and Crum and Forster Commercial Insurance Company (hereinafter jointly referred to as Indemnity), defendants in the present action. On or about November 12, 1985, Hartley filed a complaint seeking personal injury protection (PIP) benefits from Indemnity as well as from United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. (hereinafter USF &amp; G), plaintiff in the present action, the insurer of the vehicle owned by her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">By order dated May 22, 1987, the court, having found that Hartley resided in her father\u2019s household, granted judgment to Hartley against USF &amp; G and Indemnity, finding both companies liable for payment of PIP benefits in connection with Hartley\u2019s automobile accident. The court further ordered that the PIP benefits were to be paid primarily by USF &amp; G. The order also required USF &amp; G to pay interest and attorney\u2019s fees. The court denied without prejudice Indemnity\u2019s motion to hold USF &amp; G solely hable to Hartley for PIP benefits, leaving the insurers to whatever actions they may have against each other in law or in equity for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">USF &amp; G and Hartley reached a settlement whereby USF &amp; G agreed to pay Hartley\u2019s medical bills of $34,027.50 and attorney\u2019s fees of $19,081.25, while reserving its right to appeal the judgment. We affirmed in an unpublished opinion. <em>Hartley v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>No. A-3666-87 (App.Div. Sept. 27, 1989). The Supreme Court denied USF &amp; G\u2019s petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>certification. <em>Hartley v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>172, 584 A.2d 236 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">While awaiting the outcome of its petition for certification, USF &amp; G, seeking contribution from Indemnity, filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association, which Indemnity resisted. Thereafter, on April 23, 1991, USF &amp; G filed a complaint in the Superior Court, Law Division, seeking to compel Indemnity to participate in the arbitration process pursuant to <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:6A-11 (hereinafter \u00a7 11) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">If two or more insurers are liable to pay benefits under sections 4 and 10 of this act <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the same bodily injury, or death, of any one person, the maximum amount payable shall be as specified in sections 4 and 10 if additional first party coverage applies <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and any insurer paying the benefits shall be entitled to recover from each of the other insurers, only by inter-company arbitration or inter-company agreement, an equitable pro-rata share of the benefits paid. (Footnotes added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Indemnity contended that USF &amp; G\u2019s coverage was \u201cprimary\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4.2 (hereinafter \u00a7 4.2), and, therefore, Indemnity had no responsibility to pay to USF &amp; G a pro rata share of the PIP benefits under \u00a7 11. Section 4.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">Except as provided in subsection d. of section 13 of P.L.1983, c. 362 (C. 39:6A-4.3), the personal injury protection coverage of the named insured shall be the primary coverage for the named insured and any resident relative in the named insured\u2019s household who is not a named insured under an automobile insurance policy of his own. No person shall recover personal injury protection benefits under more than one automobile insurance policy for injuries sustained in any one accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Indemnity and USF &amp; G moved for summary judgment. The motion judge heard oral argument on the matter on April 3, 1992 and announced that he was denying USF &amp; G\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. However, prior to the execution of an order, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>judge requested reargument of the motion. On May 1, 1992, the parties again appeared before the motion judge, at which time he reconsidered his prior decision and ruled in favor of USF &amp; G. An order was entered compelling Indemnity to submit to arbitration for a determination under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-11 of its obligation to pay USF &amp; G a pro rata share of the PIP benefits paid to Hartley. Indemnity filed a notice of appeal with this court, and we granted Indemnity\u2019s motion for a stay of arbitration pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">At the outset we note that <em>N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>9, 486 A.2d 339 (App.Div.1984), relied on by the motion judge, determined that the Travelers could not appeal an arbitrators\u2019 award because the arbitration agreement expressly precluded appeals. However, in dictum, we referred with approval to <em>Federal Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 464 A.2d 1197 (App.Div.1983) and <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 432 A.2d 544 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>489, 443 A.2d 705 (1981). In those decisions, we held that \u00a7 11 means what it says, that there is contribution between two or more insurers liable to pay PIP benefits. The amount of contribution is to be determined through arbitration based on the standard of \u201can equitable pro rata share of the benefits paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Thus, in the absence of \u00a7 4.2, USF &amp; G was entitled to the judgment compelling arbitration of its claim for contribution and we would affirm. Section 4.2 was enacted in October 1983, after <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>and <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. </em>were decided. Under \u00a7 4.2, USF &amp; G\u2019s PIP coverage was \u201cprimary.\u201d At issue is the meaning of \u201cprimary\u201d as used in \u00a7 4.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Indemnity contends that USF &amp; G has no right of contribution from Indemnity because \u201cprimary\u201d means that USF &amp; G pays all the PIP medical benefits up to the $75,000 \u201climit\u201d established in the current version of <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4a. At best, Indemnity contends, it is obligated to provide excess coverage after USF &amp; G\u2019s limits have been exhausted. USF <em>&amp; </em>G contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>carrier identified as \u201cprimary\u201d in \u00a7 4.2 must pay the insured\u2019s PIP benefits initially and may seek contribution under \u00a7 11 from other available PIP coverage. We agree with USF &amp; G\u2019s contention, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">When it enacted \u00a7 4.2, the Legislature did not eliminate or modify \u00a7 11. Indemnity\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4.2 would render \u00a7 11 virtually meaningless, for \u00a7 11 would apply only if two or more carriers were \u201cprimary\u201d under \u00a7 4.2, an unlikely, though not impossible, event.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>ll:3-37.12(c) permits contribution. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">(c) If an automobile policy PIP plan provides benefits for medical expenses for an insured who is eligible for medical expense benefits under more than one automobile policy PIP plan, the automobile insurer of the paying PIP plan may seek equitable pro rata contributions from the other automobile policy PIP plan(s) for the benefits actually paid by the paying PIP plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">This regulation supports USF &amp; G\u2019s position because it reflects the Department of Insurance\u2019s understanding of the impact of \u00a7 4.2 and its relationships with \u00a7 ll.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An agency\u2019s understanding of a statute it is charged to enforce is of assistance in interpreting that statute. <em>See Cedar Cove, Inc. v. Stanzione, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>202, 212, 584 A.2d 784 (1991). \u201cThe meaning ascribed to legislation by the administrative agency responsible for its implementation, including the agency\u2019s contemporaneous construction, long usage, and practical interpretation, is persuasive evidence of the Legislature\u2019s understanding of its enactment.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The major flaw, however, in Indemnity\u2019s primary/exeess construct is that a limit on the payment obligation of the primary carrier is the predicate of excess coverage. In 1983, when \u00a7 4.2 was adopted there was no limit on the PIP carrier\u2019s obligation to pay, there was only a right of reimbursement from the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund. In 1983, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4a provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">a. Medical expense benefits. Payment of all reasonable medical expenses incurred as a result of personal injury sustained in an automobile accident. In the event of death, payment shall be made to the estate of the decedent. In the event benefits paid by an insurer pursuant to this subsection are in excess of $75,000.00 on account of personal injury to any one person in any one accident, such excess shall be paid by the insurer in consultation with the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Board and shall be reimbursable to the insurer from the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1977, c. 310 (e. 39:6-73.1).5 (Footnote added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Under this scheme it is unlikely that the Legislature intended to use the word \u201cprimary\u201d in \u00a7 4.2 to indicate a primary/exeess relationship between two insurers liable to pay PIP benefits, because at the time \u00a7 4.2 was enacted the primary carriers\u2019 \u201climits\u201d were never exhausted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We are persuaded .that the purpose of \u00a7 4.2 was to identify a source for the <em>immediate </em>payment of PIP benefits, thereby insulating covered persons from delays caused by squabbles between insurers. We agree with Judge Haines\u2019 construction of \u00a7 4.2 expressed in <em>Cokenakes v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 313-14, 505 A.2d 243 (Law Div.1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>In the final analysis, Section 4.2 merely designates the carrier first required to pay PIP benefits, preserving its right of contribution from other insurers also liable for such payments. The Legislature thus provided a remedy for persons injured in automobile accidents when multiple insurers are unable to agree as to the PIP contributions to be made by each. Section 4.2 promotes a primary intent of the No-Fault Law: the prompt payment of PIP benefits. Victims of automobile accidents no longer need wait for multiple insurers to resolve their differences before these important benefits become payable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Indemnity\u2019s contention that USF &amp; G\u2019s demand for arbitration is precluded by the principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata is without merit. The contribution issue was reserved by the trial judge in his judgment in the Hartley litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-11\">The Act is the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, <em>NJ.SA. 39:6A-1 </em>to -35, popularly known as the no-fault law. Sections 4 and 10 refer to <em>NJ.SA. </em>39:6A-4 and -10 which provide for basic personal injury protection (PIP) benefits and optional additional PIP benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-12\"> This clause, \"if additional first party coverage applies\" refers to the insured's election of additional PIP coverage under <em>NJ.SA. </em>39:6A-10. In that event, \u00a7 11 provides that the maximum amount payable shall be governed by section 10. Contrary to Indemnity's contention, the clause is not relevant to the issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\"> In a household of related individuals, <em>e.g., </em>three siblings, with multiple automobiles in different ownership and with different carriers there may be multiple \"primary\u201d carriers if one of the household members does not own an automobile and is not a named insured on any of the policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The regulation is in a subchapter titled Order of Benefit Determination Between Automobile Personal Injury Protection and Health Insurance. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-37.1 to 37.14. However, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-37.12 is not by its terms limited to cases where PIP coverage is secondary to health coverage. <em>See NJ.A.C. </em>11:3-37.9. Moreover, if two PIP carriers are secondary to health coverage, it would appear that \u00a7 4.2 and \u00a7 11 would govern the relationship between the PIP carriers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> This provision was enacted in 1983. L.1983, <em>c. </em>362, \u00a7 7. It was enacted in the same legislation which enacted \u00a7 4.2. L.1983, <em>c. </em>362, \u00a7 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\"> The current version of <em>NJ.SA. </em>39:6A-4a, enacted in 1990, seven years after \u00a7 4.2 was adopted, establishes a $250,000 limit per person per accident for medical expenses as a result of the 1990 amendments. L.1990, c. 8, \u00a7 4. The 1990 amendment continues the reimbursement obligation of the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund after the PIP carrier has paid $75,000 in medical expense benefits. In this case we do not address the impact of \u00a7 4.2 and \u00a7 11 on the relationship'among the primary PIP carrier, the secondary PIP carrier and the Fund, because Hartley\u2019s medical expenses were less than $75,000. It appears, however, that our interpretation of \u00a7 4.2 would postpone the Fund\u2019s duty to reimburse until the primary and secondary PIP carriers together had paid $150,000 in medical expense benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
