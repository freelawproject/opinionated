He was sentenced to concurrent one year terms of probation, and VCCB penalties totaling $60 were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In his brief on appeal defendant makes the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION OF BURGLARY SHOULD BE VACATED, BECAUSE JOYRIDING IS NOT \u201cAN OFFENSE THEREIN\u2019\u2019 AS CONTEMPLATED BY <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2, AND BECAUSE SIMULTANEOUS CONVICTION OF BURGLARY AND JOYRIDING ARISING OUT OF ONE TRANSACTION VIOLATES THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT JOYRIDING BE PUNISHED AS DISORDERLY PERSONS OFFENSE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Defendant\u2019s contentions -are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">It is now well established that burglary is complete upon entry with purpose of committing an offense. <em>See State v. Pyron, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 504, 495 A.2d 467 (App.Div.1985); Cannel, <em>Criminal Code Annotated, </em>Comment 2 to 2C:18-2 (1992-1993) at 353. The projected offense need not be actually committed. <em>See State v. Mangrella, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 441, 519 A.2d 926 (App.Div.1986), certif. den., 107 <em>N.J. </em>127, 526 A.2d 194 (1987). The burglary and a subsequent attempted theft by unlawful taking are separate and distinct offenses \u201ceven though the \u2018structure\u2019 broken into is also the \u2018movable property\u2019 attempted to be stolen.\u201d <em>State v. Subin, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 236, 536 A.2d 758 (App.Div.1988), certif. den., 111 <em>N.J. </em>580, 546 A.2d 506 (1988). The notion that joyriding is not an \u201coffense\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2 is belied by the plain language of the statute which defines burglary as an entry (or surreptitious remaining) \u201cwith purpose to commit <em>an offense </em>therein\u201d, an all encompassing term which includes not only crimes, but disorderly persons offenses and even petty disorderly persons offenses. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:1-14k; <em>also </em>Cannel, <em>supra, </em>Comment 3 to 2C:18-2 at 354-355.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the joyriding conviction immunizes him from the third degree burglary conviction because the former is a disorderly persons offense is a <em>non sequitur. </em>As already noted, these are different offenses which the Legislature has dealt with separately and differently. Indeed, the Legislature rejected the notion they should merge. <em>See Cannel, supra, </em>Comment 7 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>2C:18-2 at 357; <em>also State v. Pyron, supra, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 504-505, 495 A.2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In <em>State v. Benford, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 614 A.2d 659 (Law Div.1992), the Law Division held that a defendant could not be convicted of burglary if his intent at the time of entry into the automobile was only to commit the disorderly persons offense of joyriding. We disapprove that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We agree with Judge MADDEN\u2019s thoughtful decision and affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
