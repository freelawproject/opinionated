For the latter offense, he was sentenced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>life imprisonment with twenty-five years\u2019 parole ineligibility; for the other two convictions, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of five years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Defendant\u2019s arrest and indictment resulted from information that Anthony Harewood and Sandra Palmer provided to the police after their arrest for having sold nine baggies of cocaine to an undercover investigator for $100. When they were arrested, Harewood had $314.02 in cash in his pocket and Palmer had a large glassine bag containing 7.34 grams of cocaine in forty-eight smaller ziploc baggies. They told the police that defendant had recruited Harewood to sell cocaine. Defendant would supply Harewood daily with thirty to sixty bags of cocaine for resale. Palmer would hold the drugs and Harewood, who lived with her and was the father of three of her children, would collect the money from buyers whom defendant directed to him. According to Harewood, he would give defendant between $300 and $1500 a day; Palmer said that Harewood would pay defendant approximately $5000 a week and keep approximately $2000 a week as profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The statements which Harewood and Palmer gave to the police identified the apartment where defendant stored and sold cocaine. Pursuant to a warrant, the police entered and searched the apartment. Defendant was inside. While he was attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>turn on a light, he dropped a bag in which there were 42 smaller, green, ziploc baggies containing 11.08 grams of cocaine that looked like the baggies found in Palmer\u2019s possession when she was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Harewood\u2019s and Palmer\u2019s statements to the police were read to the jury. Harewood\u2019s statement said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">I met Ryan Alexander and Chris Kittrell inside 55 Railroad Avenue, Apartment A-4. Both of these guys had approximately 160 bags of cracks. They got me forty-eight bags of crack. I then gave these forty-eight bags to Sandra Palmer who hides these cracks on her body. I make $30 for every $100 of crack that I sell for Ryan and Chris. These guys sell the crack sometimes right out the window, while they stay inside. They are slick! They have over one hundred bags of cracks right now in their possession. I just seen the cracks minutes before you arrested me. I work for Ryan and Chris.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Palmer\u2019s statement said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">I have forty-eight bags of cracks which Anthony Harewood, my boyfriend, gave to me. He just received them from Ryan Alexander and Chris Kittrell in Didi\u2019s <em>[ie., </em>Alexander\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s] apartment. Ryan and Chris have been selling crack out of there since they were released from jail. They started as soon as they got out. They sell to everyone. I seen them sell to people, even juveniles over fifty times. They brag [they] own the block. They use Didi\u2019s apartment to sell their crack right out the window.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">On appeal, defendant contends that reading Palmer\u2019s statement to the jury was prejudicial error because it revealed that he had been in jail and had sold crack to juveniles; that the prosecutor impermissibly expressed his own personal opinion, without support in the evidence, when he told the jury during summation that the small ziploc bags taken from Palmer were \u201cunique\u201d and of a type that he \u201chad never seen before\u201d; that <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:35-3, the \u201ckingpin\u201d statute, is unconstitutionally vague; and that the court\u2019s jury instructions failed to distinguish between that offense and such lesser offenses as distributing or conspiring to distribute' a controlled dangerous substance. Defendant also alleges that his convictions for possession and for possession with intent to distribute should have been merged, and that the mandatory DEDR penalty to which he was sentenced constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>We turn first to defendant\u2019s arguments attacking his conviction for violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-3. The statute says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">A person is a leader of a narcotics trafficking network if he conspires with others as an organizer, supervisor, financier or manager, to engage for profit in a scheme or course of conduct to unlawfully ... distribute [certain controlled dangerous substances].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">We reject the argument that the terms \u201corganizer, supervisor, financier or manager\u201d are unconstitutionally vague. The statute has been upheld against challenge on that ground in our unpublished opinions in <em>State v. Burgess, </em>A-5319-89T4 (App.Div. Feb. 16, 1993); <em>State v. Taylor and Harris, </em>A-4265-89T2 and A-4368-89T2 (App.Div. Feb. 19, 1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>10, 611 A.2d 649 (1992); and <em>State v. Afanador, </em>A-4086-88T3 (App.Div. Dec. 19, 1991), <em>certif. granted, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>601, 617 A.2d 1222 (1992). The latter case is currently pending before the Supreme Court. We are content to follow our prior decisions on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Those decisions do not dispose of defendant\u2019s challenge to his conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-3 on the ground of the alleged inadequacy of the jury charge. That ground of appeal was not asserted before the trial court, but we will consider it because of the severity of the sentence to which defendant is subject if his conviction under that section is sustained. See <em>State v. Ricci, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>39, 43, 593 A.2d 362 (App.Div.1991), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>547, 606 A.2d 362 (1991). Moreover, \u201c[c]orrect charges are essential to a fair trial\u201d and inadequate instructions on material points are presumed to be reversible error. <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2, 15, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:35-3 was enacted as part of the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1986. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-1. That Act makes a section -3 violation its most serious offense, imposing a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment with 25 years\u2019 parole ineligibility on a defendant convicted as \u201ca leader of a narcotics trafficking network.\u201d Even <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-9, which imposes strict liability for drug induced deaths, is defined as an ordinary first degree offense punishable by 10 to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. Similarly, \u201cany person who knowingly maintains or operates any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>... facility used for the manufacture of\u2019 the enumerated illegal drugs or who \u201cknowingly aids, promotes, finances or otherwise participates in the ... operations of such ... facility\u201d contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:35-4, is guilty of a first degree crime and subject to from ten to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment with mandatory parole ineligibility for from one-third to one-half of that time; a conspirator to violate section -4 would be guilty of a second-degree crime punishable by imprisonment for from five to ten years. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-4(a). Someone convicted for violating <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:35-5 by manufacturing or distributing the drugs enumerated in <em>N.J.SA </em>20:35-3 is subject to punishment for a first, second or third degree crime, depending on the kind and amount of the drugs involved. A defendant convicted of employing a juvenile in his manufacturing or distribution scheme, contrary to <em>N.J.SA </em>20:35-6, is subject to punishment for a second degree crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">If <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:35-3 is read literally, the only evidence required to establish its violation is proof that the defendant \u201cconspire[d] with others as an organizer, supervisor, financier or manager, to engage for profit in a ... course of conduct to unlawfully manufacture ... [or] distribute\u201d the controlled dangerous substances enumerated in the statute. Anyone who initiated, supervised, financed or managed a two-person conspiracy to produce or sell any quantity of the specified illegal drugs would be subject to a mandatory penalty of life-imprisonment as \u201ca leader of a narcotics trafficking network.\u201d That was substantially what the trial court instructed the jury in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Under this literal construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-3, anyone who has violated <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-6 (employing a juvenile), anyone whose violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:35-41 (maintaining or operating a controlled dangerous substance production facility) involved more than a one-person facility, and anyone who participated in a conspiracy to violate <em>N.J.SA </em>20:35-5 (manufacturing, distributing or dispensing) and was not entirely subordinate to his co-conspirator and without any discretion of his own would also be guilty of violating <em>N.J.SA </em>20:35-3 (leader of narcotics trafficking network). In our view, an interpretation of section -3 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>makes \u201ca leader of a narcotics trafficking network\u201d largely indistinguishable from someone who violates or conspires to violate one of these other sections of the drug laws would be unfaithful to the legislative purpose evidenced by the structure of the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The Declaration of Policy and Legislative Findings enacted as part of the Act state in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">In order to be effective, the battle against drug abuse and drug-related crime must be waged aggressively at every level along the drug distribution chain, but in particular, our criminal laws must target for expedited prosecution and enhanced punishment those repeat drug offenders and upper echelon members of organized narcotics trafficking networks who pose the greatest danger to society. In order to ensure the most efficient and effective dedication of limited investigative, prosecutorial, judicial and correctional resources, it is the policy of this State to distinguish between drug offenders based on the seriousness of the offense, considering principally the nature, quantity and purity of the controlled substance involved, and the role of the actor in the overall drug distribution network. It is the intention of the Legislature to provide for the strict punishment, deterrence and incapacitation of the most culpable and dangerous drug offenders____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The 1987 Legislative Commentary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-3 relates that declaration of intent to the statutory section with which we are concerned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">The express purpose of this section is to target for enhanced punishment the upper echelon members, the so-called kingpins, of an organized drug distribution scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Referring to these declarations of legislative intent, Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>Comment on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-3 (1992), observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35~3] is new, but it bears a functional resemblance to such sections as 2C:20-7.1b (dealing in stolen property) and 2C:5-2g (leader of organized crime). Those sections, like this one, include terms such as organizer, supervisor, manager etc. and limit the 2C:l-8 doctrines of merger. The clear organized crime direction of those other sections, as well as the purpose expressed in 2C:35-1.lc to punish severely \u201cupper echelon members of organized narcotics trafficking networks\u201d indicate a legislative intent that the section be read narrowly and not applied to every drug sale operation.... <em>In the absence of this context, the section could be read to provide a mandatory Ufe term with a 25 year minimum for almost every street-level dealer. </em>LEmphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">The operative language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-3 is \u201cA person is a <em>leader </em>of a narcotics trafficking <em>network </em>if he conspires with others____\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the light of the express legislative purpose, we construe \u201cleader\u201d as referring to \u201can upper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>echelon member\u201d and \u201cnetwork,\u201d to an \u201corganized drug trafficking network.\u201d These are the key phrases which distinguish an accused who is properly subject to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-3 from someone who is punishable only under some other section as a street-level dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged 718 </em>(Philip Gove ed., 1986), defines \u201cechelon\u201d as \u201cone of a series of levels or grades (as of leadership or responsibility) in an organization or field of activity.\u201d It defines \u201cnetwork\u201d as \u201can interconnected or interrelated chain, group or system (as of secret agents).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1520. <em>Webster\u2019s Dictionary of English Usage </em>380-381 (E. Ward Gilman ed., 1989), says of echelon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\"><em>Echelon </em>is originally a French word meaning literally \u201ca rung on a ladder.\u201d It was borrowed into English in the 18th century in a figurative sense denoting a step-like military formation, and it remained primarily a military word for about 150 years thereafter, developing several additional senses during that time. One military sense it had developed by the end of World War II was \u201ca level in a chain of command\u201d [Example omitted.] In this sense, <em>echelon </em>began to appear commonly in general publications: [Example omitted.] And it quickly came to be applied to civilian as well as military organizations: [Example omitted.] This is now the common use of <em>echelon.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">That source sheds no additional light on the meaning of \u201cnetwork,\u201d but <em>The Oxford Companion to the English Language, </em>686-687 (Thomas McArthur ed., 1992), defines this term as follows: \u201cA construct in which threads, wires, or other materials are arranged as or like a net; anything analogous (a railway network, a police network).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">A jury called upon to determine whether a defendant is a \u201cleader of a narcotics trafficking network\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-3 should be instructed, in substance, that to justify conviction, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that during the period alleged in the indictment the defendant functioned as an \u201cupper echelon member\u201d of an organized \u201cdrug trafficking network\u201d and, in that capacity, conspired \u201cwith others as an organizer, supervisor, financier or manager to engage for profit in a scheme or course of conduct to unlawfully manufacture, distribute, dispense, bring into or transport in this State\u201d any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the controlled dangerous substances enumerated in the statute. \u201cOrganized 'drug trafficking network\u2019\u201d should be defined as a group of individuals who, by reason of their number and interrelationships, constitute a structured organization or system engaged in the manufacture or distribution of illegal drugs. \u201cUpper echelon member\u201d should be defined as someone who stands on an upper level of the chain of command of a drug trafficking network, exercising command authority over members of that organization whose status is subordinate to his. An \u201cupper\u201d level is a level which is superior to street-level distributors and to their immediate supervisors or suppliers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">An instruction of this sort was not given to the jury in the present case. The jury therefore did not determine whether defendant\u2019s status and activities warranted the punishment which the Legislature has reserved for a \u201cleader of a narcotics trafficking network.\u201d Consequently, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-3 and remand the case for retrial of that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">As to defendant\u2019s remaining grounds of appeal, the State concedes that his conviction for possession of cocaine as charged in the seventh count of his indictment should be merged into his conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it as charged in the sixth count. The constitutionality of the mandatory DEDR penalties imposed on defendant was upheld in <em>State v. Lagares, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>20, 601 A.2d 698 (1992). Reading Harewood\u2019s and Palmer\u2019s statements into evidence without redaction and the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument to the jury about the uniqueness of the packaging of the drugs found on Palmer were harmless errors insofar as his convictions for possession and possession with intent to sell are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(l), is merged into his conviction for possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>cocaine with intent to distribute it, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5(a)(l) and - 5(b)(3). His conviction and sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it are affirmed. His conviction as a leader of a drug trafficking network, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-3, is reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-14\">The count of the indictment which charged defendant with a violation of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:35-3 alleges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0b\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>... Ryan Lee Alexander ... between August 30, 1989 and October 21, 1989 ... did conspire with Anthony D. Harewood and Sandra Palmer and C.K., an unindicted co-conspirator, known to the grand jury as an organizer, supervisor, financier or manager, to engage for profit in a scheme or course of conduct to unlawfully manufacture, distribute, dispense, bring into or transport in this State, cocaine or a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance thereof, contrary to the provisions of <em>NJ.S. </em>2C:35-3 ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The grand jury presumably intended to allege that defendant conspired \"as an organizer, supervisor, financier or manager....,\" not that C.K., one of the persons with whom he conspired had that status or performed one of those functions. Literally read, the indictment as returned is susceptible of the latter interpretation and is therefore ambiguous. However, the trial record demonstrates that both parties understood the indictment without difficulty as it was undoubtedly intended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\"> In, Richard Price, <em>Clockers </em>(1992), \u201cRodney\u201d may be a \"leader of a drug trafficking network\u201d within the meaning of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C.-35-3; \"Strike\" is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
