The Court are of opinion, that under the act of assembly of <em>November </em>1782, <em>ch. </em>23, a tenant in tail may defeat the estate tail altogether, or convey only a limited or'qualified estate; the remainder, whatever it may be, will, -in this last case, descend. But if he intends to change the estate tail to a fee simple, then a conveyance and reconveyance to himself are necessary. But if he disposes of the estate, a common deed of bargain and sale will operate to convey the estate, and vest a fee simple in the grantee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-12\">If a limited interest is\u2018 conveyed, upon the expiration of the particular interest, the tenant in tail again takes the estate tail as originally held.__.....</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>'The Court have no doubt but that a lease will have the-effect to pass the estate, for the term of years therein expressed; for if a tenant in fee simple can lease, a tenant in tail may also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-3\">It was contended, in (lie case of <em>Paca\u2019s Lessee vs. </em>For<em>wood et al. </em>that an estate tail might, under the act of 1782, foe devised by last will and testament. Rut the court said it could not; for they considered the tenant in tail, and the heir, in the situation of joint tenants, and that the estate, upon the death of the tenant in tail, survived to the heir, and as the will would not take effect until after the death of the tenant in tail, the right of the heir, by such death, had already vested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-4\">It has been said, that a mortgage executed by the teaiantintail conveyed the interest. It is not so. When the money is paid, the old estate is again revived, and the mortgage only defeats the estate tail for a limited time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-5\">The intention and meaning of the legislature are to be \u00abollected from the law itself, and they are not to be restrained by any thing in the preamble.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-6\">Upon the whole, the court are of opinion, that the lease in this case is good and valid in law to pass and transfer -the interest in the land to the lessee for the term of years therein mentioned, and when the term of years expires, the remainder-man will take the estate under the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-7\">The defendant excepted.
