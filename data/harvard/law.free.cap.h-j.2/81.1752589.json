First you say, the bond is not valid, now you threaten me with the sale of it. You tell me <em>Hammond </em>and I are in collusion. I tell you it is more probable that he and you are in collusion. Was not every thing that was done about that business at the particular request of you and your mother? And pray how is my interest connected with <em>Hammond'si </em>Exactly in the same way that I am connected with you, and every other person who has ever done any thing for me in <em>Maryland, </em>by paying an extravagant price for it all, or obligating myself so to do. You ask, if I expect to keep the bond until it becomes due, that I deceive myself. In one thing I am sure I am not deceived, that I shall not pay it twice, and I do not conceive it will be more expensive to pay it to another than to you, But you seem to think 1 must pay it to you, whether I will or not \u2014 In this let me tell you, you deceive yourself, and grossly too. You seem to think I cannot do without your mother\u2019s testimony, and that it is of essential importance to me. In this you are wrong. Yqu never knew for what purpose I wanted her testimony, nor- does she understand it herself, neither would I have told any of you, but it seems necessary to inform you to prevent you running yourselves into infamy, and such difficulties, that it will be impossible to extricate you from, The real intention on my part was to make her testimony good for nothing, which is done, she having already sworn on both sides of the question. Now you expose my bond for sale, the thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>becomes public. It must and will be considered as a bribe for which she has perjured herself. To prevent any consequence of this kind, was my inducement for exacting a promise from you of keeping the thing an inviolate secret, and which you promised on your sacred honour to perform. It was \u2022a measure I disliked in every step, but your characters and interest being both connected with keeping the secret, and your most pointed promises so to do, I thought you might be trusted without risk to yourselves; but it appears as if avarice was superior to every other consideration with you, and that without looking forward at all. Would you have a little patience, the business is in such train that it cannot be long until you will get the money; but such imprudence on your part may put it off to a later period. How do you suppose, that in justice to myself I can pay any more money, when there is any uncertainty that 1 may never get any thing in return for <em>it; </em>and you will positively receive more clear profit on the final issue of this business than I shall. This suit has already cost me upwards of S400, and will yet cos\u00ed <em>me </em>a sum I cannot calculate, besides a great loss of time. What you get, you get clear, and that without trouble or expense. Had you me in your power in such manner that you could force money from me in this way, would it not amount to absolute robbery? And do 1 deserve it at your hand in any respect? I have felt myself under obligatior s to your mother for her friendship, but if she is privy to this om-iness, it is well calculated to cancel them all. I shall bo in <em>Baltimore i\\i. two or three </em>weeks, and hope, in the. ineao time, you will think more pradenily about tills business, other-ways you must make your best of it, and I shall never have asiy connexion with -either of you again.5\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-3\">II\u00c1xsox, Chancellor, (14th of March, 1805.)

The letter-written by <em>Andrew </em>to <em>Saunders, </em>dated Ihe 20th of October 1773, shows the foundation on which the bond was executed, and exempts it from suspicion of fraud, or illicit contrivance.
