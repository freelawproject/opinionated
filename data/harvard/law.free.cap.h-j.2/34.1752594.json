That <em>Kingsmore </em>paid \u00a16300 on account of the instalment; and other sums of money, and articles or accounts were paid, which <em>Lynch </em>has, or means to apply to other instalments, although they were not due at the time. That <em>Kingsmore </em>cut down 300 cords of wood to enable him to pay up the balance of his first instalment, and to exonerate the complainant, his surety; and that <em>Lynch </em>fraudulently meditated an act of oppression which he carried into effect, by bringing suits, immediately after the first instalment became due, on the bond against <em>Kingsmore </em>and the complainant, and filing a hill in chancery, and obtaining an injunction, which prevented <em>Kingsmore </em>from getting the wood to market, and to cut other wood, &amp;c. That judgment has been obtained against the complainant by <em>Lynch, </em>who has not credited the \u00a16300, nor with such other sums of money, wood or arricies, which he may have received. The bill calls upon <em>Lynch </em>to answer, &amp;c. and to declare, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>what sums of money, &amp;c. he hath received. <em>Prayer </em>for relief, and for a <em>subpena, </em>and an <em>injunction </em>against executions issuing on the judgment, &amp;c. <em>Subpena </em>and <em>injunction </em>accordingly issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-4\">The <em>aimver </em>of <em>Lynch, </em>which was filed on the <em>25ill of November </em>1800, denies that he ever declared or agreed that the wood on the land should be cut and carried to market for the purpose of paying the instalments, (in aid of the crop,) as the same should become due or otherwise; nor was any agreement ever made by him with <em>Kings-more, </em>by which the same was <em>to </em>be paid by wood, or that wood should be cut and sold from the land for that purpose; and therefore no inducement from such agreement sould have been the motive of the complainant for becoming surety for <em>Kingsmore, </em>no such agreement having ever been made, fie admits that lie received \u00a3300 9 4, at sundry times, as appears by one of the accounts exhibited, which are all the payments whatsoever made by <em>Kings-more </em>on account of the bond in which the complainant is surety. He never denied the payments, nor- claimed to appropriate the same to any other instalment, but hath been, am! now is, ready and willing to credit the same on the bond far \u00a31200, in which tile complainant is surety. That the credits in the other account exhibited were paid and received, and applied to the discharge of another deb\u00ed due to the defendant for the articles mentioned in the debit side of that account, sold and delivered, &amp;c. and had no relation to the land purchased. That <em>Kingsmore </em>and the complainant, having failed to comply with the condition of their bond, the defendant caused suits to be instituted for the recovery of the balance due thereon, and hath obtained judgments at law. That <em>Kingsmore </em>having proceeded, against the consent of the defendant, to th^ cutting and selling timber, and other trees, growing on the laud, and clone other acts greatly endamaging the estate, and injuring the defendant, he applied for and obtained an injunction, &amp;c. He denies all fraud, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">ILvx-sok, Chancellor, (November 25th, 1800.) The defendant having put in his answer, and entered on the docket notice o\u00ed motion to dissolve the injunction in this cause issued, it is at his instance, ordered, that the motion stand for hearing at next term; provided a copy of this or?<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the complainant before the end of the der be served on present month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-8\">. A .service of the above order was proved to have been made, on the 27th of November, 1800.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-9\">Hanson, Chancellor, (January 6th, 1801.) The motion to dissolve, &amp;c. being submitted, &amp;c. The Chancellor must, on this occasion, repeat a rule, which he has always adhered to, and which he conceived was well known\u2014 \u201cWhenever, on motion to dissolve, it appears from the answer that the complainant was entitled to an injunction at the time of obtaining it, the same shall continue until final hearing, or further order, unless the defendant admits every thing alleged inthebill, on account of which the injunction was obtained.\u201d When that admission is made, and the injunction has been to stay execution at law, the injunction may be dissolved with a proviso, that not more be levied than remains clue after allowing every thing claimed by the. complainant; but when a proper ground for the injunction is admitted by jhe answer, and there still remains a dispute between the parties, the injunction is invariably continued until final hearing, or further order. Great and obvious inconveniencies would follow from a different pvac-. tice. In tire present case, it appears from the answer, that the complainant, at the time of obtaining his injunction, was liable to an execution, (if liable to an execution at all,) for more than was due, but in admitting this, the defendant denies the other grounds of equity; he denies that the complainant is entitled to all tice deductions which he claims, so that a dispute remains between the parties. This case, like many other cases, shows, that taking an indefinite judgment does little for the plaintiff at law, but affords a fair pretext to the defendant at law for further delay, and is almost sure to produce a fresh suit between the parties. It is thereupon adjudged and ordered, that the injunction, in this cause heretofore issued, shall continue until final hearing of the cause, or further order. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-10\">The complainant entered a general replication to the answer of the defendant, and a commission issued, and testimony taken thereunder, and the cause submitted, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-11\">Hanson, Chancellor, (October term 1801.) It appears to the Chancellor that the defendant, from his conduct, ought to be considered as having released the complainant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>from Ms engagement. it is plain from flic evidence, that the defendant had at least impressed the complainant, before he became r-ecuiity for <em>Khtgsinore, </em>with an idea, that the rn.mev would, or might be, paid from the sale o\u00ed timber, ami oilier wood, on the laud, and it ia extremely probable, if not certain, that the complainant was thereby induced to become a surety. Whether or not, without that inducement he would have become security, is not material. It is certain that if his engagement remains binding, he ha.-t been o;- wav Le gioafry injined by the defendant's obtaining an injunction; and tiic question is, whether he shall sustain that injury, or the defendant, who has done the wrong, be deprived of one pa-i of his security? The Chancellor on this question cannot hed\u00edate, and on the paper,-; and pi oceedings in the cause does not perceive how he can do otherwise than decree a perpetual injunction. <em>Deemed, </em>that the injunction, heretofore issued in this cause, be perpetual, but that each party bear his own costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-4\">Yroiii which decree the defendant \u00bfappealed to this court; .and the case '\u00bfLauding under <em>rule argument </em>at this tena, the <em>uppc?l(m\u2018,ti </em>death was suggested, and the case was entered <em>dialed </em>(a.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-8\">S'idgahi, <em>Johnson, </em>(Attorney-General,) and <em>W.
