The bill in this case was filed by the present appellant against <em>Archibald Robinson, Abraham Jarrelt, </em>aud the administrators of <em>Ralph Bondi </em>It stated that the' complainant had been sheriff and Collector of <em>Harford </em>coiirity, and that he appointed <em>Robinson </em>one of his deputies,- who gave two bonds, one as deputy sheriff and the other as deputy collector, cririditioned for the faithful performance of hi\u00bb duties; that in the bond as deputy sheriff <em>Jarrelt </em>was his surety, and in that as deputy collector <em>Ralph Bond </em>was his surety. That <em>Robinson </em>having greatiy defaulted in his duty, and being largely in arrear to the complainant, suits were brought on both the bends, and, judgments obtained against him on each bond at March term 1790, for a large sum of money. That <em>Robinson, </em>being seized and possessed of considerable real and personal estate, and for the purpose of fraudulently deceiving and injuring the complainant, a few days before the obtentiou of <em>the </em>judgments against him, conveyed his real estate to <em>Jarrelt </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>\u00a1Band, </em>in fee simple, \u00e1ppareutly and for the pretended consideration of J\u00e1CO, when in truth the conveyance was tesecuted without consideration of money, and intended to guarantee and indemnify <em>Jarrett </em>and <em>Bond </em>as sureties in the said bonds, who hav'e never been damnified, or paid the complainant any thing on account of <em>Robinson, </em>but hold and enjoy the real estate, and also the personal property of <em>Robinson, </em>also conveyed to them since the judgments* as a further indemnity. That they have permitted <em>Robinson to </em>sell part of the personal estate for his own use and benefit, &amp;c.\u201d <em>Prayer </em>for a disclosure of the trusts, and vacation of the deeds, &amp;c.. and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b331-4\">The <em>answers </em>of the defendants admit that the deeds Were executed for the purpose of indemnifying and securing <em>Jarrett </em>and <em>Bond, </em>as securities for <em>Robinson. </em>That <em>Jarrett </em>had become <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>surety to other persons, and be had a claim against him also on an open account, and for money lent, and the conveyances were not only to secure him as surety to the complainant, but also to secure the payment of the money due, or for which he was so answerable, to other persons. That the defendants were ready and willing that the property should be sold, and the proceeds applied to the discharge of the claims due <em>Jarrett </em>and <em>Bond, </em>and the residue to discharge <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>debts. The answers also stated, that <em>Robinson </em>was prevailed upon to confess judgments lip\u00f3n the terms of all payments and discounts made appear, to be allowed, and which the complainant now refused to allow, and that they can prove, that but a small sum of money, if any, is due on the judgments, upon a fair and just settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b331-5\"><em>Testimony </em>was taken under a commission as to the amount duo to the complainant, and the account was audited by the auditor, stating the sum of <em>\u00a3395 </em>6 8, current money, exclusive of interest, <em>to </em>he due to the complainant, and ill48 18 10 current money, exclusive of interest, due to <em>Jarrett </em>from <em>Robinson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-8\">IIanson, Chancellor, (December term 1804.) When a man becomes security for another* and is answerable for his debt, the chancellor cannot conceive there is any fraud in the principal\u2019s conveying properly to secure him, and likewise to secure the payment of ally advances that may <em>be </em>afterwards made by the security. In short, the chan\u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>cellor docs not perceive that the creditor, haring taken <em>&amp; </em>surety for his debt* has a right to vacate any conveyance made to the surety by the pWncipnl for the purpose of \u00a1counter security. The situation of the surety would be hard if the rule were otherwise. The circumstance of the sureties afterwards becoming insolvent, supposing that to be fairly a part of the c\u00e1se, which it is not, the chancellor conceives lias no effect on the case. But inasmuch as the surety, to whom the conveyance is made, is answerable to the principal, and is to be considered .as trustee to <em>the </em>principal for any surplus remaining after the surety is secured, and the law gives a recourse to the equitable interest of a man against whom a judgment lias been obtained, the chancellor is of opinion* and it is adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the land conveyed to the defendant, <em>Abraham Jarrett, </em>as stated in the bill, be sold for the purpose of paying, in the first place, the debt due from <em>Robinson </em>to Jarrett, and then to discharge the debt due to the complainant; the said debts being established, <em>or to </em>be established, by this court. That <em>John </em>Moores, esquire, be and lie is hereby appointed trustee for making sale, &amp;c.
