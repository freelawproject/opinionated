The bill, filed by the present appellees in 1801, stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Richard Robinson, </em>being seized in fee of several tracts of land, on the 1st of May 1778, borrowed J\u00dc170 of the then current money, of <em>R. T. B. Worthington, </em>whose executors and representatives the appellants are, and executed a mortgage of his said lands, and sundry slaves, &amp;c. for the payment of the said sum of money, with interest thereon, on the 1st of September then next ensuing. That <em>Robin - son </em>being about to leave the state, on the 6th of October 1782, applied to <em>Worthington </em>to release the personal property mortgaged, as the land was amply sufficient for the payment of the mortgage debt, which he refused to do unless <em>Robinson </em>would endorse on the mortgage the sum of money then due in gold and silver, which he agreed to, and the sum then stated to be due was <em>\u00a3145 3 3 </em>gold and silver, current money. That on the 15th of October 1783, <em>Robinson </em>assigned all his right, and equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises, to <em>Ninian Riggs. </em>That <em>Robinson, </em>after the mortgage, became indebted to the complainant, <em>Bicknell, </em>for money actually paid and advanced. That <em>Robinson, </em>in consideration thereof, and in consequence of a contract between the complainant and <em>Riggs, </em>agreed that the right of redemption in the mortgaged premises should he conveyed to the complainant, and a deed was accordingly executed. That the complainant having obtained the conveyance, and being interested in the payment of the mortgage debt, was applied to by <em>Worthington </em>on the subject, who represented to the complainant that there was then due from <em>Robinson </em>to him, lor principal and interest, the sum of <em>\u00a3171 </em>6 0, on the 26th of February <em>1791, and </em>that the complainant could not and should not obtain the benefit of the equity of redemption by a release of the mortgage, unless he gave him his bond for that sum of money; and that the complainant, confiding in the representations of <em>Worthington, </em>gave his bond accordingly. That <em>Worthington </em>is since dead, and <em>J, </em>Worthington, one of the defendants, is his executor, who has brought an action at law on the bond, and obtained a judgment. That the executor, and the other defendants, on the 25th of July 1795, filed a bill against <em>Robinson, Riggs, </em>and the complainant, for a sale or foreclosure of the equity of redemption of the mortgaged premises. That by the answers to that bill, and the evidence taken, it appears that the sum loaned by <em>Worthington </em>to <em>Robinson, </em>and the mortgage taken, waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>secure the payment of continental money, and that the sum ^ue\u2019 ca^cu^ating i*s worth by the scale of depreciation, with legal interest, had been paid off or reduced to the sum. of ^9 5 2 current money, on the 13th of December 1798\u00bb That the executor of <em>Worthington </em>is indebted to the complainant in the sum of \u00bf\u00a313 17 6, current money, for articles charged in the account exhibited. <em>Prayer </em>for a perpetual <em>injunction </em>against execution issuing on the judgment at law, and to compel a release of the mortgaged premises, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">On the coming in of the <em>answers, </em>and on the testimony taken in the cause, amongst which was that of <em>Robinson, </em>the <em>Auditor </em>was directed to state an account between the parties. He made various statements, to which both parties excepted, and by the Chancellor\u2019s order he made one, wherein the money loaned to <em>Robinson </em>on the mortgage, viz. \u00bfS170 continental money, xvas charged against <em>Bichnell </em>at <em>5 </em>for 1, with the interest thereon, and after crediting payments made at various times, and the costs on the bill filed by the executors, &amp;c. of <em>Worthington, </em>which they had dismissed, left abalance due to the complainant, on the 1st \u2022of March 1804, of <em>\u00a310 </em>111, current money,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">Hanson, Chancellor, (7th March, 1804,) decreed, that the injunction issued be perpetual; and that each party pay his own costs, &amp;c.
