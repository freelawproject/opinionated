The bill filed by the appellees against the appellants, on the 16th of January 1795, stated that <em>J-HUiam Parks, </em>deceased, was seized \u00e1nd possessed of a tract of land in <em>Ballimore </em>county called <em>Turkey Cock Alley, </em>containing 50 acres, which by virtue of a special warrant,- was on the 10th of July 1754 resurveyed for him, and a certificate thereof re* turned into the land office, by which he caused to be added 102 acres of land supposed to be vacant, and consolidated the whole into one survey by the same name of <em>Turkey Cock </em>Alley. That Parks, neglecting <em>to </em>compound for the added vacancy within the time required, a proclamation warrant was thereupon granted to <em>Edward Stevenson, </em>and he, on the 22d of February 1764, assigned the same to <em>Parks, </em>who by virtue of the warrant of proclamation and assignment, on the 28th of the same month, had resurveyed for him the added vacancy before mentioned, excluding seven acres thereof as being within the lines of elder surveys, and upon the resurvey caused to be added the quantity of 127 acres of vacant land, giving to the whole the name of <em>Parks's Death Knot; </em>and on the 5th of March 1764, he obtained a patent on the certificate. That on the 14th of April 1764, <em>Parks </em>executed and delivered to <em>Joshua Cockey, </em>deceased, a bond of conveyance for 120 acres of the land called <em>Parks's Death Knot, </em>by which bond it was, as the complainants believe, intended to se\u00ab cure to <em>Cockey </em>120 acres of the vacancy added on the proclamation warrant, forming the southernmost parts of <em>Parks's </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>.Death Knot. </em>That before <em>Parks </em>obtained the assignment from <em>Stevenson, </em>(which was procured by <em>Cockey,) or </em>at the tune of such assignment, it was agreed between <em>1arks </em>and <em>Cockey, </em>that as <em>Parks </em>was unable to pay the caution money on the certificate to be returned in virtue of the assignment, <em>Cockey </em>should pay the same, and should have, for such payment, 120 acres of the laud, to be secured by the certificate; in consequence whereof <em>Cockey </em>did pay the caution money, and thereupon patent issued, as before stated, to <em>Parks, </em>and the bond of conveyance was given in pursuance of the agreement. That <em>Parks, </em>in his life-time, although he never made any conveyance in pursuance of the bond, always acknowledged the right of <em>Cockey, </em>and always was ready and disposed to make the conveyance. <em>That Parks </em>died about 10 years ago intestate, leaving a son named <em>William Parks, </em>(one of the defendants,) of full age, hjs heir at law, who hath also at different times acknowledged the bond of conveyance, and the equitable right thereby created. That <em>Cockey </em>died some time in 1765, having first duly made his will, dated the 3d of December 3764, whereby, among other things, he devised as follows: \u201cItem. I give, and bequeath to my eldest daughter <em>Penelope Deye Cockey, </em>100 acres of land, being part of a tract of land known by the name of <em>Parks\u2019s Death Knot, </em>lying in the county aforesaid, which said parcel of land I give and devisa unto her and her heirs for ever;\u201d and of the said will constituted and appointed <em>Thomas Cockey Deye </em>sole executor. That <em>Joshua Cockey </em>left the complainant, <em>Thomas Deye Cockey, </em>his eldest son and heir at law, then an infant under the age of 21 years, and also the other children mentioned in the will. And that after the death of <em>Joshua Cockey, </em>his executor proved his.will, and took out letters thereon, and, among other papers of <em>Joshua Cockey, </em>came to the possession of the bond of conveyance, and kept the same in his possession until the 4th of February 1793, when he delivered it to the complainant, <em>T. D. Cockey, </em>as heir at law of <em>J, Cockey. </em>That <em>Penelope Deye Cockey, </em>afterwards intermarried with <em>Thomas Gist, </em>and she and her husband are two of the complainants in this cause. That <em>Thomas Deye Cockey, </em>one of the complainants, believing that the whole of the land intended to be secured by the bond of conveyance was meant to be devised to <em>Penelope peye Cockey, </em>now <em>Gist, </em>by the will of <em>Joshua Cockey, al-* </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>though only 100 acres are therein mentioned, did on the 17th of January 1794, execute a bond of conveyance; by Winch he bound himself to convey to her, m fee, all Ins, fight, title apd interest, in the said land. That on the 19th of December 1789, <em>Parks, </em>the yopnger, gold and convey- \u25a0 pd papt of <em>Paxks\u2019s Death Knot </em>to <em>J.pb Hun tt, </em>(one of the defendants;) and that the land included, within the metes and bounds in that conveyance, is the south east part of the land intended to be secured by the bopd of conveyance before mentioned; and that <em>Huntt, </em>had fujl knowledge pf the bond, and had seen and read it, and well knew the premises at the time of his purchase, apd before t]ie making of the conyeyance to him. That on the 13th of March 1790, <em>Parks, </em>for the purpose of indemnifying and securing <em>Huntt </em>from all claims \u00bfgainst the land so; conveyed to him, did by another deed convey to hipi jn fee all the residue of <em>Parks's Death Knot,, </em>yvith proviso that if <em>Parks </em>should indemnify him from all claims against the land first conveyed to <em>Huntt, </em>the last mentioned conveyapee should be void. That on the 10th of April 1790, among the other lands, conveyed to <em>Huntt </em>in fee all the tract called <em>Turkey Cock AD </em>fey, with an exception as to \u00bfsmall part thereof, and also all the tract callee] <em>Dqrfys\u2019s Death Knot, </em>excepting 31 acres thereof before conveyed t\u00f3 <em>Huntt </em>by the deed first herein referred to, and algo excepting 120 acres of that tract, for which the bond pf conveyance was given. That <em>Parks, </em>the elder, at sundry times, and down to the time of his death, applied t\u00f3 <em>Deye, </em>as executor of <em>Cockey, </em>to pay various assessments and charges on the 12\u00d3 acres of land in the bond of conveyance mentioned, alleging, that as the land belonged to the estate of <em>Cockey, </em>\u00bf11 charges thereon pught to be paid out of his estate; in consequence of which applications <em>Deye, </em>as executor of <em>Cockey, </em>paid all such assessments and charges as were exhibited fp him by <em>Parks, </em>who acknowledged the bond of. conveyance, and that the consideration of the bond had been duly paid, and frequently offered to <em>Deye </em>to malee hip a Conveyance, of the. jand mentioned in the bond, as'executor pf <em>Cockey, </em>&amp;c. That, in the deed of conveyance last'before referred to, <em>parks, </em>the youpger\u2019, and <em>limit, </em>(the defendants,) have both acknowledged the bond pf\u2019conveyance,\u2019' and an existing right under ap(f in virtue of . the same.' \u2019\u2019 That <em>Huntt, </em>in pppsequenpe of\u2019 lije conveyances to him from <em>Parks, </em>hatb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>entered into and taken possession of the land therein mem-, tioned. <em>Prayer, </em>that the defendants may be compelled <em>to convey </em>to the complainant, <em>Penelope Deye Gist, </em>in fee simple, or to such of'the complainants as may be thereto entitled, the 120 acres of land by the bond of conveyance meant and intended to be conveyed; and for other and further relief, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-4\">Exhibit, (among others.) The bond of conveyance from <em>Parks </em>and wife, to <em>Joshua Cockey, </em>dated the 14th of April, J 764, in the penal sum of *.\u2019500, and conditioned a.s follows: \u201cThe condition of this obligation is such, that if the above bounden <em>William Parks, </em>and <em>Eleanor </em>liis wife, and each and every of them, and each and every of their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, dp and shall, upon demand and at the request, cost and charges, of the above named <em>Joshua Cockey, </em>liis heirs or assigns, well and truly convey and assure, or cause to be conveyed and assured untohim, the said <em>Joshua Cockey, </em>his heirs and assigns, for ever, all the estate, right, title and interest, of them the said <em>William Parks, </em>and <em>Eleanor </em>his wife, aqd \u00ed\u00edieir heirs, and each and every of them, of, in and to, one hundred and twenty acres of lapd called <em>Pftrks\u2019s Death Knot, </em>situate, lying and being, in the county of <em>Baltimore </em>aforesaid, with the appeytenances thereunto belonging or appertaining, now in the possession or opeppatiou of them the said <em>William </em>Paries, and <em>Eleanor </em>his wife, by such sufficient conveyances anti assurances in the law, as by the said <em>Joshua Cockey, </em>liis heirs or assigns, or his qr their counsel learned in the law, shall ' advise and require; then the said obligation to be void and of none effect, or else to be and remain in full force and virtue in law.\u201d \"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">The <em>answers </em>of the defendants stated, among other filings which it is not material to notice, that they weye totally ignorant for what consideration the land wqs to be conveyed, or what part of the land was intended fo be conveyed; and they did pot know or admit that the southernmost or south easternmost parts wqs intended to be conveyed under the bopd of conveyance. That <em>Cockey, </em>or any person claiming under him, neper was in possession of anv part of the land \u2014 nor did they ever hear at any time that <em>Cockey </em>was, by virtue of the contract, entitled to the southpnmost or south easternmost part. TJjat Penelopeone qf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the complainants, came of full age 15 years past or more, and <em>T. I). Cockey, </em>(one other of the complainants.) not less than 11 or 12 years past. That <em>Parks, </em>the grantor, and after his death, <em>Parks, </em>the son, were willing to comply with the bond of conveyance, and convey to <em>Cockey, </em>or to whomsoever was entitled under the bond, whatever land they were thereby entitled to have cpnveyed to them; but no person chose to come forward and receive a conveyance, or ascertain what part of the land he, she or they, were entitled to under the said contract. That on the 23d of October 1789, <em>Parks, </em>being desirous of selling the residue of the land to extricate himself from difficulties under which he then suffered, did advertise publickly in the <em>Maryland Journal and Baltimore </em>Jldoertiser, requesting any person who was entitled to the benefit of thp bond of conveyance to appear, prefer their claim, and receive a conveyance for the land they might be entitled to thereby. That <em>T. I)., Cockey </em>and <em>Penelope JDeye Gist, </em>were then both of full age, and that neither of them did apply to receive the conveyance, although thus called upon. That <em>Parks </em>was at that time under execution, and had no method of freeing himself therefrom but by a sale of some part of his lands. That he applied to <em>Huplt, </em>and proposed to sell him a part of his lands in order to raise money to free himself from the execution; and in consequence <em>Huntt </em>purchased from <em>Parks </em>the lands mentioned in the deed of the 19th of December 1789, which was then supposed to contain 31 acres, for which <em>Huntt </em>paid six dollars per acre, That the land being found to contain eight and a quarter acres more, he paid for the surplus on the 15th of March 1791. That <em>Huntt </em>was induced to purchase the particular part of thq land described in that deed, because it lay adjoining to lands which he then owned; and the greatest part thereof actually ran in, and lay between, two tracts of land owned by him. That <em>Huntt </em>had seen and knew of the bond of conveyance \\vhich had been so executed by <em>Parks, </em>the elder, to <em>J. Cockey, </em>ar,d had advised with counsel as to the effect thereof, and it was by the advice of coungel that he made his purchase. That on the 10th of April 1790, <em>Parks </em>executed a deed to <em>Huntt </em>for the lands, therein mentioned, which was intended to secure to <em>Huntt </em>the payment of \u00bf388 3 6, then due to him, with interest. <em>Huntt </em>admitted, that on the 13th of March 1790, <em>Parks, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>executed in due form of law another conveyance to him, the object and intention of which was to secure and guarantee to him the lands first sold to him; that after deducting the lands so conveyed by <em>Parks </em>to <em>Iluntt </em>by the first conveyance, there remained a greater quantity of <em>Parks'a Death Knot, </em>than was contracted by the bond ot conveyance to be conveyed to <em>Cocksy. </em>That they were instructed, that after the length of time which had elapsed since the execution of the bond of conveyance, without the complainants either possessing the land so alleged to have been contracted to be sold to their father, or claiming an execution of the contract, the complainants were not, nor was either of them, entitled to the aid of this court specifically to execute the contract to the prejudice of <em>Iluntt, </em>who is a purchaser for a valuable and <em>bona fule </em>consideration; and they claimed the benefit of the laches of the complainants, and of those under whom they claimed, and of the length of time, as fully and to ail intents and purposes as if they had pleaded the same, and relied thereon for their plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\"><em>Testimony </em>was taken and returned under a commission; and the lands were directed to be surveyed, and a plot thereof was returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">Kilty, Chancellor, (July term 1806.) The chancellor is of opinion from the evidence, that the bond of conveyance was intended to secure 130 acres of the vacancy added on the proclamation warrant taken out by <em>Edward Stevenson, </em>and assigned to <em>William Parks, </em>on which a survey was made the 28th of February 1/64, as appears by the certificate returned to the land office, being in the whole 127 acres. And also that it was intended to exclude the part added as the third vacancy, although the third vacancy is returned as containing only six acres. The first and second vacancy added are returned as containing, the one six, and the other ] 15 acres, making together 121 acres instead of 120, which it may be inferred from the evidence they were supposed to contain by the parties to the bond. The complainant, <em>Penelope Deye Gist, </em>is therefore entitled under the will, and bond of conveyance from <em>Thomas Deye Lackey, </em>which are not contested, to a conveyance for that part of <em>Parks's Death Knot, </em>which is claimed by the bill.
