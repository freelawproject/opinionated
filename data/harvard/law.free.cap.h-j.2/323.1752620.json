This was a petition for freedom, preferred by the appellant. At the trial lie offered evidence to the jury to prove, that in .January 1795, <em>Nathan Harris </em>was the owner of the petitioner; <em>that by </em>parol he sold him to <em>Jesse Harris </em>in that year, for seven years, for <em>\u00a36p, </em>and that at the end of that time the petitioner was to be free. <em>Jesse </em>and <em>Nathan Harris, </em>at the time of the sale <em>of </em>the petitioner, did agree by <em>parol,, </em>and it was part of the bargain, that <em>Jesse </em>should at the end of seven years, from the time of the sale, or sooner if be pleased to do so, manumit and set the petitioner free. The petitioner was delivered by <em>Nathan </em>to <em>Jesse, </em>and served <em>Jesse </em>until about the month of January 1799. In February 1799, <em>Nathan, </em>without the consent of <em>Jessi:P </em>sold the petitioner as a slave to. <em>Howard, </em>who soon after took the petitioner into his custody as a slave, and still holds him as such. On the 2d of March 1799, <em>Jesse </em>executed a deed of manumission of the petitioner, which was duly acknowledged and recorded. Nathan, after his sale \u00bfo <em>Jesse, </em>several times declared that he had. no right to the petitioner, and that <em>Jesse </em>was the person who was to set him free. On these facts the petitioner prayed the opinion of the court, and their instruction to the jury, that if they were of opinion from the evidence, that <em>Jesse Harris </em>pur - chased the petitioner from <em>Nathan Harris </em>in the year 1795, for seven years, and that it was part <em>o\u00ed </em>the terms of sale and purchase, that <em>Jesse </em>should, at the end of seven years or sooner, if he chose to do so, set free and manumit the petitioner, that <em>the </em>petitioner was entitled to his freedom for life by the aforesaid deed of manumission, if the petitioner was, at the time of the execution of that deed, of healthy constitution and sound in mind and body, and capable by labour to procure sufficient food and raiment, with other requisite necessaries of life, and was not mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>than forty-five years of age. But the court, (Clagett* Cli. J.) was of opinion, and so instructed the jury, that if they should find that the sale and purchase between <em>Nathan </em>aud <em>Jesse </em>Harris, was as above stated, that the petitioner is not entitled to freedom under the deed of manu-: mission. The petitioner <em>excepted; </em>and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b334-8\">The cause was argued before Tilgiim an, Polk, and Buchanan, <em>if. </em>by</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-9\"><em>Martin, </em>for the Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZM\">and by</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-10\"><em>Mason, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b334-11\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO AWARDEDa</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
