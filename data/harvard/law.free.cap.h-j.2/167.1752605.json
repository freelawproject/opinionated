The defendant then gave in evidence, that <em>Leonard, </em>(the second,) before and at th\u00e9 ' time of his petition to the general assembly in 1756; and \u00e1t the time of th\u00e9 passage of the law; herein before insert-fed, had issue two infant daughters, <em>Sarah, </em>born in 1754$ afterwards inarried to <em>Thomas Johns, </em>and <em>Anne, </em>born in <em>1755, </em>afterwards inarried to <em>Walter B. </em>Cox; that in the year \u00cd757, <em>Leonard, </em>(the second,) had a son, <em>Leonard,</em>(the third,) who afterwards died in 1793, without issue male, leaving his father and two sisters his survivors; and that th\u00e9 youngest of the sisters, Ann\u00e9; was 15 years older than <em>Leonard, </em>(the third.) That <em>Leonard, </em>(the second,) died iii \u00cd794, and his tiro daughters, Mrs. <em>Johns </em>and Mrs; <em>Cox, </em>survived him. And afterwards Mrg; <em>Johns, </em>and her husband, died, add her sister, Mrs. <em>Cox, </em>and her husband* survived them; on the death of <em>Leonard^ </em>(the second,) without issue iha\u00ed\u00e9, <em>Waller B.

The plaintiff then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>prayed the court to, instruct the jury, that upon the afore\u00bb said evidence, if they believed the facts so offered in evidence to be true, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-3\">Chase, Ch. J. In this case, the counsel have said every thing which could be suggested upon the subject. They have made use of ingenious arguments. There cart be no doubt but it has been fully and ably argued on both sides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-4\">The court think, that the intention, of the legislature is to prevail, and that intention is to be collected from the whole of the law, and the circumstances,which produced it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">The case is to be considered, 1st. What was the intention of the legislature? 2d. Have they used cleat' words to express that intention? 3d. What is the effect of the enacting clause, and does it carry their intention into efv feet?.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">The. motive.does not satisfactorily appear; but facts do appear in the petition, as recited in the act, which are, that the land would, by the will, vest in <em>Thomas', </em>that <em>Leonard </em>had no son, but he had daughters who could not inherit; that he had improved, the land, and had a solicitude to provide for his daughters. It is apparent to the court, that. <em>Leonard </em>had little.or. no expectation of having any other children; he.liad in view to providp for the children he then had. <em>Thomas, </em>his brother, knowing of the improvements made on the land by <em>Leonard^ </em>and actuated by motives of affection, concurred in the petition. It appears that the; operation under the will was intended to be suspended. The petition sets forth, that <em>Leonard </em>had \u2018.\u2018only female, heirs, who could npt inherit.\u201d This was nothing more than, a description of the persons who were to take under the law. The prayer of the petition was \u201cto vest in the female.heirs.\u201d of <em>Leonard Hollyday, </em>in fee simple. \u201cFemale heirs\u201d- meant the two daughters of <em>Leonard Holly~ day, </em>and-that the.estate was to vest <em>immediately </em>in them. It appears that the petition had in view to provide for the two daughters. The legislature granted the petition. Has the enacting elapse carried the intention into effect? \u201cshall be and are hereby vested in the said female heirs.\u201d The intention must be to vest the estate in tl\\p daughters <em>then in being. </em>It is a plain designation of the persons who \u25a0were to take; and that an estate in fee simple should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>vested in the two daughters, to he defeated only upon the happening of two contingencies. If the events, or either, of them, had happened, the estate in, fee simple would have, divested, and let in the operation of the will. This shows, that by the act there was to be a suspension of the estate. It was tlie act of the father providing for his children, with a proviso in case of male heirs, or the death of his daughters without issue. <em>Thomas </em>made a greater sacrifice than <em>Leonard.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-6\">'VV'hat would be the effect if tlie construction contended for on the other side was to prevail? It would be putting it in the power of one party to defeat the provisions of the, legislature. Such a construction could never be admitted^ The, children of <em>Leonard Hollyday, </em>(the third,) never could have inherited under the will.\" '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-7\">The court are of opinion, that an estate in fee simple vested in the two daughters of <em>Leonard Hollyday, </em>which estate was tobe defeated and divested.out of the daughters* on the happening of either of - two contingencies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-8\"><em>First. </em>If <em>Leonard- Hollyday, </em>(the second,) left issue . male at the time of- his death.\" \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-9\">Second.

The defendant then read- in evidence a deed- <em>of mortgage </em>from <em>Leonard Hollyday, </em>(the third,) to <em>Benjamin.

That <em>Leonard, </em>(2&lt;J,) still continued tenant in tail, as before, with a limitation to his female heirs in case of his dying without issue, male, with power of alienation, &amp;c, and that his deed to <em>Leonard, </em>(3d,) of the 1st of February 1791, barred the estate tail, and vested a fee in the grantee. 2. Or, that the act gave the estate beyond this control of the tenant, to sucli persons as at the time of the death of <em>Jjeonard, </em>(2d,) answered the description of his heirs female, as purchasers, including all those who, gt his death .in 1794, would have been his heirs female, viz. his two. daughters, Mrs. <em>Johns </em>and Mrs. <em>Cox, </em>and also his granddaughters, the children of <em>Leonard, </em>(3d.) 3. Or, that the act gave the estate beyond the control of the tenant to such persons, as, according to the meaning of the terms \u25a0when the law passed in 1756, answered the description of heirs female of <em>Leonard, </em>(2d;) that is, females who were heirs also, vbf, the daughters, the heirs <em>of-Leonard, </em>(3d.)
