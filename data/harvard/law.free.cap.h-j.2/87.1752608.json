To all concerned.\u201d The defendant then read in evidence, the certificate of <em>Conococheague Manor, </em>whereby was rcsurveyed on the 25th of October 1736, by order of <em>Samuel Ogle, </em>Esquire, Governor of <em>Maryland, </em>for the use of the Lord Proprietary, his Lordship\u2019s Manor of land, lying in <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county, called <em>Conegocheig Manor, </em>according to its first intended bounds, beginning, &amp;c. containing 10,594 acres of land. He then read in evidence the warrant which issued on the 6th of June 1752, to <em>Charles </em>Cheney, for 50 acres, lie having paid-50s. sterling, caution for the same; and he offered- to prove, that in pursuance of that warrant, a survey was made for <em>Cheney </em>on the 15th of November, 1752, and a certificate' thereof returned in 1762, for a tract of land called <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight, </em>containing 96 acres of land, to be' held of <em>Conegocheigue Manor; </em>and that the certificate of survey was examined and passed on the 30th of March 1754, and the composition money was paid thereon in April 1762. He also offered to prove, that <em>Cheney </em>immediately after the survey, entered on the land, claiming the whole as his right and property, and died in possession thereof in 1780; and that the certificate of survey, and the land therein included, called <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight, </em>are truly located by the defendant on the' plots in this cause. And that <em>Cheney </em>built on, improved and cultivated part, and cut and used the wood growing thereon, claiming the whole until his death, as his right and property; and that the defendant, on the death of <em>Cheney, </em>his father, entered on the said land, claiming the whole as his property, according to the location and certificate aforesaid. And that <em>Cheney, </em>the ancestor, and the defendant, planted orchards, and held by actual enclosure and cultivation for more than <em>twenty-seven </em>years next preceding the bringing of this ejectment, all that part of <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight </em>which is contained within the lines shaded blue, -as located and described on the plots, claiming the enclosed land, and the whole of the tract, as their own proper estate and right; and that all the land, as located within <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight, </em>exterior to the enclosures shaded blue, has been claimed and used by <em>Cheney, </em>and those claiming under him, as part of <em>Cheney\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>jidighl, </em>exterior to the enclosures shaded Hue, has been claimed and used by Cheney, and those claiming under him, as part of <em>Cheney\u2019s </em>Delight, \u00bfver since the year 1762, by cutting wood and rail, and other timber thereon, for the use and purposes of their dwelling and farm, on said land; and that no other person whatever has at any time used, enjoyed, or cut any of the wood or timber on the land, except Cheney, and that no person has claimed the same, or any part thereof, except that a claim has been setup by the lessors of the plaintiff, and those under whom they claim. That <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight </em>is included within the lines of a tract of land called <em>The Number of Two. </em>The plaintiff then showed in evidence, that on the certificate of survey of <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight, </em>no patent ever issued, and that the reason why a patent was refused upon that certificate, is indorsed thereon in the words following, viz. \u201cNo patent to iSvSue on this certificate, by order of his Excellency, being within the rcsewe of <em>Comegoeheigue. </em>' '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-4\">Test. <em>IF.

He then read in.evidence a deed from <em>Jordania Thomas Ring-gold, </em>dated the 26th of October 1770, for the land called <em>The Number of </em>Two; also the will of <em>Thomas Ringgold, </em>dated the 16th of February 1774, whereby lie devised the said land to <em>Benjamin Ringgold, </em>his son, in fee simple. And he proved, that <em>B. Ringgold </em>died on the 26th of August 1798, without child, and intestate, whereby the said laud descended to his three brothers, <em>'/'liornas, Samuel, </em>and Tench, and his sister <em>JLvna </em>Marie, who before this ejectment was brought was and still is a married woman, the wife of <em>Frisby Tilghtnan; </em>that the Iasi named <em>Thomas Ringgold, </em>by deed o\u00ed bargain and sale, on the -day of October 1798, conveyed all his interest in the said land to his two brothers <em>Samuel </em>anti <em>Tench, </em>which said <em>Samuel </em>and <em>Tench, </em>together with <em>Frisby Tilghnan, </em>and <em>Anna Maria </em>his wife, are the lessors of the plaintiff. That <em>Jordan, </em>the patentee, entered upon <em>The Number of 'Two, </em>claiming title to the whole thereof, according to his right, until he sold the same to <em>'Thomas Ringgold. </em>That <em>T.

Ringgold, </em>respectively entered upon tire said land, and by himself and themselves, and his and their tenants, possessed and enjoySd a part thereof by actual cultivation and enclosure* and claimed title to the whole thereof, according to his and their respective \"rights, viz. <em>T. Ring gold </em>until hjs death in November 1776; <em>B. Ringgold </em>until hid death in August 1798; and the lessors of the plaintiff until the time of bringing this ejectment. <em>That Jordan </em>resided in the city of <em>Annapolis, </em>distant from the land upwards of 100 miles. That <em>T. Ringgold, </em>the elder, resided at <em>Chesler-Town'm </em>this state, distant upwards of 200 mil\u00e9s front the land; and that the guardian of <em>B. Ringgold, </em>during his minority, resided upwards of 100 miles from the lahd. That <em>B, Ringgold </em>was born on the 6th of January 1774, and on the 17th of September 1796, in the name of his lessee, he instituted an action of ejectment against the present defendant, in the general court, for the recovery of the land now sued for by the present plaintiff, against the present defendant; and that the action was depending and undetermined wheh <em>B. Ringgold </em>died, and that it did. abate by his death, and was so entered at October term 1798. The plaintiff also offered in evidence, by the same witnesses who were examined by the defendant, that they, the witnesses, always understood that <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight </em>was alleged to lie within the reserve of <em>Conogocheague </em>Manor* and therefore the owners of <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight </em>could not obtain a patent therefor. The defendant then prayed the opinion of Hie court, and their direction to the jury, that if they find the facts as stated by the defendant, that then the lessors of the plaintiff were barred from making title to any part of <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight, </em>for the reason that the same was included in the lines of <em>The Number of Two, </em>for. which the ejectment is brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-3\">Chase, Ch. <em>3.</em><footnotemark><em>(a.)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court refuse to give the direction prayed, being of opinion that nothing less than twenty years adverse possession, by actual enclosures, will bar or defeat the title of the plainti\u00f1in this case.

It is contended, that the order to lay reserves around the manors of the Lord Proprietary, dated the 30th of June 1731, was not applicable to the <em>Conococheague Manor, </em>which, as it is said, was surveyed in the year 1736, subsequent to the date of that order; that therefore the reserve on that manor was unauthorised and void, and that a patent for <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight </em>was improperly withheld. But the certificate of <em>Conococheague Manor, </em>dated the 25th of October 1736, is evidently a certl. ficate of resurvey recognizing an original, and having for its foundation an order from the then governor of <em>Maryland </em>to resurvey <em>Conococheague Manor, </em>and for any thing appearing in the record, the original survey of that manor may have been anterior to the .date of the order to lay off reserves. But whether anterior or not, a reserve was made around <em>Conococheague Manor, </em>and afterwards the warrant granted to <em>Cheney </em>on the 6th of June 1752, was located, (as appears by the aforegoing statement of facts,) within the lines of that reserve; and for that reason it was ordered and determined, that a patent should not issue on the certificate of <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight. </em>And whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>judgment of the judges of the land office, was correct or not, or whether the reserve laid off on <em>Conococheague Manor </em>v\\ as properly or improperly made, is not now for us to decide, nor is it material in the consideration of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">A patent did issue, for <em>The Number of 'Two, </em>which does not appear to have been ever vacated; and so long as it remains unvacated, if there is no elder patent covering the same land, or other grant overreaching it in law, (neither of which appears,) it operates to vest in the patentee, and those claiming under him, the title to all the land lying within its lines, whether the order to lay off reserves is applicable to <em>Conococheague Manor </em>or not, and whether a patent for <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight </em>was properly or improperly withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">To recover <em>The Number of Two, </em>this suit was instituted, and defence was taken for <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight, </em>which, it, appears, lies within the lines of <em>The Nwaber of </em>'Two, and for which no patent ever issued. Therefore the defence taken, was not on title derived by grant, but grew out of the possession in the defendant, and <em>Charles Cheney, </em>under whom he claims, of a part of <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight, </em>by actual enclosure for more than twenty years before the time of bringing this suit, with a continued enjoyment from the year 1762, of the parts not enclosed, by cutting timber, &amp;c. exterior to the enclosures. Hence the only question is on the operation of the act of limitations upon that possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">I shall not go into an examination of the questions, whether twenty years exclusive and nmnixed possession of a tract of land by cultivation and general use, without an actual enclosure, is such a possession as will bar a recove <em>rj </em>in an action of ejectment? Or whether twenty years possession of a part of a tract of lend by actual cultivation and enclosure, with an exclusive and immixed enioyment of all exterior to the enclosure by spars'\u2122 ' '&lt;&gt;\u2022 and general user, will bar a recovery in ejectment oi the parts not enclosed? For although they are questions of considerable importance in this state, and whatever ev opinion touching them may be, yet as they are not involved in this cause, it is not necessary, nor perhaps would it be proper, to decide upon them now.</p>\n<p id=\"AQk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The question in the court below grew out of the faene \u00aexistmg in the cause; and that the opinion, from which this is an appeal,, was given upon those facts, and with a, view to the particular case then under consideration, n; evident from the opinion itself, which is in these words? \u201cNothing less thali twenty years adverse possession by actual enclosure will bar or defeat the title of the plaintiffin this case.\u201d And I concur with the general court in that opinion, admitting all the facts stated' in the bill of exceptions to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">This is a case of two conflicting claims, in which the pretensions of both parties are set out. The lessors of the. plaintiff with title, having possession by enclosure and. cultivation of a part of the tract of land in dispute, claiming the whole; and the defendant without title, having possession by enclosure of a part of the same tract of land, with the use (by cutting timber, &amp;c.) of other parts not enclosed. As to that part of the land which was in the possession of the defendant, and his ancestor-, <em>Charles Cheney, </em>by actual enclosure for more than twenty years next preceding the bringing of this suit, the plaintiff is bound by the act of limitations; but not as to the parts used by the defendant exterior to the enclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">When two are in mixed possession of (he same laud, one by title, and the other by wrong, the law considers him having the title as in possession to the extent of his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The act of limitations did not atta.ch or run against the Lord Proprietary on any possession of vacant lands; and even if it could have run against him as to the land in question, he was not barred by the possession of <em>Charles Cheney </em>on the 7th of March 1769, the date of the grant of <em>The Number of Two.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ah9\">And whatever might have been the effect in law of the use made by the defendant, and his ancestor, of those parts of <em>The Number of Two, </em>claimed by tliem exterior to the enclosures by sparsim cutting, for twenty'years next preceding the institution of this suit, in case the purchaser had never entered and obtained possession before or due ing that user, and no mixed possession had followed; yet in this case it is stated, that <em>John Morton Jordan, </em>the grantee of <em>The Number of Two, </em>and those claiming under him, did immediately after the date of the grant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>t\u00fallan SO years from the commencement of any possession in Cheney, enter upon and take possession of a part of <em>Thi Number of Tif&gt;,\\ij </em>actual enclosure and cultivation, claiming title to the whole, and have ever since so possessed and claimed; and the possession of part, gives in law \u2022a constructive possession of the whole. This principle may be extended to both parties in this case, and each may be considered as having been in possession of the land claimed by him, according to his right, and the true extent &lt;*f his lines, with the exception of the parts enclosed by the other \u2014 the defendant of <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight, </em>and the lessors of the plaintiff o\u00ed <em>The Number of Two, </em>which includes all <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight-, </em>or in other words, the defendant of a part of <em>The Number of Two-, </em>according to certain alleged lines, and the lessors of the plaintiff of all <em>The Number of Two, </em>except the parts thereof enclosed by the defendant. Their possessions, therefore, of those .parts of <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight </em>not enclosed, or rather of the unenclosed parts of <em>The, Number of Two, </em>claimed and used by the defendant, (for there appears to b\u00e9 no such grant as <em>Cheney\u2019s Delight,) </em>were mixed or conflicting possessions, on which the statute of limitations could not attach or run, so as to bar a recovery by the plaintiff, who, If the facts slated in the bill of exceptions are true, is the 'legal owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Even if the defendant\u2019s possession by enclosure commenced first, which is not stated to be the case, that, and rMs cutting timber exterior to ihe fences, could not have 'prevented the constructive possession vesting by operation of law, in <em>Jordan, </em>of all the unenclosed parts of <em>The Number of Two, </em>on the actual entry and enclosure made by him, and those claiming under him, upon a part of that tract of laud, within twenty years from the date of the. \"rant, claiming title to the whale. Bui if the possession, by enclosure, of the lessors of the plaintiff, and those under whom they claim, commenced first, and for any thing appearing in the record that may have been the fact, surely no cutting, &amp;c. by the <em>Cheneys, </em>exterior to their enclosures, could so divest the possession, cast by law upon the plaintiff\", of the unenclosed parts of <em>The Number of Two, </em>as to let in the, operation of the act of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Upon the whole, I consider the question in ibis case to l&gt;e, whether twenty years mixed possession of unenclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>lands can operate to bar a recovery in ejectment by the rightful owner, he being one of the possessors?</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">On this question I feel no doubt, and therefore am of opinion that the judgment of the general court ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-8\">Nicholson, J. concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b106-9\">Ganti', J. dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
