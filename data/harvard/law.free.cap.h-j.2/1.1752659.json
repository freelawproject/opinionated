The bill, filed, by the present appellee, stated that <em>Brooke, </em>the complainant, being possessed of and entitled to 80 shares of stock in the Bank of <em>Columbia, </em>and being desirous of disposing thereof, did, in May 1795, make application to <em>Solomon, </em>one of the defendants, who at that time acted as broker in Baltimore, to sell them for him. That <em>Solomon </em>informed <em>Brooke </em>be had a commission to purchase shares in the Bank of <em>Columbia </em>for a gentleman in <em>Philadelphia, </em>and that he would, and did purchase the shares of <em>Brooke, </em>for which <em>Solomon </em>agreed to give, and did give to bun, bis promissory notes for \u00a72424, the one half payable in 26 days, and the other half payable in 28 days, and the shares were transferred by <em>Brooke </em>to <em>Solomon. </em>That <em>Solomon, </em>in 4 or 5 days after the date of the notes, became bankrupt, and on the 18th of May 1795, made and executed a deed of trust to <em>Winchester, </em>&amp;c. the other defendants, of his effects and property, in trust, to be distributed among Ms creditors. That under and in virtue of the assignment, the assignees, <em>Winchester, </em>&amp;c. lay claim to the 80 \u00abhares, <em>(Solomon </em>not having disposed thereof for a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>\u00e1nd <em>valuable </em>consideration to any person whatever before Ms failure,) they alleging that the shares, or the nett pro-' ceeds thereof, must be applied equally among all the creditors of <em>Solomon; </em>although <em>Brooke </em>charges, that he hath an <em>equitable lien </em>on the shares, or the proceeds thereof, in preference to\u2019imy other of the creditors of <em>Solomon, </em>the shares having been a fund created on the credit of the notes, and not having been since assigned <em>to a purchaser for a valuable consideration, without notice of stcch equitable lien. </em>That <em>Brooke </em>hath applied to the assignees, <em>Winchester, </em>&amp;c-. who refuse <em>to </em>pay him the amount of the shares, or the value thereof, alleging that <em>Brooke </em>hath not any preference to the other creditors. <em>Prayer, </em>that the defendants bG compelled to pay to the complainant the said shares, or the value thereof, in preference of the other creditors of Solomon, and true and perfect answers make, &amp;c. Also to account with and pay to the complainant the said shares, or the value and nett proceeds thereof, in satisfaction of the notes; and that the complainant may have such other remedy in the premises as the nature of his case doth or may require, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-3\">The <em>answer </em>of <em>TP inchester, </em>&amp;c. so far as is material; stated, that when <em>Solomon </em>executed the deed of trust <em>t&amp; </em>them, he was insolvent, and owed large sums of money ta several persons, far exceeding the value of all the property and effects which he was interested in, or had any title to. That these defendants had no notice, at the execution of the deed, that <em>Solomon </em>was indebted to the complainant, or any other person, for the 80 shares. That these defendants, all of whom are the creditors of <em>Solomon, </em>did, in July 1799, sell the shares for ,\u00a71613. That they are willing to pay to the complainant Ms proportion of all monies which they received in virtue of the deed, and have always been willing <em>to </em>pay the same; but the complainant has refused to make any application therefor. They insist that the complainant has no lien, either equitable or legal, on the shares, or the money arising from the sales thereof, for the payment of the notes, as the shares were legally transferred to <em>Solomon, </em>and by him to these defendants. They say, that they have been informed by <em>Solomon, </em>and. believe the fact to be, that <em>Solomon </em>purchased the shares en his account, and for his own bene&amp;t and use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>The <em>answer </em>of <em>Solomon </em>is similar to the preceding answer. That at the time he executed the deed of trust, lie was indebted to a number of persons far exceeding the value of the property and effects to which he was entitled. That lie did not, inform the trastees, at the time he executed the deed, or at any time before, that he had not paid the complainant for the 80 shares. That after the execution of the deed lie did not interfere in the administration of his effects, but the same, since that period, ha* been under the entire and exclusive control of the trustees, That on the 18th of May 1795, and after the execution of the deed, he was arrested at. the suit of some of Ms creditor*, and confined in gaol in <em>Palimiore; </em>and that on the sue-seeding day the certificate of the transfer of the 80 shaves was received by the trustees, lie positively denies he ever told the complainant that he had a commission to purchase shares in the bank of <em>Columbia, </em>or io any other bank, tor a gentleman in <em>Philadelphia, </em>or any other place whatever, or that lie acted as a broker in making the con \u25a0 tract with the complainant; but he expressly says, that ho purchased the shares on his own account, and for his own use and benefit. That the complainant, about 18 month5! after the purchase of the shaves, applied tc this defendant 10 sign an instrument of writing, stating that he had purchased the shares on commission, which he. refused to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-4\"><em>7vMiinony. </em>That the trustees of <em>Solomon </em>sold at auction 80 shares in the Bank of <em>Cohnnliu, </em>to <em>John Mun </em>- <em>mekuijsen, on </em>the 23d of July 1799, for S2480, which, after deducting duties and commission, amounted to g\u00a3413\u201e That <em>Charles Lowndes, </em>in May or June 1799, requested <em>IkimiiekutfMi </em>to purchase for him 80 shares in the Bank of <em>Columbia, </em>who purchased the same fur him for 31 dollars a share, amounting to 82480.

If it were allowed it must either be charged to the trustees, or must come out of the estate of the insolvent, to the prejudice of other creditors.
