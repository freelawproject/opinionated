The plaintiff' then offered in evidence, that the office of the examiner-general, and the office of the agent, to whom the caution money was paid, were held in the city of <em>Jlnnapolis, </em>and that the party, after his certificate was examined and passed, and returned to the office, was accustomed to carry his certificate to the office of the agent, and pay the caution money thereon, and to bring the same back to the office; and that after the certificate was compounded on, the party could not take his certificate out of the office, without applying io the judge of the land office, and obtaining his permission for that purpose, and that before the certificate was taken out on such permission, the \u00a1-.arty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>was required to give a receipt for the same, which receipt was kept in \u00e1 memorandum book for that and otlier purposes. It ivas offered in evidence, tli\u00e1t the said memorandum book; as Well a\u00e1 other memorandum books, which had been kept for particular purposes in the land office under the proprietary government, have been lost or destroyed. That in such instances, uiidet-the proprietary government, in which the parties themselves carried the certificates to the land office, they wef\u00e9 carried there before they were examined arid passed, and were sent to the examirier-gener\u00e1\u00ed by the clerk of the land office to be examined, in the same m\u00e1nrier as if retiirned into the office by the survey- or. And it was also given in evidence by <em>John </em>Callahan, Esquire; Register of the Land Office, who had been examined as to the foregoing facts; that before the year 1/60, it was hot th\u00e9 practice or us\u00e1ge in the land office to endorse oh the certificate the time when the certificate was received into the office; that when a warrant of any kind was issued for the surveying or taking up.of land, it was immediately entered up and recorded in a record book kept in the land office for that purpose; that when a person applied to the offic\u00e9 te Caveat any certificate, if .the same was not in the office; or could not conveniently be found, it was usual to enter the caVeat in the margin of the warrant; that under the proprietary government, a caveat docket Was regularly kept, ill which was also entered every caveat a3 soon as made; but that those dockets are now lost. That where a certificate was eaveated, the judge of the land office did not act upon the caveat and dismiss the same, under the proprietary government, unless the certificate was in the office; that the witness knew of no instance to the contrary; and that it was the usual practice to endorse the dismissal of ihe caveat on the certificate. That if a caveat was entered, it was not the usage of the office to have patents made out, sent to the governor to be sealed, returned to the office and recorded, until a hearing and dismissal of the caveat; and that although the caveat had remained more than six months unacted upon and unrenewed, yet it was not the practice and usage of the land office, under the proprietary government, to have the caveat dismissed, and patent issued and recorded, unless on particular application of the party entitled to the patent The plaintiff further offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>hi </em>evidence, that the said <em>Callahan </em>was, when examined, j'n the forty-ninth year of h\u00eds age; that he first went to write in the land office in the latter end of the year 1767, and continued in that office nearly the whole time, until the formation and adoption of our present government; that when he went to write in the land office, <em>William Steuart </em>was the clerk of the land office, and continued such until some time in the year 1774, when <em>David Steuart </em>succeeded him in the said appointment, and continued to hold that office until the appointment of <em>Saint George Peale, </em>as \u2022register of the land office, in April 1777; and that at the time the said <em>Callahan </em>first went to write in the land office, <em>Saint George Peale </em>was the eldest clerk or writer in that office, employed by <em>William Steuart, </em>(who was not very often himself in the office,) and remained so until he was appointed register. That during the <em>American </em>revolution, to wit, sonietime in the month of January 1776, the books, records and papers, belonging to the land office, were packed up and removed to <em>Upper Marlborough, </em>where they were kept until sometime in July 1778, when they were Brought hack again to the city of <em>-Annapolis, </em>and that by snch removal some loss and injury had happened to some of <em>the </em>books <em>and papers-. </em>The plaintiff further offered in evidence the assignment of the certificate foe <em>\u25a0Part of Wood\u2019s Inclosure, </em>and that it was made and executed on a separate piece of paper, and that the assignment is annexed, by wafers, to one side of a sheet of the -original certificate in the land office, and that the side of the sheet, to which it is so annexed, is blank, and not written upon. The assignment is of \u201cthe certificate returned on a certain resurvey had and made upon 86 acres of land, being part of a tract of land called <em>Wood\u2019s Inclosure, </em>originally taken up by <em>Joseph Wood.\u201d </em>He further offered in evidence, that the certificate of <em>Part of Wood\u2019s Inclosure, </em>now remaining in the land office, comprizes and is written upon two sheets of paper; and that the said <em>Callahan </em>had no knowledge that the certificate was ever out of the office from the time the caution money was paid thereon. The said <em>Callahan </em>further in his testimony declared, that he had no knowledge what was the usage and practice in the land office in the year 1753, and for many years after; that when he spoke of the usages and practices of <em>the </em>land office, he meant the usages and practices while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>lie was a writer therein, which he supposes conformable i'6 the usages and practices which had been in former periods adopted'. That it was the general practice of the land office, and that he did not recollect an instance to the contrary, that caveats were not heard and decided upon, unless the certificate caveated was in the office at the tim\u00e9 of decision; and that it was the practice to note on the certificates caveated's the decisions made thereon, allowing or disallowing the caveats. The plaintiff also offered in evidence three original certificates from the land office; With tli\u00e9 warrants under which the surveys were made; and the endorsement's in the margin of the warrants of caveats having been entered against patents issuing on those Certificates; and that neither the caveats, the orders, nor decisions made thereon, appear on the certificates. He also offered in evidence a large bundle of original certificates, returned to the land office, from <em>Frederick </em>county; for the year 1753, amounting to the number of 120, and th\u00e9 same were brought into court, and offered in evidence in the; order in which they were found in the land office, and that in the number aforesaid there were only three certificates on which caveats were noted.' The defendant then offered to prove, that there is no endorsement upon ilie certificate now in the latid office for <em>Part of Wood\u2019d 'Inclosure, </em>of the time when it was returned to the land office; and also proved by <em>John </em>Callahan; esquire, register 6f the land office, that when a certificate of survey or res\u00farvey was returned to the said office,- and remained therein, and was caveated by any person who opposed \u00e1 grant issuing thereon, it Was customary to endors\u00e9 the entering of the caveat upon the back of the certificate so caveated; but that if the certificate'- was not in the land office whe'h file caveat' was so entered,- that then if was customary to make an entry of the' caveat in the margin of the warrant book, opposite to' the warrant upon Which the certificate Was founded. He then produced from the land office, and showed to the' jury, the warrant upon which this' certificate was founded,; and the book in which the same is entered; and also showed, that in the margin thereof,- opposite to the wa'rrant, it is entered that <em>Greenbury Ridgely </em>did, on the 12th day of July 1754, enter a caveat against a- giant issuing on the certificate for <em>Part of Wood\u2019s Inclosure. </em>He then pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>chiced the original,certificate for <em>Part of Wood\u2019s Inch sure </em>^ and from ihe same showed to the jury that there is no entry upon that certificate, made by any clerk or officer in. ihe land office, by which it can be inferred that the same was in the land office, until the 30th of. January 1772, when there is an entry thereon that the same was caveated by <em>Philip, Rezin, </em>and <em>Matthias hanmfond, </em>sons of <em>P. Hump mond, (to </em>whom the same certificate had been assigned by <em>J. Howard,) </em>and that the certificate has no plot or table of courses annexed thereto, or filed therewith. He, then offered in evidence, that although it was customary for the surveyor, who made out a certificate before the revolution to return the same to the land office, from whence it was transmitted to the examiner-general, yet there was n.o. regulation which prevented the party himself from bringing his own certificate, and carrying it himself to the examiner, previous to its coining into the land office; and that before the revolution, as well r.s since, it was the business.of the owner of a certificate, which hail been examined and passed, to carry the same to the person authorised to receive the composition money, that lie might ascertain the sum to be paid thereon, and to pay the composition money to the person so authorised to receive the same. That on the 14th of June 1733, there was a proprietary order ret specting the continuance of caveats, in the words following: \u201cThat no caveat be permitted to be renewed after the,, expiration of six, months. \u201d That on the 19th of, Decern-\u00bb ber 1768, there was a second proprietary order on the same subject,, in the words following: \u201cThat no caveat be permitted to continue longer than six months, nor be renewed after that tipie, unless upon very special circumStances.\u2019* He also offered evidence, that no charge, before the revolution, \\yas entered upon.the proprietary rent, rolls fon. lands against any person, until thejands, were patented, and no account raised against any person as the holder of lands, for quit rents as due to the proprietary, except for lands which were patented. That whenever a certificate was returned to the land office, and had been examined and passed, and compounded on, it was the interest of the proprietary that it should be.patented; and if such certificate remained in the land office, and there wps no legal objection to patent issuing thereon, it was customary to issue a patent thereon, and charge the grantee with the euitreatg. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>due. thereon to the proprietary. It is admitted that the whole of the evidence ottered by both plaintiff and defendant, as stated herein preparatory to the taking this bill of exceptions, <em>so </em>far as the same is not derived from papers of the land office, herein stated'and referred to, is derived from. <em>John </em>Callahan, Esquire, register of the land office. That one of the three- certificates, herein before referred to by the plaintiff, as, the case of a. certificate, caveated whereon the caveat was entered in the margin of the warrant and not upon. the. certificate, was as followeth: The original' certificate bore date on the 22d of July 1754, upon which there was a.caveat entered on the 26th of February 1756, by one / Bayne? that this caveat was en_ fered on the margin of the warrant, and also on the certificate returned to, filed, and now remaining in tire land office? that the said certificate- was afterwards amended, ajid the amended certificate, bearing date on the 26th of May 1769, returned to the land office, upon which amended certificate a patent issued'on the i'5t!\u00ed ofNovember 1769, and in the margin, of the warrant, upon which the same, issued, there was an entry in these words/\u201ccaveat overruled. Patent issu,ed 15 October <em>1769,\u201d </em>of which proceeding there was no entry, either upon-the original certificate, or upon the amended certificat\u00e9. The- plaint ill' then offered to give in evidence a petition preferred by <em>Thomas Dorsey, </em>on the 2.9{th of October 1772,. to the judges of the land office, caveating the certificate for <em>Part of Wood\u2019d Inclosure, </em>which was originally drawn in the hand-writing of <em>Samuel Chase, </em>esquire, and which remains in'the land' office. The petition, as originally drawn, after stating\u2019 the issuing the warrant, the resurvey, &amp;c. was as follows: \u201cThat the said certificate was <em>never </em>returned \"to the land\u2019 office, <em>but kept by the said Philip Ilammond in his </em>posses- . <em>sign, till his heath in. the year </em>1761. Thai the skid certificate was <em>kept </em>by a certain <em>John Ilammond, </em>esquire, son of the said <em>Philip, or by the. said, a certain Charles Hammpnd, esquire, or one of them, from the dealli of the said Philip until </em>the month of June 177\u00cd,\u201d &amp;c. which petition appears on the face of it to haye been altered so as to read as: follows: \u201cThat the -said certificate was, <em>on the 4th of October </em>1753, returned io <em>the </em>land office, that the said certificate was, <em>on the 13th of </em>October..1763, <em>withdrawn out of tile- land office </em>by a certain <em>John 'Hammond, </em>esquire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>son of the said <em>Philip,</em>till the month of June 1771,\u201d &amp;cf And the plaintiff o\u00ed\u00ederet\u00ed to give in evidence, that the alteration made in, the petition, by inserting the words and figures, <em>\u201con the 4th of October </em>1753,\u201d and the words and figures, <em>\u201con the, 13tli of October </em>1763, <em>withdrawn oui of </em>\u25a0&gt; <em>the land </em>office,\u201d is in the handwriting of <em>St. George Peale; </em>and that <em>St. George Peale </em>departed this life some time in the year 1779.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\">Chase, Ch. J\u00bb The court refuse to permit the plaintiff to give in evidence to the jury the petition preferred to the judges of the laud office by <em>Thomas Dorsey, </em>and the alterations therein, in the hand-writing of <em>Saint George Peale, </em>as a circumstance to prove at what time the certificate for <em>Part of Wood's Indosure </em>was returned into the land office, or to prove that it was returned into the office on or before the! 5th of March 1754, the court being of opinion, tliat it is inadmissible for that purpose, as the defendant does not derive\u2019any interest in the land in questiqn under <em>Thomas Dorsey, </em>by \\yhom the petition was so preferred to the judges of.the land office.
