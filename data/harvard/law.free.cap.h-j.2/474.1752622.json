The bill, which was filed t\u00edy the appellee against <em>Williams, </em>(the appellant,) and <em>John Clarke, </em>stated that William\u00a7 and <em>Clarke </em>entered into partnership under the name of <em>J\u00f3hn Clarks, </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 Co. During the partnership, <em>Clarice </em>bought goods from the complainant, <em>(Hodgson,) </em>which were delivered to <em>Clarke </em>on account of the partnership, and by him sold. That the belief that <em>Williams </em>was a partner, gave credit to the firm. That on the 7th of July 1797, <em>Clarke </em>settled with the complainant, and the concern was found indebted JPS19 0 5, <em>Virginia </em>currency; and for that sum <em>Clarke </em>gave bond to the complainant, in the names of <em>Clarice </em>and <em>Williams, </em>(jointly and severally,) executed by <em>Clarke </em>alone, sighed <em>John Clarke, </em>&amp; Co.

Thai <em>Clarke </em>is insolvent, &amp;c. That suits were brought on the bonds in the general court against <em>Williams, </em>and were <em>non prossed, </em>because that court were of opinion that one partner could not execute a bond, so as at law to bind his copartner, unless a special authority for such purpose existed. <em>Prayer </em>for a disclosure from the defendants, whether they were partners or not, and that they may be compelled to account with and pay the money due to the complainantj and tor other relief, &amp;c&lt; The <em>answer </em>of <em>Williams </em>stated, that he and <em>Clarke </em>entered into partnership in October 179a, for three years, in the milling and distilling business. <em>Clarke </em>was directed not to purchasa merchandize on <em>Williams\u2019s </em>account, and he believes that <em>Clarke </em>sold goads on his own account. He does not know whether or not <em>Clarke </em>bought goods on the partnership account, and if' he did, the answer insisted that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ihnl was riot liable. That he knew nothing of the settlement or execution of the bonds. That suits were brought on the bonds, and <em>non prossed, </em>as stated in the bill, and that <em>Clarke </em>was insolvent.

The objects of the bill, as stated therein, were to have a disclosure from the defendants, whether they were partners; to compel tliein to account with the complainant, and pay the money due as charged in the bill, on account of goods sold to them, and to obtain other relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-6\">As a ground for relief, the complainant states, that during the continuance of the partnership, <em>Clarke </em>gave a bond to him in bis own name, and that of <em>Williams, </em>for a balance due on account of goods sold to them, and aftervyards another bond was given on a similar account, on which suits were brought against <em>Williams </em>in this state, and <em>non prossed, </em>on the ground of such bonds not binding him at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-7\">The answer of <em>Williams </em>denies the partnership to the extent alleged by the complainant, and does not admit the purchase of the goods by <em>Clarke; </em>the settlement or execution of the bonds. It admits that <em>Clarke </em>is insolvent, and that suits were brought on the bonds, and <em>nan.prossed </em>as stated in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-8\">The defence set up is, that the remedy, (being for the price of goods sold,) is at law, and that it is not a case for relief in equity, and that the bonds relied on as a ground of relief by the complainant, are not proved. And it is also contended that an issue ghonld be tried as to the partnership, &amp;c. and that the question of [aw \u00a1should be submitted to the judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-9\">The counsel for the complainant relies on the facts disclosed in the case, W support the jurisdiction and the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>lief prayed for; and also contends that the demand being against the defendants as partners, gives the court of equity a concurrent power with a court of law; and so as to the prayer for a discovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-3\">Upo.n this question of jurisdiction, the case is attended with considerable difficulty, and the authorities on the subject have been carefully examined with a view to its decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-4\">The position laid down by the complainant is certainly too broad. A prayer for a discovery, which is made a part of every bill in calling on the defendant to answer, cannot give a jurisdiction in every case, nor can the circumstance of the defendants being partners give such jurisdiction in a case purely determinable at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">If therefore the complainant had merely stated a sale, and delivery of goods, and had brought his bill to recover the price, or if instead of a bond, a note unsealed had been given by <em>Clarke, </em>the complainant would not have been so ill advised as to have prayed for relief in this court, or if he had, would have failed to obtain it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-6\">.But there are circumstances in this case which, under the principles recognized by courts of equity, incline the chancellor to think that the jurisdiction may be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\">It is certainly desirable that the boundaries between the courts, as to their jurisdiction, should be prescribed, but they are not in all cases to be clearly discovered, and a writer of eminence observes, that \u2018\u2018to strike out the distinguishing principle upon which courts of equity in such cases have proceeded, would be indeed extremely useful, but that after having given considerable attention to the. subject, he found himself incapable of reconciling the various decisions on it.\u201d.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-8\">, In addition to the maxim, that matters of <em>account, fraud accident </em>and <em>mistake, </em>are proper objects of a court of equity, there are other principles which require to be considered in viewing this case. Although a court of equity will not generally give relief where the party hag a remedy, or. the matter is properly determinable at law, yet to prevent such relief, it must be a case which pan be fully investigated, and receive a complete and effectual decision in a, court of law, and the remedy there mpst be clear and certain. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>In many cases a court of equity will exercise jurisdiction, although a remedy might he had in a court of lav/.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-3\">There are some cases in which, although the complainant might have a remedy at law, a court of equity having obtained jurisdiction for the purpose of discovery, will retain the suit for the purpose pf giving relief; and if this rule was more general than it is, it would only be an extension of the principle in bills for account of assets, which are stated to have been originally only bids for discovery, which could not be had without an account, but ou which the courts of equity have made complete decrees, and given the party his debt likewise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-4\">Equity jurisdiction is exercised to put a bound to vexatious and oppressive litigation, and to preven\u00eda multiplicity of suits,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\">It is exercised where the courts of ordinary jurisdiction are made instruments of injustice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">A court of equity will lend its aid whenever by fraud or accident a person is prevented from effectually asserting, in the courts of ordinary jurisdiction, rights founded on principles acknowledged by those courts, and where parties by contract have given a right, but have not given a, sufficient remedy, and in the case of defective securities for money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">The present case may not perhaps come under the scope of all these principles, but there are some of them which appear to be applicable to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-8\">Without stating particularly the evidence in the cause, the chancellor is satisfied of the existence of the partnership, as alleged by the complainant, and of the liquidation of the balance due for the goods sold, the execution of the bonds as stated, and the event of the suits on them. With regard to the answer of the defendant, <em>Clarke, </em>it is considered, that the partnership being proved by of iter testimony, his admissions are evidence in the sa\u00edne manner as his acts would be in the exercise, of the joint business of the firm. Ami it may here be observed, that the responAbility of one partner for the acts of another, is not, as stated by the defendants\u2019 counsel, a principle, of <em>sheer </em>mercantile law', but is founded in justice and necessity, and is inseparable from the nature of partnership transactions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-9\">It appears that <em>Clarke </em>executed the bonds with a view of ascertaining, and perhaps of securing in some degree, the balance dug for goods sold to the company; and these bonds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>were taken by the complainant from a <em>misapprehension of </em>ignorance of their legal effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-10\">If notes had been given by <em>Clarke, </em>without seal, as in the case of <em>Ilkldh</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>and the partnership had been proved, they would have been obligatory on the defendant, Williams, at law. The bonds cannot be considered in equity as less solemn and obligatory than the notes, but the remedy sought for on the bonds was, defeated by what was indeed a <em>sheer </em>principle of law. For if it be proved, as the chancellor conceives it to be, that the defendant, <em>Williams, was, </em>liable, and might have been bound by notes, without seal, for the same amount, the defence set up to the bonds was not ?,n equitable or conscientious on,e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-11\">In this respect then the court of law, or (as expressed in one of the principles above stated,) the court of ordinary jurisdiction, has been made the instrument of injustice. Ey the accident,, as it may be termed, of the balance due being secured by bouds, the complainant was prevented; from asserting in a court of law the right of recovering money due to him on principles acknowledged by all courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-12\">The parties who purchased the goods have, by the authorised acts of one of them, given (by their contracts,) a right to the money admitted thereby to be due, <em>but </em>have given a remedy insufficient at law, by securities, in that respect, defective.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-13\">It is alleged, by the, counsel for the defendants, that the complainant, if the money is due to him, has a full and adequate remedy at law; and to prove this, he contends that the bonds are not an extinguishment of the original contract. If the bonds were obligatory on <em>Ckivke, </em>(which seems to be admitted,) it is difficult to say how the original contract, which was a joint one, remains unimpaired, or how <em>Clarke, </em>if solvent, would be liable on both.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-14\">If an absolute decision on this question was necessary, it would appear consonant to reason that an unliquidated claim, sounding in damages, would be extinguished by the acceptance of an instrument of a higher nature, which, fixed the amount, Eut supposing this to be left in doubt, has the defendant succeeded in showing that the complainant\u2019s remedy, (supposing him entitled,) would be <em>clear </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>certain </em>in a court of law, or tTiat U would there be fully investigated, and receive a complete and effectual decisi- . 0 1 ons* h , ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">If equity jurisdiction may be exercised to ptit a boittid to vexatious and oppressive litigation, and prevent a multiplicity of suits, it is not necessary to send a party to a court of law, where the remedy, if td be attained, would be the same; and in this case it may be inferred from the evidence of <em>J. </em>Riddle, that if instead of bonds, notes unsealed had been given, the same recovery would have been had as in Riddle\u2019* case. And the same principle, iu addition, to the discietionary powers of this court, will account for the chancellor\u2019s not applying to a court o\u00ed law, as was suggested by the defendants\u2019 counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-7\">The complainant has already tried his remedy at law, which has failed, as much at least through the fault of the defendants as his own; and it is not clear but that a suit0 in this court might have been originally sustained on the ground of <em>Williams </em>not being bound in law by the bonds, though in that case the opinion of the court or the judges, as to the law, might have been resorted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-8\">In the case of a joint bond it is a constant practice, in case of the insolvency of the surviving obligor, to commence a suit in chancery against the representatives of the other party; and although this arises in part from the acknowledged jurisdiction, as to administrators, &amp;c. yet it is grounded also on the situation of the parties rendering the remedy of the law ineffectual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-9\">With regard to the part of the bill praying for a discovery, it may be further observed, that as the binding of <em>Williams, </em>by the bonds of <em>Clarke, </em>is alleged to have depended at law on the assent of <em>JVi\u00fciams, </em>art acknowledgment of such assent might, have been expected by the complainant on filing his bill, which might have been a reason for filing it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-10\">The chancellor has stated his reasons at greater length than may be usual or necessary in such cases, on account of the doubts which he entertained at die trial. These doubts have been removed by the further consideration which he has given to the subject; and his opinion is groundfid on the principles which he has staled, and on his determination, that where the merits appear to be with the complainant, ke will not dismiss a bill on an allegation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>want of jurisdiction, or any other similar objection,- unless <em>it is </em>clearly and positively established. Decreed, that the defendants pay to the complainant the sum of \u00a31023 15 ft current money, with interest thereon, &amp;c. and ibe costs of this suit.

On every application to this court, not grounded on positive law, when it appears, that no former decision is in all.points, applicable to the present case,, the principles, on which the comi was originally instituted, are to be considered. Its jurisdiction, from the beginning, has been exercised in preventing\u2019 men from taking unconscientious advantages of law, in obliging them to discharge trusts, and to perform reasonable _ engagements of every kind, either express or implied, and in relieving against fraud, or accident. But it never yet has been the professed business of this court-to compel men to- do that, which neither they, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>nor the <em>persons whom they </em>represent, have engaged <em>to perform, which </em>the positive laws of the land do not enjoin, and whicli equity and good conscience do not demand. In some cases, indeed, which did not appear to come under known established principles, or to be embraced by former decisions, chancellors have exercised their ingenuity in raising agreements by construction; provided nevertheless, that the yierformance of the thing, thus supposed1 to be contracted for, might fairly and reasonably be demanded. Hence it is that the condition of a bond to pay money has been construed an agreement, which equity ought to enforce, after tile obligor lias been discharged from the penally at law. How far the first deci\u00ab sion in such case was right, is perhaps questionable; for tills plain reason, that the obligor was not, and could not be apprized of this power, which equitj would afterwards assume, of compelling him to do that, which he never in any manner contracted to perform; the operation of a joint bond at law being this, that during the life <em>of </em>both obligors it is binding on <em>both, and, after </em>the death of one,, the obligee can have recourse to the other only. However, the determination in the case of <em>Bishop and Church, </em>2 <em>Ves. </em>371, cited by <em>the </em>counsel on each side, must now recognized as a law or rule for this court; and whether that case applies sufficiently to tins present is to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The two cases appear to agree in every point, except one; but that one point, in which they differ, is important. In the former case, executors of a joint obligor were called on to pay money lent to the testator and the other obligor, who were partners in trade, and the constructive agreement of the testator, was on a substantial consideration. But, in the present case, the executors\u00bb are called on to pay money which never was, or intended to be, participated by their testator. The constructive agreement therefore, on which alone this court could decree against them, was voluntary, and such as, without special circumstances, \u00a1ought not to he enforced. What then are the special circumstances of this case? To say nothing of the lapse of time, and the neglect of the complainant.\" He has it still in his power to obtain the debt from the trustee of the surviving\u2019 oblig-or. In short, it appears to the chancellor, that a decision in favour of the complainant would go for beyond any former determination, and that former determinations, with respect to joint obligors, have gone quite far enough,, On the point relative to the act of limitations, it is not necessary to <em>decidc~~I)ecreed, </em>that the bill be <em>dismissed,</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b492-13\">Buchanan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANC\">I consider the partnership, alleged in , this case to have existed between the defendants below, as sufficiently established to the extent charged in the bill, and that the delivery of tlie goods, and merchandise, said to have been sold to Clarke, as acting partner, is fully-proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>But if the bonds charged iu the bill to have been passed by <em>Clarke, </em>in behalf of <em>Williams </em>and himself, were exeeuied by him for the amount of tir\u00f3se goods, the simple contract debts were not thereby severed, and continued open as to <em>Williams, </em>and destroyed as to <em>Clarke, </em>(ou whom such bonds would be obligatory;) but being respectively joint, they became in law extinguished as to both. And though equity will interpose its aid where a remedy is wanting at law, the demand continuing, yet it cannot revive a debt which in law is extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-2\">If, however, such a bond could be construed to extinguish a simple contract debt as to the party signing it only, leaving it open as to the other partner for the interposition of a court of chancery, yet in this case the complainant has failed in proof to lay a foundation for a decree against <em>Williams; for, </em>as <em>against him, the bonds </em>in question which are set up in the bill as the very ground of the relief prayed, are not proven by any legal evidence exhibited in the record; and it cannot be seriously contended, that in the absence of such proof, the chancellor could hold jurisdiction over the case; for if no such bonds were executed by <em>Clarke, </em>the simple contract debt remains unimpaired, and the proper remedy is in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the chancellor\u2019\u00bb decree, however consonant to strict justice, ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00a1DECREE REVERSES,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
