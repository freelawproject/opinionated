The complainant, (now appellant,) by his hill filed on the 20,th of April 1798, stated that <em>George Gordon, </em>being seized of certain lots ip fee in <em>Gcovge-Town, </em>by his will dated 1766, dey (vised the house and lot No. 48, and the <em>acre of land </em>where-the old warehouses are erected, in fee, to his grandson <em>George F. Hamilton, </em>and lot No. 52, with the warehouses thereon, in fee, to his grandson <em>Charles E. </em>Hamilton. That after the death of the testator, <em>George </em>and <em>Charles </em>respectively entered, &amp;c. Th$t they both afterwards went to sea, and died intestate, leaving <em>Thomas Hamilton </em>their, heir at law. That <em>Thomas </em>Hamilton, being seized of the lots devised to <em>George F. Hamilton, </em>died in 178.3, without having made any valid testamentary disposition of the. lots, his will not having been executed in the manner prescribed by law to pass real estate; and having died intestate as to the lots, the same descended to <em>William, Hamilton, </em>vaho was his eldest son and heir at law. That; <em>William Hamilton </em>afterwards died, having made his will June 1786, by which the lots are not particularly devised, but if they passed by the expression, in the will, ifc was to the complainant, and who \\yas his eldest son and heir at law. Thai after the death of his., father, the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>pkinant resided in <em>Monongalia </em>county, in the commonweal tli of <em>Virginia, </em>and that in the year 1791, <em>Brooke Beall, </em>since deceased, (whose father had intermarried with <em>lh\\th, </em>one of the daughters of <em>Thomas Hamilton,) </em>Well knowing the premises, and that for want of a legal execution of the will of <em>Thomas Hamilton, </em>the lots were the property of the complainant, and intending to defraud the complainant thereof by untrue and deceitful pretences, fraudulently procured <em>Andrew Hamilton, </em>who was named executor in the will of <em>Thomas Hamilton, </em>to repair to the complainant in <em>Virginia, </em>where he resided, and by deceit and fraud to obtain a legal conveyance from him to <em>Beall </em>for the lots; and that' <em>Andrew Hamilton, </em>acting by the procurement, and by the directions and with the consent and knowledge of <em>Beall, </em>falsely and deceitfully alleged and pretended to the complainant, (who was then <em>little </em>more than 21 years of age, and was ignorant and unlettered,) that the will of the complainant\u2019s grandfather, <em>Thomas Hamilton, </em>was good and valid in law, only that he had not thereby authorised or empowered him, <em>Andrew, </em>although appointed his executor, to sell the lots; and <em>Andrew </em>further informed the complainant., that he must give him a power of attorney for the purpose of acknowledging a conveyance from the complainant to <em>Beall </em>of the lots, which <em>Andrew </em>said he had consented to sell to <em>Beall, </em>under themii of <em>Thomas Hamilton, </em>or that the complainant must go to <em>Maryland </em>to execute and acknowledge the same, or that he <em>(Andmo.) </em>must apply to the governor and council of <em>Maryland </em>for an order to sell the lots, under a late act of assembly of that state, which ^Zneire\u00ab) falsely alleged to iiave passed, and that the complainant therefore would be obliged to attend at <em>Annapolis </em>to make valid the sale. That the complainant, being young and unlettered, and placing (confidence and belief in what <em>Andrew, </em>in behalf and by the procurement of <em>Beall, </em>falsely told him, and fearing that he must either execute a conveyance for the lots, or be subjected to the expense and inconvenience of attending at <em>Annapolis, </em>as <em>Andrew </em>had falsely and deceitfully told him he must do, and being likewise without money, and his mother then ill in bed, and depending on him for assistance and support, he was induced to execute, and did, on the7th of February 179i,execute a conveyance to <em>limit \u00a3w </em>the lots before mentioned, for the trifling consi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>deration of <em>three pounds ten shillings </em>current money, wliiclx is all that he received, and which he would by no means' have accepted as a consideration for the lots, but for the imposition practised on him as before mentioned. That after the execution of the deed, to wit, in 1798, <em>Ileall </em>died seized of the lots, and intestate, leaving a widow and seven children, to whom, by law, his real estate equally descended, to wit, &amp;c. the defendants. <em>Prayer, </em>that the conveyance may be set aside and rendered null and void* &amp;c. and for further and other relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">The <em>answers </em>of the defendants, (one of them- being an infant answered by his guardian for that purpose appointed,) admitting certain facts set forth in the bill, and their ignorance of others, stated, that <em>Thomas Hamilton, </em>claiming to be heir at law of <em>Charles E. Hamilton, </em>conveyed that part of lot No. <em>5% </em>which was devised to <em>Charles </em>by <em>Gordon, </em>to <em>John Orr, </em>who afterwards.conveyed the same to <em>Brooke. Beall, </em>the ancestor of the defendants. That after the death of <em>Thomas Hamilton, </em>his executor <em>Andrew Hamilton, </em>offered to sell to <em>Brooke Beall </em>the lots which is the object of the bill of complaint, but on examination it was found that there was a def\u00e9ct in the title, and.it was agreed between <em>Andiew Hamilton </em>and <em>Beall, </em>that if a good and complete title could be procured for the lots, he* <em>Beall, </em>would become the purchaser; whereupon <em>Hamilton. </em>agreed to procure a title, and obtained the deed mentioned in the bill from the complainant to <em>Beall, </em>and <em>Beall </em>paid to <em>Hamilton lor </em>the lots \u00a3700 or *800. The defendants, deny that <em>Beall </em>ever did in any manner advise, or through: false pretences persuade the complainant to convey the lots* nor do they believe that <em>Andrew Hamilton </em>took any undue means to effect that end. They refer to' the conveyance, and pray that it may be taken as part of their an-, swer; and <em>Beall </em>being, a purchaser for a valuable consideration, without fraud, they contend, that neither him, nor Ids heirs* ought to be disturbed in their rights. That the complainant never did, as they are informed and believe, make any claim to the lots either of <em>Beall, </em>in his life-time* or of his heirs since his death, until the present application; and they are ignorant of any fraud ever having been practised on him. That since the purchase, on the faith, thereof, <em>Beall </em>made valuable improvements, &amp;c. The answer of <em>Apdreiv Hamilton, </em>also one of the defendants* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>siat\u00e9d, among other things material to be noticed, that \u00e1\u00bf executor of <em>Thonias Hamilton, </em>not knowing of \u00e1ny defect in the title, he advertised the lot or acre of ground, whereon the old warehouse formerly stood,' for sale, and on the Sd of January 1791, exposed the lot at public sale; where there were several bidders, and among others <em>Broo\u00ed\u00e9 Beall, </em>and it was fairly struck oif to him, as the highest bidder, for <em>\u00a3225. </em>That after the sale, the title papers were by the defendant put-into the hands of <em>Beall, </em>to prepare the conveyance. That it was discovered by <em>Beall </em>that the will of <em>'Thomas Hamilton </em>was defective, there not being three witnesses to it, and on that account the legal estate had descended to the complainant, who was the heir at law of <em>William. Hamilton. </em>That <em>Beall </em>refused to pay the purchase money until the title of ilie complainant cb\u00fcld b\u00e9 obtained, either <em>to </em>himself directly, or to some person who would convey to him; that Mr. <em>Gantt </em>was consulted ag counsel, and he advised the making of a deed to <em>Beall </em>directly from the complainant, as the most proper mode of securing the title, and \u00e1 deed was prepared by Mr. <em>Gantt} </em>for whicli the defeud\u00e1nt paid him. The defendant afterwards, in February 1791, went to <em>Virginia, </em>Where the complainant then resided, and carried with him tli\u00e9 deed so prepared, and a copy of the will of <em>Thomas Hamilton. </em>That <em>ike </em>defendant showed to the complainant the copy of the will, explained to him the defect, and informed him, that it having only two witnesses would Uot authorise the defendant to make a title to the purchaser, that the wilt was inoperative as to the latid; that <em>Beall </em>had become the purchaser, but refused to Complete the cOtitraet unless the Iomplaihant would couvey the land. The defendant then showed the deed, so prepared, <em>to the </em>complainant, <em>and </em>asked him if he would execute it. That the cotnplainant, being fully acquainted with the nature of the will, voluntarily, and without any hesitation, agreed to convey his title to the property, and to execute the deed to <em>Beall. </em>That the defendant had also \u00e1 power' of attorney prepared to have the deed properly acknowledged by sortie person in this state; but the complainant informed the defendant,, that he wished to make a visit <em>to </em>his \u00fanele <em>John, </em>who resided- near <em>Shepherd's </em>town, and <em>Allegany </em>county being oa the road, he would, on bis way through that county, exc<em>mte </em>and acknowledge the deed; which was accordingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>done on the fth of February 1791. That the complainant and defendant were in company together for Several days after tli\u00e9 execution of the deed, arid conversed respecting\u2019 it, \u00e1rtd tli\u00e9 complainant expressed himself Satisfied with its execution. When th\u00e9 def\u00e9ndarit saw tire compiainaiit several years after} he Aid not express any dissatisfaction at having conveyed the land to <em>Beall. </em>The defendant denies that he ever told the co'iripfuitiant that the will of <em>Thomas Hamilton </em>was good and valid in law} but on the contrary informed him that it was defective arid inoperative to pass land, or give- any power or authority to affect the same. He also denies that he ever informed the complainant that he \u25a0would apply to the governor and council, &amp;fc. arid dririies thci other allegations stated in the bill, of fraud, deception, &amp;c-&gt;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\"><em>Testimony </em>was taken under commissions, and the cause having been argued and submitted,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-7\">Hanson,- Chancellor, (24th September 1805,) stated} \u25a0that whether he shall decide in favour of the complainant} or in favotir of the defendants, the' Case must, to every candid person, appear hard for the loser, and most probably litigation will be continued as far as possible to the great expense, trouble, and anxiety of both parties.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-8\">In various cases of doubt of difficulty, 6r hardship, the chancellor has thought proper to recommend a compromise and decree by consent, and experience has Convinced him 'that he is right\u00bb He considers this- case peculiarly proper for a settlemen t in that Way.

Consider too, the rule respecting the refutation of an answer \u2014 examine the answer and evidence in this cause together-compare the testimony on,. each side \u2014 consider, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>we must do, when witnesses differ, whose testimony is most probable\u00bb \u2014 consider even if the complainant\u2019s witnesses are correct, and their testimony is to prevail against the .answer and opposing testimony, how far ignorance should protect a man in this court. If one party shall tell the other a most improbable, story to intimidate^ \u2014 For instance, if A tells B, a plain common fanner or planter in Virginia, \u201cif you, will not execute this deed, the governor of <em>Maryland, </em>in virtue of a law of his, state, witll send for and compel you.\u201d If the farmer-be not half ai) ideot or a. lunatic, qr iri a state of mental imbecility', if must be difficult for even <em>three </em>witnesses against a. defend ant\u2019s answer, to satisfy the mind that A\u2019s declaration has induced the, farmer to make the conveyance. The testimony of those, who swear to <em>Andrew Hamilton\u2019s </em>declarations must be unsatisfactory'; their memories must be defective; if not, it may be demanded, wherefore did they stand by and permit the falsehood to have its effect?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-3\">If ignorance were by this court protected to. that extent, how many fair contracts might be set aside! Ignorance indeed, real or pretended, might in many instances have the. advantage of knowledge and wisdom. In the chancellor\u2019s, opinion, on a view and comparison of all the proofs, there has not in this case been that <em>suggesiio falsi, ant suppressio veri, </em>which can authorise him to grant the relief prayed by the grantor in the deed against fair purchasers, wlio have long been in possession, of, and improved the property, before a demand of any kind made of or against them. <em>Decreed, </em>that the bill be <em>dismissed, </em>but as the complainant had probable grounds for instituting the suit, it is dismissed without costs.
