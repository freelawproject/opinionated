At the trial the plaintiffs gave in evidence, that fifty-two years ago the fence, located on the plots, was set up by the proprietor of the land, located on the plots, and called <em>The Adventure, </em>and that the fence has been uniformly kept up. They further gave evidence, that between 50 and 60 years ago their father, <em>Person Chapman, </em>had possession of the tract of land located on the plots called <em>Gryme\u2019s Bitch, </em>and also of all that part of the tract called <em>The Adventure, </em>which lies on the west side <em>u\u00a3 </em>the fence; that <em>P.
