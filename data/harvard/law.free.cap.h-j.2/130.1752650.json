Hammond, </em>down to the lessors of the plaintiff. Also that the tract of land for which this suit is brought, as well as the several tracts or parcels of land described in the grants and deeds aforesaid, are truly located by the plaintiff on the plots. The defendant then offered evidence to prove, that there was no tract of land in the county of <em>Frederick </em>patented by \u00bfhe name of <em>Wood\u2019s Inclosure, </em>or so called in the certificate for tlie same; that a tract of land situate in <em>Frederick </em>county, was on the 10th of January 1748-9, resurveyed for <em>Joseph Wood, </em>by virtue of a warrant of resurvey dated the 28th of July 1748, and patented to him, the 1st of June 1750, for 1540 acres, and called in the certificate and patent thereof, <em>Wood\u2019s Lot; </em>that this land did afterwards acquire, in the neighbourhood where it lay, the name \u2022alsoof <em>Wood\u2019s </em>Inclosure; that a tract of land contiguous thereto, surveyed on the 12th of November 1752, called <em>The Request, </em>and located upon the plots, did actually begin at the end of the 19th line of <em>Wood\u2019s Lot, </em>but i\u00bf the certificate thereof, calls to begin at the end of the 19th line of <em>Wood\u2019s Inclosure', </em>that several mesne conveyances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>U;r </em>pairs of <em>Wood\u2019s Lot, </em>executed by the proprietors \u00a1.hereof between the years 1754 and 1759, cali and des\u2022cribe the land by the name of <em>Wood\u2019s Indomre. </em>The defendant then read in evidence the patent to <em>Joseph </em>Wood, dated the 25th of March 1747, for the land called <em>Wood\u2019s Lot, </em>containing 126 acres, and granted to him <em>for so </em>much laud due him by virtue of a warrant for that quantity granted him the 18th of February 1746, which tract Is stated to lie in <em>Prince-'George\u2019s </em>county, and beginning <em>ai </em>a bounded oak standing on the E. side of a small branch, &amp;c. agreeably to a certiiicate dated the 25th of March 1747. The defendant then offered evidence to prove, that <em>/Pood\u2019s Lot </em>is truly located upon the plots, as beginning at A, and described by black lines from No. 1 to No. 45, black 'figures. Also that J. <em>Howard </em>never had any interest in, or title to, any part of <em>Wood\u2019s Lot, </em>or <em>Wood\u2019s </em>In<em>closure, </em>either in law or in equity, except as to 94 acres part thereof, which 94 acres are truly located on the plots? and to prove this, the defendant offered the evidence of the clerk of <em>Frederick </em>county court, the keeper of the land records of that comity, to prove, that among the records \u2022of the county, from the commencement \u00ab1 the county up io the year 1775, there is no record of any deed, bond of conveyance, or other instrument of writing, from <em>Joseph Wood </em>to J. <em>Howard </em>for or respecting <em>Wood\u2019s Lot </em>or <em>Wood\u2019s Indosure, </em>except the deed for the 94 acres above stated. Also the evidence of the clerk of the general court for the western shore, that among the records in his office there is no record of any deed, bond of conveyance, or in-thru meat of writing of any kind, from ,7. <em>Wood </em>to ,7. <em>Howard, </em>respecting <em>Wood\u2019s Lot </em>or <em>Wood\u2019s Indosure, </em>theplaintiifhaving on the trial produced no su ch deed, bond of conveyance, or instrument of writing, or any copy thereof. Also that <em>J. Howard, </em>or any person claiming from or under him, never was seized or possessed of any part or parcel of <em>Wood\u2019s Lot </em>oi <em>Wood\u2019s Indosure, </em>except the before mentioned 94 acres. Also that the 86 acres of land located by the plaintiff upon the plots, as the original upon which the resurvey called <em>Part of PVoad\u2019s Indosure </em>is pretended to have been naide, was always, from the taking up thereof, to wit, from the 10th of January 1748, till the year 1780, in the possession, occupa\u00fcon, and actual user of ,7. <em>Wood, </em>the patentee, by actual indosure of part, and by cutting and using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the wood land as to the residue, and during all that time never was, in the whole, or in part, in the possession of <em>J. Howard, </em>or of any person claiming under him. Also, that from the 1st of January 1780, down to this time, the said lands have been, and still are, in the like possession and occupation of the defendant in this cause, claiming under <em>J. Wood, </em>and not under any title derived through or from <em>J. Howard. </em>The defendant then read in evidence a deed from <em>Joseph Wood </em>to <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>for part of <em>Wood's Lot </em>or <em>Wood's Inclosure, </em>dated the 20th of June 1754, and reciting, that on the 21st of June 1750, <em>Wood </em>had conveyed to <em>Dorsey </em>part of <em>Wood's Inclosure, </em>containing 584 acres; that the parties had discovered that patent had issued to <em>Wood </em>fo- the laud, by the name of <em>Wood's </em>Lot, although commonly called and known by the name of <em>Wood's Inclosure. </em>This deed was therefore to confirm the title, &amp;c. Which land is truly described on the plots as beginning at red B, and described by yellow lines. That on the 22d of August 1757, <em>E. Dorsey </em>obtained a <em>special warrant </em>to resurvey the part of <em>Wood's Lot </em>so conveyed to him, which warrant staled that he was seized in fee of and in 584 acres of land, part of <em>Wood's Lot, </em>lying in <em>Frederick </em>county, originally, on the 1st \u00f3f June 1750, granted by patent of confirmation to <em>Joseph Wood </em>for 1540 acres, contiguous to which he had discovered some vacant land, and being desirous to add the same, prayed a special warrant to resurvey his part of the said tract \u2014 warrant was therefore granted to him, &amp;c. Also a certificate made for <em>E. Dorsey, </em>bearing date the 18th of February 1758, in virtue of the said warrant, by which certificate it appears that the said part so resurveved for <em>Dorsey, </em>contained only 564 acres; that 336 acres of vacant land were added, and called <em>The Resurvey on Part of Wood's Lot, </em>containing 900 acres. Also a patent to <em>E. Dorsey </em>for the same land, bearing date the 18th of February 1758. Also that <em>E. Dorsey, </em>the patentee, died previous to the 16th of October 1760, and that the lands descended to his heir at law <em>Thomas Dorsey. </em>Also that the land so granted to <em>E. Dorsey </em>is truly located on the plots beginning at B, and described on the plots by blue lines from 1 to 38, red figures, marked at the end of each line with red P W L. Also that <em>E. Dorsey, </em>the patentee, and those claiming under him, held, used and enjoyed, <em>The Resurvey on Part of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>Wood\u2019s </em>Lot. from the date of the certificate thereof, un\u2122 der the aforesaid title, down to the bringing of this ejectment, \u00bbart of it in cultivation and under actual enclosure, and part bein'\u00bb; in woods unincloscd, by cutting, using wood oa and therefrom; and tiiat <em>J, Howard, </em>or any person under him, never did use, occupy, possess, or in any way enjoy, any part of the lands included in the resurvey called <em>The Jlesursty on Part of Wood\u2019s Lot, </em>or any part of the lands included within the lines of the resurvey called <em>Part, of Wood\u2019s Indosure,. </em>The parties in this cause, <em>by consent, </em>examined <em>John </em>Callahan, esquire, the register of the land office for the western shore, who deposed, that according to the law, practice, and usages of the land office, prior to the year 1753, and ever since, no person was entitled to a patent on a certificate returned on a warrant of resurvey, unless such person was seized of an estate of freehold in the original whereon the resurvey was made. That by the law, practice and usages aforesaid, from ihe time aforesaid, if the person so having returned a certificate, and liad by the sam\u00e9 included vacancy, and had paid to ihe officer, entitled to receive it, the full amount of caution money for the vacancy added, and the land was, after that payment, included in a subsequent certificate on which the caution money was fully paid, although subsequent to the payment of the first caution money, that in such case, if the prior certificate was caveaied in the land office, and it was proved and made appear to the judges of \u00a1he land office, that neither the person for whom the prior certificate wrr made, nor any one claiming the certificate, had any k-gri estate or seizin in the original on which the certificate of the resurvey was made, that then the prior certificate would be, and ought by the said law, practice and usages, to be vacated, and a patent ought to issue on the second or subsequent certificate, if that certificate was not in other respects liable to objection; and that upon so vacating the first certificate, the party claiming the same would be entitled to as much land warrant as would amount to the sum of money so paid for caution money. <em>Mr. Callahan, </em>upon cross examination, deposed that he has been in the land office, except fifteen or eighteen months, upwards of thirty-four years; that he came into that office in the year 1767. He knows of no proprietary instructions given, that a person taking out a warrant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>resurvey on lands of which lie was not seized in fee, and in virtue of that warrant including vacant land and compounding for the same, which prevented such person from having a patent for such vacant land. But that it was the understanding and practice of the office, in his time, that stich patent would not be allowed. He knows of no usage- or instance, in which a caveat lias been heard and determined unless' the caveator did show an interest in the. lands at the tirhe. Ho does not kno v any instance in-which the caveat has prevailed unless the caveator had air interest in the land caveated.

Nothing but the deed itself can prove the location of the land recited in the deed now offered to be read to the jury. The court are therefore of opinion, that the deed from <em>J. Howard </em>to <em>P. Hammond </em>is not legal evidence to show title in <em>Hammond </em>in the 86 acres of land, part of <em>Wood\u2019s Jnclo</em>sure, as located on the plots by the plaintiff, or to support his location of the same, without producing the deed from <em>Joseph Wood to </em>JHoward, to which the deed from <em>J-Howard </em>to <em>Hammond </em>doth refer, to ascertain and identify the 86 acres intended to pass by the same; and that the deed is inoperative to pass the same, without producing that deed. The court refuse therefore to suffer the same, to be read to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-8\">The court are also of opinion, that the facts and circumstances, stated by the plaintiff, are inadmissible to prove, the location of the 86 acres, and the court refuse to suiter the same to be read to the jury for that purpose, or to show title in <em>P.

And in case, they have evidence, to satisfy their minds, of the true original beginning of the resurvey made by <em>Wood, </em>and for which this suit is brought, and that the saipe is at a piace different from what is located by either the plaintiff or this defendant, that then they are to begin at the place so proved, and run the first eight courses of the grant, without or with such variation, as they think m^st proper, to, correspond with the original location; and that the ninth course, must be run to its call at <em>a, </em>red 27, red <em>P TVL\u00bf </em>and in case they have not evidence to establish the place, called for at the termination of the 104th line, that then they have a right, and are bound, to locate the lines from <em>qf </em>with or without variation, as they think proper, until the. given line shall intersect and close with the place of beginning.

The court capnot give the direction prayed on the part of the plaintiff', inasmuch as the plaintiff has not made any location pn the plots to warrant the court in directing the jury to find a beginning for the plaintiff, different from that located at the letter <em>G, </em>as the beginning of <em>Part of Wood\u2019s Inclositre, </em>the plaintiff having made only one <em>location </em>of the <em>beginning </em>of that tract of land, and the same having been counterlocated by the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-9\">The chief judge said, that the plaintiff must make such locations as will suit his case. lie. has made two from the same beginning, one of which the jury must find, if they find for the plaintiff'. It is customary, in order to meet the variation of the compass, to make sundry locations, so as to have one which the jury may find.
