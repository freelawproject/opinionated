Buchanan and Gantt, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-10\"><em>Mi Mechen, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARQ\">contended, that it did not appear by the record that there was any authority from the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore </em>to authorise any person to prosecute this action. A corporate body cannot appear in person, or by attorney, to prosecute or defend a suit, unless by letter of attorney under their corporate seal. 1 <em>Blk. Com. </em>502. 503. To enable an attorney to appear for a corporation, he must be authorised, by warrant of attorney, under their common seal. It does not appear by the record that there was any warrant of attorney authorising any attorney, or other person, to institute or prosecute this action; if such authority was given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>it fiiould have been certified in the record.] Special errors, assigning that there was no such warrant of attorney, were ottered at the last term, but general errors having before been assigned, they were refused to be received by the counsel for the defendants in error. They liad notice therefore, that under the general errors, the want of a warrant of attorney would be relied on by the plaintiff in error. The special error, that there is no warrant of attorney certified in the record, is relied on, and now oifcr - edtobe assigned; and it is prayed, on the part of the plaintiff in error, that a <em>certiorari </em>may issue, directed to the keeper of the records of the lato general court, requiring him to certify whether or not there ia any warrant of attorney in this action. That a writ of <em>certiorari </em>should be granted in this case, fully appears in <em>LilL Ent. </em>22\", 255, 352, 556, 558, 560,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-3\"><em>Key </em>and Harper, for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqx\">The wr it of <em>certiorari </em>ought not to be granted for the purpose alleged. '\u00a1'he practice of our courts is to consider the appearance of an attorney for either parly to be regular, and that he had sufficient authority to do so. In the case of a common person it has always been so considered, and there is no reason why it should be otherwise in the ease of a corporate body. The warrant of attorney is no more necessary in the one case than it is in the other. If the writ of <em>certiorari </em>were to issue, and it was certified that there was no warrant of attorney, this court would presume the attorney had authority; and if he had no such authority, the corporation had their remedy against the attorney for an improper use of their name against their consent. In the case of <em>The Corporation of the Roman Catholic Clergymen\u2019s Lessee vs. Hammond, </em>1 <em>Harr, fy Johns. </em>580, there, was no warrant of attorney, and no objection for the want of it was made. It is every day\u2019s practice to use the name of the state in actions on public bonds, without any special directions for that purpose.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-4\"><em>Ridgely </em>and <em>Mi Mechen, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2e\">The case of <em>The Corporation of the Roman Catholic Clergymens Lessee vs. Hammond, </em>was an action of ejectment, wherein a demise was stated to have been made to a lessee, and the action was brought in the name of the lessee. That case, therefore, has no bearing on the question before this court. It is by common consent that an attorney appears for an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>without a warrant of attorney, but were an objection made, the court would not permit it. The books, however, are explicit, that a corporation, being; an mvisiulc body, cannot 1 , , \" , . , appear m person, but must appear by attorney, authorised by warrant of attorney under their corporate seal; and it is fatal unless there be such authority. With respect to the name of the state being used, there is an express act of assembly authorising it in suits on testamentary, administration, sheriffs, and other public bonds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-7\">Chase, Ch. J. The court consider that it is not nccessa &gt; fy to spread the warrant of attorney on the record. Everything will be intended in support of the judgment, unless the contrary appears.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-8\"><em>M\u2018Mechen, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adg\">then contended- \u2014 \u00bb 1, That the bond was not taken in conformity to the ordinance of the Mayor and City Council of <em>Baltimore </em>of the 12th of December 1798, but was entered into after, instead of before the license was granted. He referred to that ordinance; also to <em>The Inhabitants, &amp;c. of Chittinston </em>vs. <em>Penhurst, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>475, and <em>Rex vs. Croke, Cowp. </em>26.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-9\">2. That the ordinance, under which the bond was taken, was repealed previous to the'bringing this action; and as the repealing ordinance saved no rights, the action could not bo supported. He referred to the act of 1796, <em>ch. </em>68, <em>s. </em>8. <em>Miller's </em>case, 1 <em>W. Bl/c. Rep. </em>451. 6 <em>Bac\u201e Ah. </em>tit. <em>Statute, </em>(D.) 372. and <em>Rex vs. The Justices of London, </em>3 <em>Burr. </em>1456.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-10\">3. That this action is stated to be brought in the names of <em>The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>at the instance and for the use of <em>Alexander Storey. </em>He referred to <em>Martyn vs. Hind. </em>1 <em>Doug. </em>142. The acts of assembly October 1780, <em>ch. </em>30. May 1781, <em>ch. </em>11; 1784, <em>ch. </em>61; 1790, <em>ch. </em>12; and 1796, <em>ch. </em>68.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-11\">4.
