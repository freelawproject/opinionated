The bill, filed by the complainant, <em>Edward Norwood, </em>(now Appellee,) on the Slst of July 1800, stated, that he and the defendant <em>Sarftnel Nonoood, </em>(now Appellant,) being jointly indebted to <em>I), Bulany, </em>on the 20th of April 1784, gave to him their joint bond,' conditioned for the payment of \u00bfS314 sterling, an.d \u00bf6820 current money, with interest, That the defendant having omitted to. pay any part, suits were brought against each on the bond, and judgments obtained. That the complainant paid \u00bf2100 11, current mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>insy, on the 17th of September 1788, anti glOOO on tlie 28th May 1795; That the balance due from him on the judgment, after the deduction of the payments, amounced with interest and costs, on the 29th of July 1800, to \u00a1\u00a3321 <em>S </em>10. That the defendant, contriving to injure and oppress the complainant, obtained an assignment of the whole judgment against the complainant, arid issued \u00e1n execution thereon in his own name, as assignee, and threatens to levy the whole amount of the judgment, although the defendant Is himself liable for one half. That the defendant is in\u00e1ebted to the complainant in \u00a1\u00a3776 15 6' current money, exclusive of interest and costs, recovered by the latter of the former by a decree of the court of chancery. That the defendant refuses to discount out of the judgment any part of <em>the </em>money due to the complainant. <em>Prayer </em>for general relief, and an injunction. Injunction granted, &amp;c. The <em>anszver </em>of the defendant stated, that on the 20th of April 1784,at the pressing solicitation of the complainant, lie became bis security to D. Bulimy, in the bond stated In the bill, and which bond was given to renew a former bond of the complainant to <em>Dulany, </em>for the sole and proper debt of the complainant, contracted about the year 1772. That the defendant neither directly nor indirectly received \u00a9r participated in the benefit of any part of the consideration \u00a9f the said debt, and that he signed and executed the bond as the security of the complainant, and he positively denies the allegation of the complainant, that the same was for a joint -\u00e1ebt, or that the defendant ever received full or any satisfaction for the same. He admits the payments stated by the complainant, and the institution of the suits, and recovery \u00bbf judgments on the bond, and that lie ihc defendant hath. Obtained, as the surety of the complainant, an assignment of the judgment recovered against the complainant, as was lawful and just for him to do, and lie claims and insists, that he, as surety of the complainant, hath a legal, just, and equitable title, to proceed to recover the balance thereon due. He admits that the complainant hath obtained a decree in the court of chancery against him for the sum stated, but he insists that the complainant cannot justly claim any discount for or by reason of that decree, which is unjust, and upon which he hath prosecuted an appeal to the court of appeals, and where he confidently expects a reversa! of the decree. He deifies all fraud, &amp;c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Tlie \u2019defendant gave notice \u00f3f a motion to dissolve the in1' junction at the next term;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-3\">H\\ns'6n', Chancellor, at the next t\u00e9rm, On the motion to dissolve, passed an.order continuing the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-4\">There was much testimony taken, and it was the object of the complainant to prove that he had paid to the defendant more than his proportion of his father\u2019s estate, whose - executor the coinplainant was, and that the debt due to , <em>Dulany </em>w\u00e1s from the estate of the father; and that the bond was executed by them as joint obligors* each to pay one li\u00e1lf. The judgments obtained by the executrix of <em>Duldny </em>against <em>E. </em>and <em>S. </em>Norwood* (the payments made being deducted;) in consideration of the principal sum of money, and interest due thereon, being paid by <em>S. Nor-woody </em>all the right, &amp;c. of the plaintiff to the judgments; was assigned unto <em>S. Norwood </em>on the 24th of July 1800; by <em>William Cooke, </em>Esquire* attorney for the executrix of <em>Dulany-, </em>and in virtue of that assignment, a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>issued on the judgment against <em>E. Norwood, </em>in the name of <em>S. Norwood, </em>as the assignee of the executrix of <em>Dulany </em>* returnable to the general court at October terna 1800,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-5\">Hanson, Chancellor, (June term \u00cd803,) passed the-following interlocutory decree: The case is that of one of two obliges in a bond obtaining an assignment of the judgment on the bond, and endeavouring to avail himself of it as a mere security; whether or not he was such, is the main, if not the. only question in dispute. As it does not appear from the face of the bond that the assignee was only a security, his answer to the bill is not to be considered as standing good if it be contrary to the testimony of at least two witnesses, or of one witness, and strong equitable circumstances. Whether or not he was a mere surety must then be determined from the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-6\">The chancellor must declare that the testimony is by no means such as to convince him that <em>S. Norwood </em>joined in the bond with <em>E. Norwood </em>as a mere security. But supposing he did, and that no part of the consideration was by him received from <em>Dulany, </em>the obligee, if he received a consideration from <em>E. Norwood </em>for joining in the bond, he is surely to be charged with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Upon ihe whole, the chancellor conceives himself obliged to decree; and it is, &amp;c. decreed, that the parties account with each other before the auditor; and that the auditor of this court state <em>And </em>return the account to this court, charging <em>E. Norwood </em>with one half of the bond to <em>Dulany, </em>in the bill and answer mentioned, and giving him credits for payments appearing tci have been by him made, charging interest on the principles in this court established, and striking the balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-4\">But still the chancellor is by no means satisfied with respect to the merits of the cause. It appears that <em>S. Nor* wood </em>received upwards of \u00bf269 in specifics, as his share of the personal estate of the father, whe\u00fc \u00e1 far less sum was due to him; and it is probable that the said sum was the consideration for his joining <em>E. Norwood </em>in the bond to <em>Dulany. </em>The case is wonderfully perplexed and confused^ probably from the want of keeping regular accounts. If that sum <em>was </em>ihe consideration, and if, after deducting <em>S. Norwood\u2019s </em>share of the personal estate, it was inferior to the one half of the bond to <em>Dulany, </em>surely <em>S. Norwood vs </em>entitled to credit for the deficiency. Let then the auditor state an account in a different way, charging <em>E. </em>Nor-<em>\u2022wood </em>with the whole of the bond to <em>Dulany, </em>giving him \u2022credit for payments, and likewise for the delivery of the specifics to <em>8. Norwood, </em>deducting <em>S. Norwood\u2019s </em>share of the personal estate. The account, when returned, shall bo subject to the opinion of the chancellor, on exceptions, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\">The truth is, that in the present state of aif\u00e1irs the chan\u00bb cellar does not feel himself competent to pass a final decree to satisfy himself. lie knows not whether in the account in another cause between the parties, <em>E. Norwood </em>hath not had credit for the said sum. Let the auditor examine the former account. If already <em>E. Norwood </em>has received a credit for the said sum, probably he ought to be charged with the whole of the bond to <em>Dulany. </em>Iiowevers ihe whole is open to examination and controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-6\">The Auditor having reported, and both parties having excepted to some one of the accounts stated,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-7\">Haxsox, Chancellor, (July 25, 1804.) After hearing the exceptions of ihe parties, and the ingenious arguments \u2022of counsel relative to the statements of the auditor made under the decree of the 3d of August last, the chancellor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>has bestowed the most anxious attention to, and has tong deliberated on a causey than which he' never attended to one more perplexed and difficult. The testimony is very far from being satisfactory, and yet it appears unquestion' ably entitled to some weight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-6\">Upon the whole* the chancellor conceives it best to consider the complainant as the sole principal in the bond to <em>Bulany, </em>(the evidence in the cause showing that it was given on account of bonds by him passed without the defendant,) and to charge the defendant with \u00a3269 6 4, twelve months after the day of the date of the probate of the last will of <em>Ei Norwood, </em>deceased. It is accordingly ordered, that the auditor state another account differing substantially from account No. '2, by him endorsed and filed, &amp;c\u00bf</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-7\">And, on the 27th July 1804, it was further decreed, that{he <em>injunction </em>should be dissolved, provided that no mor\u00e9 be cotisidered due or levied by <em>S: Norwood, </em>by his execution on the judgment at law assigned to him, than the cost\u00e9 at law* arid the Sum of \u00a3278 9 0, with interest, &amp;c. But Whereas <em>E. Norwood, </em>by his petition this day,- hath stated dll oath, what is true to the chancellor\u2019s knowledge, that he hath a decree against <em>Ss Nonvood </em>for a sum which, With the lawful interest, is superior to the aggregate sum of \u00a3303 li 6, due to A. <em>Norwood </em>from <em>E. Norwood, </em>it is, Conformably to the petition* adjudged, &amp;c. that <em>S. </em>Nor-<em>wood </em>be further enjoined not to proceed on his execution at law until the further order of the chancellor, it being reasonable that there be a discount between the parties. From which decree the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b252-8\">The caus\u00e9 was argued before Chase, Cli. J.

That the amount of the decree by the chancellor, as well as the other sums, supposing the appellant not a cmprincipai, are properly discountable with any other sums he might owe to the appellee. He referred to the act of lTfiS, <em>ch. </em>23, and, insisted, that the appellant must prove, 1st. That he was a surety; and 2d,, That he has a.regular and legal assignment. That the assignment was made by the <em>attorney, </em>and not by the principal creditor or plaintiff in the judgment, as required by the act of \u25a0 1.T63; and that the execution, issued in the name of the appellant, as assignee, of the plaintiff, in the judgment, was not justified by the act under an assignment made by the attorney of the plaintiff, and in which it was not stated that the appellant was the surety.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b253-4\">Chase, Ch.
