The defendant then offered to read in evidence a commission, issued from this court on the 12th of November 1802, and certain depositions taken thereunder, and returned to this court on the 10th of April 1804. It appears-that the defendant had, at May term 1801, obtained a commission to <em>London </em>for the purpose of taking testimony, and as the cause was then standing for trial, the commission was granted, with a proviso, that if it was not returned at the next term it would be no cause of continuance at that term on the part of the defendant.

At October term 1802, the defendant had leave to renew his commission upon the same terms as were originally granted, and he tiled <em>additional interrogatories, </em>and issued the commission, and sent a copy of his original and additional interrogatories with the commission, which was returned, with depositions, as before stated, and were now offered to be read, but which were objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\">Chase, Ch.

The oath which the commissioners take, shows that they may receive additional interrogatories at any time before the commission is closed. In executing foreign commissions, notice is not necessary; but time should be given, that the opposite party might exhibit cross interrogatories.

That the deed from <em>Brown </em>to <em>Gadsby </em>appeared to Lave been executed <em>in pais </em>before <em>Carroll </em>and <em>Bland, </em>and sealed and delivered in their presence. 2. That the receipt of the alienation fine, as endorsed on the deed, stated that it was paid to <em>Carroll </em>on the 4th of May 1699. 3. That there was strong evidence of the execution of the deed on that day, because <em>Carroll, </em>who gave the receipt, was a wihiess to its execution! 4. That it was unusual to pay the alienation fine before the execution of the deed, as it could not be demanded before execution, being a duty arising on the actual alienation, and not before. 5.

That it was the official act of the clerk could not be doubted, because it was made under the eye of the court, and with their consent, and endorsed on the original deed. 7. That it was enddrsed at the request of the grantee, for his benefit, and to explain th\u00e9 date of the alienation fine. 8s That the memorandum, after so great a lapse of time, was the best evidence of the fact, and ought therefore to have been admitted in evidence as the act of the clerk in open court, with the consent of the court and the parties to the deed.

That if it could not be legally held under that judgment, it Was \u2022embraced by the releasing act of 1797, <em>ch. </em>119, unless it came within one of the provisos. 3. That the <em>second </em>proviso could not aid the appellee, for two reasons \u2014 1st. because <em>Norwood </em>was not an informer against <em>confiscated </em>lands; and 2d. because the rights of informers extended not to the land,'but to a certain part-of the price. They referred to the acts of 1785, <em>ch. </em>88, <em>s. </em>3; 1788, <em>ch. </em>49, &amp;, <em>2s </em>1789, <em>ch. 47, s. </em>20; 1790, <em>ch. </em>65; 1791, <em>ch. 77, ch. </em>90; 1792, <em>c\u00edi. </em>81; 1794, <em>ch. </em>40, <em>s. </em>7; <em>$r </em>1800, <em>ch. </em>62. 4. That the only remaining question was, whether <em>Norwood </em>came within the <em>first </em>proviso; that is, whether at the time of passing this act, (21st January 1798,) he had a right in or to this laud? They contended that the grant to <em>Nor-wood </em>could have no relation to the date of the escheat warrant, which had illegally issued; nor to the date of the certificate of survey, which was equally illegal, as there could be no relation to an illegal or tortious inception of \u25a0title.

That the land was liable to escheat, and that the escheat grant was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of an escheat. That if <em>Scarify </em>or his daughter, died after the 4th of July 1776, and before the act of confiscation, then the land escheated to the state, as the next heir being an alien could not inherit; and that it was incumbent on theappellant, who'claimed against the escheat grant, to prove that this did not happen. 2. That admitting the land to have been liable to confiscation,- and not escheat, still the grant ought to pass it; because, at the time of the grant, the price of escheat and confiscated lands were the same. 3. That at the time of making the grant, the chancellor had authority to grant confiscated lands under the acts of 1793, <em>ch. </em>64, and 1795, <em>ch. </em>6. 4. That he had general authority to judge and decide in disputes respecting the title of confiscated lands, and that he did so on <em>Hammond's </em>caveat; and his decision ought to be final under the acts of 1785, <em>ch. </em>66; April 1787, <em>ch. </em>SO, s. 4, and 1789, <em>ch. </em>35, <em>s. 4. 5. </em>That the grant was protected by the warranty clause in the act of November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>1781, <em>ch. </em>20, <em>s. </em>8.
