The bill stated, that <em>Davis </em>being seized of a valuable real property, and also- possessed of a considerable personal estate, consisting, among oilier tilings, of certain chattels real, and being also indebted to &lt;ii\\er.s citizens of this and of tho <em>United 8t.at.es, </em>beyond what he wars able to pay without a greater indulgence than his creditors were disposed io graut him, was compelled, sometime in the summer of the year <em>1787, </em>to apply to the chancellor for the benefit of the act of assembly respecting insolvent debtors; that hi consequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>thereof <em>Stephen Wilson </em>and <em>Robert Lemmon </em>were appointed trustees,oil behalf of the creditors of <em>Davis, </em>and that he executed to them', on the 10th of October 1788; a deed of all his real and personal property. That the trustees proceeded to sell, and, did sell a part of the- property to <em>Cumberland Dugan, </em>for the sum of \u00a31310 current money, and on the 6th of November 1792, the trustees executed to <em>Dugan </em>a deed for the property so to him sold. That <em>Dligan, </em>in lhaking the purchase, <em>acted </em>professedly as the fri\u00e9nd \u00f3f <em>Davis, </em>so f\u00e1r, that if h\u00e9 <em>Davis </em>could pro-\u2019 'cure die purchase money within \u00e1 certain time, lie was to have the benefit of the purchase; but as he was hot able so to do, it became necessary to sell the property, or a part thereof; to rais\u00e9 the purchase money; and to indemnify <em>Dugan\\ </em>and that <em>Dugan </em>being about to sell the property; and among the rest the following five lots, distinguished on a plot of <em>Baltimore </em>town by the numbers 950, 951, 952; 953 and 954, which lay connected and adjoining each other, on which <em>Davis </em>had a house, in which he resided with bis family, and also \u00e1 garden adjoining the house; which <em>Davis </em>and his wife were particularly desirous <em>to </em>preserve for themselves, but thinking themselves not able to purchase the whole of the lots, they were anxious that the lots should not be sold together, but subdivided into three or more subdivisions, each to be sold separately; 'and one of the subdivision's to include the house and garden; and in that case it was agreed that a friend should become the purchaser of the subdivision, including the house and garden, for ahd on behalf of <em>Mary, </em>the wife of <em>Davis, </em>and as a trustee for her, and that upon the purchase money being paid, the subdivision, so to be purchased, should be conveyed to her; and the better to effect this design, <em>David </em>and wife conversed with <em>Walsh, </em>the defendant, who professed himself a very warm friend to <em>Davis </em>and wife, and requested him to endeavour to prevail on <em>Dugan </em>to sell the lots in subdivisions, to enable <em>Mary, </em>the wife of <em>Daviss </em>by the intervention of a friend, to become the purchaser, fully disclosing to <em>Walsh </em>the intention of <em>Davis </em>and wife, that the wife should thus become the purchaser of that subdivision which should include the h\u00e9use and garden. <em>Walsh </em>perfectly approved <em>Davis </em>and wife\u2019s design, and promised to give his assistance for its completion, but declared, that in preference to applying to <em>Dugan </em>himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>be would apply to major <em>Thomas Yates, </em>the auctioneer, and solicit him to procure <em>Dugan </em>thus to subdivide <em>the </em>property, and as an encouragement for <em>Dvgan </em>so to do, he would let <em>Yates </em>know that in such case he, <em>Walsh, </em>would, purchase one of the subdivisions, consisting of meadows. That <em>Walsh </em>accordingly applied to <em>Yates </em>to procure a subdivision of the lots, informing <em>Fates </em>that it was intended the subdivision, in which the house,and garden were in-eluded, should be bought in, in trust for the wife of, <em>Davis; </em>and <em>Yates, </em>in consequence, prevailed on <em>Dugan </em>to subdivide the lots into three subdivisions, in such manner that one of them, containing nearly one acre of ground, should include the house and, garden. That <em>Davis </em>and wife, agreed with <em>Joseph Stockton, </em>who married tha sister of the. wife of Davis, to be the nominal purchaser of. the house and garden for the wife of <em>Davis, </em>and to attend the sale and, bid off the said- subdivision for her, with which <em>Walsh </em>was, fully acquainted. That <em>Davis, </em>the jamming before, the sale, applied to <em>Walsh </em>to be the security of. <em>Stockton </em>for com\u00bb plying with the terms of payment, provided <em>Stockton </em>purchased the house and garden on behalf of the wife <em>o\u00ed Davis, </em>which <em>Walsh </em>agreed to do. That both <em>Davis </em>and wife, as well as <em>Walsji- </em>and <em>Stockton, </em>attended the sale; that Stock<em>ton </em>bid for the subdivision, including the house and garden, and it was struck off to him for the sum of, \u00bf8155, that being the highest bid for the same; and that <em>Walsh </em>became, the purchaser of the other two subdivisions, giving for the one &lt;\u00a390, and for the other J83. That <em>Walsh, Dugan, </em>and others, well knew that <em>Stockton </em>bid.'for the wife of <em>Davis; </em>that this was repeatedly mentioned, and.that publicly, during the auction, and while he was bidding for the property. Thai by the terms of the sale, one-third of the purchase money was to be paid in three months from the day of sale, one-third in six. months, and the other third in nine months, and that the sale was made on the loth of June 1792, before which time <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Lemmon </em>had made their sale to Dugan, although they did not execute the deed to <em>Dugan </em>until some months after. That Stock\u2022 <em>ion </em>executed and delivered to <em>Dugan </em>a bond, with <em>Walsh </em>his surety, for payment of .the purchase money for the subdivision purchased by <em>Stockton </em>for the wife of <em>Davis; </em>the money to pay for which was to be furnished and provided by <em>Davis; </em>and that <em>Walsh </em>executed and delivered to <em>Dugan?, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>bond, with <em>Stockton </em>his surety, for the purchase money of the other two subdivisions. That <em>Davis </em>and wife <em>have, had the constant actual, possession of tfie subdivision </em>so bid off by <em>Stockton, </em>ever since the said purchase. That the day of the sale, <em>Davis </em>was at the house of <em>Stockton, </em>when <em>Dugan </em>was there with bonds to be executed for the. purchase money, and <em>Davis </em>observed that they ought to state the money was for the house and garden, but <em>Dugan </em>replied, it was immaterial, for that he would at any time give a bond for the conveyance thereof. That sometime after the sale, <em>Davis </em>called on <em>Walsh, </em>and told him he thought it time for <em>Dugan </em>to give his bond to convey the house and garden; for that he, <em>Davis, </em>had procured a great part of the sum first to be paid, and that he <em>Davis </em>wished to have a bond for the conveyance before he made the payment; whereupon, after a short pause, <em>Walsh </em>replied, to the amazement of <em>Davis, </em>that he, <em>Walsh, </em>had got a. bond for the conveyance, and that <em>Danis </em>. had nothing to do with it. <em>Davis </em>then asked <em>Walsh </em>what he meant by having a bond of conveyance, as he, Walsh, was only the surety for <em>Stockton </em>who purchased it in trust for the wife, of <em>Davis? Walsh </em>replied, he meant that <em>Stockton, </em>had given it all up to him. <em>Davis </em>then told <em>Walsh </em>that when the first payment became due he expected to make the payment, and that he did not want <em>Walsh </em>to pay for him, to which <em>Walsh </em>answered with warmth that <em>Davis </em>had nothing to do with it. That <em>Stockton </em>(as <em>Davis. </em>and wife are informed and believe,) being about to leave this st.ate and go to <em>Pennsylvania, </em>where, he now resides, ' was induced, in order to secure <em>Walsh, </em>to direct that <em>Dugan </em>should give the bond of conveyance to <em>Walsh, Jfalsh </em>at the same time assuring <em>Stockton </em>that no advantage, should be taken thereof, but that whenever <em>Davis </em>paid the purchase money, the wife of <em>Davis </em>should have a deed executed to her for the same. That some months after the .sale, <em>Davis </em>went to Dugan, and offered to pay him 8200, which he had then ready to pay him, and to give <em>Dugan </em>security for the residue, provided he would give up the, bonds which <em>Stockton </em>had executed, with <em>Walsh </em>as his surety, and offered to make payment of the residue in sixty days, but <em>Dugan </em>declared he could dp nothing without consulting <em>Walsh, </em>and that he, <em>Dugan, </em>must make the conveyance to whomsoever <em>Stockton </em>directed, saying that he did not know <em>Davis </em>in the transaction, altho\u2019 at the sama <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>time <em>Dugan </em>acknowledged that he knew <em>Stockton </em>purchased the property for the wife of <em>Davis; </em>and that <em>Stockton </em>had so mentioned in his, <em>Dugan\u2019s </em>presence, to Walsh, and also that <em>Stockton </em>made <em>ft ulsh </em>promise that she should have it when <em>Davis </em>paid the money for which it was purchased. That <em>Davis </em>was always willing and desirous to have paid the purchase money according <em>to </em>the contract, and several times applied to <em>Dugan </em>on the subject, and also to <em>Walsh </em>as being the surety, for payment of the same. That <em>Dugan </em>always alleged that he did not know <em>Davis </em>in the business, and that he had conveyed, or must convey, the property <em>to Walsh; </em>and when <em>Davis </em>applied to <em>Walsh, </em>he insisted <em>Davis </em>had nothing to do with the property, and that it belonged to him, <em>Walsh. </em>That <em>Dugan </em>hath actually conveyed the house and garden, and the lot on which they are situate, to <em>JFahh; </em>and that sometime in June last <em>Walsh </em>claimed of <em>Davis </em>\u00a330, as rent for one year lor the premises, and distrained for the same, altho\u2019 <em>Davis </em>sailh, that he never rented the premises of <em>Walsh, </em>or agreed to pay him any rent therefor, but always claimed the same in consequence of the said purchase; and that <em>Davis </em>was obliged to replevy the goods so distrained by <em>Walsh. </em>That <em>Jf'alsh </em>hath instituted an action of ejectment in the county court of <em>Baltimore </em>against <em>Davis, </em>to recover the possession of the four lots No. 951, 95,9, 953 and 954, which include the property so purchased by <em>Stockton. </em>That within the last thirty days <em>JFalsh </em>also served <em>Davis </em>with a notice, as if he had been a tenant of <em>Walsh, </em>to leave the premises within thirty days from the notice, in order to institute proceedings against <em>Davis </em>under the act, entitled, \u201cAn act to provide a summary mode of recovering the possession of lands and tenements holden by tenants for years, or at will, after the expiration of their terms.\u201d That on the 15th of February last, <em>Davis </em>did actually tender to <em>Walsh </em>the whole amount of the principal and interest of the purchase money, for, which <em>Stockton </em>purchased the property, and demanded that <em>Walsh </em>should convey the same to the wife of <em>Da,vis, </em>and that <em>Walsh </em>refused to receive the money, or execute a conveyance. <em>Prayer, </em>that <em>Davis </em>and wife may he quieted in their possession of the premises; and that <em>Walsh </em>may be compelled by a de \u25a0 cree to convey to the wife of <em>Davis </em>the property so purchased by <em>Stockton </em>for her use. <em>Prayer </em>also for <em>sulpena, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>and for an injunction, &amp;c. The <em>answer </em>of Walsh, the de-i fendant, admits that <em>Davis </em>applied for the, benefit of the insolvent law, and that the trustees named became entitled to his estate as the bill alleges, but the defendant hag no knowledge whether any agreement ever, took place between the complainants and <em>Dugan, </em>that in case the pur-, chase money was obtained by them he was to convey the. same to them. The defendant admits that the lots of ground mentioned were sold by <em>Dugan </em>at public sale as stated; anti the defendant saith, that the complainant., <em>Mary, </em>came to him previous to the sale thereof, and mew, iionetl to him that she and her husband were desirous o\u00a3 purchasing that part on which,the improvements of.-a smalL house and. garden were made, but expressed her, apprehensions that they would be unable to accomplish the payments at the limited, periods, and asked the defendant if-he would consent, to take the same to-his own account, in case they were so unable, and- the defendant did consent .to.do so. That at the sale of the property, which was distributed into three parts, the defendant became the purchaser of- two third part's thereof, and that <em>Stockton </em>became the purchaser of the remaining third part, including the house and garden, as the defendant was informed and believes, in trust for <em>Davis, </em>in the event of his making the payments. in 3,6-and 9 months, that being the time,limited -at the sale thereof. That the defendant became the security of \u25a0 <em>Stockton </em>for. the purchase money of the third part, to <em>Dugan, </em>and at that time also informed <em>Stockton </em>that he had made the promise, herein before stated, respecting the same, to Mrs. <em>Davis. </em>That before bonds for the co.nvey-. anee of the lots of ground were executed by <em>Dugan, </em>the complainants severally came iq the defendant, and informed- him that they had determined not to have any thing -to do with the purchase made by <em>Stockton, </em>and requested the defendant to take the whole upon himself, and obtain a bond in his own name for,the conveyance thereof; at that time also the defendant consented to take the same upon himself, but observed to the complainant <em>Davis, </em>that it would be proper for him and- <em>Stockton </em>to call on <em>Dugan </em>and request that the bond of conveyance should be executed to the defendant only. That shortly after this conversation, <em>Davis </em>and <em>Stockton </em>informed the defendant that they had waited on <em>Dugan </em>for that purpose. Tlipt- at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>another day, previous to the execution of the bond of conveyance, <em>Davis, </em>in conversation with the defendant relative to the property, and in order to induce the defendant the more readily to take the purchase upon himself, informed him that <em>Peter Lilzingcr, </em>the proprietor of the ad4 Joining ground, would sell the same on reasonable terms, and advised the defendant to purchase the same, as he would thereby obtain the whole front on both sides of the Street; and the defendant did accordingly purchase the opposite front from <em>Lilzingcr. </em>The defendant afterwards obtained the bond of conveyance in his own name; that he was pressed to take the same both by <em>Stockton </em>and Davis\u00ab That at the stipulated periods he paid the purchase money to <em>Dugan, </em>and has since obtained conveyances in fee for the whole of the property; and at the request of <em>Stockton </em>executed to him a bond of indemnity against the payment of the purchase money to <em>Dugan. </em>That <em>Davis, </em>at the time of the sale of the property, was considerably indebted to the defendant fer goods sold and delivered, and that on that account be is now indebted to the defendant in the sum of more than <em>\u00a3~\u00a1Q. </em>That after the defendant made the first payment for the property to <em>Dugan, </em>he informed <em>Davis </em>that he must pay \u00bf330 per annum rent. That he always considered himself entitled to recover that sum, and that <em>Davis </em>was his tenant at that rent, and compellable to the payment thereof by distress. That under this impression, and in consequence of <em>Davis\u2019s </em>refusal to pay the same, he levied a distress, and instituted such process for the recovery of the possession of the property, as stated ia the bill. The defendant doth positively deny that he either, directly or indirectly, ever promised or gave any other assurance to the complainants, or either of them, or to <em>Stock-ion, </em>that whenever they paid the purchase money he would execute a conveyance for the third, or any other part, to <em>Mary </em>one of the complainants. That he does not believe any tender of money, on account of the pretended claim of the complainants, was ever made to any person, until nearly two years after the sale, when <em>Davis </em>came to the defendant\u2019s house, and told him that he came to tender him money for the property now possessed by the complainants, when the defendant answered, that as he had neither sold, nor promised to sell him, auy ground, he could riot receive any onjhat account, but would be thankful to receive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>apply the same to their credit for goods sold to Mrs. <em>Dash </em>two years before, which <em>Davis </em>refused, observing that that account should be paid in due time. That since the property hath been in the possession of Davis, the name hath suffered great injury, and the defendant has reason to apprehend, and doth believe, will be almost wholly ruined if suffered to remain with him; and the defendant is restrained from taking the possession thereof. The defendant doth positively aver, that he hath never, since the purchase of the ptoperfy, promised or bound himself to permit the complainants the privilege of paying up the principal and interest of the purchase money, and taking the property; and expressly denies any trust whatever for their benefit. He denies the fraud and oppression charged by the complainants, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-4\">A motion <em>to </em>dissolve the <em>injunction </em>was made by the defendant, which being submitted,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">Hansost, Chancellor, stated, that the bill and answer were by him read and considered, and it appearing that the equity stated in the bill, on which the injunction was obtained, is fully denied by the answer; and there being ncs circumstances to induce the chancellor to continue the injunction until final hearing, or further order, it is adjudged and ordered, that the injunction be, and it is hereby dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\"><em>Commissions </em>issued for taking testimony, which were executed and returned, containing <em>the </em>following <em>evidence.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\"><em>Joseph Stockton </em>He affirmed that in the year <em>1793 he </em>was present at the sale of a house and lot situated on <em>Hampstead </em>Hill, at the head of -Bond-street, in the city of Baltimore, that the sale was made by order of <em>Cumberland Dugan, </em>the owner of the property, under the superintendence of major <em>Yates, </em>an auctioneer; that at the time of the sale, the premises were divided into three parts or parcels; that the affirmant, at the instance and request of <em>Mary Davis, </em>one of the complainants, with the knowledge and approbation of her husband, the other complainant, became the purchaser of the first part or parcel of the premises, whereon a house and garden were erected, and laid out; that at the time of the sale it was publicly announced by the auctioneer, and was understood by the defendant, who was present, that the affirmant made the, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ptirchase as agent, and for the use of the complainants, that the defendant became the purchaser of the other two lots, parts or parcels of <em>the </em>premises; that <em>the </em>affirmant bid \u00bf\u00a3 I SO for the lot which be bought, and that the defendant bid a larger sum (how much the affirmant cannot recollect,) for the two parts which he bought.

That sometime before the executing the said bond of conveyance, <em>Davis, </em>or his wife, called on the deponent, and told him it was perfectly agreeable that a bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>of conveyance should be given to <em>Walsh </em>for the whole of the property; and the deponent understood that the complainants and defendant were then on good terms. He believes that <em>Walsh </em>did know, or had been informed, at or before the time when the bond of conveyance was execut-. ed, that <em>Stockton </em>purchased the property for <em>Davis </em>or wife. He believes that <em>Davis </em>called on him a short time before the first payment became due, and after the bond of con- . veyatice had been given to Walsh, and said he would pay him 8200, and give him security for the remainder, but the deponent said he could not do any thing in it, because the bond was nearly due, and he expected to get the whole, when it became due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Afc\"><em>Job Gurretson. </em>He deposed- that it was publicly said at the sale that <em>Stockton </em>bid for Mrs. <em>Davis; </em>that the der ponent so understood it. himself, and supposed it to be so, Understood by others, from the general- conversation, and he believes it was so understood by <em>Walsh </em>and Dugan, and that Dirgvmtold the deponent so. That at the time of the. sale, <em>Stockton </em>told the deponent that <em>Walsh </em>had agreed ta be security for him if he bought the property. That <em>Dugan, </em>told the deponen.t that he. supposed <em>Walsh </em>would be security for Stockton. <em>Walsh </em>afterwards said to deponent, he. thpught it was a pity that <em>Davis </em>and wife, should be put out of- the property, and that he had become security for. the payment of the money, and that when they paid the. money the property was theirs. That a few days before, <em>Stockton </em>went away, <em>Dugan </em>told the deponent that <em>Stock* ton </em>had a bond of conveyance, and that he might, deed or. assign it to Walsh, but whenever the money was paid, the, property would be theirs, meaning <em>Davis </em>and vvife. That. <em>Stockton, </em>a little before, informed the deponent, that he was a good deal uneasy about his being security for <em>Davis. </em>for the purchase money of the said house and garden; that he was going to leave the. place in a. few days, and had \"a mind to let <em>Walsh </em>have it, and whenever <em>Dav.is </em>and wife, \u2022paid the money, <em>Walsh </em>would let them have the property. On the deponent informing <em>Dugan </em>of this conversation, the. preceding conversation with <em>Dugan </em>took place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">It was admitted that <em>Davis </em>remained in possession of the house and garden, until he was turned out by a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>issued on a judgment at law obtained' ^gainst him at the suit of <em>Walsh's </em>lessee. That <em>Stocktm\\ </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>removed out of the state shortly after the purchase, and before any part of the purchase money was paid. That the sale made by <em>Dugan </em>was after the time of the purchase made of <em>Davis\u2019s </em>trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-3\">IIansojt, Chancellor, (December term, 1805.) The pause standing ready for hearing, has been debated by the counsel on each sidc<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>, and the whole by the chancellor carefully considered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-4\">How often does the chancellor think it proper to mention the principle on which the statute of frauds was fram-' ed, and principles in this court established. There is ip this case no agreement, that the chancellor perceives. Is it necessary to say that a contract is a stipulation or agreement, or understanding, between two persons, each of whom is bound to do something on his part, and that if one is not bound, he has no right to consider the other as bound? It is true, that an express contract may be so made, as that one shall for a consideration be bound, and the other pot bound without his own will. For instance, A and B make this agreement \u2014 A binds himself for the consideration of 10 dollars, before the 25th of December, to procure to B 10 hogs, for which, if B likes them, and chooses to take them, he shall pay at the rate of \u00a78 per 100 wt. In this case agreement is clear, A is bound to bring the hogs; but it is at the election of B to take or reject them as he thinks proper, losing his \u00a710. But if there, be no consideration to A, it is not to be supposed that he is bound to bring the bogs, and B not bound to take them. This may indeed be considered as illustrating by the thing itself. Let, it be said then, that in the present case there was, on the part of the complainants, no contract. There was no <em>actus contra aciitmj </em>there, was no consideration flowing from them; there was nothing binding on them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">It has been contended, that <em>Stockton </em>only acted as trustee for the complainants, and purchased for them. But is there any proof, or even allegation, that he purchased with their money, or that they were bound to provide the money, or take the purchase from them? It has been insisted too, that as he made the contract in his own name, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the property was to be considered as a security in the hands of him, the nominal purchaser, and that as this was the case, the time stipulated for redeeming it was to be considered in the same light as the day of redemption mentioned ip a common mortgage. There is no analogy, and it is not to be conceived that this court ought to determine, that although there was np consideration flowing from the complainants, and although there was nothing binding on them, <em>Stockton </em>should be obliged to convey to them at any time, when they should find it convenient to pay the money; am} that at any period after the time stipulated, whoever should hold the property from, by, or under <em>Stockton, </em>after even twenty megne transfers, should hold it subject to the wilt of the complainants to redeem it at any time. How would such doctiine comport with the interests of a young thriving town?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-3\">The chancellor does not conceive there is any solidity in. the observation respecting answers in this court. The distinction is plain. Where a defendant first admits the allegations in a hill, and then sets up some distinct <em>after </em>transaction, by way of ,avoidance, he is bound, to prove that transaction. But where a man is called on by a bill in tins court to say whether or not there was an agreement between him and the complainant, and what it was, his answer, with respect to the nature of that agreement, is to be taken altogether. For instance, says the bill of A. \u2014 B contracted with me, by parol, for the consideration, of $50C0, to sell me 300 acres of land in <em>Baltimore </em>county, of which he, put me in possession, but I was to have credit for five, years without paying interest. B, in his answer, admits that there was a parol contract for the land, and possession given as stated; but instead of having credit as aforesaid without interest, A was to give him bond, with security, .for paying with interest in tl^ree years. Will common sense suffer a construction as, that because B admits^ a contract and possession he must be considered to have, admitted every thing necessary for A\u2019s purpose, unless hq can prove, on commission, that the contract was as stated, in the answer? No! the absurdity is glaring. But if B1 had admitted the matters stated in the bill to be facts, but went on and said that afterwards, A, for'the consideration of $100; had agreed to give up the purchase, &amp;c, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>{part of the answer must be proved on commission, unless A, on interrogatories, had admitted its truth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-4\">The chancellor thinks proper to make a remark, which ought to have come before \u2014 supposing <em>Stockton </em>really bound to convey on receiving the purchase money on or before such a day. inasmuch as the complainants were under no obligation whatever to take the purchase off <em>Stockton\u2019s. </em>hands, and inasmuch as he had no valuable consideration, the utmost they could claim in reason would be to take the purchase off his hands by paying the money on the day stipulated. Suppose this case \u2014 they do not bring him the money on that day \u2014 property has tallen so much in value that it is not for their interest to take it on or before the day. lie cannot compel them to take it. He does not wish to keep it, but to get free of it on the best terms. He sells it for S500 less than it cost him. Ten years after this the property is worth three times as much as it cost <em>Stockton. </em>Then, indeed, <em>Davis </em>and wife, whether or not they have money, can contrive to redeem, or claim it to advantage, provided it can be so redeemed or claimed. AYell' \u2014 the purchaser from Stockton, or the purchaser from that purchaser, or the purchaser from the second purchaser, is obliged, on <em>Davis\u2019s </em>application, to convey him the property on his paying, <em>Sic. </em>It is really an affront to common sense to say that <em>Davis\u2019s </em>claim ought to prevail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">The chancellor has given his ideas at large. He might' refer to decisions of the court of appeals, which if there be \u25a0a judgment to be formed from decrees, the reasons of which are not assigned, are more strict with respect to agreements set up against the intent of the statute of frauds than the chancellor has ever seen.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">The chancellor indeed has always thought that it would have been much better to construe the statute of frauds <em>strictly </em>against contracts. However he has always endeavoured to conform to decisions, which on any principi\u00e9 might be considered as binding on him. lie has never intentionally decided against any decree of the Lord Chancellor of <em>England, </em>made before the revolution, or even any decision of Chancellor <em>Rogers, </em>which hath not been controverted, unless on a bill of review. As to the present case, he is satisfied, that by decreeing a dismission of the bill, he will contravene the principle of no decision in equity, which ever hath been given, <em>Decreed, </em>that the bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the complainants be dismissed, and the defendant be dismissed, but without costs.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b354-6\">From which decree the complainants appealed to this court.
