The object of the bill, as stated therein, and in the arguments of the \u25a0 counsel, is to set aside and annul the decree heretofore obtained by the defendant against the complainant, in this court in October 1801, on the ground of fraud practised by the defendant in the obtaining that decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-11\">It becomes necessary therefore to examine bow far this-allegation is supported by the evidence in the present suit. This, consists of the plot returned, by which the complain-' ant contends, that it appears the locations of the lands in controversy are different from what they were represented to be in the former case. But this circumstance, suppos- \u2018 ing it to be clearly established, does not amount (o a proof of fraud as to the former decree. One part of the tesff<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>snony, admitted in the former case, was the deposition of <em>John Foster, </em>which the complainant alleges was repugnant to the truth; and another was the cerlificate of <em>Bell, </em>asan assistant surveyor to <em>Gist, </em>which the complainant states was agreed by his counsel to be admitted as evidence upon the false suggestion of the defendant. Of this fact there appears to be no proof; and although fraud may be inferred from a variety of circumstances combined together, it is not tobe presumed merely because the fact may on the present proof be different from what the evidence, admitted through mistake, showed it to be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-2\">It is not necessary or proper to go into the former decree on the evidence then produced, and it must stand, unless it can be set aside according to the known and established principles of this court. <em>Decreed, </em>that the bill of the complainant be dismissed, <em>but without costs. </em>From this decree the <em>complainant </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-3\">The cause was argued before Chase, Ch.
