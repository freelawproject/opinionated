This was an action or ejectment brought to recover two tracts of land, viz. <em>Colds Harbour, </em>and <em>Mountenarfs Neck, </em>lying in <em>Baltimore </em>county. The defendant,, (ncfiv appellant,) pleaded the general issue. The plaintiff at the trial, at May term 1804, offered in evidence,- that <em>Jlndrem Stigar, </em>in his life-time, being seized of four parts- or pircels of the two tracts of land for which the ejectment was brought, arid being justly indebted to <em>James Franklin, </em>in order to secure to him pay - ment of the money due, did, on the 9th of May 1787, execute, a mortgage to him of the said parcels of land, to bo' void upon payment of the money due, on the 7 th of May 1789. He also gave in evidence,- that no part of the money has been paid; and that the lessor of the plaintiff is-heir at law and administratrix of <em>FfttnMin, </em>who died before the institution of this suit. The defendant then offered in evidence, that <em>Stigar </em>was seized find possessed of the said four parcels of land before and on the 24th of May 1785. He then offered in evidence a record of a judgment obtained by <em>Thomas Usher </em>against <em>Stigar, </em>rutile general- court in-May 178-5, which judgment was signed on the 24th of that month-. And evidence that <em>Usher </em>afterwards departed this life on the 1st of January 1786,. having by his will appointed <em>T. Usher, J. </em>Donaldson, ami <em>S. Johnston, </em>his executors. He also offered in evidence certain records and proceedings of the general court, showing, that the said executors afterwards, on the 5th of April 1786, sued out a writ of <em>scire facias </em>on the said judgment, the same being then due aiid unsatisfied} and that a <em>fiat </em>was thereon entered at October term 1787. That a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>issued on the last mentioned judgment, directed to' the then sheriff of <em>Baltimore </em>county, on the 17th of July 1788, returnable to the October term following, when it was returned by the said sheriff, thereon endorsed, \u201cmade as per schedule, and remains in the sheriff\u2019s hands for want of buyers.\u201d Which said schedule stated, that \u201cfour acres of land near Baltimore-town, and adjoining the property or lands of <em>George Lux, </em>with all the improvements thereon,\u201d were valued by four persons, as appraisers, to .-SI 500, and \u201cabout 27 acres of land, more or less, part of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>or <em>Todd\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>Mange, </em>and pari of <em>Mounteney\u2019s Neck, </em>lying to the north side of Pitt-street, near Baltimore-town,\u201d were valued at \u00a312 pef acre; and \u201cabout 2| acres of land in the S. East addition of <em>Baltimore-tovm, </em>lying on <em>Harford </em>and <em>Eden </em>streets,\u201d were valued at\u00a3l2 per acre; and \u201cPart of <em>Todd\u2019s Bange, </em>containing 11 acres, more or less, leased to <em>Peter Shepperd </em>for \u00a390 pr. annum,\u201d was valued at \u00a31500. That a writ of <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued to the said sheriff on the 6th of December 1788, commanding him to expose to sale the several pieces or parcels of land, and the money therefrom arising, have before the court at the May term then following; which last mentioned writ the said sheriff returned, thereon endorsed, \u201cmade and satisfied plaintiff in part, \u00a3485.\u201d He then offered in evidence, that <em>T. Usher </em>purchased the lands exposed to sale upon the said writ of <em>venditioni exponas, </em>from the said sheriff, under the said execution; and that the said sheriff executed to him a deed therefor, which deed the defendant also offered in evidence, dated the 31st of December 1790. He also offered in evidence, that <em>T. Usher </em>did duly pay to the said sheriff the purchase money for the land so to him sold j that he entered upon the said land, and was thereof seized; and afterwards, on the 11th of May 1792, for a valuable consideration to him paid by the defendant, did duly execute and deliver to him a deed of bargain and sale for the said parts of the two tracts of land before described. Also, that under that deed the defendant entered, &amp;c. and that <em>Franklin, </em>or any person claiming under him, never was in the actual possession of tiie said lands, but that the same remained in the actual possession of <em>Stigar, </em>or those under whom the defendant claims. The plaintiff then prayed the opinion of the court, and their direction to the jury, that on the foregoing statement of facts, if they believe it to be true, the plaintiff is entitled to recover all the lands for which this suit is brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-3\">Martin, (Attorney-General,) and <em>Harper, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alg\">in their arguments cited <em>Arnott and Copper vs. Nicholls, </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>471. and <em>Co.

The <em>fieri facias </em>in that case had been taken out after the alienation of the land, and the court thought the alienee should have notice; and that a <em>scire facias </em>should have issued to warn him as terretenant; that the whole real estate of the defendant was bound by the judgment, and if there were other alienees, or other real estate, the whole should contribute. That the alienee, having notice, might come in and pay the judgment so as to exonerate the land; and if there was other property than that aliened, the <em>fieri facias </em>should be levied of that, before recourse should be had to the land aliened.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-8\">The court consider the case of <em>Arnott $/\u2022 Copper vs \u00a1 Nicholls, </em>similar to the case at bar in all respects except as to the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-9\">The mortgagee has 'a legal title in the land mortgaged, and upon failure to comply with the proviso, by paying the money, the legal title is completely vested in the mortgagee, to be defeated only upon payment of the mortgage' moneys or in other words, the mortgagee has a legal title in the land, defeasable at law, by redemption at the day, Indefeasable at law afterwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-10\">The mortgagee can bring his ejectment, but the mortgagor may come in and pay the money, and exonerate the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-11\">At the time the judgment was rendered on the <em>scire fa</em>ldas, the mortgagee was terretenant of the land, and tire <em>scire facias </em>ought to have issued against him to give .him an opportunity to plead as terretenant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-12\">A <em>scire facias </em>against terretenants is either general or special; that is, either against the terretenants generally, without naming them, or specially against them by name.
