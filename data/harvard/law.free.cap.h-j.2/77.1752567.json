J. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>The court are of opinion, 'that the \u25a0defendant is not entitled to the set-off claimed, as his right \u25a0to the plaintiffs\u2019 note accrued subsequent to the com\u25a0snencemeni of this action. If this set-off was allowed, great mischief would result from it. It would burthen the plaintiff\" with the costs of suit, although at the time he in\u25a0siituted his suit he had a good cause of action, and against which, at the time, there was no defence, and it would encourage and sanction a practice which ought not to receive any countenance or favour from this court \u2014 the practice of buying up claims against a plaintiff, which, instead of promoting, would be a perversion of justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-13\">The act of assembly, in the opinion of the court, makes no change in the law as to the time tire cause of action accrues. It enumerates the cases in winch the set-off may be claimed, and allows the defendant to plead it, or give it in evidence on the general issue, on filing his cause of .action, and giving notice that he claims to set it off\" against the plaintiff\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-14\">Certainly the act of assembly ought to be liberally construed so as to prevent circuity of action, and to do juslice between the parties in the adjustment of their mutual debts, <em>subsisting </em>at the time the action was brought; but there would be no liberality or justice in construing it so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>as to sanction and legalize the practice of buyingup claims1 to harass the plaintiff, aad burthen him with costs, without any fault' in hint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">The chief judge observed, that the defendant can- avail himself of nothing done during the pendency of the action, unless it has the concurrent act of <em>the </em>plaintiff. The debt must be a subsisting debt at the time the suit is brought. If the defendant pays the debt, or has a release, he must plead it after the last continuance. If a <em>feme sole </em>marries pending the suit, it must he pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-8\">In the case of <em>Wolgamot vs. Bruner, </em>there were three' pleas, viz. Nothing in airear, payment, and set-off There was a demurrer to the last plea, and an exception to 'the oilier pleas. The exception was defective; and the only question was upon the plea of set-off as the party could not lake advantage of the exception, it being defective. <em>Barnes's Notes </em>was the only case referred to on the set-off. The case of <em>Sapsford vs. Fletcher, </em>4 <em>T. R. </em>511, is certainly good law; it was there considered, that payment to the landlord by the subtenant, is payment to the tenant. All the authorities, both before and since the revolution, concur in establishing that a plea of set-off is not a good plea to an avow in replevin. The defendant excepted. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed to this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-13\">/V debt or demand may be set off, or pleaded in discount, altho\u2019 it was not subsisting at the time tlie action was brought.</p>\n<judges data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b90-9\">The cause was argued before Tilghman, Nicholsok. and Gaxtt, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-10\"><em>Shaajf, Johnson, </em>(Attorney General,) and <em>Van-Horn, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0v\">referred to the statutes of 2 <em>Geo. </em>II, <em>ch. </em>22, <em>s. </em>11. 8 <em>Geo. </em>II, <em>ch. </em>24, <em>s. 4, </em>5; and the act of 1785, <em>ch. </em>46, <em>s. 7.
