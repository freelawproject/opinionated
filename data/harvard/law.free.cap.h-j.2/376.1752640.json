This was an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>brought by the appellees, and' entered for the use of <em>James Robertson, </em>against the appellant. The declaration contained a count for goods, wares' and merchandizes, properly chargeable in account, as by a particular account, &amp;c. a count for money paid, laid out and expended, and a count on a <em>quantum meruit </em>for goods, &amp;c. property chargeable in account, sold and delivered. An account was filed witli the declaration, in which the defendant was- charged as debtor to the plaintiffs, on the 3d of December 1799, \u201cto 1 hhd. sugar, p. bill p.

Which opinion and direction the county court, <em>\u00a3Sprigg, </em>Ch. J.] refused to give to the. jury. The defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being for the plaintiffs, the defendant prosecuted this appeal.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b387-4\">The cause was argued before Chase, Ch. <em>2, </em>Buoiiaxanv and Nicholson, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-5\"><em>r. </em>Buchanan, for the Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AON\">contended, that the judgment of the court below must be reversed.

This court can only look at the declaration and the bill of exceptions. The court below were right In re,fusing <em>to </em>give the opinion prayed for, if there was no evidence in the case. There are no facts stated in the bill of exceptions, but a hypothetical opinion prayed to be given by the court, which the court very properly refused to give. No evidence was offered that the money was. paid by <em>Robertson, </em>or any agreement that he would pay it, if the defendant did not; and this court cannot say that the court below erred in refusing to give an opinion where no facts were proved to justify such opinion being given. It is not stated that the defendant offered to prove the fact of payment by <em>Robertson, </em>flor that the plaintiffs had been paid. If the judgment is reversed, this court will say that the opinion ought to have been given by the court below, although founded on no facts. It cannot bo inferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>by this court judicially, that there wag any evidence offered Ut all. This court cannot travel out of the record. It is important that facts should be stated; and this court cannot reverse this .judgment, as there was no statement of facts upon which th\u00e9 Opinion and direction, Us prayed, could be given.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-3\"><em>T. Buchanaii\u25a0, </em>ill rfcply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7n\">Hypothetical opinions hfeV\u00e9 been often given iri th\u00e9 late general court,, and courts do so when they do not require the whole facts spread upoh the record. It is done to prevent the drawing up th\u00e9 facts, and crowding the recoi\u2019d, and to save expense to the parties. Such was the practice in the cases of <em>Lawrence vs. Devalt, (October </em>term 1794. J <em>Muhony vs. Ashton, </em>4 <em>Harr. &amp; M'Hen. </em>296, 305, <em>Newman vs. </em>Morris, 4 <em>Harr. &amp; M\u2018Hen. </em>421. <em>Queen vs. Ashton, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>M'Hen. </em>339, <em>Worthington vs. Filthy, (October </em>term 1791;) and <em>Reeves vs. Middleton, (May </em>term 1793.) Will it be said, that because no facts are stated, this court will not review the decision of the.c\u00e9t\u00edrt below? It may be inferred that the evidence was offered, or the court below would not liave been called on to give the opinion and direction a\u00e9 prayed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b388-4\">Chase, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGW\">In every case where the court are called, upon to give a direction to the jury, the facts should appear, and the opinion of the court will depend upon the mature of the evidence, and unless it does appear what the fapts are, it cannot be said-the court erred in their opinion by refusing to give the opinion asked for. If a contrary practice prevailed,, the court might be called upon to decide upon questions not arising in the case. I am of opinion, that the bill of exceptions in this case ought hot to be retained by this court.</p>\n<author id=\"b388-5\">Buchanan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhW\">As the- court below has, not stated that they refused1 the prayer, because the facts were not stated or-proved, this court are bound-to,decide on th\u00e9 law in. the case. The most regular way- would, be to. state the facts,, or that there were-.no such facts, if nolle existed in the case. If in this- case there had: been no facts to. justify the-opinion being given, the plaintiffs should-not have stated: in the-bill of exceptions, that the facts did not exist. As.a matter of practice,, the evidence \u00e1h\u00e9t\u00fcd be-stated.,- It N <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>my opinion, that the bill of exceptions taken in the case ought to be retained.</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-4\">Nicholson, J. concurred with Bugiunak, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSE\u00bb,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
