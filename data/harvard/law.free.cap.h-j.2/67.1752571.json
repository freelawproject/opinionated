That in consideration of a debt due from <em>Cover </em>to them, he on the lliti of Slay 1787, assigned the. said single bill to the complainants. That suit was brought on the, bill against <em>Willetts, </em>in the name of Cover, for the use of the complainants. That a judgment was obtained at May term 1800, and an execution issued against the. property of <em>Willetts, </em>which was returned <em>nulla bona </em>to October term following. That no part of the debt was ever paid, except \u00a310 paid on the 30th of September 1797. That <em>Willetts </em>has become insolvent, and released by the insolvent law. That the complainant-\u00a1 have, frequently called on <em>Cover, </em>the assignor, and roques! ed payment, which he has refused.. That the assignment of ihe single 1 till was not made in pursuance of the act of assembly, so as to enable the complainants to proceed at law against <em>Cover, </em>the assignor. <em>Prayer, </em>for a decree <em>to </em>compel <em>Cover </em>to pay the amount, of the single bill, (deducting the said payment,) with interest, <em>See. </em>and for other relief, \u00a3:,e. The \u00ab\u00absteer of <em>Cover </em>stated, that he assigned (he single bill of Willetts, and two other bonds to him from other persona, to the complainanfa, in full satisfaction of the debt which ha owed to them, and that they agreed to taka said assignments in full satisfaction, without having any further or after recourse to him for the debt due from him to them, or for or on account of the assigned bill and bonds, and upon that condition the assignments were made, and receipt, in full was given for ilia debt duo by him to them.
