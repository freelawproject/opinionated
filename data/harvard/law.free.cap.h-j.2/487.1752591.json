That in the. true and genuine certificate <em>of Singery\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>TroUiing Streams, </em>there is no call for \u201cthe beginning tre\u00e9s of <em>Petticoat\u2019s Loose,\u201d </em>but that the certificate returned to . . the land office by <em>Singery, </em>has tins expression, widen the relator expressly states was forged and inserted by <em>Singery </em>for the purpose of extending the twelfth line of the trad, and thereby taking in more land than he was entitled to. That by the certificate, as made out by <em>Calder </em>before mentioned, <em>Singery\u2019s Trouting Streams </em>is made to contain 178 acres, but that by the certificate returned to the land office by <em>Singery, </em>that tract, by virtue of the call above mentioned, contains 560 acres, as <em>Singery </em>contends, though the certificate expresses only 178 acres, as will appear by a plot of the land exhibited, and which was made out and returned by the surveyor of <em>Baltimore </em>county to the general court, in an action of ejectment therein depending for the land between the relator\u2019s lessee and <em>Singery. That Singery, </em>oti the 20th of April 1775, obtained a patent on the said forged certificate, and thereby got 382 acres of land more than he was entitled to, or compounded for with the Proprietary, or his agents. That by virtue of two special warrants obtained from the land office in the year 1793s the relator had surveyed for him, by the surveyor of Haiti<em>?nore </em>county, 300 acres of land, called <em>Boreing\u2019s Habitation Rode, </em>and returned a certificate thereof, and that afterwards, on the 24th of April 1795, a patent issued to him for the same. That the land taken up, and paid for by him, called <em>Boreing\u2019s Habitation Rock, </em>is claimed by <em>Singery </em>under fhe false and forged certificate and patent thereon, as will fully appear by the plot before referred t\u00f3; and that <em>Singery </em>has possession of the land, and holds it as being within the lines of <em>Singery\u2019s Trouting Streams. </em>But the relator expressly charges, that he has instituted art ejectment in the general court <em>against Singery to recover </em>the land, and obtained a verdict and judgment in his favour, from which decision <em>Singery </em>has appealed to the court of appeals<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>; and he is apprehensive that the said impositions and forgery will be productive of endless controversies and disputes between him and <em>Singery, </em>unless it can be corrected by this court. That by the plot returned to the land office, with the certificate on which the patent is- - sued, it is obvious that <em>Singery\u2019s Trouting Streams, </em>(which included two old surveys, namely <em>Petticoat\u2019s Loose </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>Merryman\u2019s Mountain </em>and a very small piece of vacancy,) could not contain more than 178 acres, as mentioned in the certificate, because bv the plot it appears that Petti<em>boat's Loose, </em>and <em>Merryman s Mountain, </em>were almost contiguous and adjoining tracts, and there was only a small vacancy between them,* but by extending the twelfth line of <em>Singery\u2019s Troutlng Streams </em>to the surreptitious \u2018'beginning trees of <em>Petticoat\u2019s Loose,\u201d </em>as now contended for by <em>Singery, </em>there will be created a vacancy of 382 acres between the two tracts, which the relator contends is not the fact, but that it is an imposition in <em>Singery.' </em>That at .the time <em>Singery\u2019s Fr\u00f3uti\u00f1g Streams </em>Vas surveyed, there was a rule or law of the land office prohibiting the surveyors from expressing calls in any certificates of surveys made by them under any warrant from that office* and that the call in the certificate of <em>Singery\u2019s Troutlng Streams, </em>is iri direct violation of that rule* as will appear by recurring to the rules of the land office, and by the deposition of Colder, the surveyor, now filed. <em>Prayer, </em>that the certificate and patent of <em>Singery\u2019s Troutlng Streams \u2018 </em>may be vacated, or corrected, so as to exclude the call,and\" restrict <em>Singery </em>to the bourses and distances specified in the certificate, and for further relief, &amp;e. The <em>answer </em>of <em>Singery, </em>the defendant, states that, commissioners were appointed by the Lord Proprietary to.make sale of his reserved lands* or of parts thereof, and.tke defendant b'eing in possession of two surveys within the reserves of <em>Baltimore </em>county* the on'e called <em>-Merryman\u2019s </em>Mountain, and the other called <em>Petticoat\u2019s Loo\u00e9C; </em>purchased the same of the commissioners, and he believes the two parcels of land were reduced into one entire tract under the authority of <em>Colder, </em>but not by him, for \u00edfi\u00e9 defendant states that his survey and certificate were made out by a deputy of <em>Colder, </em>who usually ntade the surveys in the reserves of <em>Baltimore. </em>That his object in the purchase and survey was to join his two tracts* and \u00e1 Survey he admits was made called <em>Singery\u2019s Fronting Streams, </em>and returned to the office, on which patent afterwards.issued to the defendant. That he does not know, nor was he ever privy, to any fraud or deception in makiitg the survey or c'ertificate of that land* nor does he know* admit or believe, there was any. He admits the call hi the certificate greatly increases the quan tity of his land, but he states the cal\u00ed was essent\u00eda\u00edly ne= <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>cessary to join his two tracts together, which was the ohject of his purchase, and if the surveyor mistook the length of line, or rpiantity of acres, it was not with the consent, knowledge or privity, of' the defendant. He does not believe the certificate recorded in <em>Colder\u2019s </em>book to be a true copy of his certificate; and that <em>Colder </em>is grossly mistaken in two important tacts, and those facts are misconceived and mistaken in the bill of complaint. That <em>Colder </em>never did make out or sign a certificate of <em>Siagery\u2019s Trouting Streams </em>for the office, but that the same was made out, signed and returned, by the deputy, and is now in the office, and it was usual and customary for <em>Codder\u2019s </em>deputy so to do with his assent, as will appear by a great number of original certificates in tire land office, made out at the very period when the defendant\u2019s was, and some of them on Surveys made in the reserves. That the certificate returned to the office is the true and genuine certificate of <em>Singcry\u2019s Trouting Streams, </em>which was made out' for, and delivered to him as such, by <em>Colder </em>in person, to whom the defendant carried it, and the sam,e fias, a call to the beginning trees of <em>Petticoat\u2019s Loose, </em>which was a well known place, and intended to be run to and called for; and the defendant can prove, that on the original survey made, the beginning trees of <em>Petticoat\u2019s Loose </em>were actually run to, and he offered such evidence on the trial of the ejectment cause referred to by the bill of complaint, which testimony the general court refused to admit. The defendant does not pretend to know what inay have been the rules of the land office at that time as to the calls, but <em>Colder </em>is mistaken iu hi$ deposition filed, fiepguse there are many certificates in tjie office made put and signed by him, of surveys at that time of reserve lands similar to the defendants, in which <em>Colder </em>hath inserted calks. The defendant denies all fraud, combination, \u00abtic. That the call in his certificate and patent were of such notoriety, and his possession of, and the beginning trees of <em>Petticoat\u2019s Loose </em>were so well known to the neighbourhood, and <em>ta </em>the surveyors in the county, that younger surveys Were made, which called for and run with the line apd to the call mentioned in the defendant\u2019s patent, as is demonstrated by the location of the-tract of land called <em>Horatio\u2019s. Lot, </em>on the plot filed. That the defendant, actuated by <em>the </em>most honest principles, made a resurvey on his land <em>m </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>1792, and included the whole of his lands, and returned a certificate to the office, and the excess of the number of acies was ca^ec^ surplus; that he was willing to pay for it, and made his resurvey with that intent, but by reason of the act of 1785, <em>ch. </em>81, the treasurer could not receive such payment, and it was not until after this transaction that the relator, combining and leaguing with <em>Calder, </em>who to cover his own negligence and malconduct in office, combined with the relatar to cheat the defendant out of his land, and recommended the relator to take up the surplus as vacancy, which <em>Calder </em>was to support, by throwing all blame on bis deputy, although the records of the land office falsify the oath of <em>Calder </em>in two essential facts; first, they show that it was customary for his deputies to make out certificates and sign his name; and secondly, that he himself, in certificates made o.ut and signed by him, did give calls. He admits the action of ejectment instituted jn the general court by the less.ee of the relator, for recovery of part of the defendant\u2019s land, included in the relator\u2019s tract called <em>Boreing\u2019s Habitation Rock, </em>but the facts never came to issue; that the case was determined on a point pf law, tp which a bill of exceptions was taken, and the judgment of the court was appealed from, and the appeal will go up to the court pf appeal? in June next. He does not believe the relator is entitled ip any court oflaw or equity to a vacation of the defendant\u2019s original grant, the same can only, originate in a desire to ruin and oppress the defendant; because if the relator ultimately succeeds in the court of appeals, a decree to convey all the defendant\u2019? right and title tp the relator, in fee, of all the land contained in his patent of <em>Boreing\u2019s Habitation Rock, </em>will be sufficient. He further states, that he claims the whole of the land included in his patent called <em>Sing cry\u2019s Trouiing </em>Streams; that the call- was an hqne?t one; that the tracts of land called <em>Merryman\u2019s Mountain </em>and <em>Petticoat\u2019s Loose, </em>never did lay contiguous or close to each other, but always lay, were located and held, as by the table of course? thereof on the plot filed; that the survey was made by a deputy of <em>Calder </em>named <em>Jam.es Hall, </em>who made out the certificate,as was common with <em>Calder\u2019s </em>deputies ip the reserves, and that <em>Calder </em>did not himself make the same out; and the defendant believes the mistake exists on <em>Calder\u2019s </em>books; that the entry was mq.de therein firorp the deputy\u2019s field note^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and the call omitted to be inserted; that the calf did exist.

The chancellor has considered the petition of <em>the </em>defendant.

The authorities on this subject are not very clear. The case nmst ill favour of this position, is <em>Underwood vs. </em>Morduanf, 2 <em>frernon, </em>238, in which the court declared, that the question was,- whether an as-signo.'ent was fraudulent or not; and that having been tried at law there was no room for equity to interfere; that if they should relieve the plaintiff, they must declare <em>that </em>not to be fraudulent in equity which was found to be so at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-8\">.

In the ejectment brought by the lessee of <em>Boreing, </em>for Bore<em>ing\u2019s Habitation Rock, </em>against <em>Sing\u00e9ry, </em>the question in issue between the parlies, on the different locations on the plots, was, who was entitled to that part of <em>Borcing\u2019s </em>Ha<em>bitation Rock </em>which was covered by or included within <em>Singcry\u2019s Trovling Streams? </em>This question might have been decided on the different certificates and grants of the parties, and such evidence as might have ascertained what was the true location of the respective tracts claimed by the litigating parlies. It appears by the record and testimony in this case, that the certificate and grant of Singe\u00ab <em>ry\u2019s Fronting Streams </em>are older than the certificate and grant ot <em>Boreing\u2019s Habitation Rock, </em>and would have a preference, so far as the conflicting grants interfered.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">To repel the defendant\u2019s defence, and to impeach his-title, the plaintiff offered to prove, that the certificate of <em>Singery\u2019s Fronting Streams </em>was forged, and the evidence for that purpose was admitted by the' court; and such evidence could not have been deemed admissible by the court, only on the ground that if it was proved to be forged, the grant obtained on it was fraudulent, and could not have' any operation in law to pass the land to the defendant.That decision must rest on the principle, that what commences in iniquity must transmit its impure or deleterious-quality to the grant which was intended to perfect or complete the title of the party, and will invalidate it, unless the Proprietary was apprised of the nial-practice before the issuing the grant. The evidence in a court of law,- and in a court of equity, to impeach them, is the same* parol evidence being admissible in both \u2014 the effect and final result is the same.

Cause the evidence is better sifted, and ihore critically inquired into, and the credit of the witnesses is better tested. Where frauds \u00e1re clearly established,1 the courts of law arid a court of chancery have concurrent jurisdiction. Ill Some cases it may bd necessary to resort to a court of chancery to compel \u00e1 discovery of facts and circumstances, which are confined to the knowledge of the parties, in order to prove a fraud; which, it is believed, is the only reason why the applications \u00e1re more frequent, in cases of fraud, to the court of chancery* than to a court of law. If the evidence was iriiproperly admitted because the\" Operation of a grant cannot bd questioned in' a court of law for fraud in obtaining it,- then the verdict of the jury, finding for the defendant, cannot conclude the' plaintiff as to the fact whether the certificate w\u00e1s forged or not. But what principle is it which allows a court of law to be competent to inquire into fraud and collusion in obtaining a judgment or decree, and to declare such judgment or decree inoperative to pass any right or interest, which does not extend to a patent? A judgment or decree must stand on as high authority as a patent. In this case the fact of forgery came before the court arid jury collaterally, and was not directly in question, the issue between the parlies being, who liad the right of possession to tlie land in controversy? and therefore the verdict cannot be received as evidence to prove that the certificate was not forged. It may very well be questioned, as the court were not called on, arid did not direct the jury if they found the certificate forged* that nothing passed by the patent; and as the jury might suppose, notwithstanding the certificate was forged, that the prior grant ought to prevail, and could not be' affected by it, Whether the verdict Could conclude the plaintiff if the fact of forgery had been directly in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Although on a bill in chancery charging forgery, the de\u00ab fendatit cannot be compelled to answer any fact which will criminate himself, yet the court of chancery has jurisdiction over the easel and on proof of the forgery, by which a fraud has been committed, will grant lelief by vacating the grant or deed from whence the injury has arisen, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>will make such decree as the circumstance's of the case fendef necessary.</p>\n<author id=\"b508-10\">The coijrt</author>\n<p id=\"Aqt_\">ar\u00e9 of Opinion, that the forgery of the certificate of <em>Singefy's Trending </em>Streams, and the fraud consequent thereon, have been fully established, and affiroi the decree of the court of chancery, with costs to the appellee.</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-11\">Gantt, J. dissented.</judges>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">DECREE affirmed?</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
