By the bill, answer, and testimony taken in the cause, it appears that a certain <em>TVilliam Dail, </em>having a daughter married to <em>Wingate, </em>the complainant, entered into a verbal agreement with him to sell to him two parcels of land, on which <em>Wingate </em>then resided, for \u00a3150, being one half the value of the land; the other half lie intended to give to <em>Wingate\u2019s </em>wife; and that <em>Bail </em>often declared that the land was to be deeded to <em>Wingate\u2019s </em>son. That <em>Wingate </em>paid \u00bf240 in part of the purchase money, and continued in possession, and paid the' taxes on the land, which were charged to him by the direction of <em>Bail, </em>and with the approbation of <em>Wingate. </em>That <em>Bail </em>made an entry in his book of accounts, crediting <em>Wingate </em>on the 25th of August <em>'179S, </em>\u201cBy cash received for a contract for the plantation where he now lives,\u201d &amp;c. <em>\u00a340. </em>That <em>Bail </em>afterwards had a son born, named <em>Joseph, </em>(the appellee,) and in order to make provision for his son, declared his intention of taking the land from <em>Wingate, </em>and giving it to his son, and in lieu thereof to give <em>Wingate </em>personal property; which intention was made known to <em>Wingate, </em>who was not altogether satisfied with the arrangement. That <em>Bail </em>offered to return the \u00bf240 to <em>Wingate, </em>which the latter did not refuse to take, but said he had no occasion for it, and <em>Bail </em>said he would keep it for him until he should call for it. <em>Bail </em>afterwards, by his will, devised the land to his son, (the appellee,) and bequeathed sundry slaves to <em>Win-gate\u2019s </em>wjfe,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">Hanson, Chancellor, (3d July 1804.) It appears, that to prevent the setting up of contracts, like the one stated in the bill, was the object of the statute of frauds and perjuries; and this court never did, and never ought, by its decision, to defeat the salutary intent of the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">It has, indeed, under some circumstances, enforced the performance of parol contracts, but never in a case like the present, where it remains uncertain whether or pot there was any contract, and even if there was a contract, it does not appear clearly what was the engagement on the complainant. <em>Decreed, </em>that the bill be dismissed, but without costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">From iyhich decree the1 complainant appealed to this Qoqrt.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The cause was argued before Chase, Ch.
