The plaintiff then offered evidence to the jury, by the testimony of <em>Benjamin </em>Ogle,esquire, one of the grantors named in the deed, who deposed that in 1774 he became seized and possessed of an estate in <em>Prince-George\u2019s </em>county, called <em>Belle Air,- </em>upon-which, estate there then was, and still is, a large and commodious furnished house; that he considered the city of Annapolis, near to which he had a large landed estate, as the place of his residence from the year 1770 down to- this time; that in the county of <em>Anne-Arundel </em>he toted, was-summoned to serve as a juryman, and was permitted to enjoy the right of passing the various ferries in the said county without paying ferriage, none of which privileges or immunities were ever enjoyed by .him in the county of-<em>Prince- George\u2019s. </em>That from the time he became possessed of the estate called <em>Belle Ah', </em>until the year 1790, it was customary for him occasionally, every year,- to go with his family to that es tate, aild live there for a time, sometimes for a longer and sometime for a shorter period of time. That on the 25th of June 1777* he was with his wife at .his seat _ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Called <em>\u00c9elle-Air, </em>in <em>Prince-George's </em>county, (their children being at <em>West- River,) </em>and there, together with his wife, executed and acknowledged the deed from himself and wife to <em>James Bosley. </em>That lie was himself in the city of <em>Annapolis </em>in August 1777, when the <em>British </em>fleet passed up the <em>Chesapeake </em>bay, but that his family were then at <em>Belle-Air. </em>The plaintiff, with the consent of the defendant, produced and read in evidence the deposition of <em>John Tliornas </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>in the following words: \u201cThat he hath, from an early petiod of his life, been acquainted with <em>Benjamin Ogle, </em>esquire, and with his lady; that Mr. <em>Ogle </em>resided, and still resides, in the city of <em>Annapolis, </em>where he has a large and commodious house and lot, his place of residence, and near to which city he held, and still continues to hold, a large and valuable landed estate; that previous to the year 1777, Mr. <em>Ogle </em>recovered, by a suit in chancery, from his late uncle, Col. <em>Benjamin </em>Tasker, a valuable landed estate in <em>Prince-George's </em>county, and that Mr. <em>Ogle, </em>during the summer season, generally, with his lady, spent a great part of his time at <em>Belle Air, on </em>the land recovered as aforesaid, but that his household furniture and servants still remained at his dwelling-house in <em>Annapolis. </em>He well remembers that Mr. <em>Ogle </em>and family remained at <em>Annapolis </em>the first part of the year 1777, lie thinks until the month of April, or the beginning of May, and that Sir. and Mrs. <em>Ogle </em>were at <em>Belle Air </em>the latter part of the month of that year. In June of the same year, this affirmant was twice at, Mr. <em>Ogle's </em>dwelling-house in <em>Annapolis, </em>where he and his lady then were, with his servants, and that this affirmant, as lie had been accustomed for many years, lodged there. He may have been ofterier with them, but of that he has no distinct recollection. That in August and September Mr. and Mrs. <em>Ogle </em>were at <em>Belle </em>Air; that in the fall of 1777 his kitchen, in <em>Annapolis, </em>was burnt down. However they were in said dwelling-house in the spring of 1778. The winter following they, resided in the now government-house, and remained there until the spring of 1779. That he always did, and doth now, consider <em>Annapolis </em>as the place of residence of Mr. <em>Ogle, </em>and that he never did reside in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Printe-George\u2019s </em>county; his retiring there in the summer season-, he conceived as a visit from home, and not as going to constitute a n\u00e9w residence.\u201d The plaintiff also of,jere(j jri evidence, by the testimony of Mrs. <em>Mary Ridont, </em>sister-to <em>Benjamin Ogle, </em>that her brother, upon his marriage, which took place in September 1770, settled in <em>Annapolis, </em>and has resided there ever since. That when he got possession of his estate called <em>Belle Air, </em>there was upon it a large and commodious furnished dwelling-house; that it was usual for him to go occasionally every year with his family and spend sometime at his sent; that she cannot now recollect when her brother first began to reside occasionally at his said country seat, nor can she recollect - the time or season of the year when he usually went to it, but she remembers that she herself spent the. summer of 1777 at <em>Bath, </em>in <em>Virginia, </em>and upon her return home from. <em>Bath, </em>in the month of September <em>1777, </em>she called at the \" seat of her brother in <em>Prince-George\u2019s </em>county, called <em>Bette Air, </em>and spent some days there; at that time her brother and his family were residing there. Being asked by the counsel for the defendant, whether she considered <em>Bette Air </em>or <em>Annapolis </em>the place of residence of her brother? she answered, both; that in her estimation, when a gentleman had a town house, and country house, and occasionally spent part of his time at each of them, he resided in both . of them. The <em>defendant then </em>produced, and swore <em>to </em>the jury, <em>Henry Margaret Ogle </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>who deposed, that about the middle of <em>May 1777, </em>her grand-mother died; that about this period, or some short time before, she' seiit her children to <em>West River, </em>in <em>Anne-Arundel </em>county, to the house of her uncle Mr. <em>John Thomas, </em>to keep them from taking the small pox, which then prevailed in <em>Annapolis, </em>that the children continued at <em>West River </em>for two or three months; that Mr. <em>Ogle </em>and herself, and at times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>herself only, went to see them at <em>West River, </em>and in going to <em>West River </em>from <em>Annapolis, </em>and from <em>West River </em>to <em>Annapolis, </em>she and Mr. <em>Ogle </em>occasionally called at <em>Belle-Air, </em>their seat in <em>Prince-George\u2019s </em>county, and staid one or two nights; but she does not remember ever to have staid at <em>Belle Air </em>more than two nights, unless her children were with her. That the deed from Mr. <em>Ogle </em>and herself to <em>Bosley, </em>of the ,35 ih of <em>June, 1777, </em>was executed at <em>Be,lie-Air, </em>on one of those occasional visits when she and Mr, <em>Ogle </em>were passing from <em>Annapolis </em>to <em>West River, </em>or from <em>West River </em>to <em>Annapolis. </em>That it was executed just before they left <em>Belle Air, </em>which she well remembers, because, seeing persons coming to the house, she was afraid she should be detained at <em>Belle JMr; </em>that the persons proved to be the party who bought the land, coming to tender continental money in payment of it, aud to have the deed executed. That she and Mr. <em>Ogle </em>had not their children at <em>Belle Air </em>in the year 1777, until after Mr. <em>Ogle\u2019s </em>return from <em>Berkley </em>county. That <em>Annapolis, </em>in <em>Anne-Arundel </em>county, she always considered their place of residence. That different times of the year, and of different years, they occasionally spent part of their time with their family at <em>Belle Air, </em>and in some years they went to <em>Belle Ah' </em>only for a day or two at a time. That Mr. <em>Ogle </em>has a large landed estate in his cultivation nearly adjoining to <em>Annapolis. </em>The defendant also proved by <em>Beniamin Ogle, </em>that he went in the year 1777 to <em>Berkley </em>county, in Virginia; that he went there after the \u00a35th of June 1777, and returned before the 10th of July 1777* and that in 1777 he did not take up his temporary residence at <em>Belle Air, </em>until after his return from <em>Berkley. </em>That he was at <em>Belle Air </em>in 1777, before the execution of the deed, and at its execution, but does not remember the time he went there, nor how long he staid there. That from <em>Annapolis </em>to Mr. <em>John Thomas\u2019s </em>at <em>West River, </em>is 14 miles, to <em>Belle Air </em>is \u00a18 miles, and from <em>Belle Air to West River </em>is <em>14 </em>miles. The plaintiff then prayed the opinion of the court, and their direction to the jury, that if they are satisfied from the evidence that <em>Benjamin Ogle </em>had <em>aud kept </em>two dwelling-houses furnished, to wit, a town house and country bouse, from the year 1774 to the year 1780, the town house situate in <em>Annapolis, </em>in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>county of <em>Anne-Arundel, </em>the country house situate in the, county of <em>Prince-0 forge\u2019s, </em>and that during the time his resilience was principally in Annapolis, tho\u2019in each of the years aforesaid he occasionally went with his family to his country house in <em>Prince-Gear go\u2019s, </em>and resided therefor a time, sometimes for a longer and sometimes for a' shorter period in each of the years aforesaid, and that he with his wife were, on the 25th of June <em>1777, </em>at his country house in <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county, and then and there, with his wife, executed the deed of that date to <em>Bosley, </em>that then the deed, so executed, was and is good and sufficient in law to pass and transfer, from <em>Ogle </em>to <em>Bosley, </em>all the interest which <em>Ogle </em>then liad in and to the lands mentioned in, and intended to be conveyed by, the deed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-9\"><em>Martin, </em>(Attorney General,) and <em>Mason, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQb\">stated, that the question was, whether Mr. <em>Ogle </em>liad, on the testimony in the cause, such a <em>living </em>or <em>residence </em>in <em>Ppince-George\u2019s </em>county as to justify his acknowledging in that county' the deed from him and wife to Bosley? Or whether a deed ackno pledged in <em>Prince- George\u2019s </em>county, before two justices of the peace of that county, for lands lying in <em>.Baltimore </em>county, by persons who are stated in the deed to be of <em>Anne-Arimdel </em>county, was a good and sufficient deed in law to pass and transfer the estate to the grantee? To show that Mr. <em>Ogle </em>had a sufficient residence in <em>Prince-George\u2019s </em>county, to enable him to execute the deed in that county, they referred to the acts of <em>1715, ch </em>47, s. 8, 9, and November 1766, <em>ch. </em>14, <em>s. </em>.2, 3. <em>Sim </em>&amp; <em>Lee\u2019s Lessee vs Deakins, </em>2 <em>Harr, &amp; M'Hen </em>46.

They contended, 1. That at the time the deed from <em>Ogle </em>and wife to <em>Bosley </em>was executed, the grantors did not reside in the county of <em>Prince-Qeorge\u2019s, </em>and, therefore, that deed did not transfer the estate thereby intended to be conveyed, to the grantee. They referred to the acts of 1715, <em>ch. 47, s. </em>8, 9; November 1766, <em>ch. </em>14, <em>s. </em>2, 3, July 1729, <em>ch. 8 s. </em>5; J793, <em>ch. </em>53, <em>s. </em>7,'22; and 1796, <em>ch 43, s. </em>14. <em>Const.

They also contended, that the certificate made on the deed by the clerk of <em>Prince-George\u2019s </em>county court does not pursue the words of the act of assembly of November <em>1766, ch. </em>14, <em>s. </em>3, he having used the words <em>\u201clegally authorised and assigned,\u201d </em>instead of the words of the act, <em>\u201cduly commissioned and sworn.\u201d </em>That intendment could not be admitted to supply the omission of the words u'sed in the law; and that if intendment could be admitted, there was not sufficient matter stated in the certificate to show that the justices had been sworn. They referred to the several decisions made by this court as to the acknowledgments of deeds <em>by femes covert </em>grantors, also the acts of February <em>1777, ck. </em>5, <em>if 1796, ch. </em>43, <em>s. 17; </em>and <em>Dyson vs. West, </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp;; Johns. 567,</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-4\">Martin, ('Attorney General,) and <em>Mason,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIc\">in reply to the <em>second point, </em>referred to the acts of 1785, <em>ch. 9, s. </em>8, 9, and 1797, <em>ch. </em>103. <em>Griffith\u2019s Lessee v Ridgely, </em>2 <em>Harr, &amp; M'Hen. </em>418; and <em>Sim, &amp; Lee\u2019s Lessee vs. Deakins, Ibid </em>46.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\">Chase. Ch. J. The court are of opinion, that this case is not distinguishable from the case of <em>Sim \u00bff Lee\u2019s Lessee vs Deakins, </em>and that the principles of that case must govern. In tiiat case <em>Warder, </em>by coming into <em>Maryland, </em>acquired a temporary residence sufficient, under the act of assembly, for the purpose of executing and acknowledging the deed.

He had a knowledge of the facts whereupon to ground his certificate, which is to authorise the recording the deed. The court think a substantial compliance with the directions of the act is all that is requisite; and the <em>court consider </em>the words used in the certificate are words of that import. ' The words <em>legally </em>authorised, are of the same import as <em>\u201cduly commissioned and sworn.\u201d </em>The court consider that the justices could not be legally <em>authorised </em>unless they had been <em>commissioned and sworn.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-9\">The court are of opinion, that the certificate of the clerk of <em>Prince-George's </em>county court, endorsed on the deed from <em>Benjamin Ogle </em>and wife to <em>James Bosley, </em>is good and sufficient in law to warrant the enrolling the deed by the clerk of <em>Baltimore </em>county court among the land rev cords of that county.

In this case the testimony was, that the fence from 60 to 52, to 53, and so on to 60, was made by the defendant, and those under whom he claims, before the year 1774, and continued to run thus until the year 1783, when the fence was altered, and run from 60 to red 7, 8, 9, black 61 to 60; that this last fence from ml 7, 8, 9 to 61, was in the year 1782 put up by those under whom the plaintiff claims, and those under whom the defendant claims, jointly; that in the latter part of the year 1782, or beginning of the year 1783, the plaintiff, and those under whom he claims, put up the fence running from red 7 to X, as a fence belonging to <em>Hill's Forest, </em>and the owners thereof; that immediately after, in the, year 1783, the defendant removed the fence from 60 to red 7, and run the same from GO across to X, and joined the same to the fence so made by the plaintiff from red 7 to X. The defendant thereupon prayed the opin'nn of the court, and their directions to the jury, that if they were of opinion from the evidence, that the defendant, and those under whom he claims, have held by enclosure and cultivation for more than <em>twenty years, </em>the land included within the lines from 60 to red 7, and red 8, red 9, to 61 to 6o, claiming the same as his own, that then he has title to ihe same by adversary possession, although before the expiration of the twenty years the fence and enclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>was removed from red <em>7 </em>to X, to 60,- and thereby enlarged the enclosure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-7\">Chase, <em>Ch. </em>J.
