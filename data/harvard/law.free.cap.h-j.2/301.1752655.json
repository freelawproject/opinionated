The bill filed in <em>1790' </em>charges, among other tilings, that the defendants, <em>Stump </em>\u2018 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>and <em>Dallam, </em>being seized in fee of a tract of land situate in <em>Harford </em>county, sold a part thereof, (describing it,) to the other defendant, <em>Patrick, </em>and gave him a bond for a conveyance thereof to him in fee. That <em>Patrick, </em>at the time of purchase, paid a considerable part of the purchase money, and gave his bond for payment of the residue. That when the bond became due, <em>Patrick </em>tendered thu sum of money therein mentioned to <em>Dallam, </em>agreeably to the acts of assembly in such-case made, but <em>Dallam </em>refused to receive the same. The bill next states, that a judgment was obtained in <em>Harford </em>county court against <em>Pa - trick, </em>a <em>fieri facias </em>issued thereon, which was laid on part of the land purchased as aforesaid by him; afterwards a <em>venditioni eorponas </em>issued, and under it the land was sold, and was purchased by one <em>Pattison </em>for the complainant, as appeared by the deed of the sheriff executed to the complainant, and accompanying the bill. That under executions, on other judgments against <em>Patrick, </em>the residue of the land was sold to the complainant, who received the sheriff\u2019s deed. That <em>Slump </em>had afterwards received the rents of the land, and after the sales made to the complainant, <em>Patrick, </em>with a view of defrauding the complainant, gave up the bond of conveyance to <em>Slump. </em>That the complainant had made application to <em>Stump </em>for a conveyance of the lands. The bill prays that <em>Slump </em>may be compelled to execute to the \u2022 complainant a deed for the lands.

Hanson, Chancellor,</author>\n<p id=\"Ajf\">(October term 1804.,) On considering the bill, answers, depositions and exhibits, &amp;c. it \u00a1appears to the chancellor, that he cannot grant .the prayer of the bill without a,violation of several principles in this court established. In the first place,, the contract, of which .the complainant claims the benefit, is such aeon-1 tract as this court has again and again said it will not enforce, It was a speculating contract for continental money, which, if <em>Patrick </em>the party, instead of <em>Hopkins, </em>were; Complainant, this court would not enforce; and it is impossible for any rational man to coiiceive. that an assignee,? or any person <em>claiming in the place of the </em>party, shall be in a better situation than the party him\u00e1elf. But it appears, the idea of the bompLiriant that <em>Stump, </em>in whom alone the legal title how is, was willing- to perform the contract, and so stipulated; bht that arrangements were made to defeat or defraud flie complainant. On this subject the complainant called on the defendants for full explicit answers; but the defendants have, by their answers, explicitly denied the chief important matters charged in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">There is no' principle better established than this, that if d defendant be compelled to answer, whatever he says on oath shall prevail, unless refuted by the testimony of two' witnesses, or of one witness with equitable circumstances^. But the testimony in this case is nothing like such a refutation of the answers of the several defendants; notwithstanding the strong pointed charges made by the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">On the demurrer, the chancellor long since decided ire the complainant\u2019s favour so far as this \u2014 the court of appeals having, as he was informed, decided an equitable interest to be liable to a <em>fieri facias, </em>the party wlm has at a sale on a <em>fieri facias </em>purchased fairly an equitable ihtej-est, is entitled to the aid of this court to give hint the legal title. This is the plain meaning of the chancellor\u2019s declaration, which however appears to have been misunderstood.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">It would seem likewise that the complainant misunderstood the chancellor in another particular. But no person, acquainted with the <em>laws, </em>or <em>rules </em>or <em>practice </em>of this court, would conceive it the meaning of the chancellor, that, whatever matter stated in a bill is not denied, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>be Considered as admitted. No! If interrogatories stated in a bil\u00ed are not answered, the complainant lias a right to except to the answer, and if the interrogatories are proper, the defendant will be compelled to answer <em>plainly, fully </em>'and <em>explicitly. </em>If then any material matter, charged in the complainant\u2019s Rill, has been neither denied nor admitted by the answers, it stands on hearing of the caus\u00e9 for <em>nought. </em>This assuredly every lawyer will admit.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\">And now let it be inquired, what is that equitable in! terest which the court of appeals has said is liable to be sold on a <em>fieri facias? </em>The chancellor does not fully understand it. But he readily conceives, that if A has purchased land from B, and paid for it, without (receiving a conveyance, or if B holds in trust for A, in either case A lias an interest liable to be taken and sold on a <em>fieri </em>facias, and the purchaser is entitled to the aid of this court to obtain the legal title. But if A has only contracted and given his bond for the purchase money, and received, ill return, a bond of conveyance, the chancellor questions, whether A has such an equitable interest, as is liable to be sold on a <em>fieri facias, </em>so as to place the purchaser in the room of A. If such be the meaning of the court of appeals, they* in effect, say, that a caus\u00e9 of action or laW suit is liable to a <em>fieri </em>facias. In short, the chancellor is Inclined to think, that the meaning of the court of appeals was, that if A has a <em>complete </em>equitable title to land, of which the naked legal title is in B, the land is liable to a <em>fieri facias </em>on a judgment against A-.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The chancellor cannot conceive, that contracts for land, which ritay be deemed to confer an equitable interest, are so far bound by a judgment, as that, after the judgment, and before a <em>fieri fades, </em>the parlies cannot come to a settlement \u2014 For instance, A gives his bond to B for \u00a710,000j the price of <em>Black Jlcre, </em>containing <em>500 </em>acres. B gives in return, his bond to A, in the penalty of \u00a720,000, conditioned for conveying the said land. These bonds ar\u00e9 both dated the 1st of January 1800. At May term 18025 C obtains a judgment against A, for \u00a710,000. In No* \u25a0vernber of the same year, A and B agree to vacate the contract, and <em>afterwards </em>C takes out a <em>fieri </em>facias, is it reasonable to suppose the law to be, that A liad an equitable interest, which being bound by the judgment of C, could not be given upj and that although A may have per\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>.sonal property, or land, sufficient to satisfy the judgment,' C may insist on laying the execution on the <em>contract? </em>fot laying it on the land is laying it on the contract. Nob The impropriety of th.e idea is glaring. Another doubt-L Supposing equitable interests <em>in, </em>or mere contracts <em>for\\ </em>land liable to a <em>fieri facias, </em>at what <em>time </em>are these interests or contracts bound? Ar.e they absolutely bound by the <em>date </em>of the judgments? Orare they <em>tobe </em>bound in the same manner as personal property is bound, viz. from. the time only of delivering the writ to the sheriff? The chancellor has always considered, it \u00e1 most important question, <em>never decided, </em>(that he kiiqws of,) whether or hot land is bound by .a judgment, yo far, as that if A lu\u00eds a judgment against him, and before execution A <em>bona \u2022fide </em>sells his right to B, C the plaintiff may, on <em>fieri facias, </em>take and sell it, without inquiring or seeking for other property. The chancellor is not apprized of any decision to this effect, if any such has been. But if such decision has taken place, although he certainly would govern himself accordingly, he could not do otherwise thaa (question its propriety;</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">, In <em>England, </em>whose laws we follow; lands were,-long since, bound by judgment; that is to say, if A, against whom a judgment is obtained, has land, and; after the judgment, conveys it, the plaintiff may, notwithstanding, affect it by the writ of <em>Elegit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">During our connexion with <em>England, </em>its parliament passed an act, subjecting lands in <em>America </em>to be sold under a <em>fieri facias, </em>in the same manner as personal property, to satisfy judgments, obtained by subjects of <em>Great Britain. </em>The act did not say a word respecting lands <em>to be </em>bound from the time of the judgment; but it seems; that <em>most </em>or many gentlemen of the bar entertain an idea; that although <em>personal properly </em>is only bound <em>by the delivery </em>of the writ, and <em>lands </em>are liable as personal property, the lands are bound from the tim\u00e9 of the judgment, to be taken by <em>fieri facias </em>at any time afterwards; Supposing the law to be so, and supposing contracts, as aforesaid, liable <em>to fieri facias; </em>that is to say, that the purchaser under a <em>fieri facias </em>is to be placed in the situation of the defendant at law, the nature of <em>Patrick's </em>contract is such, that, as the chancellor has already intimated, ought not to be enforced, even if <em>Patrick </em>were the com'plainant, instead of <em>Hopkins*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The counsel for the defendants has1 indeed alleged, that the chancellor\u2019s decision on the demurrer is grounded on a mistake, and that the court of appeals never has decided. an equitable interest to be liable to a <em>fieri facias. </em>If the counsel be right, there is an end of-the case at once. But the chancellor cannot think that the counsel is right, but laments <em>that </em>tribunals, <em>whose decisions are to govern other </em>tribunals, <em>do not give their, options at large on every </em>m<em>partantpoint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The chancellor, as is his uniform practice, on every important point, has given his opinion pretty much at larger He might still perhaps be more explicit as well as full, but he conceives that he hao said enough. Decreed, that the bill be dismissed. From this decree the complainant appealed to tills court; and on the cause coming on.to be argued, and the counsel for the parties declining to argu(\\ die case,</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u2022DSOlySE AFFIRMED, NISI\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
