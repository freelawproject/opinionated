It was an action \u00a9f <em>Slundcr, </em>and the declaration stated, that the plaintiff, (now the appellee,) was a good, true, honest, and faithful citizen, and had always lived free and wholly unsuspected of and from all manner of peijury, &amp;c. yet the defendant, \u2022 (the appellant,) maliciously intending to injure the plaintiff\" in his good name, and to bring him into public scandal, ignominy and disgrace, and to subject him to the pains and penalties, by the laws amt statutes of this state, made and provided against those who are guilty of false sweating, on, &amp;c. spoke and published of and concerning the plaintiff these false, scandalous, and malicious woids, viz. \u2018Tie (meaning the plaintiff',) swore false, and swore to a lie,\u201d (meaning that the plaintiff' had committed peijury, that he had taken a false oath before a magistrate.) The <em>second\\ count </em>charged the defendant with uttering these words, to other citizens, of the plaintiff: \u201cLe (meaning the plaintiff',) had swore false, and would, if he did not take care, lose his ears for it,\u201d (meaning that the plaintiff' committed per-1 jury before a magistrate.) The general issue was pleaded, and the plaintiff obtained a general verdict for <em>\u00a322 17 </em>6 curreni money. The defendant moved in arrest ot judgment, and assigned the following reasons; 1. Because the\u00bb words charged in the first count of the declaration arc not actionable. 2. Because the words charged in the\u00bb second count are not actionable. 3. Because the words\u201d charged in the different counts of the declaration, and al -111 Jegod to have been spoken by the defendant, are not so laid* and set forth in the said counts, as to entitle the plaintiff to maintain his action. 4. Because there is no <em>colloquium^ </em>set forth in the declaration, showing the words were spoken in reference to a judicial proceeding, or to what the words spoken referred. The county court overruled the motion, and rendered judgment on the verdict for the plaiiitiuj From that judgment this appeal was brought. on ff, l-1 pij ru II\" * , HI )U o, [a <em>99 </em>kii <em>ff u </em>. \u2022\u201c \\ &gt;/ 6 . ~ \u00dc - 2 <em>2 </em>\u00bb $ . 1 1 .</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b373-5\">The cause was argued before Chase, Ch.

There are some principles well established in actions of slander,, which govern the court In determining this pase.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\"><em>First. </em>No words are actionable unless they impute a crime to the plaintiff, which subjects liim to punishment, 5 <em>Bill. Com. </em>123. <em>Holt vs. Scholefield, </em>6 <em>T. R. </em>691, 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\"><em>Secondly. </em>The office of the <em>innuendo </em>is to explain doubtful words, where there is matter sufficient ip the declaration to. maintain the action; and if the words in them\u00bb s\u00e9lves are not actionable, their meaning cannot be extended by it to make them actipnqble, <em>Holt vs. Scholefidd, </em>6 <em>T. R. </em>694.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\"><em>Thirdly, </em>tf the words may be understood ip a sense not criminal, there must be a <em>colloquium </em>ip the introductory part, to show they were spoken in a criminal sense, or they \u00e1re nbt actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The word foyswom, although in one sepse it may import perjury, yet it does not <em>necessarily imply it; </em>fora person may be forsworn without committing perjury; apd no cxtrinsip aid can b,e derived from the <em>innuendo </em>to give the words a criminal meapipg.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">If the words'before the <em>innuendo </em>do not import slander, po Words produced by the <em>innuendo </em>will piake the action maintainable. It is not the nature of an <em>innuendo </em>to beget an action. Forsworn, by itself, does not import slander; otherwise \u00f3f the word <em>perjured. Core vs. Morton, Yelv. 27. Holt vs. Scholefield, </em>6 <em>T. R. </em>694.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">. To make the word <em>forsworn </em>slander, it must be intro-cl need by a <em>colloquium, </em>setting forth some judicial proceeding in which lie was sworn. <em>Core vs. Morton, Yelv. 27.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">The words in the declaration charged to have been spoken are, that \u201che, the said <em>Jacob, swore false, </em>and <em>swore to a </em>lieThe subsequent words, \u201cmeaning that the said <em>facob </em>had committed perjury, that the said <em>Jacob </em>had taken <em>f </em>false oath before a ipagistrate, \u201d are part of, and come under the <em>innuendo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">The question is, whether these words are actionable? and it is admitted, if they are not, the judgment must be arrpsted, there beipg one defective count in the declaration * \u2014 a general verdict and entire damages having been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">The court are pf opinion they are not; and that the judgment of the county court lie reversed, and judgment on y\u00e9petiot tip \u00e1rfest\u00e9do</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">^Uqf\u00edJJENT REVERS\u00c9X),</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
