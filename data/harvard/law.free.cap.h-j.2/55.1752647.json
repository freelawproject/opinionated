The bill states, that <em>William </em>Smith, one of the defendants, feeing seized in fee of a tract of land called <em>Sugar Tree Vamp, </em>lying in <em>Washington </em>county, containing 100 acres, mortgaged the same to <em>James Bryant </em>in 1788, in consideration of his having paid debts for him to the amount of \u00a359. That <em>Smith </em>had three sons, named <em>Christian, Philip </em>and <em>Peter, </em>(also defendants,) and he was indebted to <em>Christian </em>in the sum of \u00a3109 IS 10, as ascertained by a settlement made between them on the 22d of May 1789. That he had no means to discharge the debt, except by a sale of his equity of redemption in the land. That it was agreed between the father and his sons that the former should sell to them the land, and a bond of conveyance was executed \u25a0for the purpose dated the 22d of May 1789. And it was ?lso agreed, that on the sons <em>Philip </em>and <em>Peter, </em>paying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Christian </em>two thirds of the debt due to him, they were equally to have the land. From the time of the contract, <em>1 </em>p *\u00b0 7ear ^^3, the three sons possessed the laude While they were in possession, <em>Moses Rohinett, </em>(another defendant,) who had a knowledge of their equitable right, purchased the same land from <em>William Smith, </em>and obtained a deed, dated the 8th of October 1793. That <em>Peter, </em>one of the sons, was induced by <em>Rohinett </em>to believe his title was invalid, and he contracted with him for the same for the sum of 1215, for which a note was given, but the money has never been paid. That <em>Joshua Wilson </em>(another .defendant,) paid to <em>James Bryant </em>the money due on the mortgage, and obtained an assignment of the same. That <em>Rohinett, </em>having obtained the deed, applied to two magistrates for a writ of <em>forcible entry and detainer, </em>availing himself of a period when the sons could obtain no counsel, and they were induced to believe they would be turned out of possession, and therefore gave up the possession. That the magistrates who attended were those before whom the deed was executed, and one of them the agent of <em>Rohinett. </em>That on the 29th of November 1793, <em>Joshua </em>and <em>Isaac Wilson, </em>(also defendants,) in consideration of 820 paid to <em>Christian Smith, </em>obtained an assignment of his interest in the bond of conveyance, and on the 19th of June 1794, for the like sum paid by <em>Bannison, </em>(the complainant,) reassigned the bond to him. That <em>Peter Smith, </em>on the 1st of March 1794, and <em>Philip Smith, </em>on the 18th of April 1794, assigned their interests in the bond to the complainant for the like consideration. That Rohinett, after ho obtained the deed, paid to <em>Joshua Wilson </em>the money he had paid on the mortgage, and received an assignment. That the complainant tendered to <em>Rohinett </em>the principal and interest due on the mortgage, and tendered and Claimed a conveyance, but that <em>Rohinett </em>refused to receive the money, or execute the deed. The object of the bill was to obtain that conveyance, and for <em>Rohinett </em>to account for the profits of the land from the time he took possession of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"As\">The <em>answers </em>of all the defendants, except <em>Rohinett, </em>admit the facts stated in the bill. He <em>does not </em>admit tire <em>debt </em>to the sons, nor the <em>bond of conveyance, </em>or <em>his </em>know<em>ledge of the same, </em>if it did exist, before the deed <em>to </em>him- ' self.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b67-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The complainant offered in evidence sundry depositions \u25a0of witnesses, taken under a commission issued from the Court of Chancery, to prove \u2014 1.

The assignments executed by the three sons of <em>William Smith </em>to the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-3\">Hasson, Chancellor, (October term, 1803.) The answer of the principal defendant, who is called on to convey, &amp;c. expressly denies knowledge of an equitable title in the persons under whom the complainant claims, and there is not testimony, winch, according to the principios of this court, is sufficient to refute the answer, taking the whole of the testimony into consideration.

In other words, the possession alone will exclude the legal right from being protected, on the ground of being ignorant of the equitable right.

An agreement, to merit the interposition of a court of equity in its favour, must be fair, reasonable, <em>bona fide, </em>certain in all its parts, mutual, useful, made upon a good or valuable consideration, not merely voluntary, free from fraud, &amp;c. 2 <em>Pow. on Cont. </em>221. Unless a contract has all these ingredients, a court of equity will not decree a specific performance. The Chancellor decreed in this case, upon the ground that notice was not sufficiently proved. And in support of the decree dismissing the bill, it is contended \u2014 1. That there was no contract proved. 2. If there was a contract, it was a voluntary and fraudulent one. 3. The bill has not charged any thing like notice to <em>Robinett. </em>He referred to 1 <em>Pow. on Cont. </em>302. <em>Butcher vs. Stapely, </em>1 <em>Vern. </em>365. <em>Borret vs. Gomeserra, Bunb.
