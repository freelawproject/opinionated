A judgment was rendered in the late general court at May term 1791, in favour of <em>Z. Berry </em>against <em>E, Nicholls </em>and <em>C. </em>Burgess, on which writs of execution regularly issued, Iput were not executed, until the 14th of July 1806, when a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>was issued, returnable to this court, against <em>Nicholls </em>as survivor of Burgess, whose death was suggested, and was retqrned by the sheriff, \u201claid as pr. schedule, not sold, &amp;c.\u201d The schedule described the property as follow\u2019: viz., \u201cone house and lot in the town of <em>Upper Marlborough, </em>in the possession of <em>John Hodges </em>of <em>Thomas', </em>and one house and -lot in the town of <em>Upper </em>Marlborough, occupied by <em>Philip T. </em>Baker, Esquire,\u201d The plaintiff gave directions in writing to the clerk of this court, dated the 19th of August 18Q9, to have the judgment he had obtained against <em>E.

Be. pausg, in the description of the property taken under the <em>fieri facias, </em>there was not such certainty as the law requires. 2. Because the judgment, whereon the execution issued, was obtained against the defendant and <em>CL Burgess, </em>and by the endorsement on the execution, and the note of the plaintiff to th.e clerk, filed in court, it appeared, that before issuing the <em>fieri facias </em>the judgment' jvas <em>salisfedf </em>and. the execution\" was issued <em>for the use </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>fne administrator of one of the original defendants against the other.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-4\">The motion was argued before Chase, Ch.
