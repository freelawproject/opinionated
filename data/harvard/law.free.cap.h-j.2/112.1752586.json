The 'court are of opinion, that there is no adversary possession on the part of the defendant which can defeat the right derived from the state. Under the act of October 1780, <em>ch. </em>49, the state became actually possessed of the land; and that act dispenses with the requisites necessary in the case of the crown to avoid a possession adversary to the right of the crown, to wit, an office (found, or an actual entry. By an office found in <em>England, \u2019 </em>the crown becomes actually -seised and possessed of any es-cheat land in question. The state then had the right to \u00a1pass the act of assembly; and by that act, the state by its commissioners, was in as fell possession of the land as if tlier\u00ae had been, an office found, or actual entry by the cowscaissioners, and ouster of the defendant, or those nnde'\u00a3 whom he claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-8\">This case 1ms been argued upon the principle of the land*\u00ae being held, under the idea of its being part of <em>Tolly's Purchase. </em>The -court consider it as distinct from <em>Tolly's Purchase, </em>and as having no connexion with the question. It has also b&lt;jen contended by the defendant\u2019s counsel on the principles decided in former cases. The court do notcontdder this case as affected by former decisions. In <em>Kelly's Lessee vs. Greenfield fy </em>Sothoron, and <em>Russell's Lessee </em>\u00ae.s\u201e <em>Baker, </em>the lands had been granted by common warrant\u00ae, and afterwards taken by escheat warrants, and there tbs grantees under the common warrants, had had the adversary possession for the full length of time, to wit, 20 years. Eat in this case the state, by the act of 1780, having vest- \u2018 \u00ab1 -complete possession in its commissioners, the adversary possession, (as stated in the case, commencing at far\u00e1host in. 1774,) could only have continued till the passing \u2022tf that act If there had, been a subsequent entry and possession of the land by the defendant, or those under whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u00bfte claims, then; if/ik\u00ed then have been a cantisunnci?

Thatthe commissioners were in possession of the said land in virtue and by operation of that act, from the time of passing the same; and although the defendant, or those under whom Isa claims, continued hi the actual possession of the said land, it was the possession of the commissioners on behalf of the state; for where two persons are in possession, the one by right, and she other by wrong, it ia the possession of him who is in by right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-7\">\u201cThe court are also of opinion, that the possession of ihe defendant, or those under whom he claims, was divest\" \u25a0ed by the said act of assembly, and that the act of limitations ceased to have operation, or to run from that time, and that he has no right to the said land in virtue of the said possession. That the said possession not being derived from the Proprietary, but taken and held in opposition to his title, the defendant cannot have any equitable: interest in the lend, or claim to the same upon the o\u00edate, as standing in the place of the Proprietary.\u201d The defendant excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-8\">2.

He then read in evidence the will of <em>Tolly, </em>the patentee, dated the 26th of July 1781, by which he devised <em>Tolly's Purchase </em>to the wife of the defendant, who is still living; and he proved that <em>Tolly </em>died, possessed thereof, in the year 1783. He then offered evidence to prove, that from the time of the grant for <em>Tolly's Purchase, </em>the quit rents on that tract had been paid by <em>Tolly, </em>to the agents of the Lord Proprietary, until the year 1776, and that the other-taxes and county assessments imposed on lands had alsc\u00a1 been paid by <em>Tolly, </em>and those claiming under him, for <em>Tolly's Purchas'e. </em>He then offered evidence to prove, that from the time of obtaining the grant for <em>Tolly's Purchase </em>to the present time, <em>Tolly, </em>and those claiming under him, have been in the possession and occupation of that land, claiming title to the same. He then offered evidence to, prove, that his location of <em>Tolly's </em>Purchase, and for which he has taken defence, and which is described by the plot: and the fable of courses No. 15, is the true original location of that,land, and that part of the plaintiff\u2019s pretensions for <em>Friendship Compleatyd, </em>interferes w'ith, and ruins foul of <em>Tolly's Purchase. </em>He then prayed the opinion of the court, and their direction to the jury, that admitting; <em>Holland's Park, </em>mentioned in the grant of <em>Friendship Corn-pleated, </em>was liable to escheat at the time of the survey and grant to <em>Tolly's Purchase, </em>and part thereof wras included in the grant of <em>Tolly's Purchase, </em>then the subsequent grant of the escheat on <em>Holland's Park, </em>called <em>Friendship Compleated, </em>to the lessor of the plaintiff, could not operate to give him title for any part of the land which was included in the escheat grant to. <em>Tolly.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>i Where <em>hvA </em>,'5a\u00ab Mc\u00ed\u00bb &lt; ?ehe\u00a1H\u00ab wut h\u2019dutk-il ait a. \u00a1,uvv*s olid grs^fi\u00ed, \u00edi'iis\u2019ji fcte.Jicnt v/nrraist on tveyI\u00cdUT t'Tfk,, vvh gTcrtit ojxraad lo p-tss a gtecd teiN \u00a1o the iaj&gt;d.so:33t*jt\u00a3/flct?, ilT t'-eve had been possession a-nd of quit rent-: Soy move than 20 5oars he\u00bb ioi-p the act os'eosi-\u00bb iiscsUion.

Both parties appealed to the late court of appeals, and at <em>November </em>term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>1805, the points arising on the <em>bills of exceptions, </em>(th <em>a four </em>first taken on the part of the defendant, and the other <em>four </em>on the part of the plaintiff',) were argued in that court, on the cross appeals, by</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-3\"><em>Pinkney, Key, Shaaffi </em>and <em>Harper, </em>for <em>Hall,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATq\">and by</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-4\"><em>Martin, </em>(Attorney-General,) for <em>Gittings\u2019s Lessee.</em></attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\">The then Court of Appeals not having given judgment when the legislature passed the act of 1805, <em>eh. </em>16, abolishing that court, these, appeals were, by the act of the same session, <em>ch. </em>05, transferred to the present Court of Appeals, and were argued at June term 1806, before Tilghman, Buchanan, Nicholson and Gantt, J. by</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-6\"><em>Harper </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>for <em>Hall,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A98\">and by</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-7\"><em>Martin, </em>for <em>Gittings\u2019s lessee.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-8\">On the part of <em>Hall, </em>it was contended by his counsel in the former and present arguments on <em>OnR first </em>bill ofexcepfions, 1. That the Lord .Proprietary was entitled to the whole of the land in controversy, either by escheat or as vacant land, in case it was not included in <em>Tolly\u2019s Purchase. </em>2. That the Proprietary was liable to the operation of the act of limitations, and of adversary possession. 3. That he was therefore out of possession, and had merely a right of entry when the act of confiscation divested him of his rights, and transferred them to the state. 4. That the state acquired merely a right of entry, and had not a complete title or right of possession without office found or actual entry. 5. That the want of office found, or actual entry, was not supplied by the act of confiscation, and consequently that the state\u2019s patentee had no right of entry, and could not maintain the possessory action of ejectment. 6. Thai as far as the Proprietary\u2019s right depended on the escheat, it was a right <em>in pais, </em>liable in its own nature to be defeated by adversary possession, or other matter in pais, and requiring an office found, or actual entry, to perfect it; that it was transferred to the o\u00ed <em>\u00a1\u2019in </em>with all its original and inherent properties; and conscq.NL!. , was liable, even in the hands of the state, to be defeated by the adversary possession of <em>Tolly, </em>and those claiming cider him.

That if the escheat of. <em>Holland's Park </em>had fallen at the time when <em>Tolly's Purchase </em>was granted, so much of the first tract as was included within the true location of the latter would pass by the grant of the latter. 2. And that if the escheat had not fallen, but fell afterwards, still the latter grant would operate as an <em>estoppel </em>on the Lord Proprietary, (who it was contended was bound by estoppels like other persons,) and would pass the land to the grantee of the latter tract by way of estoppel, and would defeat the title of the lessor of the plaintiff under his grant of <em>Friendship Compleated. </em>They cited <em>Kelly's Lessee vs. Greenfield, </em>2 <em>Harr, &amp; M'Hen, </em>121. <em>Russell's Lessee vs. Baker, </em>1 <em>Harr, Johns. </em>71. 3 <em>Blk.
