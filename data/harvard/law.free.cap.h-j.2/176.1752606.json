The case was this \u2014 A deed of manumission, dated the 13th of September 1784, was executed by <em>B. Gaither, </em>deceased-, then of <em>Prince-George's </em>county, [giving freedom, after his death, to sundry of his negro [slaves, among whom was the petitioner, <em>N\u00e9gro James. </em>; The deed was signed and sealed by him in the presence of; find acknowledged before <em>T. Boyd\u2018, </em>one of the justices of the peace for <em>Prince-George's </em>county, on the 13th of September 1784, and recorded in the records of that comity on the 27th of November 1784. <em>Gaither </em>by his ivill, dated the 20th of June 1791, devised and bequeathed as follow: \u201cItem. I give arid devise to <em>B. /jams </em>all my land whereon T bow dwell, and my several tracts or parcels of land adjoining thereto? also all my personal estate, except mynegroes, and to his heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d \u201cItem. My will and desire is, that all my young negroes, bora since my negroes were recorded, shall b\u00e9 absolutely free at my death.\u201d The inventory, returned on <em>Gaither's </em>est\u00e1te, does not include any of his slaves. <em>Ignatius A lien._ </em>a witness sworn in the cause, deposed that he lived with. <em>Gaither </em>at the tim\u00e9 he sent for 7t <em>Boyd </em>to take the acknowledgment o\u00ed a deed to set his negroes free; that <em>Boyd </em>came and drew the deed; that after it was drawn, <em>Gaither </em>did sign, seal, and acknowledge the same as his act and deed, and did deliver the same to Boyd, requesting him to have it recorded. That when <em>Gaither </em>executed and signed the deed he was confined to his bed; that he called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u00abpon the witness to assist him. in getting up in his bed to sign tiie deed; that the witness accordingly did assist to raise <em>Gaither </em>in his bed, and that he stood by and was present, and did see <em>Gaither </em>sign the deed, and acknowledge it as his act and dead,* and also saw <em>Boyd </em>sign the same as a witness thereto. That <em>Gaither </em>asked <em>Boyd </em>if it was necessary that any one eke should sign it, and <em>Boyd </em>replied it was not. That <em>Gaither </em>and <em>Boyd </em>both observed then, that there were several who also saw him. sign; that <em>Gaither </em>requested the persons who were present, to wit, <em>Benjamin Jjams, </em>(who has left the state,) and <em>Sarah Jjams, </em>(who is since dead,) and also the witness in particular, all to take notice that he had signed an instrument of writing to set all his negroes free. The witness lived with <em>Gaither </em>eight or nine years after the <em>deed </em>was executed, and frequently heard him declare that all his negroes would be free at his <em>death, </em>as he had <em>them </em>recorded in court. That the witness cannot write his name, and did not sign Hie deed as a witness. That <em>Robert If a - ters, </em>another witness also sworn in the cause, deposed, that at the request of <em>Gaither </em>he went to draw his will, it was late in the evening, and the witness objected doing it that evening, because he alleged it was too late; but on <em>Gaithers </em>saying it would be short, he agreed to draw it. That <em>Gaither </em>told him he had deeded his negroes to be free at his death, and that the deed had been recorded several years. That after the witness had drawn the clause in the will in favour of <em>B. Jjams, </em>he told the witness to draw a clause in favour of some young negroes, and when the witness began, lie told him to stop, and said it was hardly worth while, the old ones he had deeded free at his death, and the deed had been recorded for several years, and the young ones will be free, if not named iu the will. But after some pause he said, however, you may do it, and do it in this way, all my young negroes, born since my negroes were recorded, to be free at my death. The clause was then wrote as stated in the will, dated the 20th of June 1791. That <em>Gaither </em>died about the year 1793, and the negroes mentioned in the deed have been at large ever since. That he never heard that any one entitled to <em>Gaither's </em>estate ever set up any claim to the negroes, until about two years ago.
