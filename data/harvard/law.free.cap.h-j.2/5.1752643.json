The indictment .stated, that <em>Baker, </em>(the plaintiff in error,) on the 21st of March 1803, \u201cunlawfully did setup a <em>Faro Table, </em>for the purpose of gaming, in a house in <em>Charles </em>Town, in the county aforesaid, by the said <em>John Baker </em>for that purpose rented, against the form of the act of assembly in that case made and provided, and against the peace,, dignity, and government of the state.\u201d <em>Not Guilty </em>was pleaded. At the trial the attorney for the state, to support and maintain the prosecution, gave in evidence to the jury that <em>Baker, </em>the traverser, was a resident of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>and on the 21st of March 1803, came from the city of <em>Baltimore </em>to <em>Port-Tobacco, </em>in <em>Charles </em>county, where he rented a house of a certain <em>J. E. Ford, </em>for the term of fifteen days, and that the traverser did, on the day and year aforesaid, set up a Faro Bank, and played at Faro in the house rented by him of <em>Ford. </em>The traverser - ; ; . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>gave in evidence to the jury, that the place aforesaid was-not a dwelling-house occupied by any tavern-keeper, retailer of wine, spirituous liquors, beer or cider; and that it was not an out-house occupied by any tavern-keeper, retailer of wine, spirituous liquors, beer or cider, or place occupied by any tavern-keeper, retailer of wine, spirituous liquors, beer or cider. The attorney for the state then prayed the court to direct and instruct the jury, that if they find from the evidence that <em>Baker </em>did set up a Faro Table, and play at Faro in the house stated in the indictment, they ought to find a verdict for the state. To which prayer the traverser, by his counsel objected, and contended before the court that he was not guilty of any offence against the act of assembly, entitled, <em>iiJln act to prevent excessive </em>gaming,\u201d unless the jury should find from th.e evidence that the place aforesaid was a dwelling-house occupied by a tavern-keeper, retailer of wine, spirituous liquors, beer oy eider, or an out-house occupied by a tavern-keeper, retail-, cr of wine, spirituous liquors, beer or cider, or place occupied by a tavern-keeper, retailer of wine, spirituous 1C quors, beef or cider. But the court, <em>(Gantt, </em>Ch. J.) instructed and directed the jury, agreeably to the prayer of the attorney for the state, and refused to permit the counsel for the traverser to argue to the jury on the construction of the act of assembly as contended for by him in his objection to the prayer of the prosecutor. Whereupon the traverser, by his counsel, prayed leave to except to the opinion and direction of the court to the jury, and also to the opinion of the court, in refusing to permit him by his counsel to argue on the construction of the act of assembly, and that the court would sign and seal this his bill of exceptions, &amp;c.
