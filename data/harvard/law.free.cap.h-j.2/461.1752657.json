This direction was communicated to him by letter, the defendant being then absent from home at <em>Bath, </em>in <em>Virginia. </em>That he, the witness, was at that time at work with the slaves of the defendant \u25a0upon the dam for the mill. That the witness being about to execute the above orders of the defendant, told tins plaintiff that he was about to take away the hands of the defendant from the dam; the plaintiff asked for what, lie told him to build his house; the plaintiff told him to continue to woik atibe dam, and not to mind the house, that he, the plaintiff, could make a shift with the counting room finished in the mill; that in consequence of this request of the plaintiff, he at that time refrained from building the house, and continued working upon the dam until the cold weather prevented him: that he began again to work upon it in the spring 1798, and did not finish it until some short time before the mill was completed, which was on the 21st of June 1798.

That he never after received any instructions from the defendant to . get the logs for the house, and that none were ever got.

The plaintiff offered no evidence to the jury that he ever called upon the defendant to build the dwelling-house, or requested it to be done. That on the 31st of January 1799, the defendant dispossessed the plaintiff of the mill, and kept him out ever after.

The breaches in the declaration, which have been made the ground for the motion in arrest of judgment, as slated in the reasons filed, are, that 4Hhe defendant did not enclose twelve acres of land most convenient to the mill, in the declaration mentioned, two acres whereof was bottom land, and cause the same to be put under good and sufficient fence for the exclusive use of the plaintiff,\u201d Now the declaration does not allege the breach an stated in the reasons. The breach, as laid in the declaration, is \u2018\u00a1\u2018nor did the defendant furnish the plaintiff with 32 acres of land, including two acres of bottom land, most convenient to th,e plaintiff^ under good and sufficient fence, for the plaintiff\u2019s use, but wholly refused,\u201d &amp;c. in the words uf the agreement. The meaning of which is, that <em>Gallo-</em>was to furnish the land enclosed, and that it was not to be at the joint expense of the parties. The preceding clause in the agreement saying, that the firewood, &amp;c\u201e should be at the equal cost of the parties, did not make it a covenant that the 12 acres should be enclosed at the joint expense. They are separate covenants. It is not usual for a man to covenant to furnish himself; and as this was for the benefit of Morrison, it must be <em>Galloway\u2019s </em>covenant. The costs of cutting the firewood, &amp;c, has nothing to do. with what follows respecting the land to be enclosed. After verdict, the court are to infer from the expressions in the declaration, that <em>Gallon:ny </em>did not, according to, the agreement, furnish the land,, and enclose it as by the covenant he was bound to do, and that the jury found that he did not furnish and enclose according to the covenant. The declaration does not state at whose expense <em>the </em>enclosing was to be. It was to be done for the use of <em>Morrison* </em>The firewood was to be furnished at the equal expense of the parties,</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-8\">If the judgment is reversed, by the act of 1800, <em>eh. </em>&lt;59, this co.urt are to give such judgment as the court below ought to, have given. The judgment here has been arrestv cd, and if the judgment of arrest is reversed, unless the. court give judgment under this act, tfie. appellant has no, jem.edy but anew action,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-9\"><em>T. Buchanan, </em>for the Appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoH\">The only question a? to the, construction of the agreement jss whether the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>s',as tobe Enclosed at tito joint expehsc of the parlies? Tlie declaration goes upon the ground that the enclosure was to be made solely at <em>Gullou'uifs </em>expense, when the agreement does not \u00a1so provide, but when it may bs inferred that it was to be at the joint expense o\u00ed both, and was to be taken as a mutual covenant. In the agreement, where any act was to be done at th\u00e9 expense of either of the parties, it is so stated. Hence, it not being otherwise pro* vided, the inference is, that the enclosing tlie 12 acres, &amp;c\u00bb was to be at the joint expense of both. The firewood was to be furnished at the joint expense, and the land to b\u00e1 enclosed at the like expensa. There is no reason why die expense in the one case should not be borne as in the \u00abflier. In this case the appellee took a number of bills of exceptions at the trial. He did not let the judgment go .against him <em>on </em>the verdict, and rely on the errors in the opinions given in the exceptions, but moved to arrest the judgment, which was done, and the cause is now in tills court on the plaintiff*\u2019\u00bb appeal, tf the judgment is revests-\u2022 ed, and such a judgment given as the court below ought to have entered, the appellee will be precluded from the be* Belit of his bills of exceptions.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-2\"><em>Martin, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A6I\">was stopped by the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b481-3\">JUBGMHT REVERSED, AND JHDUMEKt' \u00cdOR THE A3PPE1-BANT OX TUB Y1S\u00cdIIK0T, &amp;C.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
