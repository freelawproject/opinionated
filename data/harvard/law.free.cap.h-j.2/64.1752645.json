The bill of the complainant, (the now appellee,) stated, that in September 1797, he purchased a part of a tract of land, lying in <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county, called <em>Sloney Harbour, </em>containing 163 acres, from a certain <em>Benonill. Wade, </em>at the price of <em>\u00a35 </em>per acre; and on the 24th of December 1797, <em>Wade </em>gave him full and absolute possession thereof, and that he has ever since continued in possession. That at the time of the purchase of the land, <em>Wade </em>was indebted to the complainant on bond, with <em>Thomas Mundell </em>his surety, in the quantity of 15,605lbs. of net tobacco, tobe paid at the price of 65 shillings per hundred, the whole amounting to A482 current money, and it was then agreed, that the bond should be received in part payment of the land at the said amount, and the same was accordingly given up to <em>Wade. </em>That the complainant continued in possession of the land, and used and cultivated it, and having paid up the whole purchase money, on the 12th of November 1798, obtained a conveyance for the same. That after he had pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>chased the latid from <em>Wade, </em>and had paid the amount of the bond in manner aforesaid, and had been in possession, and had Used the land from the month of December 1797 to May 1798, a certain <em>Bryan Hampson </em>obtained three judgments against <em>Wade </em>at May term 1798, in the general court, ol\u00ed which judgments several writs of <em>fieri facias </em>have issued returnable to tlie next general court at May term 1800, and have been laid on the land of the complainant so as aforesaid bought and paid for, and there will be an immediate sale thereof, unless prevented by this court. That at the time the complainant purchased and paid fea the land as aforesaid, he never heard of the judgments against <em>Wade, </em>and was wholly ignorant of the same, until the writs of <em>fieri facias </em>were about to be laid on the land. That he is advised that, having bought the land, and having been in possession thereof as aforesaid, and having paid to the amount aforesaid, before any judgment was obtained against <em>Wade, </em>he is entitled to the aid of this court to secure him in his title to the land. <em>Prayer </em>for an <em>injunction </em>to enjoin proceedings on the judgments and executions, and for other relief, &amp;c. An injunction accordingly issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b75-4\">On coming in- of the defendant\u2019s answer, and testimony taken under a commission,- the case Was submitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-7\">Hanson, Chancellor, (October term 1803.) Whether or not the defendant would have had any ground of relief in case he had filed a bill against <em>Edelen </em>and <em>TVade, </em>the Chancellor neither will, nor ought to, nor can positively determine. Perhaps the whole of the circumstances of the case may not be before the court. However, as the Chancellor cannot doubt that the complainant, at the lime when the judgments in the bill mentioned against <em>Wade, </em>had a clear equitable interest in the land mentioned, which has since been conveyed to him, he conceives that it is the duty of this court to protect the said <em>interest </em>\u2014 Decreed, that the injunction, in this case issued, be perpetual, and that each party pay his own costs. From which decree the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmI\">The cause ivas argued in this court before Chase, Ch.

In this case it appears that a considerable part of the purchase money was paid, and possession given of the land, prior to the obtention of the judgments by <em>Hampson </em>against <em>Wade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">A contract for land, <em>bona fide </em>made for a valuable consideration, vests the equitable interest in the vendee from the time of the execution of the contract, although the money is not paid at that time.
