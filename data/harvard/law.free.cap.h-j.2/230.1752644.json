The material facts were these. \u2014The complainant <em>Rachel, </em>(one of the appellants,) whilst she was sole, on the 21st of September 1790, was seized in fee. of the tracts of land called <em>Rich Neck </em>and <em>Howard\u2019s Timber Neck. </em>A marriage settlement took place between the complainants, on the 21st of September 1790, and <em>Lyde Goodioin </em>was appointed trustee. This, settlement wag. as follows: \u201cThis indenture, made the 21st of September. 1790, between <em>Jesse Hollingsworth, </em>of the first part, <em>Rachel.

The marriage took effect, and on the 4th of January 1796 the complainants, together with <em>Lyde Goodwin, </em>executed a deed to <em>Thomas Parkin, </em>the son of the Female complainant by a former marriage, which purports to convey to him an estate iii fee simple in the said lands* and ivas acknowledged as follows: <em>\u201cBaltimore </em>county, set\u00bb On this loth day of February 1796, personally appeared <em>Jesse Hollingsworth </em>and <em>Lyde Goodwin </em>before us the subscribers, two justices of the peace for <em>Baltimore </em>county, and severally acknowledged the aforegoing instrument of writing to be their act and deed, according to the true intent and meaning thereof. At the same time came <em>Rachel, </em>the wife of the said <em>Jesse Hollingsworth, </em>and being by us privately examined apart from and out of the presence and. hearing of her said husband, did acknowledge the aforegoing instrument of writing to be her act and deed, according to the intent and meaning thereof, and declared that she made and executed the same, and this her acknowledgment thereof, voluntarily and of her own free will and accord, without being induced thereto by threats of or ill usage from her said husband, or through fear of his displeasure.\u201d This acknowledgment was signed by the justices. <em>Parkin, </em>the grantee, died in possession of the lands in 1797, of full age, and by his will devised the same in fee to his mother, one of the complainants. Certain creditors of <em>Parkin </em>and <em>AH Henna </em>filed a bill in the court of chancery against the complainants, under the devise to the mother as devisee of <em>Parkin, </em>or as hi\u00e1 heir at law, stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>:Parkin </em>died seized in fee of the lands; that they were his 'creditors; that <em>Parkin </em>and <em>MlKenna </em>were insolv\u00e9iit; and . . \u2022 \u25a0 \u2022 . - . Praying a sale \u00f3f the land. The complainants answered the bill; admitting <em>Parkin </em>tobe seized in fee of the lands, and that h\u2019e devised the same to his mother, one of the complainants. A decree for a sale took place; <em>S. </em>Chase, junior, was appointed trustee for making the sale, who made a sale of p\u00e1rt of the lands, \u00e1nd made a report thereof to the chancellor, which was confirmed, by the consent of the complainants: After the sale was made; and the confirmation thereof; the complainants alleged, they had discovered that <em>Parkin </em>never was seized of the lands in fee, but that the estate in fee belonged to the complainant, <em>Rachel; </em>and that the deed from the complainants to <em>Parkin, </em>was not such a deed as passed the estate of a married wo* man. The <em>prayer </em>of the bill was, that the chancellor would decree the sales of the lands to b\u00e9 null and void, &amp;c. and for general relief, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AaO\">Hanson, Chancellor, (October term 1805,) decreed, that. the bill be dismissed, &amp;c.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0_\">In this case, the first question to be decided by the court is, what estate vested in <em>Thomas </em>Parkin* jn the land in question, under and in virtue of the deed from <em>Jesse Hollingsworth, </em>and <em>Rachel .Lyde Parkin, </em>to <em>Lyde. Goodwin, </em>executed on the 21st of September' 1790?.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">The question arles on the following words in the <em>habcn~ dura </em>of the deed; \u201cAnd from and after her decease, that <em>Thomas Parkin, </em>and <em>his heirs, for ever, </em>shall have and possess the said lands and premises; and in case of his the., said <em>Thomas\u2019s death loithout lawful issue, </em>the said lands shall revert to and be veste4 in the said <em>Rachel, </em>and her heirs, for ever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">It is admitted that <em>Lyde </em>Goodwin, under this deed, took a fee simple in the lands in question, in trust for <em>Rachel Parkin, </em>during her life, and that the words before recited, would in a will create an estate tail in <em>Thomas Parkin; </em>but it is objected that those words in a deed will not create an estate tail, and that a fee simple passed to <em>Thomas Parkin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">It is without doubt that the above words in a will would give a fee tail, because no technical words being necessary to create sucli estate. The intention expressed by the words of the testator must prevail if not inconsistent with some rule or principle of law; and the intention is plain here that <em>Thomas Parkin </em>was to take a fee tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">In a deed or conveyance of a freehold or legal estate* technical words are appropriated by law to the creation of limitation of particular estates; for instance, to create an estate in fee, the limitation must be to <em>J. S. </em>and his heirs, and to create a fee tail, to <em>J. 8. </em>and the heirs of his body\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>It is established that the words <em>eh corpore suo </em>are not dispensably necessary, but- may be supplied by words equipollent or tantamount, plainly designating or pointing-out the body from whom the heirs inheritable are to issue or descend.</p>\n<p id=\"AGV\">In this case the limitation is to <em>Thomas Parkin, </em>and his.. liei,rs, and in case of his death without lawful issue, to revert to <em>Rachel Parkin, </em>and- her heirs. These words are comprehended in one sentence, and contain the two requisites necessary to constitute an estate tail. The subsequent words, \u201cin case of his death without lawful issue, qualify and restrain the generality of the precedent expressions, (to <em>Thomas Parkin, </em>and his heirs,) and point out, unequivocally and plainly, the heirs intended to inherit, and confine them to heirs of his body. <em>Thomas ParkiU </em>could not die without heirs, as long as he had lawful issue; and in this case the words lawful issue, heirs of his body, and issue of his body, as words of limitation, expressive of the quality of the estate to be granted, are of the same import and, signification,, and necessarily designate the heirs intended to inherit, and do convert the' fee simple created by the first words, into a fee tail; for <em>Thomas Parkin </em>could not have issue, or lawful- issue, but of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">The court being of opinion, that an estate tail vested in <em>Thomas </em>Parkin; with^the reybreion in fee tq <em>Rachel Lycle Parkin, </em>under the $wd; and/being also of opinion, that the said words, in a-jEonveyance of a freehold estate, would create a fee tan, it becomes unnecessary to decide the ques- \u25a0 tion, so ably and learnedly discussed by the counsel-, how far the court is at liberty, in expounding a deed of conveyance creating'or limiting an use or trust at common law, and not united to the possession by the statute of ijses, to reject the rules established by the common law, in the construction of a conveyance of a freehold estate, and to give an exposition according to the intention qf the parlies, as in a will,</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">It is also unnecessary to decide on the nice and refined distinctions between trusts executed and 'executory; and the court gi.ve no opinion on those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\"><em>Jls to the operation of the,deed of </em>1796. It is unquestionable that a <em>feme covert </em>cannot transfer or pass her interest in land to another, urless by fine, common recovery, or deed executed and acknowledged according to the mode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>prescribed by the act of-1715; and the. question to be decided by tlie court is, whether the acknowledgment of the deed by Mrs. <em>Hollingsworth </em>is conformable to the said mode, and effectual to render the deed operative in law to convey her interest in the lands in dispute to her son <em>Thomas Parkin?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">The court are of opinion, that the acknowledgment is. substantially defective, the word \u201cfear\u201d being omitted in the certificate of the acknowledgment, and no word of similar import or meaning substituted in its place. The word <em>fear, </em>in that part of the certificate, means a particular specific kind of- fear, and signifies that she makes her acknowledgment without being induced thereto <em>bjfear of ill-usage </em>by her husband-.
