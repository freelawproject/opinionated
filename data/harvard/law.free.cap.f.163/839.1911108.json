Infringement of letters patent No. 604,465 is charged by tho bill against the defendants appellees, and this patent is one of three several letters patent whereof infringement was adjudged against tlie same defendants in a prior suit, reported as Siemons-Halske Electric Co. v. Duncan Electric Mfg. Co., 142 Fed. 157, 73 C. C. A. 375; the present complainant having acquired title to such patent from Siemens-Halske Electric Company. In the case at bar the defendants are alike estopped from disputing the validity of the patent or scope of the claims within the fair import of their terms, as therein adjudicated, and the decree rests on the finding of noninfringement, with the issue thus narrowed. The present device of tho defendants, however, alleged to be an infringement, was adopted and used after the commencement of the former litigation and not involved therein. It also appears that the defendant Duncan obtained a patent therefor, No. 752,048, issued February 16, 1904.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b851-12\">Patent No. 001,465, in suit, was issued to the defendant Duncan May 24, 1898. As stated in tho specification, the \u201cinvention relates to improvements in electric meters, particularly that class known as \u2018integrating watt-meters\u2019 of the motor type.\u201d As described in the appellant\u2019s brief, the invention \u201crelates to means for counterbalancing or compensating for the friction which opposes Die rotation of the armature of an electric meter. This friction varies under different conditions, and the invention of the patent in suit consists in the employment of an adjustable compensating coil for counteracting or compensating for such friction, whereby the varying degrees of such friction at different times may be taken care of and tho \u2018balance\u2019 of the meter maintained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b851-13\">The introduction of \u201can adjustable compensating coil,\u201d namely, adjustable in relation to the armature, for the purpose referred to, instead of the pre-existing compensating coil which was in fixed position and \u201cnot variable in character,\u201d constitutes the single feature and means of novelty and invention in this class of so-called \u201cintegrating watt-meters.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b851-14\">Other specifications and facts involved in the inquiry are mentioned in the opinion, and the following are the claims in the patent whereof infringement is alleged:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b851-15\">\u201c3.

This means consists of electrical connections terminating in contact points arranged in the form <em>of </em>an arc and stationary, and a switch arm so mounted in circuit that its tip engages the contact points in turn as required. Thus the number of coils energized by the current is increased or diminished by turning the switch arm.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b852-6\">Edward Rector and Drury W.

Its solution hinges alone on the fair interpretation of the claims in suit, as allowed in patent No. 604,465, for the means there described, \u201cfor counterbalancing or compensating for the friction which opposes the rotation of the armature of an electric meter.\u201d This means is expressly defined, in specification and claims, as \u201can adjustable compensating coil or coils\u201d in co-operative relation to the armature, with adjustability for such co-operation conceded to be the single feature of novelty; the compensating coil (or shunt coil) in fixed position in electric m\u00e9ters being well known and so recognized in the specification. As therein stated, this adjustabilty of the coil provided \u201ca simple and efficient means for compensating for the increased friction caused by the wear and continued use of the working parts of the meter,\u201d and the sole means shown or claimed as invention was the provision for \u201cbodily movement\u201d of the coil towards and from the armature, to vary its influence and maintain the \u201cbalance\u201d of the meter.</p>\n<p id=\"A057\">The defendants\u2019 meter employs means for like purpose, but retains the compensating or shunt coil of the prior art in fixed position, incapable of this mechanical or bodily movement of the patent device, and then provides electrical connections from sections of the coil to stationary central points, with an electrical switch to make the desired contact, \u201cthus causing the current- to flow through a greater or smaller number of turns of the wire constituting the coil,\u201d whereby its effect upon the armature is varied. Identity in the general purpose and result of compensating for friction is obvious in both devices, although various distinctions are claimed on behalf of the defendants, of advantage and disadvantage in such means respectively. The defendants\u2019 means, however, for such effect, is a departure, as we believe, from any idea of invention disclosed or taught by the patent \u2014 with the limited scope undeniably imposed by its recitals and terms. As stated by one of the experts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-11\">\u201cThe patented method of adjustment is purely a\u2019 mechanical movement of the coil, the means for effecting it being merely a mechanical agent for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>changing the position of the coil, while no electrical change is made in the s\u00fc wigth or path of the current through the coil. On the contrary, defendants\u2019 meter employs a principle, method, and means that are purely electrical, no movement of the coil being provided for or even possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">In other words, the conception of the patentee for the improved means was to move and adjust the coil for the well-known effect of proximity upon the armature, with no change of current, while the other device adopts electrical connections to vary the length of path of that current through the coil \u2014 giving more or less \u201cturns to the coil\u201d\u2014 for like result.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The contention for infringement in this change of means and method is this: That the one is a well-known equivalent of the other, in the electrical art, for producing a variable effect; that the substitute means of the defendants to that end \u201cis in fact and in substance an 'adjustable\u2019 coil,\u201d in the \u201cnomenclature of the art\u201d and within the meaning of the claims; that ordinary skill only was required to make the substitution; and that the general doctrine of equivalents is applicable to such substitute. We are of opinion, however, that neither of these propositions is tenable, under the plain disclaimers and limitations of invention for which monopoly was granted in this patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The specification describes the \u201cimproved means for compensating for the increased friction of the meter resulting from use\u201d as consisting \u201cof two compensating coils\u201d located over the armature, and \u201cfirmly held in position out of contact with the armature by means of\u201d clamps, with arms which \u201cfirmly embrace said coils\u201d; also, provisions for adjustability. It then states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">\u201cAs these compensating coils may be variously adjusted toward or away from the armature and can be employe'd in meters having field-coils of different forms, I do not hereby limit myself to any of the specific forms or relative arrangements herein shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The following statements then appear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-9\">\u201cOne of the principal features of my invention is the means I employ to make the meter reliably operative on small currents or small amounts of energy and to compensate for the increase of friction incident to continued service. For example, when a meter is first calibrated it possesses a certain amount of friction, which has in some meters been temporarily compensated for by supplementing the series field with a shunt-coil, thereby producing an auxiliary starting-field, which however, is not variable in character. The result is that after the meter has been in use for some months the friction of the moving parts in most cases will have so increased that from five to ten times as much energy is required to start it as when first calibrated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-10\">\u201cAnother objection to the employment of a stationary shunt-coil in the present meters is the fact that any changes made in it, such as adding more turns to it, simply adds resistance into the armature-circuit, which results in possibly compensating for friction, but lowers the registry or characteristic on all the other loads. Placing the said supplement shunt-coil inside of the series coil is also objectionable, as it thus becomes a secondary to the series coil on alternating currents, thereby setting up a counter electromotive force in opposition to that of the mains. This counter effect increases as the current through the series coils increases, whereby its tendency to overcome friction decreases as the energy of the current through the meter increases instead of remaining constant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-11\">\u201cMy improved means for overcoming the above objections is by employing one or more, preferably two, compensating coils, 24, located immediately above the armature. These compensating coils are connected in series <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>with the armature and a suitable resistance, 25. In calibrating the meter these compensating coils are simply moved laterally or vertically by means of the screw, 30, until the friction is overcome, whereupon a small amount of energy through the meter will operate it\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Thus it is conceded that shunt-coils have been used in meters to compensate for friction and made more or less variable in effect by other means, with express mention of \u201cthe stationary shunt-coil\u201d as objectionable, because \u201cchanges made in it, such as adding more turns to it, simply adds resistance into the armature circuit, which results in possibly compensating for friction, but lowers the registry or characteristic on all the other loads.\u201d The only invention claimed or suggested was the introduction of means to make the coil adjustable instead of stationary, \u201cfor overcoming the above objections.\u201d Were it assumed therefore that the expedient adopted by the defendants, of \u201cadding more turns\u201d to the stationary coil, would otherwise appear, in any sense, within the contemplation of the invention and scope of the grant, it was not only disclaimed by this reference, but its exclusion, under the careful specifications of the improvement in means claimed and allowed is unmistakable, as we believe. That the effect obtained in improved compensation was not patentable is well settled, and the limitation to the means devised therefor is well recognized in these specifications, if not in the construction sought on this appeal. The disclaimer is binding, whatever the prior state of the art, either in fact or as viewed by the patentee, and no interpretation of the claims is authorized to charge the defendants with infringement for use of the stationary coil and electrical connections for equivalent function.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The alleged inconsistency between the present contentions of the appellant for construction of the patent and the construction urged and allowed in the prior litigation referred to do not require consideration, and the decree appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
