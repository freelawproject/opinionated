On May 6, 1997, appellant filed a document titled \u201cAppellant\u2019s Request Pursuant to Rule XXII.\u201d Appellant requests a waiver of the prohibition against filing a reply to a memorandum opposing a motion found in S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(4)(B), in order to file a reply to appellee\u2019s memorandum opposing appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Whereas there is no provision in S.CtPrac.R. XI permitting the filing of a reply to a memorandum opposing a motion for reconsideration; and whereas S.CtPrac.R. XXII is not applicable because appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was not pending when S.CtPrac.R. XIV(4XB) became effective; and whereas S.CtPrac.R. XIV(4)(B) prohibits the filing of a reply to a memorandum opposing a motion,</p>\n<p id=\"AOiF\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that appellant\u2019s request pursuant to Rule XXII be, and hereby is, stricken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
