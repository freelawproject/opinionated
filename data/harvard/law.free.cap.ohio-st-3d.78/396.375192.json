The commission refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Claimant did not prevail on appeal to the courts because they viewed the commission\u2019s order as one involving extent of disability \u2014 a nonappealable order. R.C. 4123.512. They reached that conclusion by characterizing bilateral radiculopathy not as a \u201ccondition\u201d \u2014 which would have made the commission\u2019s order appealable on \u201cright to participate\u201d grounds \u2014 but as a \u201csymptom.\u201d This characterization, according to claimant, compels the award of temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">Claimant\u2019s reasoning is somewhat unclear. Perhaps claimant believes that in characterizing bilateral radiculopathy as a symptom and not a condition, the courts inherently declared that bilateral radiculopathy was causally related to claimant\u2019s industrial injury. Contrary to claimant\u2019s belief, however, neither court addressed the causal-relationship question.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">Claimant may also theorize that the invalidation of the commission\u2019s disallowance of bilateral radiculopathy as a condition neutralizes the only reasoning the commission offered for refusing to award temporary total disability compensation, and that this, in turn, compels compensation. This theory lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">The lack of \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the denial of temporary total disability compensation does not automatically translate into \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting its award. <em>State ex rel. Lampkins v. Dayton Malleable, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 14, 542 N.E.2d 1105. Claimant retains the burden of establishing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>necessary prerequisites to eligibility for temporary total disability compensation. Claimant cannot do so here. Claimant\u2019s proffered certification of temporary total disability is based on his bilateral radiculopathy. Dr. Weisenburger, on whom the commission relied, stated that claimant\u2019s bilateral radiculopathy was not caused by his industrial injury. Thus, regardless of the label applied \u2014 \u201csymptom\u201d or \u201ccondition\u201d \u2014 a lack of causal relationship disqualifies bilateral radiculopathy as a basis for temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Claimant argues that Weisenburger\u2019s report cannot support the commission\u2019s denial of temporary total disability compensation prior to April 10, 1989, since Weisenburger did not examine claimant until that date. Claimant\u2019s reliance, however, on <em>State ex rel. Case v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 383, 28 OBR 442, 504 N.E.2d 30, is misplaced. <em>Case </em>indicates that a doctor cannot offer an opinion on a claimant\u2019s extent of disability for a period that preceded the doctor\u2019s examination of the claimant. Logic supports this principle. A claimant\u2019s condition can change with time, and simply because a claimant was not temporarily totally disabled at one point does not mean that claimant could not be so disabled later.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In this case, the relevant portion of Dr. Weisenburger\u2019s report involved causal relationship, not extent of disability. This is a critical distinction. The original causal relationship of a symptom/condition to an industrial injury \u2014 unlike the extent of disability \u2014 does not change with the passage of time. Dr. Weisenburger\u2019s report, therefore, keeps its evidentiary viability and is \u201csome evidence\u201d justifying the commission\u2019s denial of temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
