This cause originated in this court on the filing of a complaint for a writ of mandamus. It appears from the records of this court that relator has not filed a brief, due April 11, 1997, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"AnK\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that this cause be, and hereby is, dismissed sua sponte.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
