For the reasons that follow, we hold that R.C. 4123.57(A) imposes the forty-week waiting period for TTD paid specifically pursuant to R.C. 4123.56, notwithstanding that claimants cannot be paid living maintenance wage loss compensation and R.C. 4123.57(A) PPD at the same time. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AWm\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\n<em>R.C. 4123.57 Waiting Period</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\">The General Assembly established the forty-week waiting period in R.C. 4123.57 for PPD applications to ensure permanency at the time of the determination. Fulton, Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1991) 203, Section 9.11. The statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">\u201cPartial disability compensation shall be paid as follows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\"><em>\u201cNot earlier than forty weeks after the date of termination of the latest period of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code, </em>or not earlier than forty weeks after the date of the injury or contraction of an occupational disease in the absence of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code, <em>the employee may file an application with the industrial commission for the determination of the percentage of his permanent partial disability resulting from the injury </em>or occupational disease.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 767.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The court of appeals applied R.C. 4123.57 precisely as written and determined that only a claimant\u2019s receipt of TTD under R.C. 4123.56 invoked the forty-week application waiting period. The court thus held that Burrows\u2019s receipt of R.C. 4121.67(B) living maintenance wage loss compensation as of the date of her PPD application did not render the application untimely. Burrows uses the same analysis to urge us to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">But the hospital and commission insist that the analysis is more difficult. They argue that when R.C. 4123.57 is read <em>in pari materia </em>with R.C. 4121.63 and 4121.67(B), the result is a waiting period that applies to living maintenance and living maintenance wage loss compensation because both are to be considered forms of TTD under R.C. 4123.56. Their reasoning is syllogistic:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">1. R.C. 4121.67(B) directs that living maintenance wage loss compensation be paid \u201cin the same manner as living maintenance payments are made pursuant to [R.C. 4121.63]\u201d; and</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">2. R.C. 4121.63 provides that \u201c[a] claimant receiving living maintenance payments shall be deemed to be temporarily totally disabled and shall receive no payment of any type of compensation except as provided by [R.C. 4123.57(B) (scheduled losses) ] * * * [while] receiving living maintenance payments\u201d; therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">3. A claimant receiving living maintenance wage loss compensation is \u201cdeemed\u201d temporarily totally disabled for all purposes, including the R.C. 4123.57 waiting period, and, further, is ineligible for all compensation except R.C. 4123.57(B) scheduled losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">The General Assembly may have anticipated that living maintenance compensation paid pursuant to R.C. 4121.63 and living maintenance wage loss compensation paid pursuant to R.C. 4121.67(B) would always be treated as forms of TTD. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>However, in determining legislative intent, we must first look to the plain language of R.C. 4123.57. \u201cIf the meaning of the statute is unambiguous and definite, it must be applied as written and no further interpretation is necessary.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Savarese v. Buckeye Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 543, 545, 660 N.E.2d 463, 465. Unambiguous statutes are to be applied according to the plain meaning of the words used, <em>Roxane Laboratories, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 125, 127, 661 N.E.2d 1011, 1012, and courts are not free to delete or insert other words, <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 217, 220, 631 N.E.2d 150, 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The R.C. 4123.57(A) waiting period is not ambiguous \u2014 it averts PPD applications for forty weeks after a claimant stops receiving \u201cpayments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code.\u201d The statute does not mention R.C. 4121.63 or 4121.67(B). Moreover, payments available under R.C. 4123.56 are basically of two types \u2014 division (A) compensates claimants for wages lost due to an incapacity to work at their former jobs, and division (B) compensates claimants who are capable of other employment and suffer a wage loss. Neither type of compensation incorporates the further requirement, as do R.C. 4121.63 and 4121.67(B), that the claimant participate in a rehabilitation program. Thus, for whatever reason claimants are \u201cdeemed\u201d temporarily and totally disabled by virtue of having been paid living maintenance compensation or living maintenance wage loss compensation, this compensation is not payable \u201cunder\u201d R.C. 4123.56 as that term is used in R.C. 4123.57.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The <em>in pari materia </em>rule of construction may be used in interpreting a statute, but first some doubt or ambiguity must exist. <em>State ex rel. Herman v. Klopfleisch </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 581, 585, 651 N.E.2d 995, 998. Here, the R.C. 4123.57 waiting period becomes subject to different interpretations \u2014 whether it applies exclusively to claimants receiving R.C. 4123.56 compensation or also to claimants receiving R.C. 4121.63 and 4121.67(B) compensation \u2014 only because R.C. 4121.63, which R.C. 4123.57 does not incorporate, declares these claimants alike. Thus, in this instance, the <em>in pari materia </em>rule actually creates the ambiguity that the hospital and commission urge us to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"AdH\">For these reasons, we are not obligated to defer to the commission\u2019s interpretation of the R.C. 4123.57 waiting period. In its Policy Statement and Guideline issued January 1, 1989, the commission pronounced that applications for percentage of permanent disability compensation could not be filed until forty weeks after the date of the last payment of living maintenance compensation. This policy statement contravenes the express language of R.C. 4123.57 and, therefore, must yield to the higher authority. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Crabtree v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 504, 644 N.E.2d 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Burrows received her last payment under R.C. 4123.56 on November 4, 1990. She applied for PPD under R.C. 4123.57(A) on May 12, 1992, long past the forty-week waiting period. Her application, therefore, was not untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\n<em>Receipt of R.C. 123.57(A) and 4.121.67(B) Compensation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The hospital and commission also argue that Burrows cannot receive living maintenance wage loss compensation while she is receiving percentage of permanent partial disability payments under R.C. 4123.57(A). This time, plain statutory language supports their position.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">R.C. 4121.67(B) requires that living maintenance wage loss compensation be paid \u201cin the same manner\u201d as living maintenance compensation is paid pursuant to R.C. 4121.63. R.C. 4121.63 precludes \u201cpayment of any type of compensation except as provided by division (B) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code for the periods during which the claimant is receiving living maintenance payments.\u201d Thus, percentage of permanent partial disability awards under R.C. 4123.57(A) cannot be paid to claimants receiving either living maintenance or living maintenance wage loss compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Having found that R.C. 4123.57(A) imposes the forty-week waiting period for TTD paid specifically pursuant to R.C. 4123.56, notwithstanding that claimants cannot be paid living maintenance wage loss compensation and R.C. 4123.57(A) PPD at the same time, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals that grants a writ of mandamus to compel the commission\u2019s further consideration of Burrows\u2019s PPD application.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
