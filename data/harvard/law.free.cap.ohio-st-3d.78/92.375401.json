Respondent has also acknowledged that his actions violated both the Canon which requires that a judge be patient, dignified, and courteous to litigants and others with whom he deals in his judicial capacity and the Disciplinary Rule which prohibits lawyers from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The charges against respondent involve disappointing lapses of conduct and decorum in an otherwise distinguished judicial career spanning fifteen years, during which respondent received six Superior Judicial Service Awards and was active in civic and educational programs. We take particular note that in 1995 respondent handled an ever-growing domestic violence caseload during a time of increasing physical stress and fatigue which resulted in coronary artery bypass surgery in early 1996. In short, we are sympathetic to respondent\u2019s situation. Nevertheless, we cannot disregard respondent\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Respondent is no longer a member of the judiciary. The appropriate sanction, therefore, is a public reprimand, and respondent is so reprimanded. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b455-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E.

The majority opinion seems to imply that since the respondent judge was defeated in his last election and is no longer on the bench, a public reprimand is in order. I disagree. Not only did the voters indicate their displeasure with the respondent by not reelecting him, but we should not countenance such behavior with a public reprimand. The conduct in this case was a serious violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct and involved eight separate counts. An example of the conduct and behavior of the respondent can be best described in the following discussion he had with a domestic violence victim who was a woman of Hispanic descent and a naturalized American citizen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Are you the same lady on the present case pending where he is locked up now? He has a felony. And how many times have you had him arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\u201cMS. ELLERY: About three times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you think you folks are done? You cost the taxpayers $10,000. When will it stop? Where are you from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201cMS. ELLERY: El Paso, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Ever think about going home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">\u201cMS. ELLERY: I got kids here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Why is America being punished? Did we do something to you folks? We have to pay for all your crimes. Did we do something wrong? Could we get foreign aid from your native land for you being here? Now he has a felony. Who is his felony attorney? I know the taxpayers are paying for him. Did we do something to your country? Did they send you here to get even with us for something? Montezuma\u2019s revenge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">While I empathize with Judge Mestemaker\u2019s physical condition, it cannot and should not excuse his egregious conduct. From the foregoing discussion it is apparent that the respondent was not in the appropriate mental condition to be on the bench. He could have taken a paid medical leave from his judicial responsibilities until he was both mentally and physically fit to resume those duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">Judges are held to a much higher standard of conduct than other individuals. This is as it should be, since judges sit in judgment. Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-14\">\u201c * * * A judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing, and should himself observe, high standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be preserved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">In addition, Canon 2(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u201cA judge should respect and comply with the law and should conduct himself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Finally, Canon 3(A)(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\u201cA judge should be patient, dignified, and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers, and others with whom he deals in his official capacity * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">From a cursory reading of the foregoing Canons it is clear that Judge Mestemaker\u2019s conduct violated each of them. Additionally, the respondent ordered marriage as a condition of probation for criminal defendants sentenced in the Hamilton County Municipal Court in at least three other cases involving domestic violence. Again, these instances indicate that the respondent violated the foregoing Canons. Such conduct warrants a period of actual suspension. T would enter a one-year suspension from the practice of law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
