We have already rejected these contentions in a case involving other tutors and the same school board. <em>State ex rel. Kabert v. Shaker Hts. City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 37, 676 N.E.2d 101. <em>Kabert </em>applies here. Based on <em>Kabert, </em>the board\u2019s first, second, and third propositions of law are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">In its fourth proposition of law, the board asserts that appellees are estopped from claiming status as teachers for purposes of the teachers\u2019 salary schedules and entitlement to continuing contracts. The board initially contends that a provision in the collective bargaining agreements in effect during the pertinent school years precluded part-time employees like appellees from attaining continuing contract status.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>But the board\u2019s contention is meritless because appellees, and other tutors, were not members of the collective bargaining unit. Appellees\u2019 entitlement to continuing contracts and the higher teachers\u2019 salaries incorporated into the collective bargaining agreements arose from statutes rather than the collective bargaining agreements. <em>Kabert; State ex rel. Chavis v. Sycamore City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 26, 641 N.E.2d 188; <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Milton-Union Exempted Village Bd. of Edn. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 21, 531 N.E.2d 1297. Therefore, the contractual provision cited by the board did not apply to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The board also contends that it would be \u201cgrossly inequitable\u201d to compel it to issue continuing contracts because appellees did not go through the \u201crigorous evaluative process established by R.C. 3319.11 and 3319.111.\u201d This contention lacks merit because \u201c \u2018R.C. 3319.11 specifically provides that a board\u2019s failure to comply with the teacher evaluation requirements of R.C. 3319.111 results in the reemployment of the teacher.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Martines v. Cleveland City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 416, 417, 639 N.E.2d 80, 82, quoting <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 217, 222, 631 N.E.2d 150, 154. Therefore, the board\u2019s fourth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals did not err in granting appellees extraordinary relief in mandamus. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b880-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
