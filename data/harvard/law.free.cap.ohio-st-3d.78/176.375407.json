Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 20, 31 OBR 70, 72, 508 N.E.2d 936, 938. If an order is supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d then there is no abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">In this opinion, we reaffirm the proposition that this court\u2019s review of a commission\u2019s order pursuant to a complaint for a writ of mandamus should be limited to determining whether there is some evidence to support the commission\u2019s order. <em>Burley, supra. </em>To go further and assess the credibility of the evidence would place this court \u201cin the role of a \u2018super commission,\u2019 a role never envisioned by either the Ohio Constitution or the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 31 OBR at 72, 508 N.E.2d at 938. Accordingly, we will evaluate the commission\u2019s order by the some evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">Consolidation sets forth five propositions of law arguing that the commission failed to support its order with some evidence. We will address each of Consolidation\u2019s propositions separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>I. Polio</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Consolidation claims that because Dr. Fierra\u2019s report did not expressly state that his impairment rating excluded McDaniel\u2019s polio, a nonallowed and preexisting condition, its inclusion in the rating must be assumed. As a result, Consolidation argues, polio was improperly factored into McDaniel\u2019s percentage of impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The flaw in Consolidation\u2019s argument is that it assumes that McDaniel had an impairment or preexisting condition attributable to the polio. Consolidation ignores that McDaniel had worked for years prior to his injuries herein without any effect from his polio. A preexisting condition is not a preexisting disability where the claimant worked without any apparent problems prior to the injury. <em>State ex rel. Kettering Med. Ctr. v. Wallace </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 588, 589, 629 N.E.2d 444, 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Further, there is no requirement that a physician specifically indicate that a nonallowed condition was not part of his or her conclusion. In the case at bar, Fierra\u2019s report attributed McDaniel\u2019s impairment to the allowed conditions. There is no legal basis for concluding that the failure to exclude polio means that it was included. Fierra did not attribute any of McDaniel\u2019s impairment to his polio despite the fact that he knew of its existence. \u201c[Njonallowed conditions are immaterial, regardless of their severity, as long as the allowed conditions, in and of themselves, prevent sustained remunerative employment.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 454, 619 N.E.2d 1018, 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Accordingly, it was not an abuse of discretion for the commission to base its order on Fierra\u2019s report despite its failure to mention McDaniel\u2019s polio.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">II. Dr. McCloud\u2019s Report</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Fierra, in performing his combined-effects review, considered the report of Dr. Jerry McCloud in evaluating McDaniel. Consolidation argues that Fierra misconstrued McCloud\u2019s report in assessing the amount of impairment attributable to McDaniel\u2019s allowed back conditions. Consolidation specifically cites the following passage from Fierra\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">\u201c[T]he orthopedic permanent partial impairment, including the permanent partial impairment of 30% recommended by Dr. McCloud and taking into consideration that the claimant returned to work for a substantial period of time following the low back surgery, is 50%.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Consolidation claims that Fierra\u2019s report cited McDaniel\u2019s favorable response to back surgery, but then inexplicably increased his impairment from thirty percent to fifty percent when McCloud\u2019s report indicated only thirty percent impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Fierra\u2019s statement is concededly confusing. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that McDaniel\u2019s allowed condition has two components\u2014 cervical and lumbar. McCloud examined McDaniel only for the cervical condition. Thus, his thirty percent rating applied only to McDaniel\u2019s cervical condition \u2014 not to his cervical and lumbar conditions as Consolidation mistakenly believes. Therefore, Fierra\u2019s reliance upon McCloud\u2019s report was limited to an assessment of McDaniel\u2019s cervical problem. Based on McCloud\u2019s report, Fierra then attributed the thirty percent disability to McDaniel\u2019s cervical condition. The additional twenty percent impairment was an assessment of McDaniel\u2019s lumbar condition made independently of McCloud\u2019s report by Fierra and resulted in a fifty percent impairment for McDaniel\u2019s back as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">III. Hoover\u2019s Report</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Fierra reviewed the report of Thomas O. Hoover, Ph.D., a psychologist, and adopted Hoover\u2019s assessment of twenty percent permanent psychiatric impairment. Consolidation alleges that Hoover\u2019s report, upon which Fierra relied, is so inconsistent that it should be disqualified from consideration. Specifically, Consolidation alleges that Hoover\u2019s assessment of a twenty percent permanent partial impairment contradicts his later statement that it was premature to declare that McDaniel had reached maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u201c[T]he non-examining physician is required to expressly accept all the findings of the examining physician, but not the opinion drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Wallace v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 55, 59, 11 O.O.3d 216, 219, 386 N.E.2d 1109, 1112. In the case at bar, it was up to Fierra to decide which conclusions to draw from Hoover\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">More important, in <em>State ex rel. Kaska v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 743, 591 N.E.2d 235, this court specifically held that permanency is not necessarily indicative of maximum medical improvement. In other words, a person can sustain a permanent injury, of which there is a component that will not heal and a component that will heal. Accordingly, a report that indicates that the injury is permanent and that indicates that it is \u201cpremature to assume that maximum medical improvement has been achieved\u201d is not inconsistent and can provide \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting a conclusion that someone is permanently disabled for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">In the case at bar, Hoover unequivocally stated that McDaniel\u2019s injury was permanent, but also indicated that he might have some room to heal. This does not preclude a finding of permanency. The fact that Fierra found permanent impairment based on Hoover\u2019s prediction of twenty percent permanency does not render Fierra\u2019s conclusion unsupported simply because he might sustain some further recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>IV. McDaniel\u2019s Stress Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Consolidation argues that the commission\u2019s order improperly stated that Fierra\u2019s report indicated that McDaniel must refrain from \u201cany jobs with more than <em>minimal </em>stress.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Consolidation also claims the order indicated that Fierra noted a <em>reduced </em>stress requirement. (Emphasis added.) Consolidation alleges that the commission\u2019s mischaracterization of Fierra\u2019s stress limitations changed its finding from light work ability to sedentary work ability and was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Consolidation\u2019s argument is flawed. In its order, the commission concluded that McDaniel was precluded \u201cfrom working in any jobs that require lifting more than 25 pounds or any jobs with more that [sic, than] minimal stress.\u201d The minimal stress limitation did not come from Fierra\u2019s report. Rather, the minimal stress limitation was a conclusion made by the commission from its review of McDaniel\u2019s history. Only after the commission determined that McDaniel was restricted from lifting over twenty-five pounds did it <em>add </em>the reduced stress limitation noted by Fierra to find that McDaniel was precluded from all but sedentary levels of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Thus, the commission\u2019s finding that McDaniel is limited to sedentary employment is supported by some evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">V. McDaniel\u2019s Ability to be Reemployed</p>\n<p id=\"Ap_\">The commission relied upon the reports of John Ruth, a vocational specialist, and Fierra. Consolidation claims that these reports do not constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s conclusion that McDaniel\u2019s work history and education preclude return to the work force.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Ruth\u2019s report provided that McDaniel, due to his ninth grade education and his work history, which is limited to manual labor, would not benefit from vocational retraining. In particular Ruth\u2019s report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">\u201cIn summary, it is clearly evident that this man would be unable to return to his former occupation due to range of motion limitations. Mr. McDaniel would require an occupation which he could perform primarily at bent height with the opportunity to sit or stand alternately. This man\u2019s educational skills and past work experience (laborer) may limit his job seeking potentials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Ruth also determined that \u201c[l]ack of educational skills, compounded by the fact that this man does not possess any saleable skill development (Laborer) it is believed that he will have extreme difficulty seeking competitive employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYv\">Fierra concluded that McDaniel has a sixty percent total body impairment from the combined effects of all three injuries precluding him from bending, from pushing or pulling heavy objects, from repetitively lifting of objects over twenty-five pounds and various other specific physical activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The commission considered McDaniel\u2019s physical limitations and his reduced stress limitation due to his depressive state and concluded that McDaniel is precluded from all but sedentary levels of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Based on the aforementioned, there is \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s finding that McDaniel cannot return to the work force.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Pursuant to the aforementioned analyses, we find that there is some evidence to support the commission\u2019s order. <em>Burley, supra. </em>Therefore, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed, and the writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-8\">Moyer, C.J., F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Cook, <em>JJ., </em>concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b543-9\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
