Sterner </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 164, 167, 672 N.E.2d 633, 635; <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. Michaels </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 645, 647, 665 N.E.2d 676, 677; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Connaughton </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 644, 645, 665 N.E.2d 675, 676. Here respondent obtained fees by padding client bills with hours not worked. These actions, which were the basis for respondent\u2019s criminal conviction for theft in office and grand theft, are equivalent to misappropriation of the funds of a client and alone would warrant respondent\u2019s disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In addition, respondent lied to the Ohio Department of Liquor Control on several occasions. As we said in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Greene </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 13, 16, 655 N.E.2d 1299, 1301, \u201c[this court] cannot permit attorneys who lie either to their clients or to the court to continue practicing law without interruption.\u201d See, also, <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 187, 190-191, 658 N.E.2d 237, 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Moreover, when appearing before the Ohio Hazardous Waste Facility Board, respondent engaged in contemptuous, undignified, and discourteous conduct. We recognize that an attorney must zealously represent his client, but we also recognize that an attorney has a duty to be civil to opposing counsel and the court. Respondent\u2019s bullying tactics toward witnesses, opposing counsel, and the board that are revealed in the record of this hearing have no place in our jurisprudence. As we said in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Trumbo </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 369, 373, 667 N.E.2d 1186, 1188, \u201crespect for the law and our legal system is the <em>sine qua non </em>of [the] right to continue on the rolls\u201d of those admitted to practice law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Respondent is hereby disbarred. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-8\">Moyer, C.J., Tyack, Resnick, F.E.
