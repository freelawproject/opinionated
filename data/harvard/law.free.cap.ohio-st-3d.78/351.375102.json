Relator\u2019s first objection is that the board erred in finding that the relator did not file an amended complaint adding a DR 1-102(A)(4) violation to count one. Relator\u2019s next objection is that the board erred in failing to find a DR 9-101(C) violation under the facts presented at the hearings. Because of a lack of clear and convincing evidence to support either violation, we overrule both the relator\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>We adopt the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the board, but impose a more stringent sanction of a one-year suspension from the practice of law based on the gravity of respondent\u2019s disciplinary violations.
