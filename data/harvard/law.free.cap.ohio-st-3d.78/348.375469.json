Sterner </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 164, 167, 672 N.E.2d 633, 635, and cases cited therein. The facts in this case not only parallel those in <em>Sterner, </em>namely, a continued pattern of stealing from clients and neglect of client interests, but, as in <em>Sterner, </em>the respondent also seeks to mitigate the severity of any sanction by reference to his psychological condition unsupported by properly admitted expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">Moreover, the respondent engaged in a continuing course of deceit and misrepresentation to both clients and the court. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 187, 190, 658 N.E.2d 237, 239, we said, \u201cSuch conduct strikes at the very core of a lawyer\u2019s relationship with the court and with the client. Respect for our profession is diminished with every deceitful act of a lawyer. We cannot expect citizens to trust that lawyers are honest if we have not sanctioned those who are not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">The function of a disciplinary action as we said in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Trumbo </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 369, 372, 667 N.E.2d 1186, 1188, is to determine \u201c \u2018whether a [person] whom [we] have formerly admitted, is a proper person to be continued on the roll or not.\u2019 \u201d Respondent has demonstrated by his actions that he is not a proper person to be continued on the roll of those licensed to practice law. Respondent is hereby permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio.
