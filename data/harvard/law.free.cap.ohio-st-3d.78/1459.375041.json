This cause is pending before the court as a cross-appeal from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. It appears from the records of this court that cross-appellant has not filed a brief, due March 31, 1997, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"AD4\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that this cause be, and hereby is, dismissed <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
