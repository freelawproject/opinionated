Respondent represented the lender in this case, but his arrangement with the parties enabled him to receive a fee from the borrower for each loan made by the lender. Despite the fact that the lender independently decided to make each loan, this arrangement put respondent in a position where he could profit by withholding information from or exercising influence on the lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">A lawyer should avoid even the appearance of impropriety and the implication that his professional judgment on behalf of a client could be affected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>lawyer\u2019s own interests. Respondent is therefore suspended for one year from the practice of law. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b467-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
