No. 1. This statute gives the commission broad discretion with regard to requiring a claimant to submit to medical examinations. <em>State ex rel. Anderson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 9 OBR 456, 459, 459 N.E.2d 548, 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">The commission\u2019s discretion under former R.C. 4123.53, however, is not unlimited. While former R.C. 4123.53 imposes no specific limit on the number of medical examinations that the commission may schedule, on any given issue, neither does it permit the commission to act in an unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable fashion in its determination to schedule them. Propriety, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>aggregation, is the polestar of discretion in this case. Indeed, the very concept of discretion connotes action taken in light of reason, and bounded by the rules and principles of law. Discretion is not the indulgence of administrative whim, but the exercise of sound judgment. It is a privilege of decision-making, not to be placed ahead of the responsibility to act fairly and judiciously. Thus, as in other matters, the commission must exercise its discretion with regard to requiring a claimant to submit to medical examinations \u201csoundly and within legal bounds.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 57, 62, 67 O.O.2d 74, 77, 310 N.E.2d 240, 244; <em>Copperweld Steel Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1944), 142 Ohio St. 439, 445, 27 O.O. 376, 378, 52 N.E.2d 735, 737-738.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the commission abuses its discretion under former R.C. 4123.53 where the record fails to disclose that additional medical examinations are necessary or of assistance in determining PTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The commission argues that it had \u201csound reasons for its course of action in this matter.\u201d Since the claimant\u2019s complaint is directed toward the medical activity which occurred \u201cafter the June 30, 1992 hearing,\u201d the court need only concern itself with the commission\u2019s reasons for referring claimant to psychologist Dr. Shaffer for examination and the claim file to Dr. Holbrook for a combined-effects review.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The commission claims that the additional psychological examination by Dr. Shaffer was necessary because Dr. Bonds \u201caddressed a non-allowed psychological condition in his report. Thus, his report could not be used as evidence in this matter.\u201d The commission explains that Dr. Bonds took \u201cinto account a chronic pain syndrome which was never recognized as an allowed condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">With all due respect to the commission, nowhere in his report does Dr. Bonds even mention a \u201cchronic pain syndrome.\u201d The only reference to \u201cchronic pain\u201d is made in conjunction with claimant\u2019s <em>complaints. </em>At no time does Dr. Bonds purport to elevate such complaints to the level of a \u201csyndrome,\u201d \u201ccondition,\u201d or any such degree of recognition, let alone rely upon it in rendering his opinion. Instead, he very carefully and appropriately based his opinions solely on claimant\u2019s allowed psychological injuries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-8\">\u201c(1) <em>the claimant\u2019s industrial injuries[] i.e., excerbation [sic] of pre-existing dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and psychological factors affecting physical condition, </em>prevent her from returning to her former position of employment. Her condition is permanent and the degree of permanent impairment resulting from the industrial accident is 20% of the body as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-9\">\u201c(2) the claimant\u2019s <em>industrial injuries </em>do prohibit her from engaging in any sustained remunerative employment. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Dr. Bonds did not address \u201ca non-allowed psychological condition in his report\u201d or take \u201cinto account\u201d anything other than claimant\u2019s allowed psychological injuries in rendering his opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The commission next argues that Dr. Louis \u201cconcluded that [claimant] was limited to sedentary work but documented minimal impairment. Then Dr. Gibson did a combined effects review. * * * He equated a forty percent impairment with permanent total impairment. In doing so contradictory conclusions deprived his report of its evidentiary value. * * * Rather than proceed with such defective evidence, the Industrial Commission chose to solve the problem prior to making its ultimate decision.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The commission\u2019s reasoning with regard to the report of Dr. Louis is arbitrary. The commission\u2019s order was \u201cbased particularly upon the report(s) of Dr(s). Louis * * Indeed, the very finding made by the commission based on Dr. Louis\u2019s report.was that claimant \u201cis physically capable of engaging in some sustained remunerative employment.\u201d This report also helped to form the basis for the commission\u2019s conclusion that \u201cclaimant possesses the medical capacity to engage in a number of sedentary or light duty employment opportunities.\u201d In fact, the commission\u2019s order actually accepts Dr. Louis\u2019s findings with respect to <em>both </em>claimant\u2019s PPI <em>and </em>physical ability to work, which are the very \u201cdefects\u201d the commission purportedly sought to remedy. In a feat of twisted logic, the commission has managed to argue that an additional psychological examination and combined-effects review were justified on the basis of a purportedly \u201cdefective\u201d report going to claimant\u2019s physical capabilities upon which the commission ultimately relied in denying PTD compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Moreover, there is no inherent contradiction between a twenty-percent impairment rating and a sedentary work restriction. See <em>State ex rel. Koonce v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 436, 633 N.E.2d 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">As to Dr. Gibson, his report explains that \u201c[psychologically, claimant * * * cannot return to any gainful sustained remunerative employment now, or in the foreseeable future. Psychiatric evaluation of impairment, <em>even with low to moderate percentage values, </em>point to the total and permanent nature of her condition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is in this context that Dr. Gibson subsequently concluded that claimant \u201cis totally and permanently impaired.\u201d The commission is acutely aware that the assessment of a PPI percentage is a medical issue distinct from that of claimant\u2019s ability to engage in sustained remunerative employment based on her industrial injuries. Otherwise, it would not direct its medical specialists to assign a PPI percentage and then go on to make a medical determination of claimant\u2019s ability to engage in sustained remunerative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>In light of the foregoing, it must be concluded that the commission abused its discretion when it decided at the June 30, 1992 PTD hearing to schedule a third psychological examination followed by another combined-effects review.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The commission also argues that claimant \u201csat on her right to challenge the examining physician\u2019s opinion. She failed to exercise her right to depose the examining physicians involved. * * * Nor does the record indicate [that claimant] made any attempt to challenge or thwart such examinations at the time they were conducted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The only \u201cexamining physician\u2019s opinion\u201d that is challenged by claimant is that of Dr. Shaffer. However, the commission misconstrues the nature of the challenge. Claimant\u2019s challenge goes not to the propriety of Dr. Shaffer\u2019s opinion itself, but to the commission\u2019s order requiring the claimant to submit to the examination in the first place. We fail to see how deposing Dr. Shaffer has anything to do with the commission\u2019s decision to schedule the examination. Moreover, former R.C. 4123.53 (now R.C. 4123.53[C]) provided, \u201cIf such employee refuses to submit to any such examination or obstructs the same, his right to have his claim for compensation considered * * * shall be suspended during the period of such refusal or obstruction.\u201d The commission cites no authority for the proposition that a claimant must make the Hobson\u2019s choice of waiving her challenge or having her right to consideration suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Once the reports of Drs. Shaffer and Holbrook are stricken from evidentiary consideration, the only conclusion that can be reached is to grant relief consistent with <em>Gay. </em>All the remaining evidence unanimously indicates that the claimant is psychologically unable to engage in any sustained remunerative employment or participate in any rehabilitative program that would return her to gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b877-10\">Douglas, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b877-11\">Moyer, C.J., Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-11\">. Claimant phrases her challenge in constitutional terms, and accuses the commission of repeatedly examining her in an effort to \u201cmanufacture\u201d some evidence upon which to deny her application for PTD compensation. Claimant alleges that the commission \u201chas engaged in a pattern of manufacturing evidence with a view towards denying permanent total disability compensation,\u201d citing two unreported appellate cases with facts similar to those presently before the court. Such grandiose remonstrations need not be addressed. The gravamen of claimant\u2019s challenge is simply that the commission abused its discretion when it decided at the June 30, 1992 PTD hearing to schedule a third psychological examination followed by another combined-effects review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b877-12\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ald\">dissenting.
