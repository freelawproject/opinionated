V(11)(F)(4) states that when an attorney is disciplined in another jurisdiction, this court \u201cshall impose the identical or comparable discipline imposed in the other jurisdiction, unless the attorney proves * * * (b) [t]hat the misconduct established warrants substantially different discipline in Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">As both respondent\u2019s former counsel and present counsel point out in their respective filings, a disbarment under Florida State Bar Rule 3 \u2014 5.1(f) permits the respondent to apply for readmission at any time after November 18, 1998, five years from the effective date of his Florida disbarment. In contrast, disbarment under Ohio\u2019s Gov.Bar R. V(6)(C) would bar respondent from ever being readmitted to the practice of law in Ohio. Thus, a Florida \u201cdisbarment\u201d is comparable to an Ohio \u201cindefinite suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Therefore, respondent is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio with permission to apply for readmission after November 18, 1998, if he has been readmitted to the practice of law in Florida. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-9\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
