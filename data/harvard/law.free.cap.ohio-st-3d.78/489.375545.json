Lipinski v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 655 N.E.2d 1303, 1305. Here, it appears uncontroverted that unless prevented, the common pleas court will conduct further proceedings in the underlying action. Therefore, the pertinent issues are whether the common pleas court\u2019s intended exercise of judicial authority is unauthorized and whether denying the writ will result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">Absent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a tribunal having general subject-matter jurisdiction of a case possesses authority to determine its own jurisdiction, and a party challenging its jurisdiction has an adequate remedy by postjudgment appeal from its holding that it has the requisite jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>Whitehall ex rel. Wolfe v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 120, 123-124, 656 N.E.2d 684, 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Conversely, appeal does not constitute an adequate remedy and does not bar extraordinary relief if the tribunal patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over the case. <em>State ex rel. Lewis v. Moser </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 25, 28, 647 N.E.2d 155, 157. Relators contend that the common pleas court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over the various claims raised by the intervening respondents. In addressing relators\u2019 argument, we need not expressly rule on these jurisdictional issues, since our review is limited to whether the common pleas court\u2019s jurisdiction is patently and unambiguously lacking. <em>State ex rel. Willacy v. Smith </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 47, 52, 676 N.E.2d 109, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\n<em>Patent and Unambiguous Lack of Jurisdiction: . Particular Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The intervening respondents alleged claims in mandamus, injunction, and declaratory judgment in the common pleas court that are premised on R.C. 3319.081, the Ohio Constitution, and Section 4(A) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133 (140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 336, 337). Relators do not deny that the common pleas court possesses basic statutory jurisdiction over actions in mandamus, injunction, and declaratory judgment. R.C. 2731.02, 2727.03, and 2721.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Instead, relators contend that the common pleas court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over the intervening respondents\u2019 action because their claims are within SERB\u2019S exclusive jurisdiction. If a party asserts claims that arise from or are dependent on the collective bargaining rights created by R.C. Chapter 4117, SERB possesses exclusive jurisdiction over the claims. <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 167, 572 N.E.2d 87, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. Therefore, a writ of prohibition will issue to prevent a common pleas court from exercising jurisdiction over a case which is patently and unambiguously within SERB\u2019S exclusive jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel. Fraternal Order of Police, Ohio Labor Council, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 287, 289-290, 667 N.E.2d 929, 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Relators rely on <em>Fraternal Order of Police </em>(1996) and <em>Vandaliar-Butler City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(Aug. 15, 1991), Montgomery App. No. 12517, unreported, 1991 WL 355161, to support their contention that the common pleas court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over the R.C. 3319.081 contract claims. In <em>Fraternal Order of Police, </em>the court granted a writ of prohibition to prevent a common pleas court from proceeding because the case involved claims arising from and dependent on existing collective bargaining agreements and conduct allegedly constituting unfair labor practices under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>4117.11. In <em>Vandalia-Butler, </em>the court of appeals affirmed a common pleas court\u2019s affirmance of a SERB order finding a board of education guilty of committing an unfair labor practice for implementing a final offer before an impasse had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Relators\u2019 reliance on these cases is misplaced. In <em>Fraternal Order of Police, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 287, 667 N.E.2d 929, the claims arose from an existing collective bargaining agreement. The agreement here, however, has expired. Similarly, despite relators\u2019 contentions to the contrary, <em>Vandalia-Butler </em>did not hold that an employer\u2019s validly implemented final offer following impasse constitutes a collective bargaining agreement \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d As the intervening respondents and the <em>amici curiae </em>note, a collective bargaining agreement must be approved by the employee organization, reduced to writing, and executed by the parties. R.C. 4117.09(A) and 4117.10(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Relators also assert that the common pleas court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over the intervening respondents\u2019 main claims of entitlement to employment contracts with the board pursuant to R.C. 3319.081 because the terms and conditions of employment were addressed in the expired collective bargaining agreement, negotiated to ultimate impasse, and specified in relators\u2019 implemented final offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">This assertion likewise lacks merit. R.C. 4117.10(A) provides that \u201c[w]here no agreement exists * * *, the public employer and public employees are subject to all applicable state or local laws or ordinances pertaining to the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment for public employees.\u201d Therefore, it is arguable that R.C. 3319.081 prevails where no collective bargaining agreement exists. <em>State ex rel. Internatl. Union of Operating Engineers v. Cleveland </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 537, 584 N.E.2d 727 (Mandamus lies to resolve a wage dispute by compelling compliance with a city charter provision pursuant to R.C. 4117.10[A], when no collective bargaining agreement exists.); <em>State ex rel. Boggs v. Springfield Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 94, 95-96, 647 N.E.2d 788, 791 (Mandamus action to compel a board of education to recognize continuing and limited contracts of bus drivers after implementation of final offer following impasse under R.C. 3319.081 <em>et seq. </em>alleges sufficient facts to preclude dismissal for failure to state claim upon which relief can be granted.); see, also, <em>State ex rel. Chavis v. Sycamore City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 26, 29, 641 N.E.2d 188, 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">If a party asserts rights that are independent of R.C. Chapter 4117, the party\u2019s complaint may properly be heard in common pleas court. <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn., supra, </em>59 Ohio St.3d 167, 572 N.E.2d 87, at paragraph two of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the syllabus. The intervening respondents\u2019 R.C. 3319.081 contract claims do not necessarily arise from or depend <em>on </em>R.C. Chapter 4117-collective bargaining rights. Consequently, the common pleas court does not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction over these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The common pleas court also does not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction over the intervening respondents\u2019 constitutional claims. SERB, like other administrative agencies, does not have jurisdiction to determine these claims. <em>State ex rel. Columbus S. Power Co. v. Sheward </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 78, 81, 585 N.E.2d 380, 382 (\u201cIt is settled that an administrative agency is without jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of a statute.\u201d); <em>Fairview Gen. Hosp. v. Fletcher </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 146, 150, 586 N.E.2d 80, 83 (\u201c[A] plaintiff cannot initially challenge the legal authority of SERB under Ohio\u2019s collective bargaining statutes through a declaratory judgment action unless the validity or constitutionality of the statute is raised.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The remaining claim in the common pleas court action involves the union\u2019s contention that the board violated Section 4(A) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133 (140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 336, 337) by altering the deemed certified collective bargaining unit when it attempted to subcontract bus service. Under Section 4(A) of Am.Sub. S.B. No. 133, \u201cadjustments or alterations to deemed certified collective bargaining units are not permitted until challenged by another employee organization.\u201d <em>Ohio Council 8, Am. Fedn. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emp., AFL-CIO v. Cincinnati </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 677, 635 N.E.2d 361, syllabus. As intervening respondents concede, they raised this claim in their unfair labor practice charge ultimately dismissed by SERB, and the common pleas court\u2019s jurisdiction over this claim is a \u201cgray area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Nevertheless, Section 4(A) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133 arguably confers a right independent of R.C. Chapter 4117. This section is not codified as part of the Ohio Collective Bargaining Act and depends on collective bargaining relationships predating the enactment of R.C. Chapter 4117 rather than rights created by that chapter. See <em>State ex rel. Brecksville Edn. Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 665, 666, 660 N.E.2d 1199, 1200, fn. 1; <em>State ex rel. Alben v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 133, 136, 666 N.E.2d 1119, 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Therefore, although this presents a closer question than the other claims, the common pleas court also does not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction over the Section 4(A) claim. Based on the foregoing, relators are not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>a writ of prohibition to prevent the common pleas court from proceeding in the underlying action. Accordingly, we deny the writ.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AgiJ\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b857-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Since relators are not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief, respondents\u2019 motions to strike certain evidence are moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
