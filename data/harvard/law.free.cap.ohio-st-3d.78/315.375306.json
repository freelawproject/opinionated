An attorney\u2019s disclosure of client confidences has heretofore warranted a public reprimand. <em>Geauga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Psenicka </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 35, 577 N.E.2d 1074. Although in this case respondent\u2019s disclosure was inadvertent, respondent\u2019s negligence enabled a son to discover that he was to be disinherited by his parents, one of whom was still living.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">In addition, the board found that respondent\u2019s mailing was a \u201ctargeted mailing\u201d and, as such, was subject to the restrictions of DR 2 \u2014 101(F)(2)(e). That rule reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-13\">\u201cA lawyer or law firm may engage in written solicitation by direct mail addressed to persons or groups of persons who may be in need to specific legal service * * *, provided the letter of solicitation * * * (e) Includes in its text and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>on the envelope in which mailed, in red ink and in type no smaller than 10 point, the recital \u2014 \u2018ADVERTISEMENT ONLY.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We adopted DR 2-101(F)(2), directed to \u201ctargeted mailings,\u201d in response to <em>Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Assn. </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 466, 108 S.Ct. 1916, 100 L.Ed.2d 475, which held that direct mail by an attorney targeted to specific recipients knowing they are likely to need a particular legal service offered by the attorney is constitutionally protected commercial speech. A Disciplinary Rule such as the one in DR 2-101(F)(2) was specifically considered in <em>Florida Bar v. Herrick </em>(Fla.1990), 571 So.2d 1303, certiorari denied (1991), 501 U.S. 1205, 111 S.Ct. 2798, 115 L.Ed.2d 972. In that case, the Florida Supreme Court publicly reprimanded a lawyer who mailed unsolicited letters not marked as advertising to prospective clients. In <em>Matter of Anonymous </em>(Ind.1994), 630 N.E.2d 212, 215, the Indiana Supreme Court, faced with a similar situation, sanctioned the attorneys with a private reprimand \u201cbased on the unique circumstances and factors in mitigation present in these cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Respondent not only \u201ctargeted\u201d his mailing, but through the conveniences of computer programming, he also was able to \u201cpersonalize\u201d it, that is, address it to the particular recipient with a comment (albeit erroneous in this case) about \u201cyour parent(s).\u201d As the United States Supreme Court said in <em>Shapero </em>at 476, 108 S.Ct. at 1923,100 L.Ed.2d at 486:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201c[A] letter that is personalized (not merely targeted) to the recipient presents an increased risk of deception, intentional or inadvertent. It could, in certain circumstances, lead the recipient to overestimate the lawyer\u2019s familiarity with the case or could implicitly suggest that the recipient\u2019s legal problem is more dire than it really is. * * * Similarly, an inaccurately targeted letter could lead the recipient to believe she has a legal problem that she does not actually have * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded. Costs taxed to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b680-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b680-11\">Cook, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b680-12\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AgV\">dissenting. I believe that respondent\u2019s conduct warrants a more severe sanction than a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">The public, and particularly the elderly public, is vulnerable to the tactics employed by this respondent. See, generally, Note, Client Outreach 101: Solicitation of Elderly Clients by Seminar under the Model Rules of Professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Conduct (1994), 62 Fordham L.Rev. 1547. Accordingly, it is this court\u2019s responsibility to promulgate and enforce \u201cprophylactic regulation in furtherance of the State\u2019s interest in protecting the lay public.\u201d <em>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn. </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 447, 468, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 1925, 56 L.Ed.2d 444, 461, rehearing denied (1978), 439 U.S. 883, 99 S.Ct. 226, 58 L.Ed.2d 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Our Code of Professional Responsibility limits the manner in which an attorney may solicit clients. Respondent exceeded several of those limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The mailing at issue was designed to generate traffic for respondent\u2019s living trust seminars. It was blindly sent as part of a mass mailing without regard to the recipient\u2019s individual circumstance. In all, respondent sent two hundred fifty mailings of similar content.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">To induce seminar attendance, respondent improperly personalized the mailing, directing it toward the recipient\u2019s sense of responsibility stemming from being named successor trustee. See DR 2-101(F)(2)(b). In fact, the language and tone of the mailing misleadingly suggested that attendance was necessary for a trustee to faithfully discharge his duties under the trust. See DR 2-101(A)(l). Further, without permission of his clients, the respondent (two hundred fifty times) disclosed client confidences in pursuit of personal advantage. See DR 4-101(B)(1) and (3). By disclosing terms of his clients\u2019 trusts, the respondent not only increased his potential client base, but also used a relative\u2019s creation of a living trust to advance the general wisdom of that estate planning tactic.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">The mailing was also misleading in other ways. Respondent encouraged the recipient of the mailing to attend his seminar to determine \u201cwhether a Living Trust makes sense for you.\u201d He implied that a living trust would benefit the recipient in any case, however, by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">\u201c[E]veryone, regardless of their age, who owns real property, should consider a Living Trust for themselves. <em>You may not realize it but your estate will eventually be controlled by your will, your attorney and the probate court, unless you consider a logical alternative. This alternative is a Living Trust.\u201d </em>(Emphasis and bold type <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Respondent\u2019s mailing also discounted the size of one\u2019s estate as an appropriate factor to consider before establishing a living trust, by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">\u201cWhile trusts have been around for decades, many individuals and their attorneys have perceived trusts to be suitable only for the very rich. Fortunately, in recent years, several area attorneys have started to educate the general public as to the advantages of using Living Trusts to avoid Probate for families and individuals with modest estates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Because of the scope of respondent\u2019s disregard for the principles embodied in our Code of Professional Responsibility regarding client solicitation, I would suspend him from the practice of law for six months.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
