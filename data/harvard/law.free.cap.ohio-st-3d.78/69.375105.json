For that neglect respondent deserves a public reprimand. However, we disagree with the board and do not find it clear and convincing that respondent violated DR 6-102 (attempting to exonerate himself from or limit his liability to his client for his personal malpractice) when, as a part of the settlement of the Kerekis\u2019 malpractice action, he attempted to insulate himself from a disciplinary proceeding. Disciplinary proceedings are not actions for malpractice. Respondent\u2019s actions may have violated DR 1-102(A)(2) (cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>cumvent a Disciplinary Rule through actions of another), but respondent was not charged with such a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-8\">Resnick, F.E.

Because respondent failed to advise the Kerekis that their case had been dismissed, lied when they confronted him, and even when challenged as to the truthfulness of his assertion conceded only that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that the case had been dismissed, he should be actually suspended from the practice of law.
