For the reasons that follow, we find that it did not, and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Voluntary abandonment of the former position of employment can bar temporary total disability compensation. <em>State ex rel. Rockwell Internatl. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 44, 531 N.E.2d 678. In this instance, the timing of Superior\u2019s assertion of this defense and submission of supporting evidence forecloses further evidentiary review on our part.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Superior\u2019s did not specifically allege that claimant had voluntarily abandoned his former position of employment until the December 10, 1992 staff hearing. Superior\u2019s did not, however, submit evidence in support of this allegation at that time. The staff hearing officers did not, therefore, abuse their discretion in finding \u201cinsufficient evidence that Claimant voluntarily abandoned his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The commission also did not abuse its discretion in failing to vacate that determination in response to the motion for rehearing of Superior\u2019s. A rehearing is not mandatory. Contrary to the suggestion of Superior\u2019s, its newly submitted evidence did not compel rehearing and a denial of compensation. The commission found that Superior\u2019s did not satisfy the prerequisites necessary for further administrative review. Such a determination was within the commission\u2019s sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Superior\u2019s secondarily argues that the timing of its evidentiary submission was irrelevant, since the burden of proof was on the claimant to establish his entitlement to temporary total disability compensation. We interpret this argument to mean that in addition to fulfilling the criteria set forth in <em>State ex rel. Ramirez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586, the claimant must disprove every conceivable basis for denying compensation. We do not impose a burden on the commission to deny every potential basis for compensation <em>(State ex rel. Brady v. Indus. Comm. </em>[1986], 28 Ohio St.3d 241, 28 OBR 322, 503 N.E.2d 173), nor will we impose the same kind of burden now upon the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">The commission\u2019s award of temporary total disability compensation was supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d \u2014 Dr. Porter\u2019s C85A certification. The commission\u2019s order also adequately explained why the assertion of Superior\u2019s that claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>voluntarily abandoned his former position of employment was rejected. No more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b774-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
