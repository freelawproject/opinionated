From a review of the record we can understand the factors which caused respondent to neglect his professional duty to his clients. Nevertheless, we have a constitutional duty to oversee the conduct of the legal profession in' Ohio, and we cannot condone respondent\u2019s failures to meet his responsibilities. An attorney\u2019s failure to carry out a legal matter entrusted to him and failure to cooperate in the ensuing disciplinary investigation have warranted suspension from the practice of law. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Leibold </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 128, 559 N.E.2d 749. In a previous case where we found that rehabilitation was as much or more appropriate than discipline, we imposed a sanction of indefinite suspension. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Trumbo </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 369, 667 N.E.2d 1186. We believe the same sanction is appropriate here. Respondent is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
