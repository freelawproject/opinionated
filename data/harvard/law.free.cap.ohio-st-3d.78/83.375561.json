Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALA\">The issue before this court is whether natural-gas pipeline companies which are classified as public utilities can use a unit-appraisal method to determine the true value of their taxable personal property absent special or unusual circumstances, or whether R.C. 5727.11 requires the use of a cost-based method of valuation. For the reasons that follow, we find that R.C. 5727.11 does not preclude the use of a unit-appraisal method and, where true value is being contested, there need not be a finding of special or unusual circumstances. Accordingly, we affirm the decisions of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The commissioner argues that R.C. 5727.11 expressly requires use of a cost-based method of calculating the value of a public utility\u2019s taxable personal property and that an alternate unit-appraisal valuation method may not be used absent a showing of special or unusual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">R.C. 5727.10 mandates that \u201cthe tax commissioner shall determine, in accordance with section 5727.11 of the Revised Code, the <em>true value in money </em>of all taxable property * * * to be assessed by the commissioner. * * * The commissioner <em>shall be guided </em>by the information contained in the report filed by the public utility <em>and such other evidence </em>and rules as will enable him to make these determinations.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">R.C. 5727.11(B) further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">\u201c[T]he true value of all taxable property * * * to be assessed by the tax commissioner shall be determined by a method of valuation using cost as capitalized on the public utility\u2019s books and records less composite annual allowances as prescribed by the commissioner. <em>If the commissioner finds that application of this method mil not result in the determination of true value of the public utility\u2019s taxable property, he may use another method of valuation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Although R.C. 5727.11 identifies the cost-based method of valuation as a means of assessing true value, the General Assembly has not restricted the commissioner\u2019s use of alternate valuation methods. In fact, in these statutes, the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Assembly specifically states that the commissioner may use \u201canother method of valuation\u201d and that he may consider \u201cother evidence\u201d to determine true value. Contrary to the commissioner\u2019s assertion, in deciding true value, the BTA need not adhere to the cost-based statutory method of valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The commissioner also argues that in order to apply alternate valuation methods, there must be a showing of \u201cspecial or unusual circumstances.\u201d The commissioner\u2019s reference to \u201cspecial or unusual circumstances\u201d stems from language found in his \u201c302\u201d directive for determination of depreciation rates for general personal property. However, the words \u201cspecial or unusual circumstances\u201d do not appear in R.C. 5727.11 and are not a prerequisite for using an alternate valuation method where appellees are contesting true value rather than depreciation rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The ultimate goal imposed by R.C. 5727.10 clearly is to determine the <em>true value </em>of the property taxed. <em>R.H. Macy Co., Inc. v. Schneider </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 94, 97, 26 O.O.2d 440, 441, 197 N.E.2d 807, 809. If the statutory method does not yield true value, then another method of valuation may be used, whether or not there are special or unusual circumstances. Although a statute may provide a prima facie estimate or presumption of value, where rigid application of the statute would be inappropriate, the presumption of value must yield to other competent evidence reflecting true value. <em>Monsanto Co. v. Lindley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 59, 61, 10 O.O.3d 113, 114, 381 N.E.2d 939, 941; <em>W.L. Harper Co. v. Peck </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 300, 53 O.O.178, 118 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">' Turning to the facts of these cases, to challenge the statutory valuations of the commissioner, appellees submitted the unit appraisals of expert Tegarden as evidence of the properties\u2019 true value. The commissioner presented no evidence to refute Tegarden\u2019s underlying assumptions. The BTA accepted Tegarden\u2019s unit appraisals as being more accurate in determining true value than the statutory method imposed by the commissioner. In reaching this conclusion, the BTA weighed the evidence and found that the value presented by appellees was sufficient to overcome the prima facie presumption of true value accorded to the statutory method.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The BTA is vested with the discretion to determine the weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Cardinal Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 13, 73 O.O.2d 83, 336 N.E.2d 433, paragraph three of the syllabus. This court will not substitute its judgment for that of the BTA on factual issues (including a determination of true value) unless it affirmatively appears from the record that such decisions are unreasonable or unlawful. <em>R.R.Z. Assoc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 198, 201, 527 N.E.2d 874, 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>In this case, we find that the BTA\u2019s decisions are reasonable and lawful; and they are hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\n<em>Decisions affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-6\">Resnick, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b449-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas and Cook, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b449-8\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Avr\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. Am. Sub. S.B. No. 156 enacted R.C. 5727.11 to prescribe the capitalized-cost formula for the Tax Commissioner\u2019s appraisal of the true value of tangible personal property held by a public utility. (143 Ohio Laws, Part I, 891, 909-910.) The statute allows the Tax Commissioner to use an alternative method of valuation only if the cost method does not result in true value. R.C. 5727.11(B). It remains the taxpayer\u2019s burden to demonstrate that application of the statutory formula does not result in true value. <em>Snider v. Limbach </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 200, 542 N.E.2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the applicable law, a taxpayer may successfully contest application of the statutory formula by demonstrating that another valuation method produces different results. By such reasoning, disparity in the accounting-method computations constitutes evidence that application of the statutory formula does not result in true value. The factfinder is then left to choose which accounting method is preferable in arriving at true value.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">By permitting taxpayers to attack the statutory formula as flawed, as opposed to arguing that specific factors make application of the statutory formula inappropriate for valuation of their property, the majority has rendered meaningless the General Assembly\u2019s choice of accounting methods to establish true value.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">The BTA\u2019s conclusion here has at its root a preconception that, as applied to interstate pipelines, the income-approach analysis is a better measure of true value than the statutory formula based on cost. The General Assembly could have chosen a unit method of appraisal based primarily on the income approach, but chose the current statutory formula as a better estimation of true value. It is not the place of the BTA or this court to override that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Because the BTA\u2019s rejection of the Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination is founded on the concept that a unit appraisal is a better measure of the true value of tangible personal property held by a public utility than the statutory formula, its decision is unreasonable and unlawful. Further, inspection of the \u201cspecial or unusual circumstances\u201d alternatively relied on by the BTA reveals that it is the statutory valuation method and not a particular quirk in the application of that method to this case that the BTA finds inappropriate. Accordingly, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>reverse the decisions of the BTA and reinstate the commissioner\u2019s determination in case Nos. 95-1514 and 95-1515.</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-5\">Moyer, C.J., and Douglas, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
