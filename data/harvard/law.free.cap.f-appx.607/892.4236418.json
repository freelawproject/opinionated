After review, we affirm in part, and vacate and remand so that the district court can enter a new judgment dismissing certain claims without prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Defendant Steve Mateyka is a code enforcement officer with the Defendant City of Tampa Code Enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Washington\u2019s complaint alleged these facts. On August 27, 2013, Washington\u2019s husband encountered Defendant Mateyka, whose city vehicle was blocking Washington\u2019s driveway. Believing Defendant Ma-teyka\u2019s conduct was harassing and intimidating, the Washingtons subsequently filed an ethics complaint against Defendant Ma-teyka. The City of Tampa\u2019s Ethics Commission eventually concluded that there was no probable cause to believe that an ethics violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">On October 3, 2013, while the Washing-tons\u2019 ethics complaint was still pending, Defendant Mateyka inspected some property Plaintiff Washington owned, known as Al Moroe Humanity Park, at 2113 North Freemont Avenue in the City of Tampa. Washington identifies herself as a \u201csovereign Moorish National,\u201d and she and her \u201cfellow Moorish nationals\u201d practice their Islamic faith every Sunday at Al Moroc Humanity Park. Washington placed a sign in the park, which she avers \u201cdisplays [her] religious rights and the constitutional right to peaceful assembly.\u201d Defendant Mateyka cited Washington for displaying unpermitted signs, building without a permit, and failing to obtain a special use permit to operate a private recreational facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">At an April 2, 2014 hearing regarding the citations, Washington made a \u201cspecial appearance\u201d to challenge the jurisdiction of the City\u2019s special magistrate, Alex Dun-mire. Washington argued that as an \u201cIndigenous/Aboriginal Free Moorish National\u201d she was not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the Florida Statutes. A code enforcement officer, not Defendant Matey-ka, testified that the code violations were still present on Washington\u2019s property. Washington objected to Defendant Matey-ka not being present so she could cross-examine him. Washington declined to present her own evidence or to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty, still contending that the special magistrate lacked jurisdiction over her as a Moorish National.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">At the conclusion of the healing, the special magistrate found Washington guilty of the code violations. Specifically, the special magistrate found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-11\">That the following violations of the City of Tampa Code are found to still exist: Failure to apply for a Special use to operate as a recreational facility. All signage must be permitted. Failure to obtain the proper permits and zoning approval. For compliance this will require everything that was built and installed to be removed from the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">The special magistrate gave Washington until April 30, 2014 to correct the code violations, after which a fine of $100 per day would be imposed. The special magistrate authorized the city clerk to place a lien on all real property owned by Washington, except homestead property, if Washington failed to correct the code violations on time and to foreclose the lien if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>any amount remained unpaid after three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">B. Washington\u2019s Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">As noted above, Washington\u2019s complaint named two defendants, Steve Mateyka, the code enforcement officer who originally inspected and cited Washington\u2019s property, and the City of Tampa Code Enforcement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint alleged violations of Washington\u2019s First, Fourth, and Ninth Amendment rights, stating that the Defendants were trying to \u201cstop [her] from exercising a fundamental right\u201d to associate \u201cwith fellow Moorish nationals.\u201d Washington also claimed that her due process rights were violated at the code enforcement hearing because she was unable to cross-examine Defendant Mateyka and because the special magistrate \u201cnever proved jurisdiction\u201d and called the hearing a \u201cquasi\u201d hearing, and thus had no authority to issue the lien or determine Washington\u2019s guilt regarding the code violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Washington further alleged the Defendants violated RLUIPA by trying to \u201cdisband [her] fellowship by citing counterfeit ordinance violations and placing a lien on [her] properties.\u201d Specifically, Washington alleged that, for purposes of RLUIPA: (1) the Defendants constitute a \u201cgovernment\u201d; (2) A1 Moroc Humanity Park is a \u201creligious assembly or institution\u201d; (3) Washington\u2019s use of A1 Moroc Humanity Park is \u201creligious exercise\u201d; (4) Defendants \u201ccurrently allow[] other religious and nonreligious assemblies and institutions to operate in residential districts without being subjected to any enforcement action for such violation\u201d; (5) the \u201cfiling of violations and placing a lien against Nura Washington Bey and A1 Mor-oc Humanity Park\u201d is an \u201c \u2018application\u2019 of a \u2018land use regulation\u2019 that \u2018limits or restricts a claimants use or development of land (including a structure affixed to land)\u2019 \u201d; (6) Defendants\u2019 \u201cactions to prevent organized religious services from taking place on the property constitute the \u2018imposition or implementation\u2019 of a land use regulation\u201d that treats Washington \u201con less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution\u201d; and (7) Defendants\u2019 \u201cactions to prevent organized religious services from taking place on the A1 Moroc Humanity Park property constitute the \u2018imposition or implementation\u2019 of a land use regulation that discriminates and continues to discriminate against Nura Washington Bey on the basis of religion .... \u201d The complaint requested nine million dollars in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">II. GENERAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiffs complaint \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 </em>U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). For a claim to be facially plausible, the complaint must plead \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA pleading that offers labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Nor does a complaint suffice if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation, brackets, and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">\u201cWhile legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679, 129 S.Ct. at 1950. Further, although we must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, \u201cwe are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1249-50 (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">III. WASHINGTON\u2019S CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">A. First Amendment Claims Under \u00a7 1988</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">To state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983,-the plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to establish that (1) she was deprived of a federal right (2) by a person acting under the color of state law. <em>Bingham v. Thomas, </em>654 F.3d 1171, 1175 (11th Cir.2011).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Washington\u2019s complaint alleged that the Defendants\u2019 actions in enforcing the City of Tampa\u2019s code violated her First Amendment rights to exercise her religion and to assemble.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At a minimum, to state a First Amendment claim, a plaintiff must allege that her First Amendment rights were impermissibly burdened in some way. <em>See, e.g., GeorgiaCarry.Org, Inc. v. Georgia, </em>687 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir.2012) (freedom of religion); <em>Bourgeois v. Peters, </em>387 F.3d 1303, 1316-17 (11th Cir.2004) (freedoms of association, speech, and assembly).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">'Although Washington\u2019s complaint alleged that she was cited for violating several City of Tampa land use ordinances and was ordered to correct those violations or face fines and the possibility of a lien, she did not allege any facts showing how those actions burdened her religious or associational rights. Washington did not allege that she had applied for and was denied the permits, that she was not actually required by the ordinances to obtain the permits, or that she corrected the code violations prior to the code enforcement hearing. Indeed, at the code enforcement hearing, Washington did not dispute the existence of the code violations, opting instead to argue that her status as a Moorish National placed her outside the special magistrate\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Instead, the gravamen of Washington\u2019s First Amendment claims, as alleged, appears to be that Washington is <em>entirely </em>exempt from local land use regulations by virtue of the First Amendment. Washington cites no authority to support such a proposition, and we could find none. <em>Cf. First Vagabonds Church of God v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number><em>Orlando, Fla., </em>610 F.3d 1274, 1286-86 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that a neutral ordinance of general applicability that is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest does not violate the Free Exercise Clause even if it has the incidental effect of burdening a religious practice), vacated, 616 F.3d 1229 (11th Cir.2010), <em>reinstated in relevant part, </em>638 F.3d 756, 763 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc). As the district court noted, it appears from the face of the complaint that Washington merely needs to comply with the permitting process, like all property owners in the City of Tampa.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">B. Fifth Amendment Claim Under \u00a7 1983</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Liberally construed, Washington\u2019s complaint also alleged that her Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated during the code enforcement proceedings because, <em>inter alia, </em>the special magistrate \u201chad no authority to issue a lien ... or make a determination of guilt.\u201d On appeal, Washington continues to assert that the special magistrate was without authority or jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">To state a procedural due process claim under \u00a7 1983, the plaintiff must allege: (1) the deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest; (2) state action; and (3) constitutionally inadequate process. <em>Cryder v. Oxendine, </em>24 F.3d 175, 177 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a municipal proceeding conducted by a special magistrate who lacks jurisdiction constitutes \u201cconstitutionally inadequate process,\u201d Washington still has not stated a procedural due process claim. This is so because, contrary to Washington\u2019s contention, the special magistrate in her case was authorized by Florida law to adjudicate code violations within the jurisdiction of the City of Tampa. <em>See </em>Fla. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7 2(b); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 166.021(1) &amp; (4) (conferring upon municipal governments all the governmental powers \u201cto enable them to conduct municipal government, perform municipal functions, and render municipal services\u201d and granting them the authority to \u201cexercise any power for municipal purposes, except when expressly prohibited by law\u201d); Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 162.01-162.13 (authorizing municipalities to adopt a code enforcement system that gives special magistrates designated by the local government body the authority to hold hearings and assess fines against municipal code violators and impose liens on real property); City of Tampa Code \u00a7 9-1 (authorizing special magistrates to enforce the City of Tampa\u2019s code provisions or ordinances, including to impose fines and other non-criminal penalties).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">Washington\u2019s complaint established that she is the owner of the property at 2113 North Freemont Avenue and that the property is within the City of Tampa. Thus, as a matter of law, the special magistrate had jurisdiction to adjudicate any code violations on Washington\u2019s property and assess fines against her if the violations were not corrected. To the extent Washington contends that she is not subject to the City of Tampa\u2019s code or the jurisdiction of the special magistrate because she is a Moorish National, she does not cite any case from this Court, the United States Supreme Court, or the Florida courts supporting her argument, and we could find none. Washington\u2019s reliance upon the 1787 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States and the country of Morocco and the Free Moorish Zodiac Constitution is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>C. RLUIPA</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">At the outset, we note that the district court concluded that Washington lacked standing to bring her RLUIPA claims. Article III standing requires the plaintiff to establish (1) \u201can injury in fact or an invasion of a legally protected interest\u201d; (2) \u201ca direct causal relationship between the injury and the challenged action\u201d; and (3) \u201ca likelihood of redressability.\u201d <em>Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, </em>366 F.3d 1214, 1223 (11th Cir.2004). In determining that Washington failed to allege an injury in fact, the district court seems to have conflated the standing requirements with the merits of Washington\u2019s RLUIPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Washington\u2019s complaint alleged that she was the owner of the property and that she was found guilty of violating several of the City\u2019s land use ordinances and threatened with fines and a lien. Under our precedent, Washington\u2019s allegations sufficiently alleged standing to challenge the application of the City\u2019s land use ordinances to her property under RLUI-PA. <em>See id. </em>at 1223-24 (concluding that two congregations that had leased property to operate synagogues had standing to bring RLUIPA claims to challenge zoning ordinances because the town had already instituted enforcement actions in state court).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">Although Washington has standing, her complaint failed to state RLUIPA claims. Washington\u2019s complaint alleged that the Defendants violated: (1) the \u201cequal terms\u201d provision of RLUIPA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(l); and (2) the nondiscrimination provision of RLUIPA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Under RLUIPA\u2019s equal terms provision, governments are prohibited from implementing land use regulations in a manner that treats religious assemblies \u201con less than equal terms\u201d with nonreligious assemblies or institutions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(l). \u201cThere are four elements of an Equal Terms violation: (1) the plaintiff must be a religious assembly or institution, (2) subject to a land use regulation, that (3) treats the religious assembly on less than equal terms, with (4) a nonreligious assembly or institution.\u201d <em>Primera Iglesia Bautista Hispana of Boca Raton, Inc. v. Broward Cnty., </em>450 F.3d 1295, 1307 (11th Cir.2006). There are both facial and \u201cas applied\u201d equal terms violations. <em>See id. </em>at 1308-10. Here, Washington\u2019s complaint, liberally construed, did not allege a facial equal terms challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Her complaint did contain an \u201cas applied\u201d claim, alleging that the Defendants\u2019 application of the City of Tampa\u2019s land use ordinances to her property violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>ed RLUIPA\u2019s equal terms provision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Her complaint, however, made only a concluso-ry statement that the Defendants allowed \u201cother religious and nonreligious assemblies and institutions to operate in residential districts\u201d without being subject to enforcement actions. The complaint did not identify any particular nonreligious assembly or institution or allege with any specificity how the Defendants\u2019 application of the City of Tampa\u2019s code to Washington\u2019s property resulted in her religious assembly being treated on less than equal terms. Such vague and conclusory allegations are insufficient to state a claim for relief. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct.' at 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">As to the nondiscrimination claim, Washington\u2019s complaint was equally threadbare, making only the conclusory statement that the Defendants\u2019 \u201cactions to prevent organized religious services from taking place on the Al Moroc Humanity Park property\u201d constituted discrimination against her on the basis of religion. The complaint does not allege any facts supporting this assertion or explain how requiring Washington to apply for permits before placing a sign, building a structure, or operating a private recreational facility on the property prevented her from conducting organized religious services. Without further factual allegations elaborating upon how the Defendants\u2019 code enforcement actions constituted discrimination on the basis of religion, Washington\u2019s complaint failed to state a nondiscrimination claim under RLUIPA. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">For all the forgoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Washington\u2019s complaint for failure to state \u00e1 claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We note, however, that where a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim, a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff \u201cmust be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted). As explained above, the deficiencies with respect to Washington\u2019s First Amendment free exercise and association claims and her RLUIPA equal terms and nondiscrimination claims are that she failed to allege sufficient factual matter and relied on conclusory allegations. Further, it is not apparent from the record that Washington could not allege facts that would state a plausible First Amendment 'or RLUIPA claim. <em>See id. </em>(providing that a district court is not required to permit amendment where it would be futile). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss Washington\u2019s free exercise and association claims under the First Amendment and her equal terms and nondiscri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>mination claims under RLUIPA without prejudice. All of Washington\u2019s other claims remain dismissed with prejudice;</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-8\">. Contrary to the Defendants\u2019 argument, Washington\u2019s September 19, 2014 notice of appeal was timely filed within 150 days of the district court's July 25, 2014 dismissal order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(7)(A)(ii) (requiring the appellant to file a notice of appeal within 150 days of the judgment or order if it was not set forth in a separate document as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(a)). Therefore, we have appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b923-8\">. The district court concluded that the City of Tampa Code Enforcement, a department of the City of Tampa, was not a proper party and construed Washington\u2019s complaint as naming the City of Tampa, the legal entity capable of being sued under Florida law. Although Washington challenges this conclusion, we do not address it because, regardless of which entity is the proper party, Washington's complaint was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-8\">.We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Butler v. Sheriff of Palm Beach Cnty., </em>685 F.3d 1261, 1265 (11th Cir.2012). While we construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, we do not have \"license to serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a party, or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds by Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b924-12\"><em>. </em>Although Washington's complaint alleged the violation of several constitutional rights, it did not refer to 42 U.S.C. 1983. The district court properly construed Washington's constitutional claims as proceeding under \u00a7 1983. <em>See GeorgiaCarry.Org, Inc. v. Georgia, </em>687 F.3d 1244, 1253 n. 15 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b924-13\">. Washington\u2019s complaint also alleged, without any elaboration, that the Defendants violated her Fourth and Ninth Amendment rights. These claims are wholly without merit, and district court\u2019s dismissal of them warrants no discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b925-9\">. Because we affirm the district court's dismissal on Rule 12(b)(6) grounds, we do not address its alternative ruling that the Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b926-8\">. Washington's complaint did not explicitly allege that the Defendants imposed a \"substantial burden\u201d on her religious exercise, in a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(a)(l). Nonetheless, the district court liberally construed Washington's complaint to include a substantial burden claim and concluded that the Defendants\u2019 requiring Washington to apply for permits was an incidental effect on Washington's religious exercise that was merely an inconvenience and not a substantial burden. <em>See Konikov v. Orange Cnty., Fla., </em>410 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that \"requiring applications for variances, special permits or other relief provisions would not offend RLUIPA's goals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AWX\">On appeal, Washington's brief makes no mention of a violation of RLUIPA\u2019s substantial burden provision or the district court\u2019s ruling on that claim. Thus, Washington has abandoned any appeal of her substantial burden RLUIPA claim. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\"While we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b927-6\">. We note that it is an open question in this circuit whether the jurisdictional provisions of \u00a7 2000cc(a)(2) apply to RLUIPA claims asserted under \u00a7 2000cc(b). <em>See Konikov, </em>410 F.3d at 1324. We need not resolve the issue here because the third jurisdictional prong of \u00a7 2000cc(a)(2) is satisfied in any event. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(a)(2)(C) (requiring the RLUIPA violation to have occurred \u201cin the implementation of a land use regulation or \u2022 system of land use regulations, under which a government makes ... individualized assessments of the proposed uses for the property involved\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b927-10\">. On appeal, Washington argues that the district court abused its discretion by referring a motion to a magistrate judge without her consent. However, the record reflects that the district court never referred any motions to a magistrate judge and issued the two orders entered in the case. Washington also complains that the district court changed her jury demand and did not send the order dismissing her complaint to her correct mailing address. Any alleged error was harmless given that Washington filed a timely notice of appeal and has not shown any prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
