Garc\u00eda sought 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 relief arguing, inter alia, that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise him of the disposition of his direct appeal, thereby depriving him of the opportunity to file a timely petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. The district court granted Garcia a certificate of appealability on the ineffectiveness issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Under this court\u2019s Plan for Representation on Appeal Under the Criminal Justice Act (CJA Plan), \u201c[promptly after the court of appeals\u2019 decision issues, appointed counsel must advise the client in writing of the right to seek further review by filing a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.\u201d CJA Plan, \u00a7 6, \u00b6 4.
