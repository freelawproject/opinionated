He argues that the district court erred in applying enhancements under both U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) and (b)(4), resulting in impermissible double-counting. In addition, he argues that the district court committed procedural error by running his federal sentences consecutively to his state sentence, contrary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(2). Charniak argues that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence. Finally, he argues that the district court plainly erred in imposing two consecutive life terms of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Coe, </em>79 F.3d 126, 127 (11th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s fact findings, including the finding that two cases are not related, are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Query, </em>928 F.2d 383, 385 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Section 4Al.l(a) provides that, when calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history, the sentencing court should add three points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a). Section 4A1.2(a)(l) defines \u201cprior sentence\u201d as \u201cany sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>for conduct not part of the instant offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1). Conduct is part of the instant offense if it is relevant conduct to the instant offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.l). Relevant conduct includes all acts and omissions committed by the defendant during the commission of the instant offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">Section 2G2.2(b)(5) provides that \u201c[i]f the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor,\u201d the district could should increase the offense level by five levels. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5). A pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-10\">any combination of two or more separate instances of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor by the defendant, whether or not the abuse or exploitation (A) occurred during the course of the offense; (B) involved the same minor; or (C) resulted in a conviction for such conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2, comment. (n.l). Furthermore, a conviction considered under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) is not excluded from consideration when calculating criminal history points. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">The district court did not err in counting Charniak\u2019s state conviction toward his criminal history points because that offense met the definition of \u201cprior sentence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). Charniak\u2019s state sentence for abusing his daughter was imposed prior to his conviction for the instant federal offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). The state offense was not part of the instant offenses because it was not relevant conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.l). Charn-iak did not abuse his daughter during the commission of his child pornography offenses, in preparation for them, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>responsibility for them. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 lBl.S(a)(l)(A). Even though the state and federal offenses occurred during the same time period, they involved different victims and different conduct \u2014 receiving and distributing media on one hand and sexually abusing an individual on the other. The fact that agents discovered Charniak\u2019s abuse of his daughter during an interview about his child pornography offenses does not alone make that offense relevant conduct. Neither does the inclusion of facts regarding the state offense in the \u201cOffense Conduct\u201d section of the pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) make it relevant conduct, because these facts were necessary to include in order to apply the five-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">In addition, Charniak\u2019s argument that the state offense was relevant conduct as a result of the application of the five-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) fails. This section specifically allows the district court to consider offenses not determined to be relevant conduct and provides that these offenses are not excluded from the calculation of criminal history points. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2, comment, (n.l); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2, comment, (n.3). The use of Charniak\u2019s state offense to apply this five-level increase does not preclude the district court from considering the offense when calculating his criminal history points.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a claim of double-counting under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Suarez, </em>601 F.3d 1202, 1220 (11th Cir.2010). However, if a party fails to raise an argument before the district court, we review the issue for plain error. <em>United States v. McNair, </em>605 F.3d 1152, 1222 (11th Cir.2010). Plain error occurs when there is (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If the first three conditions are met, then we \u201cmay exercise discretion to correct a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or pubic reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cAn error is \u2018plain\u2019 if controlling precedent from the Supreme Court or the Eleventh Circuit establishes that an error has occurred.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d 816, 822 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 948, 190 L.Ed.2d 843 (2015). An error is also plain if it is clear or obvious. <em>United States v. Joseph, </em>709 F.3d 1082, 1095-96 (11th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1273, 188 L.Ed.2d 310 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">\u201cImpermissible double counting occurs only when one part of the guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of a different part of the guidelines.\u201d <em>Suarez, </em>601 F.3d at 1220 (quotation omitted). Further, \u201c[djouble counting a factor during sentencing is permissible if the Sentencing Commission intended the result, and if the result is permissible because each section concerns conceptually separate notions related to sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We'\u201cpresume[ ] the Sentencing Commission intended to apply separate guideline sections cumulatively, unless specifically directed otherwise.\u201d <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1310 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-14\">Under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2), the district court applies a two-level increase to the defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f the material involved a prepubescent minor or a minor who had not attained the age of 12 years.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2). If the material portrays \u201csadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence,\u201d the district court applies a four-level increase. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4). We have held that \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) is appropriately applied when a district court determines that \u201c(1) the minor in the image is a young child and (2) the image portrays vaginal or anal penetration of a young child by an adult male\u201d because this act is necessarily painful. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>312 F.3d 1250, 1263 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The district court did not plainly err by applying both enhancements. First, Charniak points to no binding precedent holding that applying both the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) and (b)(4) enhancements represents double-counting, so even if there was error, it is not plain. See Ramirez-<em>Flores, </em>743 F.3d at 822. Furthermore, there is no error at all, because the harm encompassed by \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) is not fully accounted for by \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2), and each of the guideline sections represents conceptually different notions related to sentencing. <em>See Suarez, </em>601 F.3d at 1220. An individual may receive or distribute child pornography images involving simulated intercourse or the lascivious exhibition of a prepubescent child\u2019s genitals, either of which would result in the application of \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) based on the age of the child but not \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4). While the age of the child is part of the analysis articulated in <em>Hall </em>as to whether \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) applies, the image must also portray vaginal or anal penetration of the young child by an adult male. <em>See Hall, </em>312 F.3d at 1263. The fact that the child is prepubescent is only one part of the analysis of whether the image necessarily depicts violence. <em>See id. </em>In addition, the application of both enhancements would not impact Charn-iak\u2019s substantial rights, because he possessed and distributed images of children tied up, which would result in the application of \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) even if the images of adults having sex with very young children did not. <em>See McNair, </em>605 F.3d at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">We review the imposition of a consecutive sentence for abuse of discretion, and the resulting sentence must be reasonable. <em>United States v. Covington, </em>565 F.3d 1336, 1346-47 (11th Cir.2009). We review the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 <em>de novo. United States v. Bidwell, </em>393 F.3d 1206, 1208-09 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">When a sentence is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment, the district court may elect to run the terms concurrently or consecutively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). Terms imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders them to run concurrently. <em>Id. </em>Regardless of how the district court determines to run the terms, it must make the decision in consideration of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3584(b). Echoing the statute, the Sentencing Guidelines state that when imposing a sentence on a defendant already subject to an undischarged sentence, the sentence for the instant offense may run concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive to the prior sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) (Nov.2013). The application notes provide that the district court should consider the following factors in determining whether to impose consecutive or concurrent terms of imprisonment: (1) the factors set out in \u00a7 3584 (which references \u00a7 3553(a)); (2) the type (meaning, e.g., determinate or indeterminate/parolable) and length of the prior undischarged sentence; (3) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be served before release; (4) whether the prior undischarged sentence was imposed in state or federal court, or at a different time before the same or different federal court; and (5) \u201c[a]ny other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(c) comment. (n.3(A)). This Court has recognized that \u00a7 3584 and \u00a7 5G1.3 evince a preference for consecutive terms of imprisonment when the sentences are imposed at different times. <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">However, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) provides that if the instant offense was not committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment, a term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction, and that offense was the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant offense under Chapter Two or Three of the Guidelines, the sentence shall be imposed concurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(2) (Nov.2013). Before imposing the sentence, the district court shall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term if the court determines the Bureau of Prisons will not credit the time already served to the federal sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">The district court did not err when it imposed Charniak\u2019s federal sentences to run consecutive to his state sentence. Charniak fails to show that his state offense met the requirements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(2) to require the district court to impose concurrent sentences. As explained previously, Charniak\u2019s state conviction for sexually abusing his daughter was not relevant conduct for his federal offenses of child pornography and the application of the five-level increase did not cause the offense to be deemed relevant conduct. Because the state offense was not relevant conduct, the district court had the discretion to impose concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive sentences. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c). The district court discussed the seriousness of child pornography and the need to be fair to both the victims and the community in determining whether to impose the sentences consecutively. The district court\u2019s decision to impose Charniak\u2019s sentences to run consecutively to his state sentence was within the court\u2019s discretion and did not constitute error. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c); <em>Covington, </em>565 F.3d at 1346. In addition, the judge\u2019s comment stating that she did not have a choice, when considered in context, was not an expression of her belief that she was bound by the guidelines to impose consecutive sentences, but rather an expression of her belief that the circumstances surrounding the offenses compelled her to exercise her discretion to impose consecutive sentences. Finally, the resulting sentence was reasonable, as described below. <em>See Covington, </em>565 F.3d at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AML\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence using a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We examine the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). The burden of establishing unreasonableness lies with the party challenging the s\u00e9ntence. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">The district court is required to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">A district court abuses its discretion and imposes a substantively unreasonable sentence when it fails to afford consideration to relevant, factors that were due significant weight, gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc). </em>We will remand only when \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). A sentence well below the statutory maximum penalty is one indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Charniak has not met his burden of establishing that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1378. Although Charniak does not have an extensive criminal history, his recent offenses were for the extremely serious crimes of child pornography and sexually abusing his daughter over a period of years. Charn-iak\u2019s sentence reflects both the seriousness of his child pornography offenses and the concerns for public safety, particularly the safety of children. Furthermore, Charn-iak continued to obtain and trade child pornography after his initial interview with agents. His actions show that he is likely to engage in the offenses again and show a need for adequate deterrence. Under the circumstances, Charniak\u2019s sentence accomplished the needs for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offenses, protect the public, and provide deterrence. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). His sentence was within the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts. See <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Charniak\u2019s specific arguments also fail. First, the 262-month total sentence is significantly below the 480-month maximum statutory sentence Charniak could receive with his sentences imposed consecutively. The federal sentence does not punish Charniak twice for conduct related to the federal offenses, because the state and federal offenses are separate and unrelated. The district court judge\u2019s comments regarding her experience served to place Charniak\u2019s offenses within the context of her knowledge regarding sex crimes against minors. Finally, the district court did not apply the \u201cmarket thesis theory\u201d to its determination of Charniak\u2019s sentence. The district court did not discuss the nature of child pornography in relation to the theory that consumers of child pornography increase the harm to future children by increasing the demand for child pornography, as described in the market thesis theory. Instead, the district court spoke about the harm to children who are already victims of child pornography when new consumers continue to view and transfer that child pornography long after it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">We generally review questions of statutory interpretation and the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. See United States v. Barrington, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>648 F.3d 1178, 1194 (11th Cir.2011) (Sentencing Guidelines); <em>United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2009) (statutory interpretation). If a party fails to raise an argument before the district court, we review the issue for plain error. <em>McNair, </em>605 F.3d at 1222. Plain error occurs when there is (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If the first three conditions are met, then this Court \u201cmay exercise discretion to correct a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or pubic reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). To show that an error affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, the defendant must establish a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error. <em>See United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295, 1300-01 (11th Cir.2005). An error that seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings is one that is \u201cparticularly egregious,\u201d and, if left uncorrected, would result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Puche, </em>350 F.3d 1137, 1151 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Terms of supervised release must run concurrently. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e) (providing that a term of supervised release \u201cruns concurrently with any Federal, State, or local term of probation or supervised release or parole for another offense to which the person is subject or becomes subject during the term of supervised release\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, comment. (n.2(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Here, the district court committed an error that was plain when it imposed consecutive supervised release terms. <em>See </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, comment. (n.2(C)). However, the error did not affect Charniak\u2019s substantial rights because, even absent the error, his total term of supervised release \u2014 life\u2014would remain the same. <em>See Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d at 1300-01. Charniak\u2019s arguments concerning the possible impact of a court reducing one of the supervised release terms in the future does not show an effect on his substantial rights, because Charniak would still have to serve his other life term even if that term was concurrent. Because Charniak does not meet the first three conditions to show plain error, this Court need not determine whether the error seriously affects the fairness of the judicial proceedings. <em>See McNair, </em>605 F.3d at 1222. Even if the Court considered this fourth factor, Charniak does not show the error would result in a miscarriage of justice if left uncorrected, because the error will not cause him to be subjected to any punishment beyond that which would have applied absent the error. <em>See Puche, </em>350 F.3d at 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
