Martin, Jr., federal prisoner # 09784-026, appeals the district court\u2019s denial and dismissal of two separate 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 applications wherein he challenged the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) disciplinary findings regarding an escape charge as well as charges of violating Disciplinary Code 108 \u2014 possession, manufacture, or introduction of a hazardous tool \u2014 and Disciplinary Code 305 \u2014 possession of anything not authorized. Martin argues that the district court abused its discretion by concluding that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and summarily dismissing his \u00a7 2241 application challenging the imposition of punishment following the disciplinary hearing of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>fleer\u2019s (DHO) conclusion that he was guilty of escape. He further argues that the district court erred by denying the sufficiency of the evidence, due process, and equal protection claims he raised in the \u00a7 2241 application challenging the punishment imposed following the DHO\u2019s conclusion that he was guilty of possession of a hazardous tool, namely an unauthorized MP3 player.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 434 (5th Cir.2011). Where, as here, a district coui't has dismissed a \u00a7 2241 application for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, this court reviews for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Fuller v. Rich, </em>11 F.3d 61, 62 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The record reveals that Martin completed only three of the four necessary steps in the BOP\u2019s administrative complaint resolution process following the DHO\u2019s conclusion that he was guilty of escape. <em>See Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 90, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 542.13, 542.14, 542.15. His substantial compliance is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of exhaustion. <em>Wright v. Hollingsworth, </em>260 F.3d 357, 358 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his \u00a7 2241 application for lack of exhaustion. <em>See id,.; Fuller, </em>11 F.3d at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The record further reveals that the BOP afforded Martin all of the due process rights to which an inmate is entitled during a disciplinary hearing. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 556, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); <em>Morgan v. Quarterman, </em>570 F.3d 663, 668 (5th Cir.2009). Martin\u2019s assertion that the BOP did not allow him to present the MP3 player as evidence during his hearing for violating Disciplinary Code 108 and Disciplinary Code 305 rings hollow as he did not request to present witnesses or evidence. Regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, the reporting officer\u2019s written statement that Martin was in possession of an unauthorized MP3 player \u2014 which the BOP classified as a hazardous tool \u2014 was, standing alone, adequate to satisfy the standard that the disciplinary conviction be supported by some evidence. <em>See Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454-456, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985); <em>Hudson v. Johnson, </em>242 F.3d 534, 536 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">As to Martin\u2019s argument that the BOP violated his equal protection rights because it charged him with the more serious Code 108 violation and imposed severe sanctions against him in contrast to the actions taken against other inmates accused of the same offense, the argument is without merit. Martin cannot demonstrate that the BOP acted with a discriminatory purpose due to his membership in a particular group. <em>See Priester v. Lowndes Cnty., </em>354 F.3d 414, 424 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Woods v. Edwards, </em>51 F.3d 577, 580 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
