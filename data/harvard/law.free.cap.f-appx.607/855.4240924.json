On appeal, Defendant argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) because his two prior convictions for third-degree burglary, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(l)(b), did not qualify as ACCA-predicate violent felonies. We disagree, and affirm Defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">After Defendant entered his guilty plea, the probation office prepared Defendant\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). The probation officer calculated an initial base offense level of 24, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), because Defendant had at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled substance offense. However, the probation officer also determined that Defendant was an armed career criminal based on his prior violent felony convictions. As an armed career criminal, Defendant was subject to an offense level of 34 under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(8)(A), because the probation officer determined that he possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection with a crime of violence. The probation officer then applied a three-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), yielding a total offense level of 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">Defendant qualified for a criminal history category of VI, based on his armed career criminal status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As relevant here, the PSI noted that Defendant had two convictions for third-degree burglary of a structure, in violation ' of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(l)(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of VI, Defendant\u2019s guideline range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. As an armed career criminal, Defendant was subject to a statutory minimum 15-year (180-month) term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-15\">Prior to his sentencing hearing, Defendant objected to the ACCA sentence enhancement. Defendant argued that his prior \u00a7 810.02(l)(b) convictions did not qualify as ACCA-predicate offenses because they were not \u201cviolent felonies\u201d as defined by the ACCA. According to Defendant, his convictions failed to meet that definition because the elements of \u00a7 810.02(l)(b) are broader than those of generic burglary and the violation of \u00a7 810.02(l)(b) presents no inherent danger of injury to innocent persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>At his sentencing hearing, Defendant informed the district court that he was -withdrawing his objections to the PSI because he had reached an agreement with the government. Based on the parties\u2019 agreement, Defendant\u2019s total offense level was reduced to 30 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and his criminal history category was reduced to V, which resulted in a guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant acknowledged that his mandatory minimum sentence remained 180 months\u2019 imprisonment and informed the court that he and the government had agreed to jointly recommend a 180-month sentence. The district court adopted the parties\u2019 agreement as to the guideline calculations and sentenced Defendant to imprisonment for 180 months. Neither Defendant nor the government objected to the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Despite withdrawing his objection before the district court, Defendant argues on appeal that his two prior \u00a7 810.02(l)(b) convictions do not qualify as ACCA-predi-cate violent felonies because the state statute is \u201coverbroad and indivisible.\u201d Defendant contends that, when applying the categorical approach, his \u00a7 810.02(l)(b) convictions do not fit within the generic definition of burglary because Florida law allows such convictions to be based on the defendant\u2019s unauthorized entry into the curtilage of a structure, not just the structure itself. He also argues that his convictions do not qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause because third-degree burglary does not require an assault or battery or that another person be present.</p>\n<p id=\"A8g\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>742 F.3d 949, 952 (11th Cir.2014). However, sentencing issues that were not raised in the district court are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>743 F.3d 826, 828 (11th Cir.2014). Under plain error review, we will reverse where there is \u201c(1) an error (2) that is plain and (3) that has affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and ... (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Madden, </em>733 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2013). The circumstances here also implicate the invited error doctrine. Under the invited error doctrine, we will not review an error that a defendant induced or invited the district court into making. <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2005). We have often applied the doctrine when a party argues for the sentence that the district court ultimately imposed. <em>See United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Under the ACCA, a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is subject to a mandatory minimum, 15-year sentence if he has three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include any crime that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d or is a \u201cburglary, arson, [] extortion, [or] involves use of explosives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii). In addition, the ACCA contains a \u201cresidual clause\u201d that defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include any felony that \u201cpresents a serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>United States v. Kirk, </em>767 F.3d 1136, 1139 (11th Cir.2014) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Florida defines burglary as \u201c[ejntering a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(l)(b). A burglary is a third-degree felony if, \u201cin the course of committing the offense, the offender does not make an assault or battery and is not and does not become armed with a dangerous weapon or explosive,\u201d and there is not another person in the structure or conveyance. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 810.02(4). Florida law defines \u201cstructure,\u201d as it is used in the burglary statute, as \u201ca building of any kind, ... which has a roof over it, together with the curtilage thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 810.011(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Under the invited error doctrine, we are precluded from considering Defendant\u2019s challenge to the ACCA enhancement because he withdrew his objection to the' enhancement and affirmatively requested the 180-month sentence that he now appeals. <em>See Love, </em>449 F.3d at 1157; <em>see also United States v. Masters, </em>118 F.3d 1524, 1526 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that when a defendant raises and then knowingly withdraws an objection to his sentence, we deem the objection waived and will not review it on appeal). Prior to sentencing, Defendant objected to the PSI\u2019s determination that he was an armed career criminal and argued that his third-degree burglary convictions were not violent felonies as defined in the ACCA. Then, at his sentencing hearing, Defendant withdrew his objections to the PSI based on an agreement he reached with the government as to his guideline calculations. Moreover, Defendant specifically requested that he be sentenced to the 180-month mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">Even if we were to consider Defendant\u2019s argument, it would fail under plain error review. Because the parties agree that Florida\u2019s definition of burglary is broader than the definition of generic burglary and that the enumerated offenses clause does not apply to Defendant\u2019s 'case, we only consider whether Defendant\u2019s pri- or convictions fall within the residual clause of the ACCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Kirk, </em>767 F.3d at 1139 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">To determine whether a state conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, we employ the categorical approach and \u201cconsider whether the elements of the offense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision.\u201d <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290, 1294 (11th Cir.2013) (emphasis omitted). Applying this approach, we compare whether the offense of conviction \u201c \u2018presents a serious potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>risk of physical injury to another\u2019 comparable to the risk posed by the ACCA\u2019s enumerated offenses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">We discern no plain error in the determination that Defendant\u2019s prior Florida convictions for third-degree burglary qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. Defendant does not cite, and we have not found, any Supreme Court or Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a prior conviction for third-degree burglary under \u00a7 810.02(l)(b) does not present a serious potential risk of physical injury. <em>See United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cthere can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving\u201d the disputed issue). Moreover, we have previously held that third-degree burglary under an earlier version of \u00a7 810.02 qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>466 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that third-degree burglary based on the entry into the roofed portion or curti-lage of a structure was a violent felony because the burglar may come into close contact with property owners, occupants, or another innocent person investigating why he was there). Likewise, Supreme Court precedent suggests that it is not erroneous to conclude that violation of \u00a7 810.02(l)(b) involves a substantial risk of .physical injury. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 203, 209, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (concluding that attempted burglary under Florida law was a violent felony under the residual clause because the risk of burglary includes the possibility of confrontation with police or bystanders who might come to investigate).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In sum, there is no current law from the Supreme Court or this Court to support Defendant\u2019s plain error argument. In addition, Defendant withdrew his objection to the ACCA enhancement and affirmatively requested the 180-month sentence that he now appeals. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-11\">. Had Defendant not been an armed career criminal, his criminal history category would have been V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-12\">. Defendant also had a conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude law enforcement, as well as a conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He does not dispute that these convictions constitute ACCA-predi-cate offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. Defendant\u2019s total offense level was reduced to 30 because the parties agreed that Defendant had not possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection with a crime of violence, and thus, his armed career criminal offense level was 33, instead of 34. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.4(b)(3)(A) and (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b886-6\">. We do this despite Defendant\u2019s argument that the \"residual clause is not applicable once an enumerated felony is found to be overbroad.\u201d Contrary to Defendant\u2019s argument, neither <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>- U.S. --, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), <em>United States v. Jones, </em>743 F.3d 826 (11th Cir.2014), nor <em>United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir.2014), sets forth a general rule limiting the applicability of the residual clause. Instead, <em>Descamps, Howard, </em>and <em>Jones </em>limit consideration of the residual clause because the government either waived such argument (Descamps) or did not oppose Defendant\u2019s request to preclude consideration of the applicability of the residual clause on remand (Howard and Jones). <em>See Descamps, </em>- U.S. at-, 133 S.Ct. at 2293 n. 6 (expressing no view on whether the offense qualified under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause because the government forfeited such alternative argument); <em>Jones, </em>743 F.3d at 830-31 (limiting the scope of remand to preclude argument on the residual clause because the government did not oppose such request); <em>Howard, </em>742 F.3d at 1349 (same). Unlike <em>Descamps, Jones, </em>and <em>Howard, </em>the government here specifically argues that Florida third-degree burglary is a violent felony based on the residual clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
