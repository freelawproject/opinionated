McCorvey alleged that Styles was deliberately indifferent to his (McCorvey\u2019s) serious medical needs which resulted from a sexual assault by a prison guard who was eventually convicted of improper sexual activity with McCorvey as a person in custody. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">McCorvey was harassed, threatened, and eventually sexually assaulted by a prison guard while an inmate in a TDJC prison. After McCorvey reported the incident, an officer from the Office of Inspector General took McCorvey to the prison\u2019s medical unit, identified him as the victim of a sexual assault, and expressly requested of Styles that McCorvey be examined, including application of an oral swab and a rape kit. Styles refused .that request, making such excuses as (1) he did not know which provider was on call, (2) he did not know where the kits were located, and (3) he was not permitted to break the seal on a kit. None contests that Styles failed to contact a physician or other practitioner; refused to examine or evaluate McCor-vey; did not obtain a history; and did not refer McCorvey to a mental health professional. Neither is it contested that Styles did not make a record of McCorvey\u2019s visit until four days later. Despite McCorvey\u2019s request for psychological treatment, Styles failed to respond, claiming there was nothing he could do. In sum, Styles refused to take any action whatsoever. As a result, McCorvey received neither a medical exam nor mental health treatment until he again requested assistance, this time from a different nurse who treated him and referred him to a mental health professional. In his \u00a7 1983 complaint, McCorvey lodged an Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment claim against Styles for affirmatively denying care and treatment, thus exhibiting deliberate indifference to McCorvey\u2019s serious medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Styles filed his motion seeking summary judgment dismissal on the basis of qualified immunity, which the district court eventually denied. It ruled that the summary judgment evidence supports the conclusions that Styles was told by an appropriate officer that McCorvey had been sexually assaulted; that Styles nevertheless failed to follow TDCJ protocol for reported sexual assaults; that he did not administer the required procedures regarding sexual assault kits; and that\u2014 given McCorvey\u2019s establishment of a violation of his clearly established Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, <em>viz, </em>deliberate indifference to serious medical needs\u2014 Styles\u2019s behavior was objectively unreasonable under clearly established law as well as under TDCJ policy. The district court denied Styles\u2019s summary judgment motion, concluding that he had refused to treat McCorvey\u2019s serious medical needs despite being aware of those needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">In our <em>de novo </em>review, we may affirm the grant or denial of summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>on any basis supported by the record. Even though, on appeal, Styles advances a litany of complaints of things that were not done and actions that were not taken, and even though Styles also claims that the district court erred in relying on contested facts, we are satisfied that \u2014 given the current stage of these proceedings, and the status of the evidentiary record \u2014 the district court did not commit reversible error in refusing to dismiss the instant action on grounds of Styles\u2019s qualified immunity, regardless of the court\u2019s gratuitous reference to both disputed and undisputed facts. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order of November 20, 2014, denying summary judgment based on qualified immunity is</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
