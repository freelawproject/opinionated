Although Prasai also filed applications for asylum and relief under the Convention Against Torture, his brief does not raise any cognizable contentions of error with respect to the denial of those applications. Accordingly, they are deemed waived. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-23\">Where, as here, the BIA issues its own opinion, agreeing with the IJ\u2019s decision and emphasizing particular aspects of that reasoning, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision to the extent that it impacted the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). We may not reverse an immigration court\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence is \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-24\">Under the REAL ID Act, an alien may sustain his burden of proof without corroboration, however, his testimony must be credible, persuasive, and refer to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate eligibility for relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). A trier of fact may base a credibility determination on (1) the consistency between the applicant\u2019s written and oral statements, (2) the internal consistency of each such statement, (3) the consistency of such statements with other evidence, and (4) the inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii)-(iii)). This court will defer to the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination \u201cunless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Under this standard, reversal is improper unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Prasai argues that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was erroneous and that the inconsistencies cited by the IJ resulted from aggressive and rushed questioning. However, he does not cite any specific instance wherein the IJ\u2019s actions caused him to be vague and hesitant, nor has he shown how any of the inconsistencies cited by the IJ were attributable to aggressive questioning. Further, he has made no showing that the inconsistencies and discrepancies found by the IJ and cited by the BIA were erroneous. He thus has not met his burden of showing that the record compels us to reverse the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
