In 2000, following a jury trial, Kinsey was convicted of six counts of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (also known as Hobbs Act robbery), and six counts of using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The district court sentenced him to a total of 1,655 months in prison, and we affirmed his sentence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>direct appeal. <em>United States v. Kinsey, </em>250 F.3d 750 (11th Cir.2001) (table decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Between February 2002 and March 2014, Kinsey filed multiple post-conviction motions seeking relief, including an October 2009 \u201cmotion to review clerical error,\u201d all without success. The instant motion was filed in August 2014. Kinsey argued the district court\u2019s judgment and the PSI should have listed Kinsey\u2019s robbery convictions as violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1951(b)(1) and (3) in addition to \u00a7 1951(a). He further asserted that both the judgment and the PSI should have described his \u00a7 924(c) offense in either the same terms as the jury instructions or the same terms as certain of the district court\u2019s preliminary remarks at his sentencing hearing. Finally, Kinsey claimed that his address as shown in the PSI was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The district court concluded that (1) there were no errors in the judgment or the PSI regarding either the statutes cited or the descriptions of the two offenses, and (2) Kinsey failed to explain why the address listed in the PSI was incorrect. Alternatively, the district court found Kinsey\u2019s motion was an impermissible collateral attack on the judgment on grounds previously rejected by the court. Reasoning the law of the case doctrine should prevent further litigation on the clerical error issue, the district court dismissed Kinsey\u2019s motion. On appeal, Kinsey asserts the same arguments made below.' After consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we affirm for the reasons set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">A district court\u2019s application of Rule 36 to correct its judgment after sentencing is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Pursuant to Rule 36, \u201c[ajfter giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. A clerical error is \u201cminor and mechanical in nature.\u201d <em>Poiiillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1165. \u201cRule 36 may not be used \u2018to make a substantive alteration to a criminal sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1164 (quoting <em>United States v. Pease, </em>331 F.3d 809, 816 (11th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Two statutes underlie Kinsey\u2019s conviction. The first, \u00a7 1951(a), imposes federal liability on whoever, by robbery or extortion, \u201cobstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce.\u201d Subsections (1) through (3) of \u00a7 1951 define the terms \u201crobbery,\u201d \u201cextortion,\u201d and \u201ccommerce\u201d as used in that statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1951(b)(l)-(3). The second, \u00a7 924(c), provides that \u201cany person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm\u201d shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">The judgment at issue describes the nature of the six robbery offenses as \u201cInterference with Commerce by Threats [or] Violence\u201d in violation of \u00a7 1951(a) and the six corresponding firearm charges as \u201cUsing and [Carrying] a Firearm [During] and in Relationship to a Crime of Violence\u201d in violation of \u00a7 924(c). The PSI similarly refers only to \u00a7 1951(a) and also describes the firearm charges as \u201c[u]sing and carrying a firearm during and in relationship to a crime of violence.\u201d Kinsey takes issue with the lack of citations to \u00a7\u00a7 1951(b)(1), (3) in the judgment and the PSI as well as the absence of the term \u201cpossession\u201d or \u201cpossessing\u201d in the documents\u2019 description of his \u00a7 924(c) offense. Kinsey has failed to establish that either the judgment or the PSI needs correcting.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Regarding his Hobbs Act robbery violations, both the judgment and the PSI correctly list \u00a7 1951(a) as the statute violated. Subsection 1951(a) sets forth the substantive offense made criminal by \u00a7 1951. Subsections 1951(b)(l)-(3), on the other hand, provide section-specific definitions for the terms used in subsection (a). Subsections 1951(b)(1) and (3) construe \u00a7 1951(a)\u2019s substantive offense and are not \u201cother actual crimes\u201d wrongly omitted from either the judgment or the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">An apparent scrivener\u2019s error in the district court\u2019s order has caused some confusion on appeal. In its order, the district court states, \u201c[Kinsey] complains that the Judgment only lists 18 U.S.C. Section 1951(a) and not 1951(b)(1) and (3), but b(l) and (3) are definitions for robbery and commerce; (b)(1) [sic] is the actual crime.\u201d Kinsey argues the district court\u2019s order, as written, supports his arguments on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on the language of \u00a7 1951 and our court\u2019s interpretation thereof, the final phrase was evidently written in error. Section \u00a7 1951(a) is, to borrow a phrase from the district court, the actual crime. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gray, </em>260 F.3d 1267, 1272 (11th Cir.2001) (citing \u00a7 1951(a) as the Hobbs Act). Kinsey cannot find support for his arguments on appeal in this typographical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">There is also no error in the descriptions of Kinsey\u2019s firearm offense. Section 924(c) requires a term of imprisonment be imposed upon any person who \u201cduring and in relation to any crime of violence ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm.\u201d \u00a7 924(c) (emphasis added). As noted above, the description of the offense in both the judgment and the PSI refers to Kinsey\u2019s using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Kinsey takes issue with omission of the term \u201cpossession\u201d or \u201cpossessing\u201d from the description and, to a certain extent, argues the description should include reference to a \u201cknowing\u201d violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Section 924(c) is a disjunctive statute. <em>United States v. Still, </em>102 F.3d 118, 124 (5th Cir.1996). It requires the government to establish the defendant \u201cused, carried or had actual or constructive possession of [a] firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Farris, </em>77 F.3d 391, 395 (11th Cir.1996) (emphasis added). As such, a defendant may be convicted under the \u201cuse\u201d prong, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>the \u201ccarry\u201d prong, or the \u201cpossession\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(c). <em>See id. </em>at 395-96. Further, both the \u201cuse\u201d and the \u201ccarry\u201d prongs require something beyond mere possession. <em>See United States v. Montano, </em>898 F.3d 1276, 1281 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Diaz-Boyzo, </em>432 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">According to the indictment against him, Kinsey was charged with \u201cus[ing], carrying], or possessing]\u201d a firearm in furtherance of a prosecutable crime of violence. The jury was instructed that \u201cit is a separate offense for anyone to use, carry or possess a firearm in furtherance of [a crime of violence].\u201d As stated in the judgment and the PSI, Kinsey was convicted of \u201cusing and carrying a firearm during and in relationship to a crime of violence.\u201d A finding under \u00a7 924(c) that a defendant used and/or carried a firearm in relation to a crime of violence is sufficient to support a conviction under the statute. Therefore, the nature of Kinsey\u2019s convicted offense is sufficiently described by both the judgment and the PSI, and there is no clerical error in either that necessitates correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Finally, Kinsey has not shown the legal address identifying him in the PSI is the result of a clerical error and must be corrected. Kinsey contends his street address in the PSI should read \u201c391 West 22nd Street.\u201d (The PSI lists Kinsey\u2019s street address as \u201c391 West 27nd [sic] Street.\u201d) However, Kinsey does not allege why the address as listed is incorrect or on what basis it need be changed. A single sentence on this issue, without further argument or context, appears in each of Kinsey\u2019s briefs on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even while we construe Kinsey\u2019s arguments liberally, <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam), there is simply no support for Kinsey\u2019s bare assertion that the judgment or the PSI must be corrected to reflect \u201c391 West 22nd Street\u201d as \u201cthe correct address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Kinsey\u2019s Rule 36 motion to correct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-6\">. Adding to the confusion, the government's brief inexplicably contends that \u00a7 1951(a) supplies the definition for \"robbery,\u201d that \u00a7 1951(b)(1) establishes a Hobbs Act robbery, and that \u00a7 1951(a) need not be included in either the PSI or the judgment. Such assertions are rendered incorrect by the text of \u00a7 1951. It is unclear why the government did not explain the district court\u2019s obvious typographical error and chose instead to rely on it. Regardless, our readings of the judgment and the PSI are supported by both the statute and the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. Kinsey argues the violation as described in the judgment and the PSI should track with the jury instructions below or the district court\u2019s \"oral sentence.\u201d However, Kinsey provides no authority in support of this proposition. Further, it is unclear what Kinsey means by \"oral sentence.\u201d Kinsey directs us to the district court's statement at his sentencing hearing that \"Kinsey [was] before the Court having been found guilty [by the jury] of ... six counts of using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence.\u201d He implicitly invokes those cases where an oral sentence differed from the sentence set forth in the judgment, <em>see Portillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1164 (\"[A] district court may correct \u2019clerical\u2019 errors in the written judgment at any time under Rule 36, for example, to ensure that the judgment is in accord with the oral sentence.\u201d), but those cases do not apply here,, <em>cf. United States v. Bates, </em>213 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s introductory remarks do not amount to an \u201coral sentence\u201d and, in any event, do not conflict with the description of Kinsey's offense in either the judgment or the PSI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b916-6\">. In his opening brief, Kinsey states, \"If the appellants [sic] correct address is 391 West 22nd Street, Riviera Beach, FI. 33404, then it should reflect just that in the [PSI].\u201d His reply brief provides simply, \u201cOn page 3 needs to document on record the correct address of 391 West 22nd Street, Riviera Beach, FI. 33404.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ADL6\">. Because we find the district court properly denied Kinsey\u2019s motion on its merits, we do not and need not consider the district court's alternative holdings. <em>See Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1286 (11th Cir.2008) (\"We can uphold the decision of the district court on any grounds that appear in the record.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
