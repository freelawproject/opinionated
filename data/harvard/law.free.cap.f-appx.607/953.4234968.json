Goldome Credit Corp., </em>408 F.3d 773, 785 (11th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). To overcome a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must present more than a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of evidence supporting his position, because \u201cthere must be enough of a showing that a jury could reasonably find for that party.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">The ADA protects a \u201cqualified individual\u201d from discrimination on the basis of disability in the \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). The ADA defines the term \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include \u201cexcluding or otherwise denying equal jobs or benefits to a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a relationship or association.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12112(b)(4). We may evaluate disability discrimination and association discrimination claims brought under the ADA using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), under which the plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of disability discrimination. <em>See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of association discrimination under the ADA, the plaintiff may show: \u201c(1) that [he] was subjected to an adverse employment action; (2) that [he] was qualified for the job at that time; (3) that [his] employer knew at that time that [he] had a relative with a disability; and (4) that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances which raised a reasonable inference that the disability of the relative was a determining factor in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Wascura v. City of S. Miami, </em>257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations and brackets omitted). If a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination and the defendant articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show that the defendant\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for unlawful disability discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 1242-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Pretext means that the reason given by the employer was not the real reason for the adverse employment decision. <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1528 (11th. Cir.1997). An employee can show that the employer\u2019s articulated reason was false by pointing to \u201cweaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoheren-cies, or contradictions\u201d in the proffered explanation. <em>Id. </em>at 1538 (quotation omitted). However, a reason is not a pretext for discrimination unless the plaintiff shows both that the reason was false and that discrimination was the real reason. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). The inquiry into pretext is concerned with the employer\u2019s beliefs, not the employee\u2019s perceptions of his performance. <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir.1997). Furthermore, we do not \u201csit as a super-personnel department that reexamines an entity\u2019s business decisions.\u201d <em>Alphin v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>940 F.2d 1497, 1501 (11th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Cusick was qualified for a relevant management position with Yellowbook (in light of the fact the position he previously held was eliminated in the company\u2019s restructuring), he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case because he did not demonstrate that his daughter\u2019s medical condition, or the health care costs of her condition, was a determinative factor in Yellowbook\u2019s decision to demote him. <em>See Wascura, 2H1 </em>F.3d at 1242. There was no testimony suggesting that either Michels or Terrizzi \u2014 Cusick\u2019s supervisors who made the decision to demote him \u2014 bore any discriminatory animus against either Cusick or his daughter. Nor was there any evidence that Michels or Terrizzi knew the costs of Cusick\u2019s daughter\u2019s medical treatment or whether such costs were increasing Yellowbook\u2019s insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">Moreover, even if Cusick had established a <em>prima facie </em>case, he failed to show that his employer\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for demoting him\u2014 his deficient leadership skills \u2014 was a pretext for disability discrimination, because he merely disagrees with the decisionmak-ers\u2019 perceptions of his leadership shortcomings. <em>See Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1565; <em>Alphin, </em>940 F.2d at 1501. In fact, reflecting upon his termination and performance, Cusick expressly acknowledged that \u201c[t]he disappointments clearly outweigh the accomplishments.\u201d Given the absence of evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>dence that either Michels or Terrizzi harbored any discriminatory animus or even knew whether Cusick\u2019s daughter was imposing increased costs on Yellowbook, and in the context of the substantial restructuring Yellowbook was undertaking at the time, we cannot conclude that Cusick has created genuine issues of fact with respect to whether Cusick\u2019s daughter\u2019s medical condition was a determinative factor in Yellowbook\u2019s employment decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-10\">. Cusick also raised claims for association discrimination under the ADA based upon his termination and for retaliation. However, he did not address these claims in his response to Yellowbook's motion for summary judgment, and the district court properly deemed them abandoned. <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., </em>43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that \"grounds alleged in the complaint but not relied upon in summary judgment are deemed abandoned\u201d). Moreover, Cusick has waived review of these claims on appeal by failing to address them in his brief. <em>See Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1316, 1318-19 (11th Cir.2012) (stating that a party abandons an issue \"by failing to list or otherwise state it as an issue on appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
