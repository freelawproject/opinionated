He contends that the district court abused its discretion in admitting police officer testimony as lay opinion testimony rather than expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-20\">We review the district court\u2019s evidentia-ry rulings for abuse of discretion, subject to harmless error review. <em>United States v. Ebron, </em>683 F.3d 105, 133 (5th Cir.2012). The officers testified that flight from police is evidence of consciousness of guilt and that they did not believe the firearm needed to be fingerprinted in light of the strength of the evidence indicating that Menyweather had possessed the firearm. Contrary to Menyweather\u2019s argument, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the officers\u2019 testimony as lay opinion testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 701. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 701; <em>Ebron, </em>683 F.3d at 136-38. Moreover, any error was harmless because there is not a reasonable possibility that their testimony contributed to the conviction in light of the other strong evidence of Menyweather\u2019s guilt. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Medina, </em>346 F.3d 121, 127 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-21\">The judgment <em>of the </em>district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R, 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
