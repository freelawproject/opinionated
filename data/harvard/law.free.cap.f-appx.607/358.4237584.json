The sole issue on appeal is whether the statute of limitations bars Defendants-Appellees from accelerating the loan and foreclosing. Plaintiffs-Appellants Wilfredo and Ines Rivera appeal the district court\u2019s decision granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their Texas state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The Riveras insist that Appellees\u2019 right to foreclose is time-barred. The Riveras received an acceleration notice in 2004, meaning that,- according to the Riveras, Defendant-Appellee Bank of America, N.A.\u2019s (Bank of America) foreclosure efforts in 2013 were untimely under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 13.605(e)\u2019s four-year statute of limitations for foreclosure actions. Because the Riveras made, and the lender accepted, payments in 2006, we hold that Appellees abandoned the acceleration clause until Bank of America invoked its right to accelerate the balance in 2010. Thus, Bank of America\u2019s foreclosure action in 2013 was within the four-year limitations period, and we affirm summary judgment for Defendants-Appellees .</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">The following facts are undisputed. In 2001, the Riveras obtained a home-equity loan to refinance their mortgage. The loan was secured by a deed of trust naming Defendant-Appellee Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) as the beneficiary. (The note was ultimately assigned to Defendant-Appellee Bank of America, N.A., as successor by merger to Countrywide Home Loans.) The loan agreement contained an acceleration clause that entitled the lender, in the event of several missed payments, to accelerate the loan-requiring the borrower to either immediately pay the total balance or face foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">The Riveras defaulted on their loan payments in 2003. In January 2004, the Riv-eras received a letter informing them that the lender intended to invoke the acceleration clause. In May 2004, the Riveras filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. After their first bankruptcy petition was dismissed in April 2005, the Riveras again filed for bankruptcy in May 2005, and their second bankruptcy filing was closed in July 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">In 2006, the Riveras made, and the lender accepted, several payments on the note which were applied to the balance. These payments brought the loan current through March 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-19\">In 2010, Bank of America sent the Riv-eras a notice of default and intent to accelerate the entire balance of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>In 2012, Bank of America sent the Riv-eras a loan modification application under the federal Making Homes Affordable Program. This application begat a Kafkaesque saga in which the Riveras repeatedly sent completed applications and forms to Bank of America, only to hear from Bank of America either that the documents had been sent to the wrong place, or that the documents were incomplete \u2014 a troubling \u201crun around\u201d situation with which this Court is unfortunately all too familiar. <em>See, e.g., Choe v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>No. 14-10826, 605 Fed.Appx. 316, 318-20, 2015 WL 1285280, at *2-4 (5th Cir. Mar. 23, 2015) (per curiam) (unpublished); <em>Watson v. CitiMortgage, Inc., </em>530 Fed.Appx. 322, 324 (5th Cir.2013) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In February 2013, Bank of America notified the Riveras that their home would be posted for foreclosure sale on March 5, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">After inquiring again with Bank of America about the status of their loan-modification application and after receiving no meaningful response, the Riveras sued Bank of America and MERS in Texas state court seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaratory judgment prohibiting Bank of America from foreclosing because the statute of limitations had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Defendants-Appellees removed to federal district court invoking diversity jurisdiction, and the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to grant summary judgment to Defendants-Appellees. The Riveras timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and we have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We apply Texas substantive law and federal procedural law to the state-law claims. <em>See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). We review a grant of summary judgment de novo applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Auguster v. Vermilion Parish Sch. Bd., </em>249 F.3d 400, 402 (5th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We view all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant\u2019s favor. <em>Auguster, </em>249 F.3d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">On appeal, the Riveras argue Appellees were \u201cbarred by the statute of limitations from enforcing the Deed of Trust lien\u201d and foreclosing on the Riveras\u2019 home. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Under Texas law, a secured lender must foreclose on its \u201creal property lien not later than four years after ... the cause of action accrues.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 16.035(a). If the \u201cdeed of trust secured by real property contains an optional acceleration clause, default does not [of itself] start limitations running on the note. Rather, the action accrues only when the holder actually exercises its option to .accelerate.\u201d <em>Holy Cross Church of God in Christ v. Wolf, </em>44 S.W.3d 562, 566 (Tex.2001). Even if the noteholder notifies the borrower of the holder\u2019s intent to accelerate, \u201cthe holder can abandon acceleration if the holder continues to accept payments without exacting any remedies available to it upon declared maturity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">The central issue on appeal is whether Bank of America \u201cabandoned acceleration\u201d by continuing to accept payments from the Riveras in'2006, or whether the cause of action accrued when the Riveras were first notified of the lender\u2019s intent to accelerate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>in 2004. The Riveras admit that they made payments in 2006, which Bank of America \u201capplied retroactively to Appellants\u2019 ... 2004 payments.\u201d But, relying on an intermediate appellate decision, <em>Khan v. GBAK Properties, Inc., </em>371 S.W.3d 347, 353 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, no pet.), the Riveras contend there exists a fact issue whether Bank of America exacted remedies and thus acted inconsistently with abandonment. Bank of America counters that, between its acceptance of the Riveras\u2019 payment in 2006, the notice of default in 2010, and the Riveras\u2019 loan-modification application documents through 2012, the parties treated Bank of America\u2019s prior acceleration as abandoned until Bank of America invoked the acceleration clause in 2010. In reply, the Riveras stress that their 2006 payment was applied \u201cretroactively\u201d to their missed payments from 2004 and that Bank of America failed \u201cto foreclose on the property prior to August 2011.\u201d Appellants contend that they have provided \u201csufficient summary judgment evidence to create a fact issue whether acceleration had been abandoned.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We hold that Bank of America abandoned its prior acceleration by accepting continued payments and that its foreclosure claim was timely. The undisputed evidence establishes that Bank of America accepted payments from the Riveras in 2006. The Riveras do not point to contrary summary-judgment evidence that Bank of America nonetheless invoked its right to accelerate the loan and foreclose at any other point before 2010. Thus, Bank of America effectively abandoned its prior acceleration in 2004 by accepting payments in 2006. <em>See Holy Cross, </em>44 S.W.3d at 566-67. Thus, the cause of action did not accrue until Bank of America again invoked the acceleration clause in 2010. Accordingly, Bank of America\u2019s foreclosure action in 2013 was within the four-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The Riveras\u2019 reliance on <em>Khan </em>is misplaced. The procedural posture of <em>Khan </em>is exactly opposite of this case. In <em>Khan, </em>the note holder \u2014 rather than the borrower \u2014 obtained appellate relief from an adverse summary-judgment ruling. 371 S.W.3d at 350-52, 356. The trial court ruled that accepting payments during a bankruptcy proceeding did not establish abandonment and granted the borrower\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that the foreclosure action was time-barred. The intermediate appellate court reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 354-56. The appeals court noted that four payments were made and accepted by the lender <em>\u201cafter </em>the bankruptcy was dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355 (emphasis added). The court stressed that \u201c[i]t has been the law of Texas at least since 1901 that the parties can abandon acceleration and restore the contract by the parties\u2019 agreement or <em>actions.\u201d Id. </em>at 356 (emphasis added). The court concluded that Bank of Texas\u2019s actions in \u201caccepting] payment on the Note ... after acceleration without exacting any remedies available to it\u201d created a \u201cmaterial fact issue as to the abandonment of acceleration of the Note.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356. Thus, <em>Khan </em>supports the district court\u2019s ruling in this case that Bank of America\u2019s actions here\u2014 accepting the Riveras\u2019 payments on the note in 2006 \u2014 is evidence of abandonment. Because the Riveras do not point to any competent contrary evidence, the district court correctly granted Defendants-Appel-lees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\">. The Riveras do not provide case law distinguishing between payments made and accepted as <em>retroactively </em>applicable to previously missed payments-as opposed to payments accepted for prospective obligations. We do not see how this distinction makes a difference under Texas law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
