Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Mendoza-Gomez has filed a response which asks for the appointment of new counsel. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Mendoza-Gomez\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, Mendoza-Gomez\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel is DENIED, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
