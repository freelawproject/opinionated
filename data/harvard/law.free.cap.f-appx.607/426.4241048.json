He first argues that the district court procedurally erred by failing to calculate the applicable guidelines range and by failing to consider the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). As Walker concedes, because he did not object in the district court, plain error review applies. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-21\">The record on appeal does not show that the district court calculated the guidelines range or explicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. However, we conclude that Walker has not shown that any error affected his substantial rights. In his appellate brief, Walker calculated the applicable guidelines range as 8 to 14 months of imprisonment, which is consistent with the sentencing range that the Government asserts was considered by the district court. Walker\u2019s sentence of 12 months of imprisonment was within this range. In addition, because the district court heard and considered the statements of Walker and his counsel, we conclude that Walker has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that an explicit discussion of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors or additional explanation of the sentencing decision would have resulted in a lesser sentence. <em>See United States v. Culbertson, </em>712 F.3d 235, 243 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Walker also argues that the additional sentence of supervised release imposed constituted an ambiguous or illegal sentence. We review a claim of an illegal sentence de novo, even if the defendant failed to object in the district court. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>600 F.3d 387, 388 (5th Cir.2010). After imposing a 12-month sentence of imprisonment, the district court ordered that Walker serve an additional supervised release term of 24 months or \u201cwhatever amount of time is unused.\u201d We agree with the parties that this could be interpreted as imposing as much as 29.5 months of supervised release, which would result in an illegal sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h). Therefore, we VACATE the sentence in part and REMAND to the district court with instructions to modify the judgment to reflect that Walker is sentenced to 24 months of supervised release.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-16\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
