Jackie Lyons, a citizen of Georgia, suffered injuries as a result of the accident, and Anna St. Laurent, the driver of the other car, died as a result of her injuries. Mr. Lyons filed a diversity action in the Northern District of Georgia against Ms. St. Laurent\u2019s estate and Ms. St. Laurent\u2019s employer. Michael O\u2019Quinn, the administrator of Ms. St. Laurent\u2019s estate, moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that because he, Ms. St. Laurent, and Mr. Lyons were all citizens of Georgia, complete diversity was lacking. Mr. Lyons responded and in part urged the district court to dismiss Mr. O\u2019Quinn \u2014 the non-diverse defendant \u2014 as a dispensable party in order to preserve diversity jurisdiction. The district court rejected Mr. Lyons\u2019 request and dismissed the case, holding that Mr. O\u2019Quinn was an indispensable party whose presence as a defendant destroyed diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">We conclude that the district court erred in ruling that Mr. O\u2019Quinn is an indispensable party and reverse as to that issue. We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Mr. Lyons failed to meet his initial burden of establishing complete diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">Mr. Lyons filed suit against Mr. O\u2019Quinn, Humana Market Point, Inc., and Humana Inc. (collectively \u201cHumana\u201d), alleging that on October 12, 2009, Ms. St. Laurent negligently drove her vehicle the wrong way on Interstate 20, causing a collision with the tractor-trailer Mr. Lyons was driving. Mr. Lyons pled damages in excess of $20,000,000.00 for physical and emotional injuries and loss of income. He alleged that diversity jurisdiction existed because at the time of the accident Ms. St. Laurent was a citizen of Russia, and Hu-mana was a citizen of Kentucky.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Lyons\u2019 claims against Humana are based on the theory of respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">Mr. O\u2019Quinn moved to the dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), arguing that there was no diversity because Ms. St. Laurent&gt;-r-and consequently her estate, and he as its administrator \u2014 were citizens of Georgia. In support of his motion, Mr. O\u2019Quinn filed (1) a certified copy of Ms. St. Laurent\u2019s death certificate (indicating that Ms. St. Laurent was a citizen of the United States and a resident of Georgia), (2) a copy of Ms. St.- Laurent\u2019s 1-9 Form (containing the same information), and (3) a certified copy of the petition for letters of administration filed in probate court in Henry County, Georgia (indicating that Mr. St. Laurent was domiciled in Georgia).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">In response to Mr. O\u2019Quinn\u2019s motion to dismiss, and in the face of evidence to the contrary, Mr. Lyons continued to argue that Ms. St. Laurent was a Russian citizen at the time of her death, and that, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>result, the district court had \u201csubject-matter jurisdiction over all the defendants.\u201d Mr. Lyons alternatively argued that to the extent there was a jurisdictional defect, it could be \u201ccured by dismissing the non-diverse defendant^]\u201d \u2014 i.e., Mr. O\u2019Quinn, as administrator of the estate \u2014 thus allowing Mr. Lyons to proceed against Humana.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Mr. O\u2019Quinn responded that he was an indispensable party and could not be dismissed from the case. He claimed that if he were dismissed and Mr. Lyons was permitted to proceed against Humana, Ms. St. Laurent\u2019s estate would be at risk of inconsistent judgments, and Humana would be at risk of \u201cdouble obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The district court ultimately agreed with Mr. O\u2019Quinn and dismissed the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In so doing, the district court ruled that Mr. Lyons had not carried his burden of showing complete diversity, and that because Mr. O\u2019Quinn was an indispensable party, he could not be dismissed to cure the jurisdictional defect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Babicz v. Sch. Bd. of Broward Cnty., </em>135 F.3d 1420, 1421 (11th Cir.1998). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings with regard to jurisdiction for clear error. <em>See Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London v. Osting-Schwinn, </em>613 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th Cir.2010). We agree with the district court that Mr. Lyons failed t\u00f3 carry his burden of establishing complete diversity. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order as to this issue.'</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">\u201cDiversity jurisdiction, as a general rule, requires complete diversity-every plaintiff must be diverse from every defendant.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Hosp. Auth. of Randolph Cnty., </em>22 F.3d 1559, 1564 (11th Cir.1994). \u201c[T]he party invoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts supporting the existence of federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>McCormick v. Aderholt, </em>293 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">Mr. Lyons presented no evidence supporting his allegation that Ms. St. Laurent was a Russian citizen at the time of the accident. In fact, when faced with overwhelming evidence to the contrary, this was all Mr. Lyons could muster: \u201cPlaintiff maintains that on the day of the decedent\u2019s death in this case she was a citizen of Russia and that the best evidence of her Russian citizenship would be her Russian birth certificate^]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> D.E. 9 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>There is no doubt Ms. St. Laurent was <em>bom </em>in Russia. <em>See </em>D.E. 2-4 (Ms. St. Laurent\u2019s certificate of death, indicating that her place of birth was Russia). Her place of birth, however, is not determinative on the question of her citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. As the district court correctly held, Mr. O\u2019Quinn presented undisputed proof that Ms. St. Laurent was a citizen of the United States and a resident of Georgia on the date of the accident. And, it is clear that \u201cthe legal representative of the estate of a decedent shall be deemed to be a citizen only of the same State as the decedent.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(2). <em>See also Palmer, </em>22 F.3d at 1562, 1570 n. 1. (citing \u00a7 1332(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">The district court correctly ruled that Mr. Lyons failed to meet his burden of establishing complete diversity and that the parties are not completely diverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Having concluded that Mr. O\u2019Quinn\u2019s presence as a defendant destroyed complete diversity, we next turn to whether Mr. O\u2019Quinn could be dismissed in order to cure the jurisdictional defect. In determining that Mr. O\u2019Quinn was an indispensable party, and therefore could not be dismissed from the case to preserve diversity jurisdiction, the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAr\">If this case were to proceed, the Court would still have to determine issues relevant to St. Laurent \u2014 such as whether she was Defendants\u2019 employee and whether she was acting within the scope of her employment at the time of the accident. Because an employer and employee can be jointly and severally liable, finding St. Laurent was not acting in the scope of her employment in this case could impair or impede the estate\u2019s ability to protects [sic] its interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">D.E. 20 at 7. To the extent that the district court held that potential joint and several tort liability against Ms. St. Laurent\u2019s estate and Humana inextricably led to the conclusion that Mr. O\u2019Quinn was an indispensable party, it was mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision regarding whether a party is indispensable. <em>See Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. v. Dolgencorp, LLC, 746 F.3d </em>1008, 1039 (11th Cir.2014). <em>Cf. Laker Airways, Inc. v. British Airways, PLC, </em>182 F.3d 843, 847 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cWe review dismissal for failure to join an indispensable party for abuse of discretion.\u201d). \u201c \u2018A district court abuses its discretion when, in reaching a decision, it applies an incorrect legal standard^]\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rigel Ships Agencies, Inc., </em>432 F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>S.E.C. v. Smyth, </em>420 F.3d 1225, 1230 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">We recognize that, in determining whether a party is indispensable, a district court may base its findings \u201con stated pragmatic considerations, especially the effect on parties and on litigation.\u201d <em>In re Torcise, </em>116 F.3d 860, 865 (11th Cir.1997). And it appears that the district court in this case took pragmatic considerations into account when it found that Mr. O\u2019Quinn was an indispensable party. There is a binding, bright-line rule, however, which militates against taking a pragmatic approach in a case like this one. And the rule is that where joint tortfeasors may be jointly and severally liable, neither tortfeasor is an indispensable party. <em>See Temple v. Synthes Corp., </em>498 U.S. 5, 7, 111 S.Ct. 315, 112 L.Ed.2d 263 (1990) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">In <em>Temple, </em>the Supreme Court held that tortfeasors who face joint and several liability are not indispensable parties, explaining that \u201c[i]t has long been the rule that it is not necessary for all joint tortfea-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>sors to be named as defendants in a single lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(collecting cases). \u201cThe Advisory Committee Notes to [the 1966 revision of] Rule 19(a) explicitly state that a tortfeasor with the usual joint-and-several liability is merely a permissive party to an action against another with like liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We have applied the same bright-line rule. <em>See, e.g., McCain v. Clearview Dodge Sales, Inc., </em>574 F.2d 848, 850 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201cThis Court has held that joint creditors are \u2018jointly and severally* liable to consumers ... therefore, [neither is] an indispensable party because the plaintiff could be awarded judgment against [either] defendant alone.\u201d); <em>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Teas, </em>286 F.2d 373, 380 (5th Cir.1961) (explaining that \u201cunder a joint and several obligation the obligee can sue either or both obli-gors!,]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he privilege of suing one without joining the other is a substantial benefit to the obligee which we think cannot be frustrated by holding that the other several obligor must be joined as an indispensable party.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Regrettably, neither party here brought these cases to the district court\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">In Georgia, \u201cunder the principle of re-spondeat superior, employers are generally jointly and severally liable along with the tortfeasor employee for the torts of employees committed within the scope of employment.\u201d <em>Chorey, Taylor &amp; Feil, P.C. v. Clark, </em>273 Ga. 143, 539 S.E.2d 139, 140 (2000). This principle, moreover, has been codified by statute in Georgia. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 51-2-2 (West 2015) (\u201cEvery person shall be liable for torts committed by ... his servant by his command or in the prosecution and within the scope of his business, whether the same are committed by negligence or voluntarily.\u201d). Under <em>Temple, </em>then, Mr. O\u2019Quinn was not an indispensable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">As noted earlier, the district court held that because joint and several liability applied, Mr. O\u2019Quinn was a necessary and indispensable party to the litigation. We conclude that the district court applied the incorrect legal standard, and thus, abused its discretion when it denied Mr. Lyons\u2019s request to dismiss Mr. O\u2019Quinn as a dispensable party. <em>See Rigel Ships Agencies, Inc., </em>432 F.3d at 1291. Binding precedent dictates that Mr. O\u2019Quinn is not an indispensable party even though there is joint and several liability and even though Hu-mana\u2019s liability is predicated on Ms. St. Laurent\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Mr. Lyons failed to establish diversity jurisdiction. But we reverse the district court\u2019s ruling that Mr. O\u2019Quinn was an indispensable party, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-9\">. Mr. Lyons acknowledged that Ms. St. Laurent\u2019s estate and Mr. O'Quinn, as administrator of the estates, were citizens of Georgia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\">. We have considered Mr. Lyons\u2019s claim on appeal with respect to the constitutionality of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 and find it wholly lacking in merit. Mr. Lyons' claim that the district court erred in not transferring his case back to state court is also without merit, as the case was not removed to federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b961-10\">. In response to Mr. O\u2019Quinn\u2019s motion to dismiss, counsel for Mr. Lyons stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-11\">Plaintiff maintains that a deceased person lacks legal capacity to be a citizen of any state or foreign country upon death, especially over two years after death when the civil action is filed in federal court. Thus, the representative could not legally be a citizen of the state or foreign county of the decedent to maintain subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 USC [sic] Section 1332.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">D.E. 9 at 3-4. While we appreciate counsel\u2019s existential argument, we have held that \u201d[w]here an estate is a party, the citizenship that counts for diversity purposes is that of the decedent, and she is deemed to be a citizen of the state in which she was domiciled at the time of her death.\u201d <em>King v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>505 F.3d 1160, 1170 (11th Cir.2007). There is no question that, on this record, Ms. St. Laurent was a citizen of Georgia, and therefore, so is Mr. O'Quinn for diversity jurisdiction purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b963-6\">. We note that Georgia courts apply the same rule. <em>See, e.g., Georgia Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. Moore, </em>328 Ga.App. 350, 762 S.E.2d 184, 186 (2014) (\"[U]nder Georgia law, a jointly and severally liable person is not a necessary party to a lawsuit involving another such person.\u201d); <em>Hillside Orchard Farms, Inc. v. Murphy, </em>222 Ga.App. 106, 473 S.E.2d 181, 185 (1996) (\"Even in a case based on the principle of respondeat superior, a master may be sued alone.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
