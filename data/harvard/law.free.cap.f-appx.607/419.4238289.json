Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 458-62 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015). In <em>Teran-Salas, </em>we determined that the appellant was not entitled to relief based merely on the existence of a theoretical possibility that the defendant could be convicted under Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112(a) for conduct that would not qualify as a federal drug trafficking offense. <em>See Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d at 458. Calix has not demonstrated \u201ca realistic probability that Texas would prosecute under an \u2018administering\u2019 theory in a way that does not also constitute either \u2018dispensing or \u2018distributing\u2019 under the federal sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461-62. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
