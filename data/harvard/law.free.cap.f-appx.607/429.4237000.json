Jones appeals the February 20, 2015 Order of the district court denying her leave to file her proposed negligence complaint based on the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act and denying her application to proceed in district court without prepaying fees or costs: She also appeals the district court\u2019s March 16, 2015 Order denying reconsideration of her Motion for Leave to File.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>We have reviewed the entire record on appeal, including Appellant\u2019s brief and the district court\u2019s rulings. Our review satisfies us that the district court\u2019s Orders should be affirmed and that,- like her filings in district court, Appellant\u2019s appeal is wholly without merit and is therefore legally frivolous. Further, Appellant is warned that any future efforts to continue this litigation in the district court or in this court could result in sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">AFFIRMED, with sanctions warning.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
