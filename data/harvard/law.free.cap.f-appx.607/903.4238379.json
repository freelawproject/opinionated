Defendants cross-appeal the denial of Defendants\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Credit Services was an Alabama limited liability company organized for the purpose of collecting and liquidating consumer debts. In October 2007, in accordance with the terms of the LLC\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, the LLC dissolved due to the death of one of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Following the LLC\u2019s dissolution Defendant Clinton, the sole remaining member of the LLC, began winding-up the LLC\u2019s business and affairs. This included attempting to collect on judgments already entered in favor of Credit Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">In July 2006 (before the LLC\u2019s dissolution), Credit Services obtained a default judgment against Plaintiff. Plaintiff does not dispute the validity of the default judgment order. In August 2012, Defendants \u2014 in the name of Credit Services\u2014 filed a writ of garnishment against' Plaintiff seeking to. collect the outstanding 2006 judgment plus interest. Defendants filed a second garnishment proceeding against Plaintiff in July 2013, seeking again to collect the still-outstanding 2006 judgment plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Plaintiff filed this putative class action against Defendants for alleged violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 (\u201cFDCPA\u201d). Briefly stated, Plaintiff contends that Defendants violated the FDCPA when they filed garnishment proceedings on behalf of an entity that had dissolved under Alabama law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied Defendants\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Skop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">\u201cIn rendering a decision based on state substantive law, a federal court must decide the case the way it appears the state\u2019s highest court would.\u201d <em>Ernie Haire Ford, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>260 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). Where the state\u2019s highest court has not spoken to an issue, we look to decisions of the state\u2019s intermediate appellate courts unless we are \u201cconvinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.\u201d <em>Mesa Air Group, Inc. v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>573 F.3d 1124, 1131 n. 8 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">In interpreting the meaning of a statute, the Alabama Supreme Court \u201clooks to the plain meaning of the words as written by the legislature.\u201d <em>See DeKalb Cnty. LP Gas Co. v. Suburban Gas, Inc., </em>729 So.2d 270, 275 (Ala.1998). \u2018Words used in a statute must be given their natural, plain, ordinary, and commonly understood meaning, and where plain language is used a court is bound to interpret that language to mean exactly what it says.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Alabama courts look beyond the language of a statute to determine legislative intent \u201conly if there is no rational way to interpret the words as stated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">Under Alabama law, a dissolved limited liability company may continue its existence after dissolution to engage in business that is \u201cnecessary or appropriate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>wind up and liquidate its business and affairs.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 10A-5-7.04(a). Alabama law provides expressly that a limited liability company\u2019s dissolution does not \u201c[t]erminate or suspend a proceeding pending by or against the limited liability company on the effective date of dissolution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10A-5-7.04(b)(2). Moreover, the person responsible for winding-up the limited liability company\u2019s business after dissolution is authorized to, among other things, \u201cprosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or administrative\u201d and to \u201cperform other necessary and appropriate acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10A-5-7.03(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Under this plain statutory language, Defendants were authorized, as part of them efforts to wind-up Credit Services\u2019s business, to file writs of garnishment against Plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Credit Services obtained a valid default judgment against Plaintiff before its dissolution. That judicial proceeding remained pending against Plaintiff when the LLC dissolved. And the LLC\u2019s dissolution did not terminate or suspend automatically the proceeding. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 10A-5-7.04(b)(2). Defendant Clinton \u2014 as the remaining member of the LLC engaged in winding-up the LLC\u2019s business by and through the LLC\u2019s lawyers \u2014 was authorized to continue prosecuting the pending proceeding against Plaintiff. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 10A-57.03(b). Such authority encompassed the filing of ancillary garnishment proceedings against Plaintiff to enforce the pre-existing judgment. <em>See Rice v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>628 So.2d 582, 583 (Ala.1993) (\u201cA post-judgment garnishment proceeding \u2018is an ancillary proceeding seeking satisfaction of a prior judgment, and not an original civil suit.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Plaintiff contends, however, that Alabama law imposes a time limit on Defendants\u2019 ability to continue prosecuting the pending proceeding against her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, Plaintiff argues that a dissolved LLC must complete its winding-up procedures \u2014 including the prosecution of pending claims \u2014 within two years after dissolution. Nothing in the plain language of Alabama\u2019s statutes imposes a two-year cap. And Plaintiffs reliance on the state trial court decision (which the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed without opinion) and on the published concurrence by an Alabama Supreme Court justice in <em>Berks v. </em>Cade<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is misplaced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Berks v. Cade </em>involved an entirely different issue about when a dissolved LLC may <em>commence a new proceeding </em>against a third party, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>the cited opinions say nothing about when a dissolved LLC may prosecute proceedings that were <em>pending </em>at the time of dissolution. In the light of (1) the absence of an express statutory time limit and (2) the plain statutory language providing that an LLC\u2019s dissolution does not terminate pending proceedings, we cannot infer that Alabama law imposes a rigid two-year cap on a dissolved LLC\u2019s ability to prosecute pending proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">We also cannot infer that Alabama law requires a dissolved LLC to complete its winding-up procedures within a \u201creasonable\u201d time after dissolution. Alabama law provides that the person winding-up a dissolved LLC may, among other things, \u201cpreserve the company business or property as a going concern <em>for a reasonable time. </em>\u201d <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 10A-5-7.03(b) (emphasis added). This phrase is separated clearly by semicolons from the other listed winding-up activities, including, in pertinent part, the phrase \u201cprosecute and defend actions and proceedings\u201d and the phrase \u201cperform other necessary and appropriate acts.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Under the plain statutory language \u2014 and contrary to Plaintiffs argument \u2014 the term \u201cfor a reasonable time\u201d modifies <em>only </em>the ability to maintain the LLC\u2019s business as a going concern and imposes no time limitation on the performance of the other listed winding-up activities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Because Defendants were authorized, as a matter of Alabama law, to file the pertinent writs of garnishment against Plaintiff in the name of Credit Services, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Moreover, because Alabama law imposes no \u201creasonableness\u201d limitation on the time a dissolved LLC has to prosecute pending actions, the district court was within the scope of its discretion in denying Plaintiffs Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d) motion seeking discovery about the reasonableness of Defendants\u2019 delay in filing the writs of garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Nothing evidences that Plaintiff acted in bad faith in pursuing her claim against Defendants; the district court abused no' discretion in denying Defendants\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-9\">. Thomas abandons expressly her claims, under 15 U.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e(2)(A) and 1692f(l), that Defendants violated certain notice requirements of the FDCPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-5\">. Defendants were also authorized, as a matter of Alabama law, to recover post-judgment interest on the outstanding 2006 judgment against Plaintiff. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 8-8-10 (providing that judgments shall bear interest); <em>Birmingham Pain Ctr., Inc. v. Cosgrove, </em>896 So.2d 538, 541 (Ala.Civ.App.2004) (\"Section 8-8-10 authorizes the payment of post-judgment interest\u201d which \"continues to accrue on any final judgment or any portion thereof that remains unsatisfied\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b934-6\">. The parties do not dispute the applicability of Alabama's general statutes of limitation pertaining to the filing of garnishments or to the enforcement of final judgments. On appeal, we address <em>only </em>whether Alabama law imposes an additional \"special\u201d time limitation \u2014 under Alabama's Business and Nonprofit Entities Code \u2014 on the ability of a dissolved LLC to file writs of garnishment to enforce a final judgment against a third party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b934-10\">. <em>See Cade v. Berks, No. </em>01-CV-2008-903634 (Cir. Ct. Jefferson Cnty., Nov. 19, 2010); <em>Berks v. Cade, </em>158 So.3d 438 (Ala.2014) (overruling the application for rehearing without opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b934-11\">. Neither the state trial court decision nor Alabama Supreme Court's affirmance without opinion has binding precedential value. <em>See Scrushy v. Tucker, </em>70 So.3d 289, 309 (Ala.2011) (state trial court decisions have no precedential value); <em>Mesa Air Group, Inc., </em>573 F.3d at 1131 n. 8 (this Court does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>look to state trial court decisions to determine the law of a state); Ala. R.App. P. 53(d) (\"An order of affirmance issued by the Supreme Court ... by which a judgment or order is affirmed without a court opinion ... shall have no precedential value\u201d). Moreover, nothing suggests that a published single-justice concurrence to an Alabama Supreme Court order overruling \u2014 without a court opinion \u2014 an application for rehearing of a non-precedential decision would, itself, be imperative. To the extent that these decisions constitute persuasive authority, however, they are distinguishable from the issue involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b935-7\">. We are aware of the language in Ala.Code \u00a7 10A-1-9.12(a)(3), which provides that \"As soon as reasonably practicable after a domestic entity is dissolved, the domestic entity shall; ... perform any other act required to wind up its business and affairs.\u201d This provision applies \"to all entities formed under or governed by Chapters 2 to 11, inclusive, except to the extent, if any, that any provision of this chapter is inconsistent with <em>or as otherwise provided by </em>the provision of this title or other statutory or constitutional <em>provisions specifically applicable to the entity.\" </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 10A-1-1.02(a) (emphasis added). In concluding that Alabama law imposed no unreasonable-delay restrictions on garnishments in a case like this one, the district court discussed expressly only the language in section 10A-5-7.03. We take this approach to mean that the district court concluded that the general provision in section 10A-1-9.12 (titled \"Winding up procedures\u201d) was inapplicable because winding-up procedures specific to LLCs were <em>\"otherwise provided \" </em>by section 10A-5-7.03 (titled \"Winding up\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
