A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Abq\">Defendants Township of Ewing and the City of Trenton on December 31, 1974 entered into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>contract for the construction, operation, maintenance and management of a solid waste transfer facility to be located in Ewing Township. Plaintiff, a citizen of the Township of Ewing, filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs seeking a temporary and permanent injunction \u201cenjoining defendants from acquiring, constructing, maintaining or operating \u2018such a facility\u2019 until a public referendum has been held\u201d pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:48-18. Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed, resulting in a judgment for defendants. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The Interlocal Services Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40 :8A \u2014 1 <em>et seq., </em>provides that local units of this State may enter into agreements with each other for the \u201cjoint provision within their several jurisdictions of any service which any party to the agreement is empowered to render within its own jurisdiction.\u201d The statute details the manner in which municipalities should proceed in entering into such agreements by the enactment of ordinances or resolutions. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40 :8A-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Plaintiff does not contend that the agreement was adopted contrary to the provisions of that statute but does argue that <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40 :48-18 requires the approval of the voters before proceeding. That statute provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">No municipality under any such contract may acquire, construct, maintain or operate any property or service defined as a \u201cpublic utility\u201d by section 48:2-13 of the title Public Utilities, until a majority of the legal voters in the municipality affected voting at an election advertised, held and conducted in accordance with the laws relating to elections shall vote in favor of the proposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Plaintiff next points to the definition of \u201cpublic utility\u201d contained in <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>48:2-13. The term \u201cpublic utility\u201d as there defined includes \u201cevery individual, co-partnership, association, corporation * * * that now or hereafter may own, operate, manage or control within this State any * * * solid waste collection, solid waste disposal * * * plant or equipment for public use under privileges granted or hereafter to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>granted by this State or any political subdivision thereof. * * *<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Plaintiff argues that when the Legislature required approval by referendum pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:48-18 of any \u201cproperty or service defined as a \u2018public utility\u2019 \u201d it intended to include more than an operating public utility within its provisions. He argues that the statute indicates the facility need not actually be a public utility to require voter approval, but only one of the properties or services listed in <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>48:2-13. By implication, plaintiff argues, that had the Legislature intended otherwise, the statute would have read \u201cno municipality may operate any public utility as defined by section 48:2-13,\u201d rather than \u201cno municipality * * * may * * * operate any property or service defined as a \u2018public utility\u2019 by section 48:2-13.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We disagree. What <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:48-18 refers to is not a physical structure such as a solid waste collection plant but rather the use thereof in the maintenance and operation of a \u201cpublic utility.\u201d The term \u201cpublic utility\u201d as defined in <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>48:2-13, by its terms, is intended to refer to one maintaining and operating a business or service \u201cfor public use under privileges granted or hereafter to be granted by this State or any political subdivision thereof.\u201d It refers to- one granted a franchise.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">It has long been established that a public utility may not operate without a franchise granting such a right. * * * Generally speaking, a franchise is a privilege of a public nature conferred by government on an individual or corporation to do that \u201cwhich does not belong to the citizens of the country generally by common right.\u201d In the case of public utilities, it means permission to <em>operate </em>a business, peculiarly of a public nature and generally monopolistic. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>* * * [In <em>re Petition of South Lakewood Water Co., </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>230, 238 (1672)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">See also, <em>In re Complaint by Morris Tp., </em>49 <em>N. J. </em>194, 204 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\"> A municipality, or two municipalities jointly, exercising solely for the benefit of their respective inhabitants, the \u201cdiscretionary power to provide a municipal service for the collection and disposal of garbage\u201d <em>(Pleasure Bay Apts. v. Long Branch, </em>66 <em>N. J. </em>79, 84 (1974)), within the municipality, is not operating a public utility pursuant to a franchise granted. See also, <em>Capasso v. Pucillo, </em>132 <em>N. J. Super. </em>542 (Ch. Div. 1974), aff'd 132 <em>N. J. Super. </em>473 (App. Div.), certif. den. 65 <em>N. J. </em>576 (1974). It follows that voter approval pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:48-18 is not necessary here.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the provisions of the Interlocal Services Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:8A-1 <em>et secq., </em>omitting as it does all requirements for referendum approval of contracts entered into pursuant to the provisions thereof, is an implied repeal of the requirements of V. <em>J. 8. A. </em>40:48 \u2014 18 for the conduct of a referendum insofar as public utilities may be the subject matter of such contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The agreement between the defendants provides that, if both parties agree, the facilities may be made available to others than the two contracting parties. Should the parties proceed to do so, the operation of the joint project may then become a \u201cpublic utility\u201d requiring approval at a referendum pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40 :48 \u2014 18 for the maintenance and operation of the facility for others. That, however, is not the situation now presented to us, and we express no opinion thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\"> The Solid Waste Utility Control Act of 1970, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>48: 13A-3(b), defines solid waste collection as \u201cthe activity related to pick-up and transportation of solid waste from its source or location to a disposal site.\u201d A transfer station is defined as, \u201cA facility at which solid waste is transferred from collection vehicles to haulage vehicles for transportation to a solid waste facility.\u201d <em>N. J. A. C. </em>7:26-1.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
