J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ACL\">Plaintiff New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association (Association) is an organization of \u2022 all property and casualty insurance companies authorized to do business in New Jersey. The Association was created by \u00a7 6 of the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>17: 30A-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Guaranty Act). In the present case the Association appeals from an action of the Commissioner of Insurance of New Jersey (Commissioner), notifying the Association of the insolvency of Summit Insurance Company of New York (Summit), a member of the Association, thus triggering the Association\u2019s liability for certain claims of Summit\u2019s New Jersey policyholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The main purpose of the Guaranty Act is to protect New Jersey policyholders of an insolvent insurance company from the financial loss and escessive delay in payment of claims that can result from an insolvency. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>17:30A-2(a). To provide the mechanism for such protection, the act created the Association and gave it the power to assess its member-insurers for the costs of protection. <em>N. J. 8. </em>A. 17:30A-8(a) (3). In the event of a member-insurer\u2019s insolvency, the Association becomes liable for substantially all claims against the insurer by New Jersey claimants and policyholders that are incurred prior to or within 30 days after the determination of the insolvency. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>17: 30A-8 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The Guaranty Act defines an \u201cinsolvent insurer\u201d as an insurer authorized to do business in this State which is determined to be insolvent by a \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>17:30A-5 (e). It is this latter clause which creates the issue for decision here. More particularly the question is whether the Forth Carolina General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division (Forth Carolina court) was such a \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d when, on March 17, 1975, on application of the Commissioner of Insurance of that state, it entered an order declaring that \u201cthe defendant, Summit Insurance Company of New York is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>solvent.\u201d The order further appointed the Commissioner of Insurance of North Carolina \u201cconservator\u201d of Summit, and directed him to take into his possession all of the assets of that company within that state, as provided in <em>N. C. Gen. Statutes, </em>\u00a7 58-155.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">On March 19, 1975 defendant Commissioner of Insurance of New Jersey, acting in accordance with <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17: 30A-10(a) (1), notified the Association that the North Carolina court had declared Summit insolvent. On March 24, 1975, pursuant to his authority under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17: 30A-10(b) (1), the Commissioner ordered the Association to notify Summit\u2019s insureds and other interested parties of the insolvency and of their rights under the Guaranty Act. On April 10, 1975 the Association filed a notice of appeal (or in the alternative motion for leave to appeal) from the Commissioner\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The Association contends that the North Carolina court is not a \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d within the meaning of the Guaranty Act and that the Commissioner\u2019s directive of March 19, 1975, which triggered the Association\u2019s liability for claims, was therefore without legal authority. The Association contends that the Guaranty Act must be interpreted so that only a court of the state of the insolvent insurer\u2019s domicile is deemed a \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The argument is that only the domiciliary state is competent as to all aspects of the corporate existence since it is the only state which can order liquidation of the corporation. Thus, in this instance the North Carolina court appointed the Commissioner of Insurance of that state as a conservator only of those assets of Summit which were within North Carolina. The Association also points out that on February 4, 1975, prior to the action of the North Carolina court, the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, Summit\u2019s domicile, applied to the Supreme Court of that state, which, based on the Superintendent\u2019s finding that Summit was \u201cinsolvent,\u201d appointed the Superintendent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\u201crehabilitator\u201d of Summit, pursuant to New York Insurance Law \u00a7 511. At that time, the Association notes, the New Jersey Commissioner of Insurance advised the Association <em>not </em>to begin its operations under the Guaranty Act. On the other hand, when the North Carolina court appointed its Superintendent conservator of Summit\u2019s assets within that state, the New Jersey Commissioner allegedly reversed himself and set in motion the mechanism of the Guaranty Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The Commissioner contends that the February 4, 1975 order of the Supreme Court of New York was not based on a determination by the <em>court </em>that Summit was insolvent, but rather was grounded in a determination of the Superintendent to that effect. In contrast, the Commissioner argues that the order of the-North Carolina court on March 17, 1975 contained a determination of insolvency by the <em>court </em>itself, which was a \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The Association concedes that it did not immediately obey the Commissioner\u2019s directive of March 24, 1975 and notify Summit\u2019s insureds and other interested persons of the determination of insolvency by the North Carolina court. It applied for emergent relief from the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey to stay the requirement that notice be immediately provided. When that application was denied it appealed that determination to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, which also denied appellant\u2019s application. Thereafter, without waiving its right to appeal the validity of the Commissioner\u2019s letter of March 24, 1975, the Guaranty Association on April 17 and April 24, 1975 published notice of the North Carolina court\u2019s determination of insolvency in the <em>Trenton </em>Times, the <em>Camden Courier </em>and the <em>Newark Star-Ledger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">On May 28, 1975 the New York Supreme Court terminated the rehabilitation proceedings ordered on February 4, 1975, declared that Summit was insolvent and ordered the company\u2019s liquidation. We are advised that it was shortly after the New York judgment that no'tice by mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>was given to Summit\u2019s policyholders and other interested parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Whether the New Jersey Commissioner\u2019s actions with respect to the New York order of February 4, 1975, and the North Carolina order of March 17, 1975, were or were not inconsistent, does not affect our task of deciding the meaning of the phrase \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d as used in \u00a7 5 of the Guaranty Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Statutes are to be interpreted in the light of their purpose and logic. 2A <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction </em>(4 ed., Sands 1972), \u00a7 45.05; <em>Horwitz v. Reichenstein, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>6 (1954). Section 2 of the Guaranty Act expressly states its purpose: to avoid \u201cexcessive delay\u201d in the payment of claims and to avoid \u201cfinancial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer * * <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17:30A-2(a). The act further provides that it is to be \u201cliberally construed to effect the purpose under section 2 which shall constitute an aid and guide to interpretation.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17:30A-4(a). To fulfill these objectives, the act must be interpreted to protect policyholders and claimants and to advance their interests rather than the interests of the Association. If the Association\u2019s interpretation were adopted, it would disserve the purpose of the act. It would cause, rather than hinder, \u201cexcessive delay\u201d in the payment of claims. If claimants and policyholders must await a determination of insolvency \u2022\u2014 and indeed an order of liquidation \u2014 by a court of the insurer\u2019s domicile, they would be subject to the very delays the legislation sought to prevent. Here Summit stopped paying claims on February 4, 1975, the date of the appointment of the Superintendent of Insurance of New York as rehabilitator. Adopting the Association\u2019s interpretation of the act would have postponed the triggering of protection and concomitant payment of claims under the act until May 28, 1975, when the New York Supreme Court entered its order of liquidation of Summit.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>If, as contended by the Association, the Legislature intended to say that only a court of the insurer\u2019s domicile is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\u201d and that a determination of insolvency means nothing less than the entry of an order of liquidation by such a court, the act could easily have stated just that in so many words. For example, the Ohio Guaranty Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defines \"insolvent insurer\u201d as one \u201cdecreed by a court of competent jurisdiction of the <em>state of such insurer\u2019s domicile </em>to be insolvent, and ordered by or pursuant to the authority of such court to be liquidated.\u201d <em>Ohio rev. Code </em>\u00a7 3955.01(c) (Emphasis supplied). Also, the Pennsylvania Guaranty Act defines \u201cinsolvent insurer\u201d as \"an insurer determined to be insolvent * * * by a court of competent jurisdiction of <em>the insurer\u2019s domiciliary state * * </em>40 Pa. Statutes \u00a7 1701.103(6) (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\"> Entirely apart from the foregoing analysis of the (Legislature\u2019s intent, there really is no reason to belabor the issue. It is the rule in this State that unless another or different meaning is expressly indicated, statutory words should be given their generally accepted meaning. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>1:1\u20141. See <em>Fahey v. Jersey City, </em>53 <em>N. J. </em>103, 107 (1968). The statutory words, \"court of competent jurisdiction\u201d, are clear. A court has jurisdiction to decide a case if three elements are present. The state involved must have sufficient minimum contacts with the parties or their property to make the exercise of its authority reasonable; the state must have entrusted the exercise of that authority to the court in question and, lastly, the parties must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>Restatement, Conflict of Laws </em>3d, Introductory Note, C. 3 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">As stated in <em>Leachman v. Kite, </em>133 <em>N. J. L. </em>240, 241 (Sup. Ct. 1945), aff\u2019d 133 <em>N. J. L. </em>613 (E. &amp; A. 1946) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>First. The court must have cognizance of the class of cases to which the one to be adjudged belongs. Second. The proper parties must be present. And, Third. The point decided must be, in substance and effect, within the issue, [at 241]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The North Carolina court satisfied the above criteria. Summit was authorized to do business in that state and had assets within its borders. The North Carolina legislature has authorized the court to determine insolvency in such cases. <em>N. C. Gen. Statutes </em>\u00a7\u00a7 58-155.18, 155.2(1), 155.7. Finally, Summit received proper notice and a hearing. Clearly, the North Carolina court was a \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It follows that the court\u2019s determination of March 17, 1975 that Summit was insolvent triggered the mechanism of New Jersey\u2019s Guaranty Act. Therefore, the actions of the Commissioner on March 19 and March 24, 1975, are affirmed. However, in view of the special circumstances that notice by mail to Summit\u2019s New Jersey insureds and other interested parties was not given until after the \u00a1judgment of the New York Supreme Court of May 28, 1975, we conclude on equitable considerations that the Association should be obligated for all \u201ccovered claims\u201d against Summit which arose prior to and 30 days after that date. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17:30A-8(a)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\"> These acts, as well as the New Jersey act, were adopted following a model law proposed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
