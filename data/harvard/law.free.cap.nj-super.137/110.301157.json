A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ASV\">Plaintiff commenced an action for $3,095 in rent due from defendants for July 1973 through October 1973. The first-floor apartment which defendants occupied was located in the Stella Wright Project owned and operated by plaintiff. By way of defense and setoff defendants asserted plaintiff\u2019s breach of an implied warranty of habitability <em>(Berzito v. Gambino, </em>63 <em>N. J. </em>460, 467, 469 (1973)), complaining of lack of heat and hot water, dirty hallways, incinerator smoke in hallways and in their apartment, falling plaster, failure to paint the apartment, water leaks in the \u00a1bathroom and kitchen, flooding from a standby pipe in the hallway, broken windows and disrepair of the kitchen stove. The trial judge allowed an abatement of rent equal to approximately 30% of the back rent due, entering judgment in favor of plaintiff for $1,467.50. Plaintiff appeals from the allowance of the rent abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">After the appeal was taken defendants did not cross-appeal from the determination of rent due but, instead, paid the judgment in full. A warrant of satisfaction was then filed. In view of plaintiff\u2019s contentions before us we conclude that, in accepting the portion of rent found to be due from defendants, plaintiff did not intend to and did not waive its right to pursue this appeal from the trial judge\u2019s allowance of the rent abatement. This disposes of the motion made by plaintiff during the pendency of this appeal seeking a determination that the appeal has not been rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Plaintiff contends that the remedy of allowing an abatement of rent where the tenant has not made repairs should not apply to public housing where the rents charged are limited by law to levels below that prevailing in the private sector. 43 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1403(1), (3). By limiting the amount of rent to a portion of a tenant\u2019s income the tenant receives a subsidy to the extent that the value of the apartment or the cost in furnishing the housing unit ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ceeds the rent paid. But to deprive a tenant of an offset to the extent that the habitability of the premises has been substantially diminished would result in a diminution of the subsidy intended to be furnished and a diminution of the housing authority\u2019s incentive to remedy defects and deficiencies. Accordingly, we conclude that an abatement in rent equal to the proportionate loss of habitability is an effective remedy which may be afforded to tenants of public housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">It is clear that in fashioning an appropriate remedy no one solution will necessarily exhaust \u201cthe creative powers\u201d of the courts. <em>Berzito v. Gambino, supra, </em>63 <em>N. J. </em>at 469. Concededly the Legislature excluded public housing from the statutory procedures authorizing tenants in substandard dwelling units to deposit their rents with a court-appointed administrator for use in remedying defective conditions. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:42-85 <em>et seq. </em>This act became effective on June 21, 1971 (L. 1971, <em>c. </em>224, \u00a7 14) after <em>Marini v. Ireland, </em>56 <em>N. J. </em>130 (1970) was decided, and there is nothing in the act to indicate that its provisions were exclusive of other couTt-fashioned remedies. Rather, the statute affords an elective, not a mandatory, remedy which \u201cmay\u201d be sought. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:42-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Similarly, we conclude that allowance of an abatement in rent for uncorrected defects in housing facilities or services is not precluded by preemption of federal or state law. Thus, allowance of a setoff from rent due is within the jurisdiction of the county district court. <em>Marini v. Ireland, supra, </em>56 <em>N. J. </em>at 140; <em>Berzito v. Gambino, supra, </em>63 <em>N. J. </em>at 469. Of course, the federal and state legislative schemes contemplated establishing low rent levels, which, together with federal grants (42 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1410) and indirect local subsidies in the form of payments in lieu of taxes (42 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1410(h)), would provide for operation of the project \u201con a solvent basis.\u201d 42 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1410(a); see also <em>N. J. S. A. </em>55:14A-8. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>essential objective of the federal law is to assist state and local governments in alleviating \u201cunsafe and insanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of low income * * *.\u201d 42 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1401. See also, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>55:14A-8 which provides for fixing rents at the \u201clowest possible rates consistent with its providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations * * It is not the statutory design to require tenants to subsidize public housing by paying rent for substandard accommodations. The payment of rent and the maintenance by the landlord of decent, safe and sanitary dwelling units are correlative, \u201cmutually dependent\u201d obligations. See <em>Berzito v. Gambino, supra, </em>63 <em>N. J. </em>at 469. Nothing in the legislation suggests that providing habitable accommodations is subservient to the goal \u25a0of project solvency. Neither the tenants nor the courts have the responsibility to find a way to keep rent rolls at high enough levels to maintain the solvency of the projects. High vacancy rates due to unhabitable conditions may doom the economic stability of the venture. But this would afford no basis for taxing tenants above rent levels established within the statutory framework. Nor does it preclude reducing the rent paid by a tenant for that portion of habitable accommodations which the tenant has not received.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"> We do not find that the housing authority legislation exhausts the limits of plaintiff\u2019s financial responsibilities. Municipal housing authorities can be sued <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>55:14A-7(a); <em>Jersey City Sewerage Auth. v. Jersey City Housing Authority, </em>40 <em>N. J. </em>145 (1963); <em>Goldberg v. Newark Housing Auth., </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>578, 581 (1962)), and are subject to the substantive laws of the State. <em>Union City Housing Auth. v. Commonwealth Trust Co., </em>25 <em>N. J. </em>330, 335 (1957). The housing authority as a landlord can claim no exemption from the obligation to furnish habitable accommodations for its tenants. No federal regulation has been called to our attention which would prevent reducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>a tenant\u2019s rent when he has been deprived of facilities or services to which he is entitled and which are included in the established rent. Nor do we conceive that this judicial remedy infringes upon a domain fully occupied by legislative branches of government. The remedy of rent abatement has been held to apply to public housing in other jurisdictions. <em>Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, </em>363 <em>Mass. </em>184, 293 <em>N. E. </em>2d 831 (Sup. Jud. Ct. 1973); <em>Coleman v. United States, </em>311 <em>A. </em>2d 496 (D. C. Ct. of App. 1973); see <em>National Capital Housing Auth. v. Douglas, </em>333 <em>A. </em>2d 55, 56, n. 2 (D. C. Ct. of App. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We find no merit, also, to the contention that the principles of <em>Marini v. Ireland, supra, </em>do not apply to month-to-month tenancies, simply because that case dealt with a leasehold for one year. <em>Berzito v. Gambino, supra, </em>which followed <em>Marini </em>and which sanctioned the remedy afforded here, actually involved a weekly tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We reject also the contention that the abatement should be taken from a \u201cfair rental value\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determined on the basis of assumed free-market forces in the \u201cprivate sector,\u201d as distinguished from the rent fixed within the maximum levels established under governmental guidelines. 42 <em>17. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1402(1). This is as inappropriate as it is to suggest that a tenant who is dissatisfied should move out. See <em>Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, </em>53 <em>N. J. </em>444, 461-462 (1969); <em>Berzito v. Gambino, supra. </em>The premise of public housing is to furnish decent housing for the needy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u2014 the poor and the aged with limited income \u2014 where such housing is nonexistent or in short supply. It would frustrate this objective to allow a \"rebate\u201d against a higher, theoretical rent which would result in requiring the tenant to pay the original rent for substandard housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Appellant also contends that the trial judge failed to make allowance for the fact that some of the problems in the project may have been caused by tenants\u2019 children, such as breaking windows or turning on the water in standby pipes in hallways. But there was no proof that defendants or their children were responsible for any of the conditions in issue. We see no basis for holding defendants responsible for the wrongdoing of others. Plaintiff, not defendants, had the responsibility for policing and maintaining its common areaways.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Finally, plaintiff asks us to reconsider the wisdom of the doctrine established in <em>Berzito v. </em>Bambino, supra, which allows a tenant a reduction in rent rather than obligate him to make repairs and claim only their actual cost. As plaintiff acknowledges, however, its request for reconsideration must be addressed to the Supreme Court, not this court. <em>Murray v. </em>Michalak, 114 <em>N. J. Super. </em>417, 420 (App. Div. 1970), aff\u2019d o.b. 58 <em>N. J. </em>220 <em>(1971); </em>see <em>Reinauer Realty Corp. v. Paramus, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>406, 415 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\"> In cases where (.here has been no showing that rent levels were established below \u201cmarket value,\u201d such as at a portion of the tenant\u2019s income, rent chargeable to the tenant has been held to be \u201cthe reasonable value of the property in its imperfect condition\u201d during the tenant\u2019s occupancy. <em>Berzito v. Gambino, supra, </em>63 <em>N. J. </em>at 469; <em>Samuelson v. Quinones, </em>119 <em>N. J. Super. </em>338, 343 (App. Div. 1972). See <em>Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, supra, </em>293 <em>N. E. </em>2d at 845; <em>McKenna v. Begin, Mass. </em>325 <em>N. E. </em>2d 587 (App. Ct. 1975); <em>Green v. Superior Ct., </em>10 <em>Cal. </em>3d 616, 639, 517 <em>P. </em>2d 1168, 1183, 111 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>704, 719 (Sup. Ct. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
