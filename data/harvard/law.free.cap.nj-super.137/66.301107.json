We do not reach or decide the issue whether, under any circumstances, a divorced wife may compel her former husband to submit to a physical examination required by an insurance company so that she may obtain a policy of life insurance on the husband\u2019s life. Even if we were to assume that such relief might be granted in appropriate circumstances, it is clear \u2014 as the trial judge ruled \u2014 that under the circumstances of this ease there is no warrant for granting the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The order is affirmed. Plaintiff\u2019s application for costs and counsel fees on this appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
