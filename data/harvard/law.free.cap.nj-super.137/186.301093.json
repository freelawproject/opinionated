A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ5\">Appellant Township of Wayne (township) petitioned the Department of Transportation (Department) for permission to install a grade crossing at Haul Road and the tracks of the Erie Lackawanna Railway Company (railroad) in the township. According to the petition the township was at the time \u201cinvolved in the construction, reconstruction and installation of a drainage system and realignment of * * <em>* </em>Haul Road * * *,\u201d and the construction of the proposed grade crossing had \u201cthe concurrence of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">A hearing on the petition was held before the Chief of the Bureau of Utilities in the Department, who served as hearing examiner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It appears from the testimony at the hearing that the township intends by the project to provide a drainage system to alleviate flooding and also to provide additional access to industrial projects and to \u201cthe Old Wayne area.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The township\u2019s petition makes no reference to the cost or method of financing the project. It is, however, apparent from the testimony at the hearing that the municipality was proceeding on the assumpton that it was to assume the cost of the grade crossing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A grade crossing engineer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the railroad testified that if the railroad were required by the Department to contribute funds for the grade crossing, his \u201crecommendation to Management would be that we refuse the acceptance of the Commissioner\u2019s Order to spend any funds on this project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Following the hearing the Commissioner of the Department of Transportation issued the Department\u2019s decision and order granting, \u201cin consonance with the provisions of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>48:2-28,\u201d permission to the township \u201cto construct a crossing at grade of Haul Boad and the tracks of the Greenwood Lake Branch of the Erie Lackawanna Bailway Company\u201d; directing the railroad \u201cin accord with the provisions of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>48:2-29 to install automatic flashing light signals and bell, with same being activated by a motion detector system,\u201d and directing the township \u201cto install Bailroad Advance Warning Signs and Bailroad Approach Pavement Markings in strict conformity to the \u2019Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and High<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ways.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Department\u2019s permission was granted subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">1. The entire project shall be accomplished at no cost to the Department of Transportation and at no cost to the Railroad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">2. The petitioner shall notify the Department of Transportation when the project is completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The township appealed from that portion of the decision and order \u201cwhich requires the Township of Wayne to pay for the required safety devices and the finding of the Department of Transportation that said improvements are necessary.\u201d It now contends that the Department\u2019s \u201cimposition of the entire cost of constructing the grade crossing and the protective devices associated therewith upon the petitioner is contrary to law.\u201d Both the railroad and the department argue, in effect, that the township, at the Department hearing, waived any right to contribution by the Department and railroad and is accordingly estopped from now changing its position and seeking such contribution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> The township clearly lacks authority to bind itself to an agreement providing for its assumption of the cost of construction of the grade crossing and installation of protective devices. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>48:12-79; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>48:12-49.1. As pointed out in <em>Sinclair Refining Co. v. Bergen Cty., </em>103 <em>N. J. Super. </em>426, (App. Div. 1968), certif. den. 53 <em>N. J. </em>272 (1969) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>It is axiomatic that municipal bodies in this State have no powers other than those delegated by the Legislature, and must perform their prescribed activities within the statutory ambit. <em>Scatuorchio v. Jersey City Incinerator Authority, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>72, 85 (1953). Although a public body may make contracts, it can only do so within its express or implied authority. <em>Midtown Properties, Inc. v. Madison Tp., </em>68 <em>N. J. Super. </em>197, 208 (Law Div. 1961) affirmed 78 <em>N. J. Super. </em>471 (App. Div. 1963). An act wholly beyond tbe jurisdiction of a municipal corporation is <em>ultra vires </em>in the primary sense and utterly void. <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 </em>Ass\u2019n <em>of Cape May v. City of Cape May, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>493, 504 (1955); <em>Thornton v. Village of Ridgewood, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>499, 508 (1955); <em>Bauer v. City of Newark, </em>7 <em>N.

[at 433]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The statutes applicable here are to be found in Article 11 of Chapter 12 of <em>Title </em>48 of the <em>Revised Statutes, N. J. S. A. </em>48:12-49 <em>et seq., </em>\u201cthe apportionment of expenses\u201d for the project being specifically prescribed by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>48:12-49.1. We accordingly conclude that the proposed agreement between the township and the railroad would be <em>ultra vires </em>and void. In the circumstances the equitable doctrine of estoppel cannot he invoked against the municipality. <em>Slurzberg v. Bayonne, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>106, 115 (1959); <em>Sinclair Refining Co. v. Bergen Cty., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Since the hearing had proceeded on the assumption that the township would pay the full cost of construction of the grade crossing, the decision and order are reversed and the matter is remanded to the Department and Commissioner of Transportation for a new hearing, and for new findings and conclusions consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-6\"><em> N. J. S.

S. C. A. Title 11, Section 205 (c) (2) requiring the consent of the Trustees or appropriate findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission before any expenditure of funds of the railroad could be required to comply with an order of a State regulatory body, and in view of the railroad\u2019s agreement not to oppose the Township\u2019s petition, it is understandable why the Township would undertake such an agreement with the Railroad.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> Clearly inherent in the decision and order is the Commissioner\u2019s determination that the project is needed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\"> The railroad also argues that \u201cThe criteria for judicial review of an administrative proceeding are not shown to exist.\u201d We find no merit in this contention. We are here specifically concerned with \u201cwhether the result is within and in accordance with the legislative grant and the standards prescribed thereby * * <em>In re Application of Hackensack Water Co., </em>41 <em>N.
