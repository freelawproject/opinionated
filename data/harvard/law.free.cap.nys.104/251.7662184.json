The contract it attached to and made part of the complaint. It appears that plaintiff had an agency contract with the Warren Electric Manufacturing Company of Sandusky, Ohio, and the purpose of the contract was to provide for transferring that agency contract to the Turbine Engineering Company which was apparently controlled by the defendants. The 'contract provided that 300 shares of the stock of the turbine company should be transferred to plaintiff (which was done), and that a voting trust should be created controlling a majority of the stock, and that four directors of the turbine company should be named by plaintiff, and three by the defendant Fox. It appears from the complaint that all these preliminaries were carried out, and that shortly after the execution of the agreement (September 11, 1905) the plaintiff assigned his agency contract with the Warren Electric Company, to the Turbine Engineering Company, of which he was thereupon elected manager (and subsequently president) at a salary of $500 per month; this being in accordance with the contract which assured him that salary until February 11, 1910. Section 5 of the contract provided, among other things, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">\u201cSaid assignment of said [agency] contract shall be conditional upon the-Turbine Engineering Company faithfully carrying out the requirements of such agency contract, and that in the event of the Turbine Engineering Company\u2019s failure so to do, or in the event of the Turbine Engineering Company for any reason going out of existence, then the said agency shall revert back to said, Read.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">The eighth clause of the contract, which is the one the defendants-are accused of breaking, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">\u201cThis memorandum of agreement contemplates that all the necessary capital to conduct the business of the Turbine Engineering Company and its representation of the Warren Electric Manufacturing Company shall be furnished! or cause to be furnished by S. R. Fox or the Fox Security Company, and that failure to furnish said necessary capital shall constitute failure on the part of the Turbine Engineering Company in its proper representation of the-Warren Electric Manufacturing Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">The breach alleged is: That after February 15, 1906, the defendants, neglected and refused to furnish the necessary capital to continue the business of the Turbine Engineering Company, in consequence-of which it became indebted to its employ\u00e9s, and for telephone charges and office rents, and that a judgment was obtained against it and its, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>assets sold, and it was prevented from continuing business. That in consequence.of this failure to furnish capital plaintiff lost his promised salary until February, 1910, was injured in his reputation as a business man, and his 300 shares of stock in the turbine company were rendered valueless, and for these damages he seeks to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">It is very doubtful in the first place whether there can be spelled out of the contract a definite agreement on the part of the defendants to furnish the capital. The language of the eighth clause is peculiar. It is that \u201cthis memorandum of agreement contemplates\u201d that the defendants shall furnish the necessary capital. The word \u201ccontemplates\u201d indicates rather an expectation or intention, than a promise or undertaking. If the defendants had intended to definitely agree to furnish the working capital nothing would have been easier or \"simpler than to have said so, and that they did not say so, but selected a phrase indicative merely of an intention is certainly very significant. But even if the contract could be construed as a binding agreement on defendant\u2019s part to furnish the capital, the contract itself provides what consequences shall flow from a refusal to do so. It shall \u201cconstitute failure on the part of the Turbine Engineering Company in its proper representation of the Warren Electric Manufacturing Company\u201d (clause 8), and if the Turbine Engineering Company shall fail \u201cto faithfully carry out the requirements of the agency contract\u201d with the Warren Company, \u201cthen the said agency contract shall revert back to said Read\u201d (clause 5). Under well-established principles, when parties by. their contract specifically provide for the consequences of a breach, the remedy thus provided is exclusive. McCready v. Lindenborn, 172 N. Y. 400, 65 N. E. 208. The plaintiff\u2019s remedy, then, was to seek a reassignment of his agency contract, and his action for damages cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and the demurrer sustained, with costs to appellant in this court and the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
