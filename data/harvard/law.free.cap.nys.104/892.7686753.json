A referee was appointed to take and state the accounts for the first year of the receivership and to report on disputed claims. The referee reported that all claims of class W shareholders should be disallowed, that such shares were legally issued, and that the holders thereof were not entitled to participate in the distribution of funds of the corporation until all other creditors and shareholders had been paid in full. The report was confirmed, and the holders of class W shares appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">The question presented involves the determination of the rights and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>liabilities assumed by the holders of class W shares. It is contended on behalf of some of the appellants that class W shares were never legally issued, but I do think they are in a position to raise that question. The corporation in good faith at least attempted to comply with all the requirements of law in issuing such shares, and the holders accepted the same and participated in whatever benefits accrued until the corporation became insolvent. I am of the opinion that these shares were legally issued; but, if they were not, those who took them and accepted the benefits conferred cannot now be heard to assert their illegality to the prejudice of third parties. If the corporation had succeeded, and by reason thereof the shares had become valuable, there can be no\u2019 doubt that the holders would have insisted, and would have had a right to insist as against the corporation and the other shareholders, that, although the proper formalities were not observed in the issue, their rights were nevertheless- fixed by the agreement under which they took their shares. It is therefore unnecessary to discuss the legality of the issue of these shares, since a court of equity will not permit the claimants to set up such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Class W shares were issued to provide a fixed capital for the corporation. The subscribers were required to pay one-third of the par value of their shares at the time they subscribed, and the balance was payable thereafter in monthly installments. The holders of such shares were entitled to semiannual dividends of 3^ per cent, on the amount paid in, and, after all other dividends were paid, one half of the net surplus profits was to be credited to them in-proportion to the amount paid in until the credits and total payments amounted to $100, the par value of the shares, when the payments to them were to be in cash. The other half \u00f3f the net surplus profits was to be held as a reserve fund until it amounted to $1,000,000, and thereafter the whole net surplus profits were to be divided among the class W holders. In the event of the dissolution of the corporation, any balance of the reserve fund remaining after the payment of the other obligations of the company was to be distributed among them pro rata. The sums paid in on these shares tip to their par value were not withdrawable. It was a permanent fund for the use of the corporation. Most of the shares were issued in 1900, and the interest dividends were paid down to February, 1903.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The appellants\u2019 contention is that they are entitled to share equally and ratably with the other shareholders in the assets of the insolvent corporation. The court below, in confirming the report of the' referee, held they were not; and I am of the,opinion that such conclusion is correct. The purpose of the issue of the class W shares was to guaranty the obligations of the corporation and to provide a permanent working capital. The resolution of the board of directors authorizing the issue, which was afterwards incorporated into the articles of association, commenced with the preamble:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-6\">\u201cWhereas, it is desirable that this company shall have a permanent capital that shall serve as \u00e1 guaranty of the performance of its obligations.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">It provided that the shares were entitled to the further dividends \u201cin consideration of the guaranty to the other classes of shares, arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>from the creation of these shares,\u201d and that the sums paid in should not be withdrawable, \u201cbut shall constitute the guaranty fund of the said company, and shall be and stand as a guaranty for the payment of all the obligations of the company.\u201d The stock was called \u201cGuaranty Capital Stock,\u201d and in view of the unmistakable terms used in the resolution regarding it, which were thus inserted in the articles of association by amendment, I think the only reasonable interpretation is that these shares were not to be paid, in case of a dissolution, until all other obligations of the corporation, including the other classes of shares, had been paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-3\">It is true that the board of directors did not pass a resolution amending the preamble by adding the words, \u201cincluding its obligations to the holders of all other classes of shares under the articles of association,\u201d and the appellants insist that, while this was not done at the meeting which adopted the resolutions and amended the articles, it is nevertheless controlling evidence that it was never intended that the class W shares should guaranty the other classes of shares. I do not think this necessarily follows. The body of the resolution provided that the stock was to stand as a guaranty for the payment of all the obligations of the corporation, and that the further dividends were to be paid \u201cin consideration of the guaranty to the other classes of shares.\u201d These words are sufficiently plain, and the neglect to pass, or the rejection of, the proposed amendment, may quite conceivably have been because it was regarded as mere surplusage, and not because it did not state the correct intention. And, whether it did or not, it was not binding on the corporation, and would be a forced construction to say, that all the obligations of the corporation meant only the obligations to third parties, especially in view of the nature and manner in which the business of the corporation was conducted. It would not only be a forced construction, but one which I think the court would not be justified in adopting, to say_ that the \"guaranty to the other classes of shares,\u201d in consideration of which this stock was entitled to extraordinary dividends, meant a guaranty only that the debts to third parties should be paid. And it seems this was the view at one time of tire holders of a large majority of class W shares; for, when the insolvency proceedings were about to be instituted, they signed certain declarations to tire effect that class W shares were not a liability of the corporation and ought not to be considered in determining its solvency, asserting that they were held solely under sections 3 and 4 of article 29 of the articles of association as amended, which were practically identical with the resolution of the board of directors authorizing their issue; that the fund represented by the shares was not withdrawable, that the holders were entitled only to profits actually earned, and therefore the shares were not a liability of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">The appellants also contend that upon the insolvency of the corporation its assets ought to be distributed pro rata among all the shareholders, and that, even if there were a contract of guaranty to the other classes of shares, it was terminated by the insolvency of the corporation. As a general rule, this contention\u2014nothing appearing to the contrary\u2014would be sound; but it has no application here, if the fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>going views be correct, because there was an express contract between the holders of class W shares and the corporation that they should not share equally with the other shareholders. The guaranty to the other shareholders could mean nothing, except in case of a dissolution. No injustice has been done to the holders of class W shares by refusing to permit them to share ratably with the other shareholders. Their shares were entitled to a regular <em>7 </em>per cent, cash dividend. They paid \u2022only a fraction of its par value, the balance being payable in small monthly installments, and half the net surplus profits of the corporation were to be divided among them, first as credited payments upon their shares until the par value was paid, and after that in cash. The other half was to be accumulated in a reserve fund, and in the event of the \u25a0dissolution of the corporation, after the payment of its debts, this fund, or the balance of it, was to be divided among them. After the fund reached $1,000,000, the whole of the net surplus profits of the corporation was to be divided among them. If the corporation prospered, the class W shares would be very valuable. If it did not, then the class W shares- stood as a guaranty of the corporation\u2019s obligations', and the holders could not participate in the distribution of its assets until all other claims were paid. For those who had confidence in the stability and success of the corporation, this was an attractive arrangement. It would, as it seems to me, be most inequitable to now permit the holders of class W shares to repudiate the agreement under which such shares were issued and place them on the same footing with other shareholders. Having accepted and retained the benefits, they now must submit to the liabilities which such shares imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The' order appealed from, therefore, should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
