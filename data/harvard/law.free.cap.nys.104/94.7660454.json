The complaint is that the plaintiff had placed in several newspaper establishments, including that of the defendant, certain pictures for publication on a stated future day, under an agreement that he was to be paid therefor on publication; that the defendant violated this agreement and published them before the arrival of the day, and thus made the pictures stale with all the other newspapers, whereby the plaintiff lost the benefit of his contract with them. It is then pleaded in two other paragraphs that by reason of such premature publication the plaintiff\u2019s standing with all the newspapers and publishers of pictures was injured, for which he asks damages in addition to the damages caused immediately by the said breach of contract. It is manifest that the complaint does not state two causes of action, but only one. The extra damages claimed may not be provable -or recoverable at all, but the allegation of them does not amount to a separate cause of action. The pleader had a notion that he was alleging special damage. There is a good cause of action for breach of contract alleged; the other allegations go to the question of damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs.
