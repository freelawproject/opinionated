Order granted.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1100-16\">The action was brought by complainant to foreclose a mortgage covering 'certain premises for nonpayment of an installment of $200 due on July 1, 1906, and accrued Interest. The complaint alleged a default in the payment of one installment. Before service of the summons and complaint in the action, defendant Lewis Goldberg tendered $466, which consisted of two installments due under the terms of the mortgage, and accrued interest, which complainant refused to accept. After the tender, the summons and complaint were served, and then defendant Goldberg answered and alleged as a separate defense the tender of the first installment, and also the tender of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>sum of $466 before suit, complainant\u2019s refusal to accept, defendant\u2019s readiness-to pay the sum tendered at all times, etc., and on January 29, 1907, Goldberg procured an order permitting the payment of the $466 into court, after which complainant applied for an order directing the city chamberlain to pay to him or his attorney the sum so deposited \u201con account of the above-entitled action,\u201d which application was denied.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1101-3\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

Yet I think that we must regard the purpose of the payment of the sum of the two installments into court was to-make good the plea of tender before the suit was brought, within the rule of Platner v. Lehman, 26 Hun, 374, and of Wilson v. Doran, 110 N. Y. 101, 17 N. E. 688. See, too, Nichols\u2019 New York Practice, p. 2008, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">If the defense of tender of amount due before action brought was established, the plaintiff could not take his decree of foreclosure, but only a money judgment against the defendants, less the defendants\u2019' costs. McCoy v. O\u2019Donnell, 2 Thomp. &amp; C. 671, affirmed 59 N. Y. 656. The money paid into court belongs to the plaintiff in any event. His claim as to that amount is deemed stricken from the complaint, and hence, if the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is based wholly upon the nonpayment of that sum, and limited thereto, he must fail. Wilson v. Doran, supra, at page 107 of 110 N. Y., 17 N. E. 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">I think that the plaintiff was entitled to the order, and that the or- \u2018 der of the County Court of Kings County must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
