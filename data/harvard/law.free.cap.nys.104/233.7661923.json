Defendants pleaded as a counterclaim that plaintiff had taken into her possession property belonging to \u2018defendants, consisting of paintings, drawings, etchings, and engravings, of the value of $80,000, and that possession had been demanded by defendant and refused.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b253-12\">Argued before PATTERSON, P.

The plaintiff certainly knows whether she has received any of the defendants\u2019 property, and, while it may be that a bill of particulars would be proper after the case is at issue to prevent surprises at the trial, or to limit the defendants\u2019 proof, as there is nothing to show that a bill of particulars was necessary to enable the plaintiff to reply, the application for a bill of particulars was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and dis \u2022 bursements, and the motion for a bill of particulars denied, with $10 costs, without prejudice to an application for a bill of particulars after issue is joined. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
