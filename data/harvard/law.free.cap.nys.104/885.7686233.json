Gilroy to the relator to secure the payment to it of $4,500 on demand. The said mortgage covered two leases held by said Gilroy on certain premises in the county of New York made by Isabella Hart to Bernard Reilly, duly assigned by said Reilly to said Gilroy. Said leases were each for the term of five years; the unexpired terms whereof when mortgaged being less than three years. The register demanded the sum of $22.50 as the tax imposed pursuant to the provisions of chapter 729, p. 2059, Laws 1905, as amended by chapter 532, p. 1448, Laws 1906, relating to the taxation of mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Section 293 of the mortgage tax law imposes a tax on every mortgage of real property recorded on or after July 1, 1906. Section 290 of said act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-7\">\u201cThe words real property and real estate, as used In this article, in addition to the definitions thereof contained in section 2 of this chapter, shall be understood to include everything, a conveyance or mortgage of which can be recorded as a conveyance or mortgage of real property, under the laws of the state. The words mortgage of real property, as used in this article, include every mortgage by which a lien is created over or imposed on real property or which affects the title to real property, notwithstanding that it may also be a lien qn personal or other property, or that personal or other property may form part of the security for the debt or debts secured by such mortgage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Article 8 of chapter 547, pp. 605-617, of the Laws of 1896, entitled \u201cAn act relating to real property, constituting chapter 46 of the general laws,\u201d providing for the recording of instruments affecting real property, in section 240 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-9\">\u201cThe term \u2018real property,\u2019 as used in this article, includes lands, tenements and hereditaments and chattels real, except a lease for a term not exceeding three years. * * * The term \u2018conveyance\u2019 includes every written instrument, by which any estate or interest in real property is created, transferred, mortgaged or assigned, or by which the title to any real property may be affected. * * * except a will, a lease for a term not exceeding three years, an executory contract for the sale or purchase of lands and an instrument containing the pow\u00e9r to convey real property as the .agent or attorney for the sale of such property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Section 241 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-11\">\u201cA conveyance of real property within the state and being duly acknowledged by the person executing the same, or proved as required by this chapter, and such acknowledgment or proof duly certified when required by this chapter, may be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county where such real- property is situated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">It follows that the leases in the matter at bar, which were chattels real and were for five years and created an interest in real property, were conveyances which could be recorded, and as matter of fact were .recorded. Therefore the written instrument by which such interest in real estate was mortgaged was a conveyance, and could be recorded. This mortgage thus comes within the recording act. Upon its tender, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>duly acknowledged, and upon the payment of his recording fees, the register could be compelled to record it. Therefore, by the definitions of the tax law, it came within .the purview thereof and the tax was leviable thereon. The payment of the tax having been demanded and refused, the register had no right to record it. Hence the relator has failed to establish a legal right which can be enforced by a peremptory writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The order appealed from should therefore be affirmed with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b907-6\">INGRAHAM, J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"AtD\">I concur with Mr. Justice CLARKE. A lease of real property for a term of years grants to the lessee the right to possession of the property for the term demised, and a mortgage upon such a lease creates a lien which affects the title to the real property within the definition of a \u201cmortgage on real property,\u201d as used in section 293 of the tax law (as amended by chapter 532 of the Laws of 1906). By section 290 of that act it is provided that the words \u201cmortgage of real property, as used in this article, includes every mortgage by which a lien is created over or imposed on real property or which affects the title to real property\u201d; and, as a mortgage upon a leasehold interest in real property creates a lien upon an interest in real property, it affects the title to real property, and a tax is therefore imposed upon recording such a mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">LAUGHLIN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
