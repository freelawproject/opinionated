The contract did not fix the amount of the commissions nor whether they should be the gross or net commissions, nor what would constitute a fair division.

Plaintiff further alleges that he has in all respects complied with the terms of said agreement, and has been and is now ready and willing to complete his duties as associate architect under said contract, but that the defendant on the - day of July, 1904, wrongfully terminated said contract, and has refused and now refuses to associate plaintiff as associate architect of the said building or to recognize him as the author and designer of the plans so prepared by plaintiff, or to pay him one-half of the commissions received by defendant or any part thereof; that the defendant will receive from the city of New York, as compensation for his services as architect of said building in commissions after deducting all expenses that will necessarily be sustained by defendant, at least the sum of $40,000; that plaintiff has been damaged by defendant\u2019s wrongful failure and refusal to comply with the terms of the said contract in at least the sum of $20,000. For a second cause of action it is alleged that between the 13th of August, 1903, and the 6th day of August, 1904, plaintiff rendered services to the defendant at his request as an architect to make plans for the erection of a public building known as the \u201cBronx borough courthouse,\u201d and that the services \"were reasonably worth the sum of $10,000, and that no part of the same has been paid except $200. That is, the first cause of action is to recover as damages for a breach of the contract the value of said contract. The second cause of action is for the reasonable value of the services rendered. Upon the trial it was established that the defendant had the preliminary contract with the city to prepare the plans for the erection of the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>Bronx borough courthouse'; that these plans had been presented to the municipal art commission and by them rejected. Section 637 of the charter of Greater New York (chapter 466, p. 266, Laws 1901) provides that no municipal building shall be erected upon land belonging to the city unless a design of the same shall first have been submitted to and approved by the art commission of the city of New York when the mayor or the board of aldermen shall have requested the said commission to act thereon, or when the expense for such structure should exceed $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">Such being the situation, the plaintiff testified that he met the defendant, and after a considerable talk with him, in which the defendant explained the situation he was in with the preliminary contract and with his plans presented and disapproved by the art commission, the defendant asked plaintiff to make for him a design which would pass the art commission, and that the defendant said to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-6\">\u201cBluemner, if you can make me a successful plan, I will do the best for you that a man can do. We are old friends. Here is your chance. You say you are in your own business. You are looking for opportunities, take the risk with me. It is only three months we must submit before election. I said, \u2018What do you mean by that you will do the best you can for me.\u2019 * * * He said, \u2018If we win, I give you a fair share of my commissions.\u2019 I said, \u2018Garvin, if I go into that, you mean to say if we lose I get nothing, and if we win I get a fair share.\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 * * * I said to him, \u2018It seems to me I should call myself assistant architect\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018you can do that. You can run your own business besides. Take your own jobs besides.\u2019 I said, \u2018All right, Garvin, I will do that.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">That is the evidence offered to prove the special contract alleged in the first cause of action in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">Evidence was given tending to show that thereafter the plaintiff worked for about 10 weeks on plans and designs, the mechanical part of the work being done by other draughtsmen and employ\u00e9s of the defendant; that thereafter new designs and plans and a model were submitted to the art commission, which were finally approved by said commission; that thereafter the contract with the defendant, as architect of the building, was executed, fixing his compensation at 5 per cent, upon the total cost of the building, to be paid upon the completion of the drawings and specifications, 1 per cent, of the estimated cost of the work, upon the completion of the working drawings of )4 per cent, and upon the execution and closing of the contract for the work an amount, which, together with the amount already paid, should be equal to 3)4 per cent, of the amount of the contract price, and the balance to be paid in progress payments at the rate of 3)4 per cent, as certified to the contractor for payment by the architect and president.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">The plaintiff testified that after the plans were approved he met the defendant, who said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-10\">\u201cNow, Bluemner, I give you now $40 a week. You stay here with me and you rush out these plans. Now, you get your ideal work, carry it out as you want it. Let\u2019s hurry with it. Work! You can call yourself the manager of the courthouse. I said to Mr. Garvin: \u2018Is that the way you keep your word? Is it not I who got the success of the work? Is it not I who got that courthouse back?\u2019 He said to me: \u2018Oh, go to Hell. I got the job now.\u2019 I said: \u2018Mr. Garvin, is that the way we agreed? Is that the way you promised faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>and keep it?\u2019 He said: \u2018If you won\u2019t take that, you won\u2019t get nothing at all.\u2019 And I said: \u2018All right, you will hear from me.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Thereafter this suit was brought; the complaint being verified on the 30th of November, 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">At the time of the trial, May 28, 1906, it appeared that the building had been commenced, but that it would take some five years to complete the same, and that there had been appropriated for the purposes of construction $600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">Before testimony had been offered, the defendant moved to dismiss the first cause of action, and at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case renewed the motion, both of which motions were denied. At the close of the testimony the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the first cause of action, which being denied the defendant asked the court to direct the plaintiff to elect upon which cause of action set out in the complaint he intended to go to the jury, which motion was also denied. If the first cause of action set up an enforceable special contract, it was not error to refuse to dismiss the complaint. As the plaintiff and the court construed the first cause of action, it was to recover damages for the breach of an express contract of employment. Assuming that the jury believed the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, there was such an express contract to associate the plaintiff in the undertaking as associate architect and fairly share with the plaintiff the commissions received by the defendant on account of his contract with the city of New York, which contract the defendant breached. We are of the. opinion, however, that treating the case as an action at law for the recovery of damages upon a breach of contract, the contract alleged cannot sustain the action. It is too vague and indefinite to constitute a valid contract. There is nothing in the contract which fixes the amount of the commissions to be divided, nor is there anything in its terms to define what would be a fair division of these commissions. Nor is it provided whether the commissions to be fairly divided should be the gross or the net commissions as profits after deducting therefrom the necessary expenses. The plaintiff, in his testimony, gave it as his opinion that a fair share of the commissions was one half thereof. By the terms of the contract both he and the jury were permitted to pass judgment thereon. If an agreement is so uncertain and ambiguous that the court is unable to collect from it what the parties intended, the court cannot enforce it; and, since there is no obligation, this is no contract. 9 Cyc. 248. If the offer is in any case so indefinite as to make it impossible for a court to decide just what it means and to fix exactly the legal liability of the parties, its acceptance cannot result in an enforceable agreement. Id. 249. United Press v. New York Press Company, 164 N. Y. 406, 58 N. E. 527, was an action brought to recover damages for the breach of a contract wherein the plaintiff agreed to deliver to the defendant certain news reports, and the defendant agreed to pay therefor a sum not exceeding $300 during each and every week that said news report was received. Of that contract Judge Gray said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-7\">\u201cIt lacks support in one of its essential elements. In the absence of a statement of the price to be paid, that was a defect which was radical in its nature and which was beyond the reach of oral evidence to supply; for, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>\u00bfhe intention o\u00ed the parties in so essential a particular cannot be ascertained from the instrument, neither the court nor the jury will be allowed to make an agreement for them upon the subject. It is elementary in the law that for the validity of a contract the promise or the agreement of the parties to it must be certain and explicit, and that their full intention may be ascertained to a reasonable degree of certainty their agreement must be neither vague nor indefinite, and, if thus defective, parole proof cannot be resorted to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">A good cause of action was, however, stated upon the quantum meruit for the services actually performed. This judgment cannot be sustained, however, as upon that cause of action for these reasons: First. There is not sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict of the jury which was for the sum of $9,800. The only testimony as to the value of the services actually rendered was the opinion of the plaintiff himself that they were worth between $6,000 and $8,000. No other witnesses testified at all upon this point. Second. The court did not submit the case to the jury upon the theory of quantum meruit. The court denied the motion made by the defendant at the end of the case to compel the plaintiff to elect upon which cause of action he would go to the jury, but the learned coiirt in its charge itself made the election, for it charged the jury solely upon the first cause of action, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-6\">\u201cThe crucial question in this case, and the one you must decide, is: Was a contract made between plaintiff and defendant such as is claimed by the plaintiff, or was it such as is claimed by the defendant? If you find that a contract was made such as the defendant has testified to, then the plaintiff cannot recover, and your verdict in that case should be for the defendant. If you find that a contract was made such as has been testified to by the plaintiff, then, before you can render a verdict in his favor, you must decide whether the sketches worked out by the plaintiff were actually accepted by the municipal art commission, and, if you find that they were, then it is for you to say what amount, as a fair share' of the defendant\u2019s commissions, should be awarded to the plaintiff, and you are then to give him a verdict for that amount after deducting the sum of $200, admittedly received by the plaintiff from the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Nowhere in the charge was any allusion made to the second cause of action, nor was the value of the services actually rendered, irrespective of the contract, in any way alluded to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">The judgment and order appealed from should, therefore, be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
