The 11th subdivision of the return alleges in hsec verba a clause of the \u201cordinance and contract,\u201d which prescribes certain deductions of rent for neglect to supply mains, hydrants, and water, and then argues that the effect thereof is that the respondent is not obliged to supply the same, but may as an alternative s\u00fcbmit to such deductions. The allegation is not that by the terms of the contract the respondent is -exempt, and whether it is or not depends on a construction of the -entire contract, and not upon any fragment of it. This statement -of facts or defence is therefore insufficient on its face. The plea must be as, broad as the writ, unless it be expressly stated to be partial. The same is the case with the allegations of the twelfth \u25a0subdivision. The thirteenth only relates to the placing of hydrants, ..and is therefore also only a partial statement or defence, and not being so designated is not good. The fourteenth only relates to mains and is in the same case. The fifteenth is a mere argument. And if the company has a supply from any source it does not matter that it is not from the source originally contemplated; it must do its public -duty. The sixteenth does not contain any new matter at all. All that it embraces is embraced in the issues raised by the denials, or that can be raised by denials. The same is true of the seventeenth, \u25a0eighteenth, and nineteenth.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">This case cannot be disposed of on technicalities. The relator should refrain from captiousness and bring it on for trial, so that all of the franchises, ordinances,' contracts and other facts may be put before the \u25a0\u2022court. Judgment cannot be given on mere fragments.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The interlocutory judgment is reversed in the respects in which it overrules the demurrer to any of the said statements or defences, and affirmed in other respects; and the demurrer is sustained to each thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Interlocutory judgment modified, by sustaining the demurrer to the separate -defenses in respect of which the demurrer was overruled in the court below, -and, as modified, affirmed, with costs to the relator. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
