Annie W. Stevens, respondent, one of the landowners to whom an award was made, filed her notice of appeal therefrom to this court on July 16, 1906. On January 10, 1907, the respondent got an order ex parte from a judge of the Supreme Court extending to February 1st her time to print and file her papers on such appeal. This appellant made a motion on notice before the court at Special Term to vacate the said order as irregular and void, for not being a court order, which was denied on February 1st, and thereupon, on the same day, the court granted an order ex parte extending such time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>March 1st.

The award to it is therefore final and conclusive and has to be paid by the city. It therefore played the part of an intermeddler in moving to vacate the orders extending the time of the respondent to print and file the papers on her appeal from the said order of confirmation, in respect of the award to her, and in appealing from the orders denying its said motions. In any case the brief of its counsel might well have refrained from using such epithets and accusations as \u201cinsincere,\u201d \u201cpositive impertinence,\u201d \u201cinsincere subterfuge,\u201d \u201csnap proceeding\u201d and \u201cincompetence\u201d toward his learned opponent, but all the more so when he is thrusting his client into matters that do not concern it.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The orders should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
