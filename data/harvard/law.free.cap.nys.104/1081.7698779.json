Pitt Rivers sufficiently showed that the defamatory words were published concerning the plaintiff, and it was not necessary to allege that it was published concerning her in the-express words of the statute; Code Civ.

Proc. \u00a7 535), that the defamatory words were published concerning the plaintiff if from the facts stated in the complaint it necessarily appears that such was the case. Jacquelin v. Morning Journal, 39 App. Div. 515, 57 N. Y. Supp. 299. The article complained of referred to Wm. Pitt Rivers\u2019 \u201csuit for divorce.\u201d If that had been all, it might be uncertain who was the plaintiff in said action, but in the same article it speaks of \u201chis divorce complaint,\u201d showing that he was the plaintiff. A man cannot sue any one for divorce but his wife. The complaint alleges that the plaintiff at the time of the publication was and still is the wife of Wm. Pitt Rivers. Necessarily the \u25a0 article could refer to no other person than the plaintiff. To publish an article stating that a woman is a defendant in an action for divorce which can only be brought upon the ground of adultery is libelous per se. The demurrer must be overruled.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1102-8\">Argued before WOODWARD, JENKS, HOOKER, GAYNOR, and RICH, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1102-9\">Clarence J.
