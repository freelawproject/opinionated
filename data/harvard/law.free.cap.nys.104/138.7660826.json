After many protracted adjournments and various substitutions of - attorneys and referees, it resulted in a referee\u2019s report, and a decree confirming it, entered June 31, 1899', by which the administrator was charged with the sum of $58,344.31. All proceedings were had on notice to the administrator, and he appeared in person and by attorney before the referee, whose report was confirmed as aforesaid! He was served with notice of the entry of said decree, and after the time to appeal from it had expired the motion was made by him and one of his sureties, resulting in the order appealed from, which vacated said decree and referred the matter back to said referee for further hearing and determination. The grounds for the motion stated in the moving affidavits are that the contestants have been guilty of laches in not pressing the issue to a speedy determination; that as a result of the various delays and substitutions many of the administrator\u2019s books, vouchers, and papers have been lost, so that he cannot now, as he says, \u201cexculpate himself\u201d; and that at some stage of the proceeding the administrator\u2019s counsel stated that the next of kin had agreed to abandon their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">Section 3481 of the Code of Civil Procedure specifies the grounds upon which the surrogate may make such an order, to wit: \u201cFraud, newly discovered evidence, clerical error, or other sufficient cause.\u201d It is not pretended that there was any fraud, that any new evidence has been discovered, that any clerical error was committed, or that any like cause existed for granting the motion; and it is plain that the words \u201cother sufficient cause\u201d must have an \u201cejusdem generis\u201d interpretation. It is not necessary to cite authorities upon the proposition that said section cannot possibly be construed so as to include any of the alleged grounds of this motion. The respondents\u2019 brief treats the order as one opening a default; but, if there was a default, it was willful. Said administrator, after appearing before the referee as aforesaid and while being examined as a witness, refused to submit to further examination and abandoned the proceedings. It is asserted that the proceeding was barred by the statute of limitations; but, however dead it may have appeared at times, it had sufficient life at all times to be resurrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The only other ground urged on the brief is that the referee acted upon proof that he had no right to consider. It is not shown that there is the slightest merit in any of the contentions I have enumerated; but, if there were, the place to urge them was before the referee and the surrogate on the application to confirm the report, and, if error was committed, the remedy was by appeal. The surety is not entitled to intervene now to reopen the proceedings and start a new series of delays. He was not entitled to notice of the proceedings leading up to the decree, and in the absence of fraud is bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Our conclusion is that, upon the case presented, the surrogate had no power to grant the order appealed from; and it should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Richmond county reversed, with $10 costs and. disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
