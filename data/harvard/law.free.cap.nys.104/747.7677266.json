Plaintiff was questioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-25\">\u201cWhat did Mr. Collis say to you, and what did you say to Mr. Collis, in reference to furnishing men with board? A. Well, Mr. Collis and my son talked about the contract. Mr. Collis said: \u2018You furnish me the men, build the shanty, put the men in, get your men on the job,\u2019 and he was to pay me the board bill for the whole of his men. I paid it myself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-27\">Even under the suggestion of this leading question, the answer does not state that the defendant promised in words or substance to pay for the board. The witness added, \u201cAnd he was to pay me the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>board bill.\u201d This was clearly a conclusion of his own, and not a statement of what the defendant said. The next question was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\">\u201cMr. Collis said he would pay you the board bill for the men that would be-working on the job?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Now, Mr. Collis had not said anything of the kind. It was simply an assertion of counsel, to which the witness gave his assent. But it was not evidence. It was typical of a vicious practice by which counsel assumes and asserts a thing which has not been testified to, in the mistaken hope that an assent thereto will constitute evidence. If that were so, it would permit an attorney not under oath to introduce his assumptions under the guise of leading questions as evidence. The law condemns such practice. An examination of this-case fails to show that any prejudicial error was committed, or that the justice did not determine the case in accordance with the preponderance of credible testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
