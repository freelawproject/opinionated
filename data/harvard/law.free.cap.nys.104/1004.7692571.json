J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2eo\">The judgment recovered by the plaintiff is for damages resulting from injuries to certain goods delivered by him to the defendant for transportation in the city of New York, and injured or destroyed in transit. Defendant is a domestic corporation engaged in the express business in the borough of Manhattan, and it received the goods in question from the plaintiff on the 28th day of September, 1903, under an express oral agreement to deliver them to the plaintiff at his residence in President street, borough of Brooklyn. That the goods were injured or destroyed was established by sufficient proof, and that they were worth the amount for which a recovery has been had was not disputed on the submission of the case to the jury. I find no error in ruling which justifies a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-19\">The chief contention on the part of the appellant is that the defendant\u2019s express business is confined to the borough of Manhattan, and that, on receiving the plaintiff\u2019s property, it delivered the same in good condition to another express company doing business in the borough of Brooklyn, and that the damage sustained, if any, was occasioned by the negligence of the latter. I do not think the doctrine which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>exempts connecting carriers from liability for negligence other than their own is applicable in this instance; but, if it were, it is sufficient that the evidence on the part of the plaintiff tending to show an express or special contract for delivery at his residence was in no respect refuted on the trial by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">The judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Judgment and order affirmed with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
