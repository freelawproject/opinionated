He sued the defendant for damages, and obtained a judgment in his favor. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Defendant\u2019s foreman put plaintiff to work on the machine. After he had worked on it about three weeks, he told the foreman it was out of order; that it shook too much. The foreman told*him not to mind about that, but to go on with his work. The plaintiff again spoke to the foreman, and requested him to have the machine fixed. The foreman said he would have it fixed in a couple of days, and told plaintiff to continue to use' the machine. We worked about two hours longer on this machine, when \u201cit jumped,\u2019\u2019 or \u201cwabbled,\u201d and injured plaintiff. Under the employer\u2019s liability act the assumption of risk by continuing in a dangerous position is a question of fact. The justice found, upon some proof, that plaintiff was free from contributory negligence in the management of the machine. The promise of the foreman to repair the machine, made to plaintiff to induce him to continue work thereon, constituted a contract on the part 'of the employer to assume the risk, and relieved the servant therefrom. Citrone v. Construction Co., 113 App. Div. 518, 99 N. Y. Supp. 241. This contract commenced at the time of the promise, and continued during the period of the agreement. And was in force at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
