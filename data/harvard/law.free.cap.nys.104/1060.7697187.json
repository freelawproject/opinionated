The complaint Is that the plaintiff chartered a scow to the defendant to carry cellar dirt to fills, a part of the agreement being that the scow should not be taken to Green-ville, N. J., where there was a fill; that the defendant took the scow there, .and In a storm she was blown ashore and injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1081-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>The contract was made by the agent of the plaintiff with the agent of the-defendant over the telephone. The former testifies that he told the latter (Driscoll) that \u201cwe objected to sending it down to Greenville,\u201d because she was new, and because the anchorage was about three quarters of a mile from the fill, and if a northeaster came up the scows at the anchorage were endangered. He then says: \u201cMy recollection is that Mr. Driscoll said he wouldn\u2019t send her down to Greenvilleand then follows this question and answer as the last on the subject: \u201cQ. Did you tell him you wouldn\u2019t let him go to Greenville? A. We objected to its going to Greenville.\u201d He entered the terms of the hiring in the plaintiff\u2019s scow book, but omitted any restriction as to where the scow might go. The agent for the defendant (Driscoll) testifies positively that there was no restriction as to the movements of the scow in the leasing. Before, during the time of and after the use of the scow by the defendant other scows of the defendant went continuously to the Greenville fill. There was no other evidence on the subject.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1081-5\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

The evidence for the plaintiff left it a matter of uncertainty at best. And if such a contract could be eked out therefrom, to find it would be against the weight' of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">Assuming that the contract was proved, it was error to exclude evidence to show that the damages were caused or suffered in whole or in part by the neglect of the plaintiff\u2019s captain who was aboardl and in charge of her to take proper care of her in the storm. Although the contract were broken by the defendant, it was for the captain to do what he reasonably could in the care of the scow to prevent her from going ashore. That he did not do so was not a defense to be pleaded; on the contrary, the question was what damage the breach of the defendant caused, and that would be in issue even on an assessment on failure to answer. The amount of damage is always in issue, even without a denial thereof. Milton v. Hudson R. S. Co., 37 N.
