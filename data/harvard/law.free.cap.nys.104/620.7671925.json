Hamlin, as trustee in bankruptcy for the defendant corporation, in an action to foreclose a certain mortgage for $25,000, on which a payment of $10,000 had been made, and who had been permitted to intervene and defend in behalf of the corporation, defaulted upon the trial by reason of a misunderstanding between himself and the attorney for the plaintiff. An order opening the default has been granted upon terms, and this appeal is from so much of the order as requires the trustee to furnish an undertaking for $5,000, conditioned for the payment to the plaintiff of an}'\" deficiency that may arise upon the sale of the premises by reason of the delay occasioned by the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\">There does not appear to be any occasion for the imposing of this personal obligation upon a trustee in bankruptcy, the officer of a court of the United States, and we reach the conclusion that the order appealed from should be modified, by striking out the provision for a bond on the part of the trustee, and, as so'modified, the order should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-18\">PATTERSON, P. J., and McLAUGHLIN and CLARKE, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>INGRAHAM, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AB-T\">It is conceded that the defendant, as trustee in bankruptcy, has no assets in his hands, but is seeking to defend a mortgage made by the 'bankrupt for the benefit of creditors. They 'should certainly be responsible for any damages caused by the delay in foreclosing the mortgage in the event that the defense is unsuccessful. The trustee in bankruptcy being in default, I think it was proper for the court to compel the creditors to give such security as would secure the plaintiff from the damages which should be caused by the delay if the defense should prove unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
