The doings of the plaintiff which induced the defendant to make the charge were in the said village, the arrest was made in that village by its authorities, and the hearing was had thereon before its police judge. The defendant names a large number of witnesses, of whom many, at least, seem to be material. All- of them reside in that village. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney by his affidavit challenges the materiality of some of them, deposes that the plaintiff re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>sides in King\u2019s_ county, but does not name a single witness who resides in this county. Thus the charge of venue is warranted by the reasons that the cause of action arose in Saratoga county and that the convenience of the witnesses will be subserved. See Archer v. McIlravy, 86 App. Div. 512, 83 N. Y. Supp. 727, and authorities cited. In that case we quoted with approval the expression of the court in Jacobs v. Davis, 65 App. Div. 144, 72 N. Y. Supp. 558:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">\u201cIt has become to be recognized that, as a general rule in transitory actions, the case should be tried in the locality where the transactions involved in the controversy took place, unless a large preponderance of the witnesses live in a different locality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion is granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
