On the landlord\u2019s agent raising his rent from $16 to $17 a month, the tenant asked the agent for a 3 years lease. He made and delivered to him such a lease in writing; not in the landlord\u2019s name, however, but in his own name. If, nevertheless, we deem it the landlord\u2019s lease (for it was not under seal), it was void because the agent had no written authority to make it. Section 307 of the real property law (Laws 1896, p. 592, c. 547) requires written authority to an agent to make a lease for his landlord for more than one year in order that the lease may be valid. The landlord never ratified the act of the agent in making the lease. Receiving the rent was not a ratification. There can be no ratification without knowledge of the facts. The evidence shows without dispute that the agent was restricted by the landlord to the making of monthly leases only, and the landlord never knew that he made the lease in question. If a landlord make a lease which is void under the statute of frauds for being for more than one year and not in writing, it is good for a year; but that is not the case before us; the landlord did not make the present lease; if he had done so, either himself or through his agent, he would be bound by it for the whole term for it is in writing. As it is, the landlord is not bound by the act of his agent in excess of his authority, for power to make leases for years is not necessarily within a real estate agent\u2019s authority to lease, and to be implied, in favor of persons to whom he makes leases. It is for them to ascertain the extent of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The final order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Final order o\u00a3 the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
