The plaintiff boarded a north-bound car at Chambers street and Broadway. Hq rode until .he reached Twenty-Third street. The car there turning into Lexington avenue, he for the first time asked the conductor for a transfer, -which was refused. He then left the car and boarded a Twenty-Third \u25a0Street car, paying another fare.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">The reasonableness of the rule promulgated by the defendant, requiring a passenger to ask for a transfer at the time he pays a fare, Las been upheld by the Appellate Division in the case of Ketchum v. N. Y. City Ry. Co. (recently decided by that court) 103 N. Y. Supp. 486. The judgment must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
