The attorney for defendant then moved for a similar direction in favor of defendant. The court said, \u201cBoth sides having moved for a direction, the court directs the jury to find a verdict in favor of defendant,\u201d and plaintiff\u2019s attorney thereupon excepted. The court directed the jury so to find, and it was so recorded. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-17\">\u201cI ask your honor for leave to send the case to the jury on the entire case and on the facts and on the statements\u2014on the transactions that took place between the plaintiff and the defendant alleged to have taken place on the 8th day of February.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-18\">The court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-19\">\u201cIt is too late now; a motion having been made for a direction of the verdict Gentlemen of the jury, by direction of the court you find a verdict in favor of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-20\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney noted an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-21\">Both parties moved to direct a verdict, and the record shows that the court granted defendant\u2019s motion, to which plaintiff excepted, and that the court directed -the jury so to find, and that it was so recorded. The plaintiff\u2019s request to go- to.the jury was then too late. While, until final action had been taken by the actual direction of a verdict, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel could change his mind and ask to go to the jury (Second Nat. Bank v. Weston, 161 N. Y. 528, 55 N. E. 1080, 76 Am. St. Rep. 283; Seddon v. Tagliabue, 50 Misc. Rep. 156, 98 N. Y. Supp. 236), yet in this case the final action, as shown by the stenographer\u2019s minutes had been taken, and the plaintiff was too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>late. Besides, the request of plaintiff was to go to the jury on the entire case, and this is not a matter of right, even had it been made in time. Bowers v. O. A. &amp; G. Corp., 110 App. Div. 691, 97 N. Y. Supp. 485. The subsequent declaration of the justice that the plaintiff was too late, and the court\u2019s repetition of the direction, does not alter the case. The judgment was justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">GILDERSEEEVE, J., concurs.
