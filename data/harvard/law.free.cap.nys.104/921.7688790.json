This lease was to commence on October 1, 1905, and was for. two years, the tenant to have the privilege of renewing the lease for three years, and for this the tenant was to pay $50 a month. The complaint alleges that the defendant, in the month of March, 1907, threatened and told the plaintiff that he was about to sublet said parlor to negroes, 10 Chinamen, to the most undesirable person or persons he could find, and put them in possession and occupancy thereof at the lowest rent. The defendant does not seem to have answered any of these affidavits, but it is quite clear that there was no justification for an injunction. It is well settled that in the absence of an express restriction, either by contract or by statute, the tenant has a right to assign his lease or sublet the premises. Eten v. Luyster, 60 N. Y. 252; 18 American &amp; English Enc. of Law (2d Ed.) 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">To entitle the plaintiff to an injunction, it must appear from the complaint that the plaintiff demands and is entitled to judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>the defendant restraining the commission or continuance of an act, the commission or continuance of which during the pendency of the action will produce injury to the plaintiff. Section 603 of the Code of Civil Procedure. As it does not appear from this complaint that the plaintiff would be entitled to a judgment restraining the defendant from subletting the premises, a temporary injunction cannot be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">It follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
