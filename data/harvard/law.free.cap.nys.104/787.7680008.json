In this way the blood becoming \u2018built up\u2019 and being supplied with its lacking constitutents, becomes rich and red, nourishes the various organs, stimulating them to activity in the performance of their functions, and thus eliminates disease from the system.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-8\">\u201cImprovement follows a few days use of these pills; while permanent benefit and cure can only reasonably be expected, when sufficient have been taken thoroughly enrich the blood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-9\">\u201cGENERAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014Before beginning to take these pills, cause the bowels to be freely opened by laxative medicine. It is best to begin with one Dr. Williams\u2019 Pill after each meal, commencing the use of the medicine after a mid-day meal. Being stimulating, it is not best to take them on an empty stomach. After taking a few days the number may be increased to two pills at a dose, while in extreme cases three may safely be taken at one time. Take a sufficient quantity of good, wholesome, nutritious food; avoiding, on the one hand, undue greasiness and indigestibility, and, on the other a watery or sloppy diet. Avoid soups, broths, porriges, pickles, new or warm bread, unripe fruits, and an excess of tea or coffee. Go out of doors as much as possible. Bathe the body frequently, and rub the skin well with a rough towel. Keep the bowels regular. A nutritious diet may be chosen from among the following: \u2014Fresh meats (except pork) fresh fish, fowls, eggs, vegetables (well cooked.) bread and butter, milk, rice, com-flour, and sago puddings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-10\">\u201cSPECIAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014The general directions suffice for the great majority of cases, but for others, especially in women, other directions are necessary, read them:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-11\">\u201cSUPPRESSION OF THE MENSES from cold or other causes, as fright, &amp;c., demand the taking of the pills in the larger dose, and the nightly use of the hip bath with mustard; also the taking of a large cupful of some hot, stimulating beverage, such as ginger tea, pennyroyal, or any such herb tea, each night at bed-time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-12\">\u201cPREGNANT WOMEN must be careful not to take these pills until they have passed the fourth month. After that time they will obtain much benefit from their use in the smaller dose. By invigorating the system of the expectant mother, the healthy development of the offspring is ensured, and the woman herself placed in the best possible condition to pass safely through her hour of trial without undue sufferings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-13\">\u201cLEUCHORROEA or WHITES.\u2014This general complaint is very weakening, and consists of a milky, glairy, or purulent discharge, usually worse just before or after the monthly periods. Directions:\u2014Take the pills according to general directions. Dissolve four teaspoonfuls of powdered borax in a half gallon of hot water. Then introduce the nozzle of a syringe as far as possible without causing pain, slowly injecting the whole of the water, as hot as can be borne. Do this twice a day. Pain in the backs, inflammation of the womb, and unusual irritations may be treated in the same way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-14\">\u201cDELATED DEVELOPMENT OF GIRLS when arriving at the proper age may be remedied by the simple administration of the pills, with an occasional hip bath of hot water and mustard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-15\">\u201cTARDT PERIODS may be treated in the same way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-16\">\u201cCHLOROSIS or green sickness is characterized by a sallow, greenish tint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of the skin, and depends upon a deficiency of the red portions of th\u00e9 blood. Directions\u2014take the pills in large doses, according to directions above, and bathe the stomach and abdomen each morning with salt and water\u2014a tablespoonful to the quart\u2014followed by energetic friction with a coarse towel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b810-5\">\u201cANJEMIA\u2014literally bloodlessness\u2014is caused by an actual deficiency of the blood and a watery and depraved state of that fluid. It is but an aggravation of chlorosis. It is characterized by a pale complexion, pale lips, dull eyes, tongue and gums bloodless; shortness of breath on slight exertion\u2014especially upon going up stairs; palpitation of the heart, feeling of impending death; weakness, loss of appetite and ambition, irregular and pale monthly periods. If left to itself is apt to result in decline and death, or persistent pernicious anaemia\u2014one of the most hopeless of diseases. Directions Dr. Williams\u2019 Pills taken in increasing doses will never fail to effect a cure if used persistently for a reasonable length of time. Good food, fresh air, and sunlight, agreeable society, warm clothing, and moderate exercise will materially aid the cure. If the digestion is very weak it would be well to drink half a pint of some claret wine at the principal meal each day. This, by stimulating the system and assisting in the rapid formation of blood gives the pills more to work upon and hastens the cure. Claret is not an intoxicant if used in any reasonable quantity, but it is of great use in helping to make blood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b810-6\">\u201cLOCOMOTOR ATAXY.\u2014Take the pills in gradually increasing doses, until the larger dose is reached. This disease prior to the discovery of Dr. Williams\u2019 Pink Pills was held by the highest medical authority to be incurable but the fact has been demonstrated that these pills will cure this disease if the treatment is persisted in. While taking the pills bathe the body daily with cold water and follow by brisk rubbing with a coarse towel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b810-7\">\u201cFOR MEN.\u2014For men these pills stand unrivalled. They build up the system shattered by excesses or disease, and cure the various ills caused thereby, viz: spermatorrhoea, impotence, nervous despondency, loss of memory, confusion of ideas, irritability of temper, pain in the back and perinseum, and draining of the prostatic fluid. Directions:\u2014Stop any practice that may have caused the trouble. This is imperative, else the cure cannot be looked for. Take the pills regularly for two or three months first one after each meal, gradually increasing the dose to three pills thrice daily. Bathe the body each morning in cold water using vigorous friction of the skin with a turkish towel. Each night bathe the private parts and buttocks in ice-cold water. Eat good wholesome food avoiding an excess of meat. Avoid stimulants entirely including tea and coffee. Go to bed early and rise early. Sleep on a hard bed with a light cover. Take a large amount of out door exercise. Live a pure and manly life. Engage heartily in some health occupation. Follow the foregoing directions and a cure will be sure to follow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b810-9\">\u201cCONSUMPTION OF THE LUNGS can be cured but it is much better to prevent it by keeping the blood and the system up, thus resisting the onset of this and other wasting diseases.

Dr. Williams\u2019 Pink Pills for pale people are not a patent medicine, but are a thoroughly scientific preparation, the result of years of careful study. The merit of Dr. Williams\u2019 Pink Pills is attested by the hundred of marvelous cures they have wrought. These pills are not a purgative medicine. They have an especial action (through the blood) upon the sexual organs of both men and women. It is a well recognized fact that upon the healthy activity of the sexual apparatus depends the mental and physical well being of every person come to adult years. It is that which gives the rosy blush to the cheek, and the soft light to the eye of the maiden. The elastic step, the ringing laugh and the strong right arm of youth own this same mainspring. How soon do irregularities rob the face of color, the eye of brightness? the blood becomes impoverished, the victim pale. This palor of the skin is often the only outward mark of the trouble within. Then Dr. Williams\u2019 Pink Pills for pale people step into the breach and hold the fort. The impoverished blood is enriched. Vigor returns! Youth is recalled! Decay routed! The bloom of youth again mantels the faded cheek!</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b811-4\">\u201cDR. WILLIAMS\u2019 PINK PILLS FOR FEMALE TROUBLES.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b811-5\">\u201cPure blood is the secret of health and beauty. The features may be regu- \u2022 lar, the form perfect, but no woman can be beautiful in the sense of the word while suffering from any of the peculiar ailments of her sex. Disease destroys the complexion, is productive of wrinkles and premature old age. The regular monthly uterine action is necessary to every woman\u2019s health and if this function of life is checked disease a pale and sallow complexion and a feeling of exhaustion are the result. The monthly secretion must continue from puberty to the turn of life without unnatural obstruction. Any breach of this law of nature will result in the distressing symptoms which make the lives of seven-tenths of the women of this country miserable. Almost invariably a few of these symptoms are severe headaches, loss of appetite, pale or sallow complexion, palpitation of the heart, swolen ankles or legs, nervousness, offensive breath, &amp;c. &amp;c. The sufferer may exhibit one or more of these symptoms or may have all. They simply indicate the ravages disease has made upon the system, and the more of these symptoms the patient shows the greater the necessity for prompt and persistent treatment until they have been banished, and the bloom of health is restored. To accomplish this end Dr. Williams\u2019 Pink Pills for Pale people are the only unfailing remedy. They positively cure all suppressions and irregularities which if neglected inevitably entail sickness and trouble. By taking these pills for a week or ten days before the expected return of each period regularity is assured. For suppression the pills must be taken steadily until the reappearance takes place\u2014generally in a months time, some times less. Follow the directions about each box. Nursing women will find their milk improved in quality and quantity by taking these pills; and also obtain relief from pain in the back and general dragged out feeling. All displacements from weakness of the uterine ligaments are speedily relieved and ultimately cured by the faithful use of these pills. Leucorrhoea bearing down weight in the pelvis and all female weakness finds speedily relief and cure in the administrations of Dr. Williams\u2019 Pink Pills for Pale People.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b811-6\">\u201cNOTE.\u2014Pregnant women are cautioned not to take these pills until after the fourth month.

Instead of bright looks, glowing rosy cheeks, and' an elastic step there are dull eyes, pale, sallow or greenish complexion, and a languidness of step that bespeaks disease and an early death if proper treatment is not promptly resorted to and persisted in until the impoverished blood is enriched and the functions of life become regular. Upon parents rests a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>great responsibility at the time their daughters are budding into woman-hood. If your daughter is pale, complains of weakness, is \u2018played out\u2019 upon the slightest exertion; if she is troubled with headache or backache, pain in the side; if her temper is fitful and her appetite poor, she is in a condition of extreme peril, a fit subject for the development of that most dreaded of all diseases\u2014consumption.

The 11th paragraph begins: \u201cThe above-named defendants, further answering said complaint, and for a second further answer and defense, alleges\u201d; and the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth paragraphs are evidently intended as one answer and defense. This answer alleges facts which, if stated as a partial defense, would be held relevant and proper for that purpose. But, not being stated as a partial defense, it must be deemed as intended for a complete defense, and is therefore clearly demurrable for insufficiency. A separate answer, which is subject to demurrer, cannot be stricken out in its entirety as irrelevant or redundant under section 545 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Goodman v.

There certain answers were demurred to for insufficiency, and the demurrers were overruled, for the reason that the answers did not allege new matter, but merely recited allegations pertinent to the issue, but which might be shown under the general denial, and were therefore redundant, and the court thought there should be a remedy by striking out the redundant matter.

If properly alleged as a partial defense, it was clearly relevant in mitigation of damages. The pleader may have intended it as a justification. It is unnecessary upon this motion to determine whether the facts alleged are sufficient to constitute a justification or not. That matter should be determined upon demurrer, or in a proper way upon the trial. If demurrer is resorted to, and the defendant fails to sustain the answer, he may be allowed to amend, and allege the matter as a partial defense, or to amplify it, so as to make it a justification. Much of the matter stricken out would be proper in a plea of justification, and the answer may be said to foreshadow an attempt to make that plea, as well as a plea of matter in mitigation. If the question is raised upon the trial, the court may allow the defendants to amplify and correct the allegations, so as to allege in form what they have attempted to allege in substance. The matter alleged relates to the charge made, against the defendants, and is material to be shown to protect their rights. Whether it is alleged in form and substance sufficient to form a defense cannot be determined by motion, but may properly be considered upon a demurrer. A motion to strike out an answer as irrelevant is not concurrent with the right to demur for insufficiency, or the right to question the sufficiency of the pleading at the trial. Walter v. Fowler, 85 N. Y. 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The argument of counsel has been directed to sustaining or overthrowing the order as an entirety. The court does not, therefore, feel called upon to determine whether certain parts of the matter stricken out might properly be stricken out as irrelevant to the issue attempted to be raised by the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The order appealed from is therefore reversed, with costs, and the motion is denied, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
