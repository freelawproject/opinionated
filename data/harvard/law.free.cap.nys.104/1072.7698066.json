His usual place of employment was on the second floor of one of the buildings, and one of his duties was to walk through the mixer room on the first floor, a distance of about 80 feet, twice or three times during the night, to a place where he had to give some signal by blowing a whistle. In going to this place, it was necessary for him to pass close to a vat in which revolving rollers were operated. They were used for mixing sugar by crushing the large lumps and pieces. The top of this vat was level with the surface of the floor, and, except when in operation, it was covered by a grating. The room in which the accident happened was lighted by electricity. Shortly after midnight deceased started for the signal post. As he entered the mixer room, the electric lights flickered and went out, leaving this room in darkness. Plaintiff\u2019s intestate was familiar with this place, and the manner of the operation of the machinery, and he must have known that, in the event of his making a slight miscalculation in the direction he was attempting to go, there was nothing to prevent his walking into these rollers. There was evidence tending to show that he was expressly warned of the danger at the time: but this was unnecessary. He knew it, and yet with no urgent necessity for his attempting to cross this dangerous place in the darkness he saw fit to do so. In doing this he assumed the risk incident to the dangerous situation in which he placed himself, and the plaintiff cannot recover. McLaughlin v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 111 App. Div. 254, 97 N. Y.

Supp. 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-11\">The judgment and order must be reversed and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
