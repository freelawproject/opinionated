The machine was returned, and all royalties paid up to that time. But the evidence was that the defendants substituted another machine instead, and the action is to recover the royalties accruing after the machine was returned.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1077-10\">Argued before JENKS, HOOKER, MILLER, RICH, and GAY-NOR, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1077-11\">Henry B.

They were sent to them by the other party, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor, and retained by them, and the learned trial judge allowed evidence for the plaintiff to the effect that they orally assented to their provisions. This was error, for the contract they contained was one which by its terms was to continue until the termination of the patents, and at the time of the making thereof there were seventeen of the patents which still had from one to thirteen years to run, the life of a patent being seventeen years. The statute of frauds makes void every agreement not in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith\u2014i. e., sought to be charged therewith\u2014 and which \u201cby its terms is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof.\u201d This statute created a rule of evidence. It renders oral evidence incompetent to prove in whole or in part a contract which must be proved by a writing, and the objection to such evidence for incompetency was good. The motion to direct a verdict for the defendant should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-14\">The judgment and order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-15\">Judgment and order rever ved, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
