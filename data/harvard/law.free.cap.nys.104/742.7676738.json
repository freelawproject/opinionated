J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atsp\">The trial justice gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff, without weighing the defendant\u2019s testimony, and upon the theory that the defendant could not avail himself of a defense in the Municipal Court that a transfer of goods, evidenced by a bill of sale, from the husband of the plaintiff to her, was made without consideration and in fraud of the husband\u2019s creditors'. In his opinion he states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-18\">\u201cWhile the circumstances of such transfer are by no means free from suspicion, if I were to render a verdict for the defendant, the defendant\u2019s principals would accomplish as much as, and more than, they could gain in a judgment creditor\u2019s action, and thus a court of inferior common-law jurisdiction would be exercising a power which courts of equity of unlimited jurisdiction should only assume.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-19\">In this position the learned trial justice was in error. So long as the defendant asked for no affirmative relief, no equitable powers of the court were invoked. As a defense, it has frequently been held that a court of common-law powers may try the question of fraud, when the title to personal property is attacked upon that ground, and that a district court has jurisdiction in such a case.
