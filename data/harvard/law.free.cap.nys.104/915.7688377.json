It is conceded that within the period allowed for the trial the mare was accidently killed. The action was tried upon written pleadings, and the complaint sufficiently alleges causes of action in replevin and convertion, and judgment was rendered by the terms of which execution against the person might issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">It was conceded that plaintiff delivered the mare to the defendant, so that no unlawful taking was established; and the undisputed evidence is that defendant was neither in possession of the property at the time of the demand, nor that he had voluntarily fraudulently or intentionally parted with the same, and consequently could not be chargeable with unlawful detention. Sinnot v. Feiock, 165 N. Y. 444, 59 N. E. 265, 80 Am. St. Rep. 736. The accidental destruction of the property while lawfully in the possession of a defendant is not a conversion. While it may constitute negligence, \u201cthe failure to deliver that which is not in being and cannot be delivered furnishes no evidence of an appropriation.\u201d Salt Springs Nat. Bank v. Wheeler, 48 N. Y. 492, 8 Am. Rep. 564. Irrespective of the character of the judgment rendered, the record conclusively shows that the question of negligence was not litigated, the learned trial justice having stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">\u201cAll the plaintiff has to make is a demand, which is conceded, and he makes out a cause of action in conversion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
