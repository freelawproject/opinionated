J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU0\">This action was brought to recover the sum of $40, being a balance due on the purchase price of a scale manufactured by the plaintiff and sold to the defendant by a written contract. The cause of action was admitted by the defendant, and his defense, stated briefly, was that the scale was warranted by the plaintiff to be accurate and correct, that the same would not weigh accurately and correctly, and that it was a false and dishonest scale, and calculated to deceive and defraud the public by giving false weight. The contract of 'sale contained a printed warranty, which related only to the condition of the scale at the time of its delivery, and provided that, should it get out of order at any time within two years from the date of shipment with ordinary use, the plaintiff would repair the same free of charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The defendant\u2019s only testimony given as to the inaccuracy of the scale was directed to its condition some two months after its delivery to and use by him for that length of time, at which time he discovered that \u201cit did not weigh right.\u201d The defendant\u2019s knowledge as to the incorrect action of the scale, as appears by his testimony, was obtained by seeing an inspector put a \u201cpound weight\u201d in the scale, when it then registered an ounce or two over the pound. Whether or not this so-called \u201cpound weight\u201d was correct is not shown. There is some testimony in the case that the defendant was \u201cfined\u201d for using this scale, but there is no competent evidence of that fact; the defendant\u2019s attorney admitting that there were no records in such a proceeding, except a summons served upon the defendant through the corporation counsel of the city for violation of an ordinance prohibiting the use of a fraudulent scale. An attempt was made by the defendant to prove that the scale was, when manufactured, intended to be so constructed as to ryeigh incorrectly and to defraud the public when used. The only testimony upon that point was given by a witness, a former employ\u00e9 of the plaintiff, and now in the service of a competitor in business, who in answer to the question, \u201cWas that an honest scale?\u201d answered, \u201cNo, sir: it was manufactured dishonestly.\u201d This testimony was objected to, and a motion made to strike it out, which was denied. This testimony was clearly incompetent, and is alone sufficient to warrant \u00e1 reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">A clause in the defendant\u2019s answer sets forth \u201cthat an action was commenced against him in the Municipal Court of this city to recover the sum of $35 as a penalty for using said scale, and he was compelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>to pay the sum of $10 in order to save himself from having a judgment entered against him.\u201d At the close of the prayer in the answer asking for a dismissal of the complaint, the words \u201cand for a counterclaim for $25\u201d appear. There was not a particle of testimony given as to this alleged counterclaim, and at the close of the case the following appears in the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I just wish to call your honor\u2019s attention to the fact that the inspectors who have examined these, and who are really the only experts, are not present and have not been called.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: The inspectors of weights and measures have been served. They are acting as witnesses in another court, and I have been expecting that they would be here. We have put in a counterclaim for $25\u2014$10 for the fine in Brooklyn, and $15\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201cThe Court: Judgment for the defendant for $15. The fine I could not allow against the plaintiff. (Exception by plaintiff\u2019s counsel.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Judgment was therefore given in favor of the defendant for dismissal of the complaint, and for $15 on defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and for costs. Further comment on the validity of the judgment is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">There is attached to the record a copy of an opinion delivered in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio in an action between the Toledo Computing Scale Company and this plaintiff. This opinion is not marked as evidence, if it could in any way be made such, is not referred to in the minutes, has no place in the record, has not been considered by this court, and should not have been used by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
