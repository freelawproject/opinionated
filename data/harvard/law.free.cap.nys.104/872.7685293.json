At the time of his arrest, the defendant, in company with 40 or 50 other boys of similar ages, undertook to board a train in the subway at Bleeclcer street, without buying a ticket and depositing the same in the box, by rushing by the guard. Eive or six of them, including the defendant, were arrested and immediately taken before the Court of Special Sessions (Children\u2019s Part), and a trial had, which resulted in the conviction of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-21\">The act of the defendant constituted disorderly conduct under the section of the Code referred to, and the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction. The appellant contends that the evidence is not sufficient to connect him with the other boys; but the testimony of the people\u2019s witness Lenhoff, when read in connection with defendant\u2019s own testimony, is amply sufficient. Lenhoff testified that at the time in question he saw the defendant \u201cpushing by the box,\u201d and when he got by he \u201cgrabbed him.\u201d Defendant himself testified that the person who arrested him was Lenhoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Appellant also contends that the court did not acquire jurisdiction because a warrant was not issued. A warrant is for the purpose of apprehending and bringing before the court the person charged 'with the commission of a crime, and when such person is seized by an officer while in the act of committing the crime, and immediately taken before the court, there is no necessity for a warrant. The person is before the court, and that is all that is necessary to give it jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">It is also claimed that the judgment is erroneous because the court did not inform the defendant of his right to counsel. It is true this does not specifically appear; but it does appear that the defendant had counsel, who made a motion at the close of the people\u2019s case that he be acquitted. His rights were fully protected, and there are no errors which call for a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">It follows that the judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
