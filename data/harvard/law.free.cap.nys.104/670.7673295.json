The petition to investigate his sanity was presented to the county judge of Tioga county on the 3d day of April, 1907, and had attached to it the affidavits of two physicians to the effect that he was irresponsible and unable to determine between right and wrong. The county judge thereupon made two personal examinations'of the prisoner, and also procured the affidavit of the jail physician, who had seen the prisoner frequently since his confinement, to the effect that he had never observed any acts or declarations on the part of the prisoner which impressed him as being irrational, even in the slightest degree. The county judge, on the 8th day of April, 1907, denied the application, and from the order denying it the petitioner has appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Argued before SMITH, P.

The petitioner is in no sense a party aggrieved by the order appealed from, nor does it affect any substantial right of his. Neither his liberty nor any property right of his is affected by such order, and no statute appears giving a petitioner under such circumstances a right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Second. The term of imprisonment of the prisoner has now expired, and he has been discharged therefrom. Only abstract questions are therefore presented for determination, if we are to consider the matter on the merits. This we should not be called upon to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">For these reasons, the appeal must be dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
