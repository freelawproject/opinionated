It is true that several of the questions propounded by the counsel for the plaintiff were objectionable in form; but this cannot be asserted of all of them, and it is clear from the record that they were objected to and excluded upon the ground that, the lease being in writing, parol evidence to prove the agreement alleged was incompetent. We think these rulings were erroneous, and that the plaintiff was entitled to prove the collateral agreement, made prior to the signing of the lease and in consideration of the lease itself. Chapin v. Dobson, 78 N. Y. 74, 34 Am. Rep. 512; Reynolds v. Robinson, 110 N. Y. 654, 18 N. E. 127; Corn v. Rosenthal, 1 Misc. Rep. 168, 20 N. Y. Supp. 632, affirmed 3 Misc. Rep. 72, <em>22 </em>N. Y. Supp. 700. See, also, 3 Misc. Rep. 639, 23 N. Y. Supp. 1160. We regard the case at bar as similar in principle to the case of Corn v. Rosenthal, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
