On June 25th, 1890, she executed a real estate bond and mortgage to the plaintiff, her son, for $300, payable three years after her death. She did not deliver them to him, but kept them in her closet in a locked box. Four or five days before she died she gave the key to the box to another son and told him to get them out of the closet and deliver them to the plaintiff, but he did not do so until after she died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-16\">Three days after the making of the said bond and mortgage, viz., on June 28th, 1890, the deceased executed and delivered a deed of conveyance of the land covered by the mortgage to her daughter, Sarah J. Booker, who died intestate the same day her mother died, leaving the defendants Lucy Preston, her daughter and only heir, and James Preston, her husband. It contained the following clause after the words of conveyance, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-17\">\u201cSubject nevertheless, to the following condition and restriction to which this conveyance is made and accepted by the party of the second part\u2014that is to say, that neither the party of the second part, nor her heirs or representatives are to alien, sell or convey or mortgage the said premises, or any part thereof, during the period of twenty-one years from and after the date of this conveyance.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-18\">The said deed was recorded after the mother\u2019s death, viz., on November 24th, 1897, and the said mortgage two weeks later.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b41-19\">Argued before WOODWARD, JENKS, GAYNOR, and RICH, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-20\">Lewis C. Platt, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-21\">Arthur M.

The learned trial judge held that the mortgage was delivered in the lifetime of the mother, the mortgagor. The delivery of the key of the box in which she kept it to the third person with instructions to get it and deliver it was a delivery. It was a delivery to him to deliver to the mortgagee, the plaintiff, and that was a good delivery to the plaintiff. Hathaway v. Payne, 34 N. Y. 92. But the trouble is that at the time of such delivery the mortgagor did not own the land, and therefore nothing passed under the mortgage. She had conveyed to her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The decision of the learned judge that the deed to the daughter was void for a suspension of th| absolute power of alienation for 21 years, was erroneous. The suspension was void, but not the conveyance. The grantee took the fee free of the illegal condition. A void or unlawful condition to a conveyance in fee, like a repugnant one, does not affect the conveyance. And a forfeiture cannot be predicated upon such a condition.

Y. 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Judgment, reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
