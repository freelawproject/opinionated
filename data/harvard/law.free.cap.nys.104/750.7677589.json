One Jacob Zlotnick drew a check on said bank for $9, making it payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>to J. Salzman, whom he permitted to write the check for him; Zlotnick being unable to write. Zlotnick was also a depositor in defendant bank. Salzman raised the check to $90, and then asked plaintiff to introduce him to the bank, so that he could draw the money. Plaintiff took the check, and asked William Walton, defendant\u2019s paying teller, if the check was good, to which he replied, \u201cPerfectly, I believe.\u201d Walton then told plaintiff to indorse it, which he did, and the money was paid. Upon finding that the check had been raised, the bank deducted the $90 from plaintiff\u2019s account, for which sum plaintiff now brings this action. Notwithstanding the fact that the action of Walton may have been equivalent to a certification of the check, and that plaintiff was merely an accommodation indorser, he was still \u201cliable on the instrument to a holder for value, notwithstanding such holder, at the time of taking the instrument, knew him to be only an accommodation party.\u201d Neg. Inst. Law, Laws 1897, p. 728, c. 612, \u00a7 55. As to certification, see Marine Nat. Bank v. Nat. City Bank, 59 N. Y. 67, 17 Am. Rep. 305; White v. Continental Nat. Bank, 64 N. Y. 316, 21 Am. Rep. 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">There still remains to be considered the amount for which this plaintiff is liable to defendant\u2014whether for the full amount of the check, or for that amount less the sum for which the check was originally drawn. That the latter constitutes the correct measure is shown by an authority cited by respondent in its brief. \u201cWhere a genuine draft has been altered, not only in the name, but in the amount to be payable, the difference between the original amount and the altered amount might be recovered back of the person from whom the drawee has received the draft and to whom he paid the money.\u201d Nat. Park Bank of N. Y. v. Ninth Nat. Bank, 55 Barb. 87. \u201cThat is, to quote from respondent\u2019s brief, in this case the difference between $90 and $9 might be recovered back from the person from whom the bank received the note, to wit, the plaintiff, and to whom it paid the money, to wit, the plaintiff.\u201d Defendant has already \u201crecovered\u201d the $81, and the original face value of the check as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The judgment herein will therefore be modified by giving judgment absolute for the plaintiff for the sum of $9, and, as thus modified, affirmed, with costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
