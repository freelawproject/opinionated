The plaintiff had purchased from the defendant in the borough of Brooklyn, to be used at his place of residence in that borough, certain furniture, to be paid for at stated intervals in small installments, and had given to the defendant a chattel mortgage on the property purchased, in order to secure the payments. Before the purchase money was all paid, the defendant shipped the property to North Carolina, and, on learning that fact, the credit clerk of the defendant instituted proceedings in the Court of Special Sessions in the defendant\u2019s behalf, by virtue of which the plaintiff was arrested, tried, and convicted of the misdemeanor' of unlawfully secreting or disposing of mortgaged property, in violation of section 571 of the Penal Code. On appeal the judgment of conviction was reversed by this court (People v. Staton, 79 App. Div. 634, 80 N. Y. Supp. 2); the chief ground of reversal being the absence of proof of a criminal intent on the part of the, accused. After the reversal the proceedings in the Court of Special Sessions were dismissed, and the plaintiff discharged. This action was thereupon brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">The plaintiff recovered a judgment on the first trial of this action, which was reversed by this court (Staton v. Mason, 106 App. Div. 26, 94 N. Y. Supp. 417), on the ground that there was no evidence tending to show that the credit clerk who instituted the criminal proceeding had either express or implied authority from the defendant to do so. The precise nature of his duties as credit clerk was mot disclosed, and there was, accordingly, nothing to indicate that his act was within the scope of his employment. On this, the second, trial it distinctly appears that the prosecution and arrest were directed by the defendant\u2019s manager, who was at the time in charge of the defendant\u2019s business. The evidence tends to establish that the defendant was seldom personal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ly at his place of business, but that such business was conducted and managed entirely by the manager, who acted and was regarded by the employ\u00e9s as the head of the concern. The jury could infer from all the evidence that it was within the scope of the manager\u2019s employment to take steps, either civilly or criminally, in the protection of the defendant\u2019s property and in the preservation of his rights and interests. The authority conferred upon the credit clerk by the manager was not disputed, and the criminal proceedings were conducted by the defendant\u2019s general counsel. There was sufficient in the case to support a finding that the act of the credit clerk was binding upon the defendant. The case is different from that presented in Mali v. Lord, 39 N. Y. 381, 100 Am. Dec. 448. In that case the defendant\u2019s superintendent, on mere suspicion, caused the plaintiff to be detained and searched. This could not have been done lawfully by the defendant in person, and it will never be assumed that authority has been conferred upon a subordinate to do that which the master himself could not lawfully do. .But in this case the defendant with probable cause would be justified in instituting legal proceedings, even of a criminal nature, and that which he could do might lawfully be delegated to an employ\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">Nevertheless the nonsuit was properly granted. The hearing and trial which resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s conviction appears to have been fairly conducted, and there is no claim or pretense that the result was procured by fraud, conspiracy, subornation, or other undue means. It seems to be well settled in this state that a judgment of conviction so obtained, although subsequently reversed, is prima facie evidence of probable cause in an action for malicious prosecution. Miller v. Deere, <em>2 </em>Abb. Prac. 1; Palmer v. Avery, 41 Barb. 290; Nicholson v. Sternberg, 61 App. Div. 51, 70 N. Y. Supp. 212; Burt v. Smith, 181 N. Y. 1, 73 N. E. 495. There is not a suggestion of malice in the case, and the evidence being sufficient to establish implied authority from the defendant to institute the criminal proceedings, and the prima facie proof of the existence of probable cause as established by the conviction not having been overcome by any evidence offered by the plaintiff, it necessarily follows that the cause of action asserted by the plaintiff was not proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
