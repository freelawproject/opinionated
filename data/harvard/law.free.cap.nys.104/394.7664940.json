The trial justice overruled the demurrer giving the defendant the usual leave to plead over.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Section 2 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1490, c. 580) provides that \u201csaid court shall not have any equity jurisdiction.\u201d The parties were engaged in a joint venture, and were to participate in the division of the profits, and were to share the expenses of their joint enterprise. This agreement constituted the parties to it partners, and their rights and liabilities are to be determined upon the same principles as are applied by courts of equity to partnership transactions. Wilcox v. Pratt, 125 N. Y. 688, 25 N. E. 1091; Mitchell v. Tonkin, 109 App. Div. 165, 95 N. Y. Supp. 669; Jones v. Walker, 51 Misc. Rep. 624, 101 N. Y. Supp. 22. A common-law action between partners \u201cwill not lie. until after a full accounting, balance struck, and express promise to pay.\u201d Mitchell v. Tonkin, supra; Belanger v. Dana, 52 Hun, 39, 43, 4 N. Y. Supp. 776. No such situation as this existed between the parties to the contract alleged in the complaint. In order to determine the amount due from one of the parties to the other, it is necessary, not only to determine the amount of money received, but the expenses incurred, and to apportion the amount due to each after such an accounting is had.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The cases of Ferguson v. Baker, 116 N. Y. 257, 22 N. E. 400, Lord v. Hull, 178 N. Y. 9, 70 N. E. 69, 102 Am. St. Rep. 484, and Head v. King, 33 Misc. Rep. 89, 67 N. Y. Supp. 141, upon which the learned trial justice relied, are not contrary to the views here expressed. In Ferguson v. Baker, supra, the partnership between the parties had been dissolved, and the plaintiff sued to recover one-half of the sum of money collected by the defendant upon bills due to the firm and unpaid at the time of its dissolution, and all the partnership affairs had been, adjusted. The action in that case was distinct from the partnership accounts and did not involve their consideration. Lord v. Hull, supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>was a case where a court of equity, in an action for an accounting between partners, refused to interfere in matters of internal regulation of the business, where a dissolution of the partnership was not sought. In Head v. King, supra, the debt for which one partner sued another had been liquidated, and the action required no determination as to the him assets or liabilities. No support for the judgment appealed from can be derived from these authorities. The cause of action set forth in the complaint calls for the exercise of equitable powers, which the Municipal Court has no authority to exert.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellant, and demurrer sustained, with costs in the court below, and complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
