The plaintiff\u2019s physician, who alone was interrogated on the point, declined to express an opinion, urging that an answer \u201cwould be speculative, because it all depends upon the kind of treatment he received.\u201d There was no other evidence on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-15\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
