The defendant appeals from an order granting to plaintiff a discovery and inspection of books, papers, accounts, and other documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The defendant has already, by stipulation, given to plaintiff the opportunity to examine and copy a considerable portion of the books, contracts, and documents covered by this order, and, as was stated upon the argument, the inspection is now proceeding under that stipulation. The defendant was incorporated in 1899, and the plaintiff seeks to examine as to contracts made by it from the date of its incorporation. The defendant, for some reason not apparent to us and not clearly disclosed upon the argum\u00e9nt, insists that such examination shall be limited to a period covered by the present administration of defendant, stated to be since March 8, 1904. It may be that none of the contracts entered into prior to that date are now in force; but as to that fact the plaintiff is entitled to resort to the evidence, and should not be compelled to rely upon the defendant\u2019s general assertion. Furthermore, whether in force now or not, contracts made prior to March 8, 1904, may have a very important bearing upon the intent and purpose of contracts entered into after that date. However often the administration may change, the corporation remains the same, and the present inquiry is directed to the acts of the corporation, and not to those of any particular set of officers. So far, then, as the examination is permitted to go, it should cover the whole period since the organization of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The order, however, as made, is too broad. The plaintiff should not be given a roving commission to examine every scrap of paper in \u25a0defendant\u2019s possession, in the hope that something may be found to sustain the allegations of the complaint. All contracts, whether entered into before or after May 8, 1904, should be open to examination, as well as all correspondence had with the persons or corporations with whom such contracts were made, or their agents, including letterpress copies of letters sent by defendant; for it is easily conceivable that such \u25a0correspondence may throw light upon the meaning, intent, purpose, and effect of the contracts themselves. We can see no propriety or materiality in permitting at the present time an examination of the books of account, vouchers, etc., tending to show the profits made h&gt;y defendant or the unreasonableness of the prices charged by it. The test of the legality of the contracts sought to be avoided is, not whether or not they resulted profitably or unprofitably to defendant, but merely whether or not they, were entered into with a view to Ihe creation of a monopoly. People v. Sheldon, 139 N. Y., 251, 34 N. E. 785, 23 L. R. A. 221, 36 Am. St. Rep. 690. Nor do we consider that plaintiffs have shown themselves to be entitled to examine the stock lists and stock ledgers of defendant. The avowed purpose of this examination is to show that defendant acquired stock in other cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>porations; but it is manifest that tins fact will not be shown by examining _ the stockbooks, showing who have owned stock, from time to time, in the defendant corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">These views suggest the modification of paragraphs 5 and 6 of the order appealed from, so as to limit the letters and copies of l\u00e9tters to-be examined to those passing between the defendants, its officers and agents, and persons or corporations with whom it has made contracts-challenged by this action, or their officer or agents, and the elimination of paragraphs <em>7 </em>to 18, inclusive, and 20 to 22, inclusive; and, as so-modified, the order will be affirmed, without costs to either party in. this court. It may be that, upon the examination to be authorized by the modified order, facts will be disclosed to justify the examination-of some of the books, papers, and documents, the justification or necessity for examining which is not now apparent. If such should prove to be the case, the plaintiff may apply for a further examination, and the order to be entered herein will- be without prejudice to such subsequent application. \u2022 All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
