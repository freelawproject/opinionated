The case first appeared on the calendar in the October term, 1906, when a motion was made to'place the case on the short-cause calendar. After that motion was granted, and when present counsel was retained to try the case, he, on the 29th of October, asked plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to consent to allow defendant to amend the answer, stating that in consequence of the absence in California of the president of the defendant corporation that he should ask for an adjournment of the trial until the return of the defendant\u2019s president. On October 30th the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney refused to consent either to the adjournment or the amendment, whereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel prepared an amended answer, and on December 1st made this motion to be allowed to serve it. The amendment simply enlarges the defense set up in the original answer, and puts the pleading in the shape the defendant desires in order to present the question as to his liability under this alleged contract. It is an amendment which, according to the present counsel for the defendant, is necessary to present the defenses which the defendant by the original answer intended to present, but which in the opinion of the present counsel, who is to try the case, is not sufficiently definite for the purpose. It is not alleged that the plaintiff has lost anything by the delay in making the motion, which was but a little over a month, and the service of this amended answer need not at all delay the trial. The nature of this amendment did not require an affidavit of one of the officers of the defendant. The question as to a formal allegation necessary to properly present the defense was a question to be determined' \u2022by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and about which the officers of the defendant could have no knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">I think the order appealed from should be reversed, and the motion granted, upon payment of the plaintiffs\u2019 costs to date, the case to retain its position upon the calendar, and to be tried without further delay when the same is reached, with $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
