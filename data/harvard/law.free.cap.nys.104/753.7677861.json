The substance of the judgment demanded is that a certain deed of said premises, dated July 2, 1903, made by said Louisa Malcom Stenton to the defendants Burton W. Gibson and William K. Aston, in so far as it represents an agreement for the compensation of said defendants Gibson and Aston and their interest in said premises, is inequitable and unconscionable, and should be reformed, so as to express such terms of compensation as may be found just, equitable, and proper; that the decision, interlocutory judgment, and final judgment filed and entered in an action of partition of said premises, instituted by said defendant Burton W. Gibson in the Supreme Court of the state of New York against said Louisa Malcom Stenton and others, in so far as the same may be deemed to have adjudged the interest of said defendants Gibson and Aston and said Louisa Malcom Stenton in said premises, or the compensation to which said defendants Gibson and Aston may be entitled for services rendered to said Louisa Malcom Stenton, be modified so as to express such interest and such terms of compensation as may be found just, equitable, and proper; that the amount of compensation to which the defendant Gibson was or is entitled for services rendered to said Louisa Malcom Stenton does not exceed the sum of \u00a71,000; that the defendants account to the plaintiff for all their transactions and dealings in relation to said property, and for all moneys received by them, or any of them, in excess of the sum of \u00a71,000, and that they, and each of them, be required forthwith to pay to the plaintiff all of such moneys in excess of said sum for which they may be found accountable; that the defendants Gibson, McFarland, Whitin, Macintosh, Stewart, Pearsall, and Dyer, or such of them as claim any interest in said premises, be adjudged to hold said premises in trust for the said Louisa Malcom Stenton; that they, and each of them, be required forthwith to convey and release the same and all their claim of right, title, and interest therein to her; that they, and each of them, and all persons claiming through or under them, be enjoined and restrained from otherwise transferring or incumbering the said premises; that the mortgage of said premises made by the defendant MacFarland to the defendant Whitin, and the judgment of foreclosure thereof, the deed of said premises made and delivered by the referee named in such judgment to the defendant Macintosh, the deed by the defendant Whitin to the defendant Stewart, and the mortgage by the defendant Stewart to the defendant Pearsall, are void, invalid, and of no effect as against the said Louisa Malcom Stenton; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>that the said Instruments be canceled or vacated, as the case may require, as against the said Louisa Malcom Stenton, and that the remaining defendants have no right, title, interest, claim, or lien in, to, or upon said premises; and that plaintiff have such other and further relief as to the court may seem just and proper, together with the costs of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-5\">The order appealed from, referred to in the opinion, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-6\">\u201cUpon the annexed affidavit of George I.

On the 9th day of that month, upon the affidavit of the plaintiff, Mr. Justice Greenbaum made an order requiring the defendants Burton W. Gibson, MacFarland, Whitin, Macintosh, Pearsall, and Dyer to appear before a referee for the purpose of taking their examination. This order in form used the language of section 873 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The defendants, other than Macintosh, who was not served, moved to vacate the order, and this motion was denied. The defendants other than Gibson have appealed from this order, which, having been argued before this court, has been affirmed at the present term.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon the settlement of the order of denial the defendant Gibson submitted a proposed order, in which he asked, among other things, that the order be modified by expressing in terms that the examination was under the provisions of sections 870 to 886 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This proposition was rejected; the learned justice following in his order the language of the original order. With matters in this condition Mr. Gibson procured an order to show cause, returnable at Special Term, asking for a modification of the order in the same particulars. The learned Special Term not only modified the order in the particular suggested by Mr. Gibson, but limited the scope of the examination to such an extent that the plaintiff urges, and not without reason, that it will defeat the very object for which the order was sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">The facts set forth in the moving papers are such as to warrant a very thorough examination. Mr. Gibson is a member of the bar, and insists that he is willing to afford any proper information, and, if this is the case, there need be no practical difficulty in dealing with the questions under the original order. The transaction, primarily rests upon the relations between Mr. Gibson, an attorney, and Louisa M. Stenson, now an incompetent, while the former was acting for the latter, and the affidavit on which the original order was granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>alleges that the entire transactions involving all of the defendants is involved in the fraudulent scheme. The case seems to be one where a very thorough examination is proper, for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff to bring out the true state of affairs, and we are of opinion that the learned court at Special Term erred in granting more of an amendment or modification of the order than was asked by Mr. Gibson.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to modify should be denied, with $10 costs, leaving the original order to stand as made. It follows that the order denying the motion to vacate the original order, made by the defendants other than Gibson, should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-10\"> Without written opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
