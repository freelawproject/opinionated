The testimony for the plaintiff is as follows: He stood at a street corner in the borough of Manhattan, and when the open car of the defendant reached his standpoint it was stopped for passengers both to alight and to board the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>car. Of the latter class there were four or five, of whom he was the last. As he attempted to get on, he took hold of the rail by his hand, and put one foot on the step, when the car went on with full force, dragging him for half a block. The defendant was liable if, in the absence of contributory negligence, it knew, or should have known, that the plaintiff intended to take passage, and therefore if it did not afford to him a reasonable opportunity to board the car in safety. Sexton v. Metropolitan Street R. Co., 40 App. Div. 26, 57 N.Y. Supp. 577. But the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence was not one of law, even if the plaintiff\u2019s version was credited. Hence the court erred when it instructed the jury, under exceptions, both in the main part of the charge and also thereafter when the defendant pointed out the instruction,\" that the plaintiff must have the verdict if the jury believed his version, for such instruction in effect required the jury to find the defendant negligent if the jury believed the plaintiff. In fine, the defendant\u2019s liability was to be determined alone by the plaintiff\u2019s credibility. This was reversible error under the doctrine of Kellegher v. Forty-Second St., etc., R. R. Co., 171 N. Y. 309, 63 N. E. 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">There must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
