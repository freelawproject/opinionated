The defendant resided at Sea-bright, N. J., and the plaintiffs had their place of business in New York City. The case rests in a series of letters between the plaintiffs and the defendant, xtheirs from the said city and his from Seabright. There was no oral employment. On January 3, 1906, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendant they had a customer for his lot at $37,500, and asking for an answer. The defendant sent some answer which does not appear; and on February 5th the plaintiffs wrote acknowledging receipt of it, and asking him for his lowest price, and saying they have a \u201cclient\u201d for his lot. On February 5th the defendant answered that his price was $38,500, which could stand until March 1st, and that if their client wanted it at that price they must inform the defendant previous to that date. The plaintiffs answered on February 16th that their client deemed the price too high, but that they would see their client on Monday and learn definitely; and asked if the second mortgage could be paid off. The defendant answered on February 19th that he did not know whether the second mortgage could be paid off. On February 26th the plaintiffs wrote that they were working to get their client up to $38,500, on condition that the second mortgage can be paid off, and asking the defendant to come to New York- City and meet him at their office on Wednesday next, so the principals could make mutual concessions. Defendant did not come to New York or answer the letter. On March 27th the plaintiffs wrote that their client would pay $38,500 \u201cover existing mortgages.\u201d The defendant answered accepting, providing they did .business at once, as the offer would not be open after April 1st. The plaintiffs telegraphed or wrote the defendant to come to their office on a day stated, but he did not come. The plaintiffs then sent a lawyer to the defendant at Seabright who asked why he had not come to New York as requested-.and meet the buyer. The defendant answered that his wife was in the lunatic asylum and she could not join in the deed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1078-14\">Argued before WOODWARD, JENKS, HOOKER, RICH, and GAYNOR, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>Isidor Cohn, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1079-5\">Harold H.
