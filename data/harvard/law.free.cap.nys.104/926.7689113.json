J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIrx\">When this case was called for trial on December 18, 1906, the defendant\u2019s attorney moved for an adjournment until .December 24th, and submitted two affidavits and a bond, with two sureties, under section 194 of the Municipal Court act (Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>1902, p. 1547, c. 580). The ground of the application was that the defendant, who it was claimed was a material witness, was then absent in Porto Rico. The plaintiffs opposed the motion upon the ground that the defendant had been subpoenaed as a witness, and the adjournment was thereupon refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">The affidavit of the defendant contains an affidavit of merits, and recites that at the time this action was instituted he had an important engagement in Porto Rico; that issue was joined on November 19th and was set down, for November 26th; that he was then ready for trial, but the case was adjourned until November 28th; that on that day he was ready for trial, but the case was again adjourned until December 6th; that prior to that day he had engaged passage to Porto Rico for December 1st, and that he could not postpone his business there for a longer time; that he would be able to return to this city as early as December 23d; that none of said adjournments were made necessary by any act of his; and that he is a material and necessary witness on the trial\u2014and the affidavit fully sets forth the nature of his testimony, and it clearly is material. The affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney is also to the same effect, and he also testifies that it will be impossible to safely proceed to trial without the testimony of the defendant. We think, under this proof, which was in no way contradicted by the plaintiff, the adjournment from December 18th to the 24th, a period of but six days, should have been granted. A reading of the record strongly supports this position, as it is clear that the defendant\u2019s testimony might have a material effect upon another trial. The interests of justice require a reversal of the judgment and the ordering of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
